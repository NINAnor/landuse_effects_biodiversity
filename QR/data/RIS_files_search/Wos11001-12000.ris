TI  - A difficult journey from enactment to implementation of local content policy: instigating factors and accountability mechanisms for achieving sustainable development
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ACCOUNTING RESEARCH
AB  - PurposeThe study examines the instigating factors behind the development of the local content (LC) policy in Ghana and it further investigates the accountability mechanisms that drive the LC policy implementation to promote sustainable development.Design/methodology/approachThe study reports on a series of interviews with key actors using Institutional Theory and the application of Bovens' (2010) Global Accountability Framework as a lens for discussion and interpretation of results.FindingsThe results reveal that two forces instigated LC policy enactment. One is external funding pressure from the Norwegian government and the World Bank. The other is the government's engagement of Civil Society Organisations and other internal stakeholders to justify its activities and missions to signal adherence to impartiality, neutrality, and, to a lesser extent, solidarity. The analysis also reveals tensions in how accountability legitimacy relates to implementation of the LC policy. The study further discovers that while participation, transparency, monitoring, and evaluation are frequently invoked as de jure institutional legitimacy in oil and gas contracts, actual practices follow normative (de facto) institutionalism rather than what the LC policy law provides.Research limitations/implicationsThe interview had a relatively small number of participants, which can be argued to affect the study's validity. Nevertheless, given the data saturation effect and the breadth of the data obtained from the respondents, this study represents a significant advancement in LC policy enactment knowledge, implementation mechanisms and enforcement in an emerging O & G industry.Practical implicationsThe findings of this study suggest that future policy development in emerging economies should involve detailed consultations to increase decision-maker knowledge, process transparency and expectations. This will improve implementation and reduce stakeholder tension, conflict and mistrust.Originality/valueThe findings of this study build on earlier investigations into legitimacy, accountability and impression management in and outside the O & G sector. Also, the findings reveal the legitimising tactics used by O & G actors to promote local content sustainable development targets.

TI  - Unravelling Mickey Mouse: The Effect of Supply Chain Position and Organisational Slack on the Uneven Balance of Sustainability Dimensions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This paper contributes to a less-studied area on how a firm's position in the supply chain influences triple-bottom-line considerations in strategic decision making. We also contribute to previous research on a nuanced understanding of unabsorbed organisational slack as an antecedent to the triple-bottom-line dimensions of sustainability. The research data comprises survey data and financial reporting data from 508 manufacturing and trading firms operating in Finland, divided among four supply chain tiers. The economic dimension dominates the decision making on all tiers, followed by social and environmental considerations, resembling the shape of Mickey Mouse. Unabsorbed organisational slack is negatively related to the importance of economic considerations and positively related to environmental considerations. The results help firms in evaluating their position in terms of sustainability and in their redesigning efforts accordingly. The findings will also be useful in terms of promoting sustainability practices among supply chain members and policymakers in their practical efforts towards sustainable development.

TI  - Pesticide Residues Analysis of Three Vegetable Crops for Urban Consumers in Benin - Human and Environmental Consequences of Abuse and Misuse of Synthetic Pesticides
T2  - II ALL AFRICA HORTICULTURE CONGRESS
CP  - 2nd All Africa Horticulture Congress
AB  - Urban and peri-urban (UPU) horticulture provides an increasingly important source of income in African countries. The potential of UPU gardening is severely undermined by a number of production constraints. Recent field diagnoses in Benin identified severe pest problems and revealed alarming pesticide practices in the UPU areas. Several major pest problems are direct consequences of pesticide abuse that 1) destroys the biodiversity required for natural/biological pest control, 2) causes pesticide resistance and pest resurgence and 3) poses human and environmental hazards. Increasing pesticide use among vegetable producers in UPU gardens in Benin led to the initiation of the pilot project "Pesticide residues analysis of three vegetable crops for urban consumers in Benin". A total of 92 samples of tomatoes, carrots and leaves of African eggplant ("gboma") were collected in November 2010 at different markets in Benin. The samples were comminuted in Benin and sent frozen to Norway for analysis of possible pesticide residues. Two multi-methods covering 293 pesticides including some metabolites were used for the analysis. Residues were detected in 20 samples, resulting in 41 findings of different pesticides and/or metabolites. Gboma leaves contained the highest number of residues and also the highest concentrations of pesticides. One sample had a very high content of dimethoate and omethoate (sum 8.1 mg/kg). Consumption of these leaves may represent a health risk, as both the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and acute reference dose (ARfD) were far exceeded. Few residues and low concentrations were found in the carrot and tomato samples. Internationally banned pesticides are commonly used in UPU vegetable production in Africa. The link between agriculture, environment and health is evident. Despite this, consumer consumption of pesticide residues through contaminated products receives little attention.

TI  - Latitude is significantly associated with the prevalence of multiple sclerosis: a meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY NEUROSURGERY AND PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background There is a striking latitudinal gradient in multiple sclerosis (MS) prevalence, but exceptions in Mediterranean Europe and northern Scandinavia, and some systematic reviews, have suggested that the gradient may be an artefact. The authors sought to evaluate the association between MS prevalence and latitude by meta-regression.
   Methods and findings Studies were sourced from online databases, reference mining and author referral. Prevalence estimates were age-standardised to the 2009 European population. Analyses were carried out by means of random-effects meta-regression, weighted with the inverse of within-study variance. The authors included 650 prevalence estimates from 321 peer-reviewed studies; 239 were age-standardised, and 159 provided sex-specific data. The authors found a significant positive association (change in prevalence per degree-latitude) between age-standardised prevalence (1.04, p<0.001) and latitude that diminished at high latitudes. Adjustment for prevalence year strengthened the association with latitude (2.60, p<0.001). An inverse gradient in the Italian region reversed on adjustment for MS-associated HLA-DRB1 allele distributions. Adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies did not appreciably alter the gradient in Europe. Adjustment for some potential sources of bias did not affect the observed associations.
   Conclusion This, the most comprehensive review of MS prevalence to date, has confirmed a statistically significant positive association between MS prevalence and latitude globally. Exceptions to the gradient in the Italian region and northern Scandinavia are likely a result of genetic and behavioural-cultural variations. The persistence of a positive gradient in Europe after adjustment for HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies strongly supports a role for environmental factors which vary with latitude, the most prominent candidates being ultraviolet radiation (UVR)/vitamin D.

TI  - Constructing the hospitality superstar in restaurant dining rooms
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM
AB  - The need for competent hospitality workers is significant for the sustainable development of the restaurant industry. However, with the recurring challenges of recruiting and retaining a competent workforce, there is a need to understand how employers portray and communicate hospitality work in the recruitment process. Therefore, this study examines how employers construct the image of the hospitality worker, by analyzing what job advertisements signal and communicate to the applicants. Through thematic analysis of 100 job advertisements in Sweden, we found that the ideal hospitality worker is an individualized team player with occupational passion. This means that social capacities and commitment to hospitality and gastronomy, factors that are difficult to measure, are of relevance to gaining employment. Additionally, by asking for social capacities, the distance between work and leisure is diminished and the employee is constructed as a commodity for the purpose of improving service. In contrast to the common image that hospitality work is work that anyone could do, we conclude that the qualifications for becoming a hospitality worker in the restaurant industry are fairly complex.

TI  - Airborne laser scanning reveals large tree trunks on forest floor
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Fallen trees decompose on the forest floor and create habitats for many species. Thus, mapping fallen trees allows identifying the most valuable areas regarding biodiversity, especially in boreal forests, enabling well-focused conservation and restoration actions. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is capable of characterizing forests and the underlying topography. However, its potential for detecting and characterizing fallen trees under varying boreal forest conditions is not yet well understood. ALS-based fallen tree detection methods could improve our understanding regarding the spatiotemporal characteristics of dead wood over large landscapes. We developed and tested an automatic method for mapping individual fallen trees from an ALS point cloud with a point density of 15 points/m2. The presented method detects fallen trees using iterative Hough line detection and delineates the trees around the detected lines using region growing. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed evaluation of how the performance of ALS-based fallen tree detection is impacted by characteristics of fallen trees and the structure of vegetation around them. The results of this study showed that large fallen trees can be detected with a high accuracy in old-growth forests. In contrast, the detection of fallen trees in young managed stands proved challenging. The presented method was able to detect 78% of the largest fallen trees (diameter at breast height, DBH > 300 mm), whereas 30% of all trees with a DBH over 100 mm were detected. The performance of the detection method was positively correlated with both the size of fallen trees and the size of living trees surrounding them. In contrast, the performance was negatively correlated with the amount of undergrowth, ground vegetation, and the state of decay of fallen trees. Especially undergrowth and ground vegetation impacted the performance negatively, as they covered some of the fallen trees and lead to false fallen tree detections. Based on the results of this study, ALS-based collection of fallen tree information should be focused on old-growth forests and mature managed forests, at least with the current operative point densities.

TI  - Impacts of alien mink predation on island vertebrate communities of the Baltic Sea Archipelago:: review of a long-term experimental study
T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
CP  - Maj-and-Tor-Nessling-Foundation Symposium held at the 5th Environment Symposium
AB  - Feral American mink (Mustela vison) are emerging as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity in northern Europe. Here we summarize responses of migratory seabirds, island small mammals and amphibians to 15 years of large-scale, experimental mink removal in the outer Finnish archipelago. Mink control led to increases in breeding populations of 14 of 22 species of seabirds, which were generally of smaller body size and later breeders as compared with those species which showed no responses. Mink also suppressed the natural summer increases of bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) populations but only during years of good rainfall. Impacts on common frogs (Rana temporaria) took seven breeding seasons to appear probably because of delayed maturation of frogs; the less palatable common toads (Bufo bufo) seemed unaffected. It appears then that the disruptive effects of mink impacts may cover the entire island vertebrate community with cascading consequences to the whole archipelago ecosystem. Ongoing research is focused on the effects of the native apex predator, the white-tailed sea eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), whose return may suppress the detrimental effects of mink.

TI  - Environmental impact assessment of Marennes-Oleron bay: operational mathematical modelling and GIS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COASTAL REGIONS III
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Environmental Problems in Coastal Regions
AB  - Throughout the world, coastal zones are the most heavily populated and ecologically vulnerable areas. Many different and often conflicting interests exist in such areas which have to be (at least) properly addressed and (hopefully) carefully managed. For this purpose it is absolutely necessary to enhance the forecasting capacity regarding the medium- to long-term changes in the coastal marine system in the light of human activities and natural changes.
   In this framework, the primary objective of the European OPCOM project (Operational Modelling for Coastal Zone Management - Mast 3 - website: http://www.hydromod.de/projects/OPCOM/OPCOM.html) is to improve methods and techniques for continuous monitoring and operational forecasting in coastal waters. In this respect, operational models and monitoring infrastructure are used in four European coastal areas: the Elbe Estuary (Germany), the Bay of Marennes-Oleron (France), the Tagus Estuary (Portugal), the Archipelago Sea (Finland).
   Consequently, quality standards and the needs of interested first users in coastal zone management are being considered in the project work Marennes-Oleron Bay was chosen as the French site for implementation of a hydrodynamical model developed by SOGREAH, coupled with the Geographical Information System built by IFREMER and implemented at the CREMA laboratory.

TI  - Reduced opportunities for regional renewal: The role of rigid threat responses among a region's established firms
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - This article illustrates how opportunities for regional renewal in a peripheral region may be reduced by rigid threat responses undertaken by established firms operating within traditional regional industry. In an inductive case study of new biorefinery industry initiatives in a region where traditional pulp-and-paper and forestry industry was in decline, we used primary and secondary data to outline how a set of new industry players who created innovative ways of using existing regional infrastructures and resources sparked rigid threat responses among established firms from the struggling traditional industry. Established industry firms framed new industry initiatives as threats, and responded by (1) reducing new industry actors' possibilities for new business development, (2) engaging in entrenched resistance, (3) creating collaborative illusions and (4) undermining the fundamentals of the new industry. Consequently, this study contributes to existing literature by proposing the potential of applying the threat-rigidity thesis on a regional level. This is achieved by illustrating that conflicting behaviours between new and established regional industry actors constrain opportunities for regional renewal in a peripheral region. As such, relevant directions for future research and policy implications are outlined.

TI  - Developing in engineering students a critical analysis about sustainability in productive systems: Empirical evidences from an action research experience
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose The Mechanical Engineering course at the University of Campinas is composed of different disciplines in the areas of materials, mechanical design, manufacturing (production and manufacturing), computational systems, thermal and fluids. In the manufacturing area, in particular, there is a discipline entitled Productive Systems whose main objective is to offer to the student a global vision about operations management. In the field of operations management, sustainability is gaining more and more importance; thus, it is important to develop in the students a critical sense about social and environmental aspects. Thus, this paper aims to present the main initiatives developed in the discipline to promote sustainability in engineering students.
   Design/methodology/approach Since 2015, the professors responsible for the Productive Systems discipline, assisted by post-graduate students and professors from other universities, have begun to redesign the discipline, including debates, lectures, projects and other initiatives to provide a critical view concerning the traditional concepts taught. The discipline has been performed three times with this new conception. The methodology to structure this research was literature review, documental analyses of the discipline records and meetings with professors that participated in the initiatives. An Action Research approach was performed by two professors and a graduate student. The authors of this paper also compared the results with those obtained by initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden).
   Findings This study allowed to reinforce some results from initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden); however, some differences were identified. For example, similar to the initiatives mentioned, the professors of University of Campinas had problems with didactic books, as they loosely integrate the basic operations management concepts with sustainable development fundamentals. On the other hand, debates related to social sustainability were considered positive from the point of view of the professors and students, differing from initiatives performed at Chalmers University of Technology.
   Research limitations/implications Results come from one field study (University of Campinas) when professors of the Mechanical Engineering course try to integrate operations management concepts and sustainable development. Different results may be observed by other higher education institutions.
   Practical implications The authors of this paper believe that the diffusion of these initiatives can stimulate other professors and researchers in the field to broaden the academic debate about the insertion of sustainability into engineering courses.
   Originality/value There are few papers presenting didactic experiences and empirical results about the integration of operations management concepts and sustainable development. Results of this paper reinforce some good practices and they also present other ones, in a way that extend the debate about educational engineering.

TI  - Integrating fertilisation and liming costs into profitability estimates for fuel wood harvesting: A case study in beech forests of eastern France
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - Substituting renewable forms of energy for fossil fuels is a real challenge in developed countries and fuel wood will undoubtedly have an important role to play in forested areas. However, fuel wood harvesting may deplete nutrients in forest ecosystems and adversely affect site fertility in the long term. We compared the cost of compensatory fertilising and liming operations between whole-tree harvesting and traditional stem-only harvesting. We worked in beech (Fagus syluatica L.) stands in eastern France and two site fertility classes (high and low). We used a growth model to calculate the nitrogen, calcium, potassium, magnesium and phosphorus contents of fine woody debris (FWD, diameter < 7 cm) and compared the benefits of selling this fine wood for energy to the cost of compensatory fertilising and liming. We showed that compensating and liming are more expensive than the profits derived from selling fine fuel wood, except when fuel wood prices rise considerably. This was mainly due to the high proportion of bark in FWD compared with other tree compartments. Indeed, bark is especially rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which were the most costly nutrients to replace. Our study highlights the importance of considering the environmental costs of fuel wood production at the stand scale. Whenever fertilisation or liming is necessary, we recommend compensating at least for calcium and magnesium, two nutrients that account for a very small part of the costs. In any case, fertilisation should only be used if long-term site fertility has been compromised. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Microsatellite markers for the palaeo-temperature indicator <i>Pentapharsodinium dalei</i> (Dinophyceae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY
AB  - Pentapharsodinium dalei is a widely distributed cold-water dinoflagellate, which is used in palaeoecology as an indicator of relatively warmer conditions in polar and sub-polar regions. This species has been proposed to be one of the first indicators of global warming at high latitudes. We developed the first microsatellite markers for P. dalei to facilitate the study of spatial and temporal population genetic changes. Single cysts were isolated from surface sediments in Koljo Fjord, Sweden. After cyst germination, single vegetative cells were isolated for establishing monoclonal cultures. Six dinucleotide polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed as multiplex polymerase chain reactions and were genotyped in 32 strains. The number of alleles per locus varied between 4 and 12, and the estimated gene diversity varied from 0.588 to 0.891. The haploid state of the vegetative cells was confirmed. The six selected microsatellites will be useful to explore population dynamics in P. dalei from contemporary planktonic and revived benthic samples to enable, for example, detailed studies into the evolutionary consequences of anthropogenic and climate-driven habitat changes.

TI  - Which regions produce the most innovation policy research?
T2  - POLICY STUDIES
AB  - This article uses the data indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases up to and including the year 2020 to map leading regions and trending topics in academic innovation policy research. The country analysis highlights four leading regions in this research field: Western Europe (led by the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, and Spain), North America (led by the USA), Scandinavia (led by Sweden and Denmark), and Asia-Pacific (led by China and Australia). The most common keywords are used to develop a conceptual framework. Applying the Tree of Science approach, we classify the most influential studies into three categories: foundational studies (the roots), structural studies (the trunk), and recent studies (the leaves). This approach shows that trending topics are built around five main pillars: innovation systems, policy tools, knowledge management, sustainability, and entrepreneurship. Finally, based on analysis of the most common keywords and the most influential studies, we propose a Sextuple Helix model. This model consists of the Quintuple Helix (government, university, industry, knowledge society, and sustainability) with the added dimension of entrepreneurship. This model offers an analytical framework with massive potential for academic research on innovation policy in the current economic context.

TI  - Does despotic behavior or food search explain the occurrence of problem brown bears in Europe?
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Bears foraging near human developments are often presumed to be responding to food shortage, but this explanation ignores social factors, in particular despotism in bears. We analyzed the age distribution and body condition index (BCI) of shot brown bears in relation to densities of bears and people, and whether the shot bears were killed by managers (i.e., problem bears; n=149), in self-defense (n=51), or were hunter-killed nonproblem bears (n=1,896) during 1990-2010. We compared patterns between areas with (Slovenia) and without supplemental feeding (Sweden) of bears relative to 2 hypotheses. The food-search/food-competition hypothesis predicts that problem bears should have a higher BCI (e.g., exploiting easily accessible and/or nutritious human-derived foods) or lower BCI (e.g., because of food shortage) than nonproblem bears, that BCI and human density should have a positive correlation, and problem bear occurrence and seasonal mean BCI of nonproblem bears should have a negative correlation (i.e., more problem bears during years of low food availability). Food competition among bears additionally predicts an inverse relationship between BCI and bear density. The safety-search/naivety hypothesis (i.e., avoiding other bears or lack of human experience) predicts no relationship between BCI and human density, provided no dietary differences due to spatiotemporal habitat use among bears, no relationship between problem bear occurrence and seasonal mean BCI of nonproblem bears, and does not necessarily predict a difference between BCI for problem/nonproblem bears. If food competition or predation avoidance explained bear occurrence near settlements, we predicted younger problem than nonproblem bears and a negative correlation between age and human density. However, if only food search explained bear occurrence near settlements, we predicted no relation between age and problem or nonproblem bear status, or between age and human density. We found no difference in BCI or its variability between problem and nonproblem bears, no relation between BCI and human density, and no correlation between numbers of problem bears shot and seasonal mean BCI for either country. The peak of shot problem bears occurred from April to June in Slovenia and in June in Sweden (i.e., during the mating period when most intraspecific predation occurs and before fall hyperphagia). Problem bears were younger than nonproblem bears, and both problem and nonproblem bears were younger in areas of higher human density. These age differences, in combination with similarities in BCI between problem and nonproblem bears and lack of correlation between BCI and human density, suggested safety-search and naive dispersal to be the primary mechanisms responsible for bear occurrence near settlements. Younger bears are less competitive, more vulnerable to intraspecific predation, and lack human experience, compared to adults. Body condition was inversely related to the bear density index in Sweden, whereas we found no correlation in Slovenia, suggesting that supplemental feeding may have reduced food competition, in combination with high bear harvest rates. Bears shot in self-defense were older and their BCI did not differ from that of nonproblem bears. Reasons other than food shortage apparently explained why most bears were involved in encounters with people or viewed as problematic near settlements in our study. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.

TI  - Agricultural zinc fluxes into soils and crops of central Iran at regional scale
T2  - ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE
AB  - Mass flux assessment can provide information that is essential for a sustainable management of elements in agricultural soils. In this article, we present an assessment of regional-scale averages of zinc (Zn) fluxes into agricultural soils and crops of central Iran for the period 1997-2011, using available databases such as regional agricultural statistics. The basic units of the balances were 15 townships of the provinces Qom, Isfahan and Fars. Averaged over the entire study region, the net Zn input into arable soil resulting from all fertilizer inputs - Zn removal with harvested crops was 1515 g ha(-1) yr(-1) across the entire region, with a range of 438-3009 g ha(-1) yr(-1) among townships. Estimated average Zn inputs with manure, mineral fertilizers, sewage sludge and compost were 1254, 531, 19 and 7 g ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The input-to-output ratio of these fluxes ranged from 1.8 to 12.9 among townships and averaged 6.1 for the entire study area. Considering that outputs other than with crop harvests are minor, Zn stocks are rapidly building up in the soils of the study region. Uncertainties in the manure and crop removal data were the main sources of estimation uncertainty in this study.

TI  - Theorising pathways to sustainability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - Using a Pathways approach, controversies over environmental and natural resource management are viewed as expressions of alternative, or competing, pathways to sustainability. This supports deeper understanding of the underlying causes of natural resource management controversies. The framework is composed of two elements: the STEPS (Social, Technological, and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) Pathways approach and frame analysis. Many sustainable development dilemmas are played out in specific places and consequently, the Pathways approach is integrated with a place-based frame analysis. The resulting framework guides empirical investigation in place-based contexts. This theorising about sustainability science can be used to cast light on contested natural resource management issues, in this case mining in northern Sweden. By exposing the range of alternative Pathways to critical norms of sustainable development, we ascertain whether action alternatives are compatible with sustainable futures. The framework provides a way in which sustainability science can better understand the origins of natural resource management conflicts, characterise the positions of the actors involved, identify the potential for cooperation between stakeholders leading to policy resolution and judge what Pathways help or hinder the pursuit of sustainable development. In addition, it can enhance sustainability science by guiding integrative sustainability research at the project scale.

TI  - Comparison of Environmental Effects and Resource Consumption for Different Wastewater and Organic Waste Management Systems in a New City Area in Sweden
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - An analysis of the environmental effects and resource consumption by four systems for management of wastewater and organic household waste in a new city area have been performed, as follows: (1) conventional system complemented with advanced sludge treatment for phosphorus recovery, (2) blackwater system with urine diversion and food waste disposers, (3) blackwater system with food waste disposers and reverse osmosis, and (4) local wastewater treatment plant with nutrient recovery by using reverse osmosis.
   Substance-flow analysis and energy/exergy calculations were performed by using the software tool URWARE/ORWARE. Emissions were calculated and classified based on the impact categories global warming potential, acidification, and eutrophication, according to ISO14042 (2000). The analysis also included nutrient recovery (i.e., the potential to use nutrients as a fertilizer). Depending on which aspects are prioritized, different systems can be considered to be the most advantageous. Water Environ. Res., 80, 708 (2008).

TI  - Mine Waste and Acute Warming Induce Energetic Stress in the Deep-Sea Sponge <i>Geodia atlantica</i> and Coral <i>Primnoa resedeaformis</i>; Results From a Mesocosm Study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - There is the potential for climate change to interact with pollution in all of the Earth's oceans. In the fjords of Norway, mine tailings are released into fjords generating suspended sediment plumes that impact deep-sea ecosystems. These same deep-sea ecosystems are expected to undergo periodic warming as climate change increases the frequency of down-welling events in fjords. It remains unknown how a polluted deep-sea ecosystem would respond to down-welling because multiple stressors will often interact in unpredictable ways. Here, we exposed two deep-sea foundation species; the gorgonian coral Primnoa resedaeformis and the demosponge Geodia atlantica to suspended sediment (10 mg L-1) and acute warming (+5 degrees C) in a factorial mesocosm experiment for 40 days. Physiology (respiration, nutrient flux) and cellular responses (lysosomal cell stability) were measured for both the coral and sponge. Exposure to elevated suspended sediment reduced metabolism, supressed silicate uptake and induced cellular instability of the sponge G. atlantica. However, combining sediment with warming caused G. atlantica to respire and excrete nitrogen at a greater rate. For the coral P resedaeformis, suspended sediments reduced O:N ratios after 40 days, however, warming had a greater effect on P resedaeformis physiology compared to sediment. Warming increased respiration, nitrogen excretion, and cellular instability which resulted in lower O:N ratios. We argue that suspended sediment and warming can act alone and also interact to cause significant harm to deep-sea biota, however responses are likely to be species-specific. Warming and pollution could interact in the deep-sea to cause mortality to the coral P resedaeformis and to a lesser extent, the sponge G. atlantica. As foundation species, reducing the abundance of deep sea corals and sponges would likely impact the ecosystems they support.

TI  - Bioenergy development in the UK & Nordic countries: A comparison of effectiveness of support policies for sustainable development of the bioenergy sector
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - This paper uses both quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of government policy and support mechanisms in the UK, Sweden, Denmark and Finland in promoting bioenergy - a key technology fundamental to each country's decarbonisation strategies. It is crucial that countries develop effective policies and support mechanisms to grow sustainable bioenergy sectors. This paper analyses the success of bioenergy policies within each country and evaluates the importance of wider independent variables that collectively characterise the background to energy sector, economic and environmental dynamics. Statistical correlation and regression analyses are applied to identify if the policy landscape has had an identifiable impact on actual bioenergy development. Furthermore, the outputs from a stakeholder workshop and expert interviews are analysed to identify drivers and barriers to bioenergy. The result is a comprehensive analysis of the successes and challenges in bioenergy development, and possible lessons that can be drawn for future promotion of the sector. The research finds that the UK and Nordic countries have had different yet equally successful approaches to promoting bio-power and bio-heat respectively. However, the influence of wider factors within different countries is found to have a potentially greater collective impact on bioenergy than any single policy mechanism. Thus there is credence in learning lessons from what does and does not work in different countries, but countries also need to develop their own brands of policy interventions that suit their country's unique challenges.

TI  - Development and testing of an instrument (HeSoEduCo) for health and social care educators' competence in professional education
T2  - NURSE EDUCATION TODAY
AB  - Background: Health and social care education is highly important for preparing future professionals for their future roles in sustainable health and social care. However, previous studies have emphasized that health and social care educators' competence is complex and poorly defined. Thus, there is a clear need for a psychometrically validated instrument to enable clarification and assessment of the required skills.
   Objective: To develop and psychometrically validate an instrument (the HeSoEduCo) for assessing health and social care educators' competence in higher and professional education.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Methods: A HeSoEduCo instrument, with items inviting 1-4 Likert scale responses, was developed, based on one systematic review and one qualitative study, then validated in terms of face, content and construct validity and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha values). All health and social care educators based in all 21 universities of applied sciences in Finland and seven vocational colleges were subsequently invited to participate in a large-scale application of the instrument in fall 2018. In total, responses of 390 of these educators are analyzed here.
   Results: The face and content validity of 71 newly developed items were assessed by experts in two evaluation rounds. The final content validity showed high scores for the instrument's relevance and clarity. Confirmatory factor analysis (to test construct validity) yielded eight factors (43-items remaining), defining the following competence areas of educators: evidence-based practice, digital collaborative learning, student-centered pedagogy, collaboration & societal, leadership & management, cultural & linguistic diversity, mentoring student into professional competence development and subject & curriculum. Cronbach's alpha values for the factors ranged from 0.70 to 0.89.
   Conclusion: The instrument can be used to obtain self-evaluations of educators' competence when assessing their general competence levels and help human resources departments and managers to identify suitable continuous education programs for their staff.

TI  - Method for Quantitative Evaluation of Sustainability Measures: A Systems Approach for Policy Prioritization
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Decision makers are tasked with defining and implementing measures that can meet established environmental targets. However, it is not always clear how effective the measure(s) will be in meeting the specified goals and which measures should be prioritized for implementation. To fill this gap, we have developed a method for testing planned actions to estimate potential impact on targets. The method can be performed at any scale, e.g., at the national, regional, or city level. The approach considers several factors, including the total consumption of an area, region-specific consumption-based environmental hotspots, the decision makers, the reduction targets and related measures, as well as multiple impact types. We present the method using the example of the municipality Gothenburg, Sweden. In collaboration with local authorities in Gothenburg, we co-created scenarios that bundle proposed measures intended to make progress towards their climate target of 3.5 tons carbon dioxide equivalents per capita. We then quantified how measures related to two known environmental hotspots, fuel and electronics, may affect climate change impact levels by the target year of 2035. The scenarios indicate that despite targeting known high-impact product types in Gothenburg, the efforts lead to only 14% of the reduction needed to meet the specified goal.

TI  - Management Scenarios Under Climate Change - A Study of the Nordic and Barents Seas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - The effects of increasing fishing pressure in combination with temperature increases in the Nordic and Barents Seas have been evaluated using an end-to-end model for the area forced by a downscaled RCP 4.5 climate scenario. The scenarios that have been applied have used four different fractions of fisheries mortality at maximum sustainable yield (Fmsy); 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 1.1 x Fmsy. As it is highly likely that more ecosystem components will be harvested in the future, the four scenarios have been repeated with fishing on a larger number of ecosystem components, including harvesting of lower trophic levels (mesozooplankton and mesopelagic fish). The zooplankton biomass had an increasing trend, regardless of the increase in fishing pressure on their predators. However, when introducing harvest on the lower trophic levels, this increase was no longer evident. When harvesting more components, the negative response in biomass of pelagic and demersal fish to increasing harvest became more prominent, indicating an increasing vulnerability in the ecosystem structure to stressors. Although harvest on lower trophic level led to an immense increase in the total catch, it also resulted in a decrease in the total catches of pelagic and demersal fish, despite more species being harvested in these guilds.

TI  - In lumpfish We Trust? The Efficacy of Lumpfish <i>Cyclopterus lumpus</i> to Control <i>Lepeophtheirus salmonis</i> Infestations on Farmed Atlantic Salmon: A Review
T2  - FISHES
AB  - In this review, we have systematized current knowledge about the effect of stocking lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) as cleaner fish to control Lepeophtheirus salmonis infestations on farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). The review was prompted by recent reports in which the usefulness of lumpfish has been doubted, and the urgent need to investigate whether common lumpfish can be used to reduce L. salmonis numbers on farmed Atlantic salmon by active grazing on this species. Available published data clearly indicate that lumpfish graze on L. salmonis, and can significantly lower the lice burden in Atlantic salmon farming. It is possible to enhance the lice grazing behavior of lumpfish with the assistance of live feed conditioning prior to sea pen transfer, and with selective breeding. Data indicate that lice grazing of lumpfish is size dependent, and grazing effect is low for lumpfish larger than 200-250 g. Observations from large-scale rearing of Atlantic salmon in open sea cages in Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Scotland also indicate that lumpfish can be effective in lowering infestations of L. salmonis on salmon. Overall, this present review reveals that lumpfish can actively contribute to lower numbers of L. salmonis on farmed Atlantic salmon.

TI  - An overview of cleaner fish use in Ireland
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES
CP  - 11th International Sea Lice Conference
AB  - Sea lice infestations represent one of the most significant challenges facing the salmon farming industry, giving rise to lost production, additional costs of treatment and potential negative interactions with wild stocks. At present, cleaner fish, which actively remove lice from salmon, are an effective, biological, long-term option which has been adopted by many countries. In Ireland, several key studies were conducted in the 1990s on the use of wild-caught wrasse (corkwing, goldsinny and rock cook) as cleaner fish in experimental and commercial scale trials. More recently, the National University of Ireland Galway (NUIG), at their marine research facility in Carna (CRS), has undertaken applied research on ballan wrasse and lumpsucker. Currently, CRS is providing lumpsucker juveniles and research and development for the Irish salmon industry with support from BIM (Ireland's Seafood Development Agency) and Marine Harvest Ireland. There is a large amount of research currently being carried out in this area in all countries that are utilizing cleaner fish technology. The current focus in Ireland is the development of a native lumpsucker brood-stock to facilitate its sustainable production. The aim of this article was to provide an overview of the research, challenges and use of cleaner fish in Ireland.

T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
CP  - International Conference on Wastewater Sludge as a Resource (BIOSOLIDS 2003)
AB  - Anaerobic digestion of sludge has been part of the treatment plant in Malmo for many years and several projects on optimisation of the digestion process have been undertaken in full scale as well as in pilot scale. In order to facilitate a more sustainable solution in the future for waste management,solid waste organic waste is sorted out from households for anaerobic treatment in a newly built city district. The system for treatment of the waste is integrated in a centralised solution located at the existing wastewater treatment plant. A new extension of the digester capacity enables separate as well as co-digestion of sludge together with urban organic waste from households, industry, restaurants, big kitchens, food stores, supermarkets, green markets etc. for biogas production and production of fertiliser. Collection and pre-treatment of different types of waste are in progress together with examination of biogas potential for different types of organic waste. Collection of household waste as well as anaerobic digestion in laboratory and pilot scale has been performed during the last year. It is demonstrated that organic household waste can be digested separately or in combination with sludge. In the latter case a higher biogas yield is found than should be expected from digestion of the two materials separately. Household waste from a system based on collection of organic waste from grinders could be digested at mesophilic conditions whereas digestion failed at thermophilic conditions.

TI  - Influence of freight transport purchasing processes on logistical variables related to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: a case study in Sweden
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS-RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Emissions from freight transport stem from logistical variables such as vehicle utilisation, fuel efficiency, and distance. The purpose is to determine how shippers' freight transport purchasing processes influence logistical variables. A multiple case study of freight transport purchasing processes was conducted, based on interviews with transport purchasers and providers. Three causes of influence of shippers' purchasing processes on logistical variables were found: specific requirements, network structure of transport providers, and scope of contract. Specifications by purchasers, especially time requirements, influence several logistical variables (mode used', length of haul', load factor', empty running', and fuel efficiency'). This paper clarifies the implications of transport purchasing on CO2 emissions in terms of logistical variables, which are understood in transportation research and practice. It describes the effects of shippers' requirements on transport providers' execution of transport. The results provide a foundation for shippers to discuss their influence on logistical variables with transport providers.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of nutrients in the Baltic Proper, Baltic Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - The Baltic Proper shows many signs of eutrophication. Nutrient changes over time have been discernable, and also within the Sea there are large spatial patterns. Present study analyses the spatial patterns of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus as well as dissolved silicate (DSi) in the euphotic zone for the period 1990-2001. The focus is on the spatial heterogeneity with the aim to identify areas significantly different from the overall mean.
   Three regions are clearly discernible, the interior, the western and the eastern coastal zones. This is further complicated by the Gulfs of Finland and Riga with distinct different behaviour compared to the other ones. While the coastal zones are re-supplied by their terrestrial sources, the exchange with the interior is limited by geophysical constraints. The western border shows permanently high DSi but low DIN and DIP concentrations. The riverine loads of DIN, DIP and DSi are low but a large transport of DSi probably takes place from the Bothnian Sea to the Kattegat along the western coast with only minor retention. The eastern region, on the other hand, is characterised by both high nutrient loads and high production. These spatial patterns agree well with a conceptual model where the spring bloom leads to an interior generally low in DIN. This favours N-fixating cyanobacteria blooms at the expense of diatoms. This view is supported by decreasing DIP concentrations but unaffected DSi levels. The spatial patterns observed well reflect the riverine nutrient loads. This should be regarded in future remedy plans for the eutrophic Baltic Sea. The terrestrial load can have very different impacts on the ecosystems depending on which coastal section is involved.

TI  - Parental Decision-Making on Childhood Vaccination
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - A growing number of parents delay vaccinations or are deciding not to vaccinate their children altogether. This increases the risk of contracting vaccine-preventable diseases and disrupting herd immunity, and also impairs the trust in the capacities of health care systems to protect people. Vaccine hesitancy is related to a range of both psychological and demographic determinants, such as attitudes toward vaccinations, social norms, and trust in science. Our aim is to understand those determinants in parents, because they are a special group in this issue-they act as proxy decision makers for their children, who are unable to decide for themselves. The fact that deciding to vaccinate is a socially forced choice that concerns a child's health makes vaccine-related decisions highly important and involving for parents. This high involvement might lead to parents overemphasizing the potential side effects that they know to be vaccine-related, and by amplifying those, parents are more focused on the potential outcomes of vaccine-related decisions, which can yield specific pattern of the outcome bias. We propose two related studies to investigate factors which promote vaccine hesitancy, protective factors that determine parental vaccination decisions, and outcome bias in parental vaccination intentions. We will explore demographic and psychological factors, and test parental involvement related to vaccine hesitancy using an online battery in a correlation panel design study. The second study is an experimental study, in which we will investigate the moderating role of parents' high involvement in the specific domain of vaccination decision making. We expect that higher involvement among parents, compared to non-parents, will shape the pattern of the proneness to outcome bias. The studies will be conducted across eight countries in Europe and Asia (Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom), rendering findings that will aid with understanding the underlying mechanisms of vaccine hesitancy and paving the way for developing interventions custom-made for parents.

The most important cause of European genetic variation has been confirmed to correspond to the migration of Neolithic farmers from the area of origin of agriculture in the Middle East, The next most important component of genetic variation is apparently associated with a north-south gradient possibly due to adaptation to cold climates but also to the differentiation of the Uralic and the Indo-European language-speaking people; however, the relevant correlations are not significantly different from zero after elimination of the spatial autocorrelation, The third component is highly correlated with the infiltration of the Yamna (''Kurgan'') people, nomadic pastoralists who domesticated the horse and who have been claimed to have spread Indo-European languages to Europe; this association, which is statistically significant even when taking spatial autocorrelations into account, does not completely exclude the hypothesis of Indo-European as the language of Neolithic farmers. It is possible that both expansions were responsible for the spread of different subfamilies of Indo-European languages, but our genetic data cannot resolve their relative importance.

TI  - Rationale and design of the DP-TRANSFERS project: diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society in Catalonia
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background: Compelling evidence has been accumulated to support the effectiveness of intensive lifestyle intervention in delaying progression to Type 2 diabetes even in people identified as being at high risk determined by the Finnish diabetes risk score. The DE-PLAN-CAT project (diabetes in Europe-prevention using lifestyle, physical activity and nutritional intervention-Catalonia) evidenced that intensive lifestyle intervention was feasible and cost-effective on a short scale in real-life primary care settings, at least over 4 years. However, transferring such lifestyle interventions to society remains the major challenge of research in the field of diabetes prevention.
   Methods/design: The derived DP-TRANSFERS (diabetes prevention-transferring findings from European research to society) is a large scale national programme aimed at translating a tailored lifestyle intervention to the maximum of primary care centres where feasible through a core proposal agreed with all the partners. The method is built upon a 3-step (screening, intervention and follow-up) real-life, community-wide structure on the basis of a dual intensity lifestyle intervention (basic and continuity modules) and supported by a 4-channel transfer strategy (institutional relationships, facilitators' workshops, collaborative groupware and programme WEB page). Participation will initially cover nine health departments (7 million inhabitants) through nine coordinating centres located in metropolitan (3.2 million), semi-urban (2.9 million) and rural (0.9 million) areas from which it is expected accessing 25 % of all primary care settings, equivalent to 90 associated centres (1.6-1.8 million people) with an estimate of 0.32 million participants aged 45-75 years at high risk of future development of diabetes. To ascertain sustainability, effect, satisfaction and quality of the translation programme statistical analyses will be performed from both the entire population (facilitators and participants) and a stratified representative sample obtained by collecting data from at least 920 participants.
   Discussion: The DP-TRANSFERS will use a strategy of approach to society consistent with the impact of the disease and the fast accessibility provided by primary care settings in Catalonia. Both the widespread effect of the lifestyle intervention and the translational process itself could be assessed.

TI  - Exergy analysis and nutrient flows of various sewerage systems
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - There is an increasing demand for more sustainable sewerage systems. An important tool in the analysis of the sustainability of a sewerage system is exergy analysis. It is possible, by using an exergy analysis, to estimate the consumption of physical resources. In the present study, the demand on resources in the sewerage system of Bergsjon, a district of Goteborg, Sweden, was evaluated through exergy analysis. The case study included the existing system and two sewerage system alternatives. One important aspect of a sustainable sanitary system is nutrients recycling from sewage to agriculture. The exergy analysis has therefore been complemented with an analysis of the mass-flows of phosphorus and nitrogen. The study shows that the hypothetical calculated exergy consumption during operation will be lower in a system with local treatment and urine separation toilets compared with a conventional alternative. The amount of phosphorus that could be recycled is the same for the studied alternatives, but the amount of nitrogen that could be recycled is considerably higher for systems with urine separation techniques.

TI  - Prioritization and selection of climate change adaptation measures: a review of the literature
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM
CP  - 36th IAHR World Congress
AB  - Adaptation to climate change is key to reduce associated risks and develop climate resilient communities. Adaptation measures should be designed for both current and future impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainty in climate change and its impacts, and also the intrinsic complexity in climate change adaptation process present challenges in developing, planning, and effective implementation of appropriate adaptation strategies in many countries. Despite the improvements, it is due to these challenges that the planned adaptation to climate change still has not reached the desired levels. In particular, there are key issues and knowledge gaps associated with climate change related decision-making. For example, although generic frameworks for the assessment of climate change risks and vulnerability are available in certain EU member countries (e.g., United Kingdom, Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Norway), there is a gap in developing a common methodology for the prioritization and selection of adaptation measures. The methods which are most widely used for prioritizing (and selecting) adaption measures are Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA), Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA), Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), and expert judgment. While each method has its advantages and disadvantages, their applicability in inter-regional, cross-sectoral, cross-border, multilevel, and multi-actor cases are rather limited. At present, a systematic and comprehensive methodology which is capable of taking into account the characteristics of the case-of-concern in terms of the constraints at hand such as insufficient local resources or site-specific vulnerabilities is absent. The principles of no-regret, low-regret, and win-win are often employed in identification of appropriate adaptation measures as a first step. The purpose of this study is to provide a critical review of the current primary approaches and methods for prioritization and selection of climate change adaptation measures.

TI  - Effects of live and post-mortem shell structures of invasive Pacific oysters and native blue mussels on macrofauna and fish
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Blue mussels Mytilus edulis and the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas are both ecosystem engineering species which modify the environment, thus having large effects on associated species. With the introduction of the Pacific oyster, a new biogenic structure has been added to subtidal sediment habitats in Scandinavia. By conducting a field experiment, the effects of live and post-mortem shell structures of C. gigas and M. edulis on associated infauna, epibenthic fauna and fish on the Swedish west coast were evaluated. Plots with 5 different treatments ( live Pacific oysters, oyster shells, live blue mussels, mussel shells and sand control) were constructed on bare sandy sediment at 2 subtidal localities. Epibenthic macrofauna and fish were sampled with a drop trap, and sediment and infauna samples were collected with sediment cores. Live bivalve treatments had significant effects on organic content of the sediment; however, no treatment effects on infauna were found. In contrast, abundance and biomass of epibenthic fauna increased 4 to 8 times and species richness increased in the presence of the bivalves or their shells, compared to the sand control. Epibenthic fauna abundance and biomass was higher in the oyster shell treatment compared to the live bivalve treatments, which in turn had higher abundance and biomass than the mussel shell treatment. In general, the mussel shell treatment favoured small crustaceans, while the oyster shell and live bivalve treatments favoured fish and larger invertebrate species. Based on these results, we conclude that further establishment of the Pacific oyster in Swedish waters will cause large changes to community structure of benthic macrofauna and fish.

TI  - Managing the room of maneuver in design build contracts - a comparative study of Norwegian road projects
T2  - CREATIVE CONSTRUCTION CONFERENCE 2017, CCC 2017
CP  - 6th Creative Construction Conference (CCC)
AB  - Most public infrastructure projects in Norway are conducted with design-bid-build contract form. However, the traditional design-bid-build contract seems to be both time consuming and demand a lot of resources. And at the same time contribute to a high level of conflict between the project owner and the contractor. Because of this, and an increased amount of big and complex infrastructure projects, public project owners are boosting their use of design-build contracts. Use of design-build contracts can potentially shorten project time, and reduce cost. In addition, the use of this contract form can release the project owner's resources and make use of the contractor's competence. Within the design-build contract form and delivery method there is a certain room of maneuver. This can be utilized and potentially contribute to achieve the mentioned benefits. The problem occurs when the public project owner's laws and regulations limits this room of maneuver, and puts too many restrictions on the contractor's choice of technical solutions and ways of construction. To explore this a literature review and multiple case studies were conducted. Four public road projects were explored through semi-structured in depth interviews and document studies. This identified the room of maneuver in the studied projects, as well as the potential room of maneuver for the projects. The level of detail set in the contract by the project owner, through deployment of the laws and regulations, seems to be the most critical factor. This decides whether the contractor has a satisfying room of maneuver or is too restricted and not able to propose and execute alternative solutions. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - MACROECONOMIC SHOCKS OF 2022 AND SOVEREIGN FUNDS
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB  - In 2022, instead of getting back to pre-pandemic "new normal" the world entered into another period of severe economic and geopolitical turbulences. In terms of macroeconomics, the most evident and painful was the hike of hydrocarbons' and food prices. This drove inflation rates to the levels not seen in recent 40 years. In attempts to cool down underlying inflationary pressures the monetary authorities of many countries had to stop the policies of quantitative easing (QE) and started to raise basic interest rates. In this environment the governments, businesses and families are facing massive debt problems. The main stock market indices crushed deeply and simultaneously in 2002 which meant substantial depreciation of assets. All these macroeconomic shocks seriously affected the performance of sovereign wealth funds which currently present a solid and increasingly influential group of global assets' holders and managers. The steady growth of the value of their assets under management (AUM) was interrupted last year. According to preliminary analysis, the total losses of AUM can reach circa 1 Trillion US$. Just one fund - Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) - reported a depreciation of its assets by as much as 165 Billion US$ as of end-2022. This is an amount comparable to the GDP of a mid-size country, for instance Ukraine before current military conflict. However, for Norway's GPFG and similar state-owned investors (SOIs) of other countries such losses were not critical. SWFs are, basically, "tolerant investors" with very long view on value creation and operational planning, so they easily absorb paper losses. Simultaneously, the huge SWFs of oil and gas exporting Gulf countries enjoyed the hike of hydrocarbons' international prices and hurried up to invest massive influx of unexpected revenues into depreciated assets in troubled economies of the USA and Europe. More countries tended to expand the mandates of their sovereign funds beyond traditional stabilization and saving functions. Strategic development funds became increasingly demanded by the governments and may appear even at the supranational level (the projected European Sovereignty Fund). So far, it may be concluded that in general macroeconomic shocks of 2002 did not undermine the positions of SWFs as strong and resource-rich global investors. On the contrary, it looks like that their role as an efficient tool of governmental policies of offsetting and preventing multiple market failures is getting to be further strengthened in upcoming harsh times.

TI  - Bioresource utilisation by sustainable technologies in new value-added biorefinery concepts - two case studies from food and forest industry
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This paper presents a trans-disciplinary assessment of new and innovative biorefinery concepts producing high-value chemical compounds from residues from agriculture, food and forest industries. There is a significant potential of biomass residues in Sweden suitable for the extraction of various compounds, including upgrading by biocatalytic processes, in addition to current energy generation. Two examples presented are quercetin extracted from onion waste by pressurised hot water in conjunction with enzymatic hydrolysis, and betulin from birch bark extracted by liquid CO2 containing ethanol. Inherent in these two extraction processes and production routes is the ability to show good environmental performance from a life cycle perspective. Extraction of high-value compounds also provides possibilities for innovation in the current agricultural, food and forest industry potentially leading to socio-economical benefits.

TI  - Effects of female body mass and climate on reproduction in northern wild boar
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
AB  - Mammalian life history strategies depend on climate conditions. Hence, reproductive parameters may vary regionally, and knowledge on such patterns are important for sustainable management. Wild boar research has been biased towards south and central Europe. Here we investigate the effects of mother's carcass mass, season and climate (summer temperature and precipitation as well as January temperature) on pregnancy rate and litter size in 601 free-ranging female wild boar from hemiboreal Sweden, close to the north border of wild boar distribution range in Europe. Pregnancy rate was on average 33.4 +/- 1.94% (mean +/- SE), whereas average litter size of pregnant females was 4.7 +/- 0.12. Pregnancy rate was highest during the seasonal reproduction peak in winter and spring, and both pregnancy rate and litter size increased significantly with increasing female body mass. The probability of a female being pregnant exceeded 50% when carcass mass exceeded 58 kg, equivalent to a live mass of 113 kg, and litter size increased by one for each 16 kg increase in female carcass mass. We found no significant effects of temporal variations in climate, and suggest that such variations were not sufficiently large to affect wild boar reproduction. Alternatively, the reproductive strategy of wild boar may be adjusted to prevailing regional climate conditions. In that case, other life history traits, such as mortality, may be more sensitive to short-term climate fluctuations. Wild boar management needs to take temporal variations in reproduction, as well as in resource availability, into consideration when deciding on prudent management actions.

TI  - Connecting tree-ring phenotypes, genetic associations and transcriptomics to decipher the genomic architecture of drought adaptation in a widespread conifer
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - As boreal forests face significant threats from climate change, understanding evolutionary trajectories of coniferous species has become fundamental to adapting management and conservation to a drying climate. We examined the genomic architecture underlying adaptive variation related to drought tolerance in 43 populations of a widespread boreal conifer, white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss), by combining genotype-environment associations, genotype-phenotype associations, and transcriptomics. Adaptive genetic variation was identified by correlating allele frequencies for 6,153 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 2,606 candidate genes with temperature, precipitation and aridity gradients, and testing for significant associations between genotypes and 11 dendrometric and drought-related traits (i.e., anatomical, growth response and climate-sensitivity traits) using a polygenic model. We identified a set of 285 genes significantly associated with a climatic factor or a phenotypic trait, including 110 that were differentially expressed in response to drought under greenhouse-controlled conditions. The interlinked phenotype-genotype-environment network revealed eight high-confidence genes involved in white spruce adaptation to drought, of which four were drought-responsive in the expression analysis. Our findings represent a significant step toward the characterization of the genomic basis of drought tolerance and adaptation to climate in conifers, which is essential to enable the establishment of resilient forests in view of new climate conditions.

TI  - Great crested newts (<i>Triturus cristatus</i>) as indicators of aquatic plant diversity
T2  - HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB  - in a field study in south central Sweden, we analysed the diversity of macrophytes in paired samples of ponds in a total of five geographically separated sites. Each pair of ponds involved one pond with presence of great crested newts (Triturus cristatus) and one pond in which newts were absent. Ponds with presence of great crested newts had a significantly higher mean number of plant species than ponds without newts. Newts occurred in ponds that tended to have a lower amount of pond area covered by surface vegetation, although this difference was not statistically significant. Macrophyte diversity also tended to increase more steeply in ponds with T. cristatus, compared with ponds without newts. Broad-leaved pond weed (Potamogeton natans) and square-leaved liverwort (Chiloscyphus pallescens) were among the plants that were most associated with presence of great crested newts. Plant diversity had a slightly more nested structure for ponds with great crested newts than for those without, which indicates a more homogeneous plant species assemblage in the former group of ponds. Overall, the results indicate that the great crested newt may be a reliable and useful indicator species for high plant species richness in ponds and small wetlands, which may be valuable for environmental monitoring and conservation in pond landscapes.

TI  - Effects of pollution on macroinvertebrates and water quality bio-assessment
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB  - Many large rivers in China have an inflow of contaminated water. Water pollution caused by urban sewage and agriculture, and occasionally pollution events from industries have become a significant stress on aquatic ecology. Pollution affects the biodiversity of the aquatic community and the species composition changes from natural species to tolerant species. The species composition of aquatic animals may reflect water pollution level. Extremely non-uniform distributions of functional feeding groups occurred as a result of high nutrient levels. A combination of chemical and biological methods constitutes the best approach for biological monitoring studies that measure water quality. Macroinvertebrates were used as bio-assessment indicator to determine the environmental quality of given water body. In this study, samples of water and macroinvertebrates were taken from several dozen sites in 14 rivers in China with different pollution levels, including the Yangtze, East, Weihe, Songhua, Yongding, and Panlong rivers. Macroinvertebrates were identified to genus or family level. Water samples were classified into different water quality grades according to the concentration of different substances. Five biological indices: taxa richness (S), density (D), total BMWQ score (t-BMWQ), average BMWQ score (a-BMWQ), and the family biotic index (FBI) were used for biological assessment of water quality. Analyzing macroinvertebrates' occurrence in different water quality levels, taxa-specific indicators, which are defined as the taxa of macroinvertebrates that live in a certain water quality level but do not exist in other water quality levels were proposed for water quality bio-assessment. Leptophlebiidae, Siphlonuridae, Arctopsychidae, Perlidae, and Antocha sp. are the taxa-specific indicators for very good or good water quality; Chironomidae, Lymnaeidae, Tubifex sp., Limnodrilus sp., Limnoperna lacustris, Corbicula sp., Macrobrachium sp., Planorbidae, Glossiphoniidae, and Branchiura sp. are the taxa-specific indicators for very poor water quality; and Psychomyiidae and Hydroptilidae are the taxa-specific indicators for moderate water quality.

TI  - Within- and Across-Species Responses of Plant Traits and Litter Decomposition to Elevation across Contrasting Vegetation Types in Subarctic Tundra
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Elevational gradients are increasingly recognized as a valuable tool for understanding how community and ecosystem properties respond to climatic factors, but little is known about how plant traits and their effects on ecosystem processes respond to elevation. We studied the response of plant leaf and litter traits, and litter decomposability across a gradient of elevation, and thus temperature, in subarctic tundra in northern Sweden for each of two contrasting vegetation types, heath and meadow, dominated by dwarf shrubs and herbaceous plants respectively. This was done at each of three levels; across species, within individual species, and the plant community using a community weighted average approach. Several leaf and litter traits shifted with increasing elevation in a manner consistent with greater conservation of nutrients at all three levels, and the most consistent response was an increase in tissue N to P ratio. However, litter decomposition was less directly responsive to elevation because the leaf and litter traits which were most responsive to elevation were not necessarily those responsible for driving decomposition. At the community level, the response to elevation of foliar and litter traits, and decomposability, varied greatly among the two vegetation types, highlighting the importance of vegetation type in determining ecological responses to climatic factors such as temperature. Finally our results highlight how understanding the responses of leaf and litter characteristics of functionally distinct vegetation types, and the processes that they drive, to temperature helps provide insights about how future climate change could affect tundra ecosystems.

TI  - SONDRA HALE'S "ETHNOGRAPHIC RESIDUALS" SILENCE AND NON-SILENCE ON FEMALE GENITAL CUTTING
T2  - JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EAST WOMENS STUDIES
AB  - Sondra Hale's self-imposed thirty years of silence on female circumcision broken in 1994 for her Ufahamu article and discussed in her chapter for Obioma Nnaemeka's Female Circumcision and the Politics of Knowledge (Praeger, 2005)-was grounded in her critique of the "residuals" of the ethnographic agenda. She argued that ethnography, particularly when addressing controversial practices, creates cultural difference rather than the generating solidarity for the struggles of women, such as the Sudanese struggles she studied. Hale recognized that the issue of female circumcision (or female genital cutting, FGC) was being co-opted by imperial discourses calling for civilizing the women in African, Arab, and Muslim societies what one might label a form of trafficking in women. Hale chose to decline to address the issue of female circumcision for many years, since her audiences so often found themselves unable to consider any other issue of the Sudanese women's struggles once they heard about FGC. In the face of this imperial discourse and the harm it has done, both to international alliances and to respect for feminist movements in their varying contexts, I utilize Hale's cautionary principles and several contemporary examples to reconsider how feminists from many loci might engage positively in the female circumcision controversy with something other than silence. In my view, silence is no longer an option, precisely for the reasons Hale waited to address FGC: to resist the imperialist discourse. In light of the escalating use of FGC in inflamed journalism, misplaced condemnations, and the continuing globalization of the movement for change, I argue we must not cede terrain to the arrogance of such voices, lest we find ourselves complicit with the conflagration undermining human dignity.

TI  - Dead trees and protected polypores in unmanaged north-temperate forest stands of Lithuania
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The availability of coarse woody debris (CWD) and distribution of dead trees into categories of mortality (dead standing, broken and uprooted) were investigated in north-temperate forests of central Europe (Lithuania). The studied area comprised 188.7 ha and included 18 different stands 40-130 years of age with a variety of tree species (spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.), aspen (Populus tremula L.), oak (Quercus robur L.), forest types (caricus-sphagnum, vaccinium-myrtillus, oxalis, myrtillus-oxalis, caricus-calamagrostis) and edaphic conditions (peaty, sandy, loamy soils of different moisture). The stands were excluded from wood 3 harvesting for at least 30 years. A total of 11 365 dead trees (over 10 cm in DBH) or 6160.7 m(3) of dead wood was found (60.2 trees/ha and 32.6 m(3) /ha). The volume of CWD per hectare was larger in older stands (r(S) = 0.78, P < 0.01). Tree mortality 3 during the last 2 years consisted of 482 trees and 381 m(3), or 1.28 trees/ha x year and 1.01 m(3) /ha x year. In 25-33% of cases it was wind-related. Uprooted and broken trees were of larger DBH than dead standing. The distribution into the categories of mortality was strongly dependent on tree species (chi-square test, d.f. = 10, P = 0). Dead standing dominated in CWD of pine and alder. Broken trees comprised almost a half in CWD of aspen, and about one-third in birch, alder and oak. Uprooting most often occurred in spruce, aspen and birch. Edaphic conditions and stand age had a pronounced impact on distribution into mortality categories for spruce (chi-square test, d.f. = 20, P < 0.00001) and pine (d.f. = 8, P less than or equal to 0.0003). On peat soil, only a minority of trees of both pine and spruce was uprooted, and standing dead prevailed. In CWD of spruce and pine, the proportions of both dead standing and broken decreased and that of uprooted trees increased on mineral soils of higher moisture and bulk density in older stands. By contrast, uprooting in birch and alder occurred less often on more wet sites, where the proportions of standing snags were higher. A total of 41 species of wood-decomposing polypores were found in the study area. Among those, 10 (24%) were of conservation value. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Marine Debris Floating in Arctic and Temperate Northeast Atlantic Waters
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Floating marine debris is ubiquitous in marine environments but knowledge about quantities in remote regions is still limited. Here, we present the results of an extensive survey of floating marine debris by experts, trained scientists from fields other than pollution or non-professional citizen scientists. A total of 276 visual ship-based surveys were conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the Northeast (NE) Atlantic from waters off the Iberian Peninsula to the Central Arctic, however, with a focus on Arctic waters. Spatiotemporal variations among regional seas (Central Arctic, Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, Norwegian Sea, North Sea) and oceanic regions (Arctic waters and the temperate NE Atlantic) were explored. The overall median debris concentration was 11 items km(-2), with considerable variability. The median concentration was highest in the North Sea with 19 items km(-2). The Nordic seas, except the Central Arctic showed median concentrations ranging from 9 to 13 items km(-2). Plastic accounted for 91% of all floating items. Miscellaneous fragments, films, ropes and nets, packaging materials, expanded polystyrene and straps were the most frequently observed plastic types. Although the median debris concentration in the Central Arctic was zero, this region was not entirely free of floating debris. The variations between regional seas and oceanic regions were statistically not significant indicating a continuous supply by a northward transportation of floating debris. The data show a slight annual decrease and clear seasonal differences in debris concentrations with higher levels observed during summer. A correlation between debris concentrations and environmental and spatial variables was found, explaining partly the variability in the observations. Pollution levels were 500 times lower than those recorded on the seafloor indicating the seafloor as a sink for marine debris. The Arctic was characterised by similar pollution levels as regions in temperate latitudes highlighting that Arctic ecosystems face threats from plastic pollution, which add to the effects of rapid climate change.

TI  - Developing environmental policy indicators by criteria - indicators on the public goods of the Swedish agricultural landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This paper presents a methodology for developing state indicators, reflecting the provision of environmental public goods from agricultural landscapes. The methodology involves a structured use of meta-criteria and criteria for developing indicator variables and indicators, along with a coherent set of indicators. These indicators are aimed at providing a basis for determining agri-environmental payments to farmers. They are estimated at the object level, that is, per field or field element, so payments can be set that lead to an efficient resource allocation, structure of incentives and production. We find that, according to the criteria assessments for the Swedish agri-environmental situation, it is best to use a set of seven composite indicators on arable fields, permanent grasslands, linear elements, point elements, forest edges, bio-rich trees and relics. By estimating the indicators in two case study areas, we show that environmental services vary considerably between objects, indicating that value-differentiated payments may work as an efficient instrument in practical policy making.

TI  - The effects of progress in genetics and management on intensities of greenhouse gas emissions from Norwegian pork production
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB  - The environmental sustainability of food production systems, including net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, is of increasing importance. In Norwegian pork production, animal performance is high in terms of reproduction, growth, and health. The development and use of an IPCC methodology-based model for estimating GHG emissions from pork production could be helpful in identifying the effects of progress in genetics and management. The objective was to investigate whether an IPCC methodology-based model was able to reflect the effects of the progress in genetics and management in pork production on the GHG emissions per kg carcass weight (CW). It is hypothesized that this progress has led to low GHG emissions intensities in Norwegian pork compared to global levels and that expected improvements will give a lasting reduction in GHG emissions intensities. A model 'HolosNorPork' for estimating net farm gate GHG emissions intensities was developed, including allocation procedures, at the pig production unit level. The model was run with pig production data from in average 632 farms from 2014 to 2019. The estimates include emissions of enteric and manure storage methane, manure storage nitrous oxide emissions, as well as GHG emissions from production and transportation of purchased feeds, and direct and indirect GHG emissions caused by energy use in pig-barns. The model was able to estimate the effects on net GHG emissions intensities from pork production on the basis of production characteristics. The estimated net GHG emissions intensity was found to have decreased from on average 2.49 to 2.34 kg CO2 eq. kg- 1 CW over the investigated period. For 2019 the net GHG emission for the one-third lower performing farms was estimated to 2.56 kg CO2 eq. kg- 1 CW, whereas for the one-third medium and one-third best performing farms the estimates were 2.36 and 2.16 kg CO2 eq. kg- 1 CW, respectively. The net GHG emissions intensity for pork carcasses from boars was estimated to be 2.07 kg CO2 eq. kg- 1 CW. For the health regimes investigated, Conventional and Specific-Pathogen Free (SPF), the estimated GHG emissions intensities for 2019 were 2.37 and 2.24 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 CW, respectively. The effects on net GHG emissions intensities of breeding and management measures were estimated to be profound, and this progress in pig production systems contributes to an on-going strengthening of pork as a sustainable source for human food supply.

TI  - Investigating everyday measures through exploratory talk: whole class plenary intervention and landscape study at grade four
T2  - CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB  - We report an exploratory talk based, whole class plenary intervention, in relation to students' understanding of everyday measures and measurement, in a grade four classroom at a grade 4-6 school in Sweden. Extended, project related, teacher-researcher collaboration forms basis for such cultural historical activity theory or CHAT based efforts. As formative intervention, the conduct of the plenary is not pre-determined but embedded in ongoing curricular realities, with the agency of students and teacher promoted, pedagogical ideas reutilised and the role of researcher viewed as supporting design and growth of the intervention. Under Charlotta's guidance as teacher, the plenary is opportunity for her students to examine improbable scenarios such as, Can Eva and Anton measure the length of Sweden on foot, Can Lars and Iris measure their age in decimeters. A zone of proximal development is created, in which students make the transition from spontaneous to scientific concepts and learn how various units of measurement are objects-that-can-be-used-for-certain-purposes. With opportunity for critical and reflective inquiry, in a plenary designed to lead development, Charlotta's students look beyond the making of rote measurements and articulate a theory of measure in nascent terms. Such a landscape of teaching-learning is finally understood in terms of the nature of talk that was facilitated, the manner of pedagogy utilised, the style of teaching exercised and the kind of learning that was demanded of her students.

TI  - The productivity of mixed mountain forests comprised of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>, <i>Picea abies</i>, and <i>Abies alba</i> across Europe
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Mixed mountain forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst), and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) cover a total area of more than 10 million hectares in Europe. Due to altitudinal zoning, these forests are particularly vulnerable to climate change. However, as little is known about the long-term development of the productivity and the adaptation and mitigation potential of these forest systems in Europe, reliable information on productivity is required for sustainable forest management. Using generalized additive mixed models this study investigated 60 long-term experimental plots and provides information about the productivity of mixed mountain forests across a variety of European mountain areas in a standardized way for the first time. The average periodic annual volume increment (PAI) of these forests amounts to 9.3 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1). Despite a significant increase in annual mean temperature the PAI has not changed significantly over the last 30 years. However, at the species level, we found significant changes in the growth dynamics. While beech had a PAI of 8.2 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1) over the entire period (1980-2010), the PAI of spruce dropped significantly from 14.2 to 10.8 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1), and the PAI of fir rose significantly from 7.2 to 11.3 m(3)ha(-1)y(-1). Consequently, we observed stable stand volume increments in relation to climate change.

TI  - Empirical application of the multi-level perspective: tracing the history of ground-source heat pumps systems in Finland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY-SCIENCE PRACTICE AND POLICY
AB  - The emergence and evolution of more sustainable technologies and related industrial fields is a core concern for sustainability transitions scholars. This interest is accentuated as it has become evident that the upscaling of transition-relevant technologies follows different pathways in varying national and geographic contexts. The usual research approach to studying such industry-field dynamics in particular contexts has been to use the technological innovation systems (TIS) framework, focusing on the emergence of functioning TISs. The current calls for life-cycle TIS and the few existing examples of operationalizing the multi-level perspective (MLP) in a more focused way underscore the need to better account for the contextual specifics, contingencies, and later phases in the proliferation of transition technologies. We elaborate on the benefits of using the MLP in long-term analyses of transition technologies by examining the history of ground-source heat pump (GSHP) systems in Finland from the era of the energy crises in the 1970s until the present day. The investigation reveals how the present success of GSHPs has not followed just from simple innovation-system dynamics or niche-regime landscape relations but is also a result of variations and extent of landscape pressure as well as unplanned support from neighboring niche technologies.

TI  - Broad-Scale Climate Influences on Spring-Spawning Herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>, L.) Recruitment in the Western Baltic Sea
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Climate forcing in complex ecosystems can have profound implications for ecosystem sustainability and may thus challenge a precautionary ecosystem management. Climatic influences documented to affect various ecological functions on a global scale, may themselves be observed on quantitative or qualitative scales including regime shifts in complex marine ecosystems. This study investigates the potential climatic impact on the reproduction success of spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in the Western Baltic Sea (WBSS herring). To test for climate effects on reproduction success, the regionally determined and scientifically well-documented spawning grounds of WBSS herring represent an ideal model system. Climate effects on herring reproduction were investigated using two global indices of atmospheric variability and sea surface temperature, represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), respectively, and the Baltic Sea Index (BSI) which is a regional-scale atmospheric index for the Baltic Sea. Moreover, we combined a traditional approach with modern time series analysis based on a recruitment model connecting parental population components with reproduction success. Generalized transfer functions (ARIMAX models) allowed evaluating the dynamic nature of exogenous climate processes interacting with the endogenous recruitment process. Using different model selection criteria our results reveal that in contrast to NAO and AMO, the BSI shows a significant positive but delayed signal on the annual dynamics of herring recruitment. The westward influence of the Siberian high is considered strongly suppressing the influence of the NAO in this area leading to a higher explanatory power of the BSI reflecting the atmospheric pressure regime on a North-South transect between Oslo, Norway and Szczecin, Poland. We suggest incorporating climate-induced effects into stock and risk assessments and management strategies as part of the EU ecosystem approach to support sustainable herring fisheries in the Western Baltic Sea.

TI  - On the Swedish Road to Becoming a Professional Practitioner in Sport and Exercise Psychology: Students' Views, Hopes, Dreams, and Worries
T2  - SPORT PSYCHOLOGIST
AB  - The field of sport and exercise psychology (SEP) has experienced a steady growth, and the professional practice and training of students has evolved over that time. Based on 2 past studies, the purpose was to describe a 2015 cohort of SEP students' hopes, dreams, and worries about the future. The authors performed a thematic content analysis of essays from undergraduate students based on cohorts from 1995, 2005, and 2015. The results showed that the most recent students expressed more worries about the current situation in relation to perceptions about the future of their potential professional practice than the past groups. Four tendencies for the future emerged: continued development of applied sport psychology, increased interdisciplinary exchange and integration, inclusion of exercise and health as a vital part of the field, and increased acceptance of cultural variations. Implications for future professional practice and training in SEP are discussed.

TI  - Trialing a Road Lane to Bicycle Path RedesignChanges in Travel Behavior with a Focus on Users' Route and Mode Choice
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Redistribution of space from private motorized vehicles to sustainable modes of transport is gaining popularity as an approach to alleviate transport problems in many cities around the world. This article investigates the impact of a trial Complete Streets project, in which road space is reallocated to bicyclists and pedestrians in Trondheim, Norway. The paper focuses on changes in the travel behavior of users of the street, with a focus on route and mode choice. In total, 719 people responded to a web-based travel survey, which also encompassed an integrated mapping Application Programming Interface (API). Amongst the findings of the survey is that the average length of the trial project that was utilized by cyclists on their most common journey through the neighborhood nearly doubled from 550 m to 929 m (p < 0.0005), suggesting that the intervention was highly attractive to bicyclists. Respondents were also asked whether they believe the trial project was positive for the local community, with the majority (87%) being positive or highly positive to the change. The intervention had a considerable impact on users' travel behavior in terms of both frequency and choice of active transportation modes, together with leading to a change in route preferences.

TI  - Consensus in landscape preference judgements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This study explores three possible explanations to account for variability in preference judgements for particular landscape scenes. Variance is examined and discussed in relation to the level of preference/scenic quality, in relation to possible group differences, and in relation to mental representations of the landscape type in the visual stimuli. The scenes in the study are from a specific, marketed and positively loaded landscape type, the farmland grasslands in the Swedish traditional cultural landscape. It is suggested that a strong commonly shared mental representation exists for this landscape type, resulting in quick and holistic judgements of preference and high consensus for scenes judged as good examples of this landscape type. An effect of scenic quality on variability was also found with results showing higher consensus for the high preference landscapes than for the low preference landscapes. However, this effect is possibly connected to the positive image of the landscape type pasture. No effect was found of group differences in responses accounting for the variability.

TI  - Ultrasound for diagnosing acute salpingitis: a prospective observational diagnostic study
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - What are the diagnostic benefits of using ultrasound in patients with a clinical suspicion of acute salpingitis and signs of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?
   In patients with a clinical suspicion of acute salpingitis, the absence of bilateral adnexal masses at ultrasound decreases the odds of mild-to-severe acute salpingitis about five times, while the presence of bilateral adnexal masses increases the odds about five times.
   PID is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are often subtle and mild. The diagnosis is usually based on clinical findings, and these are unspecific. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound with regard to salpingitis have been reported in one study (n 30) of appropriate design, where most patients had severe salpingitis (i.e. pyosalpinx) or tubo-ovarian abscess.
   This diagnostic test study included 52 patients fulfilling the clinical criteria of PID. Patients were recruited between October 1999 and August 2008.
   The patients underwent a standardized transvaginal gray scale and Doppler ultrasound examination by one experienced sonologist (index test) before diagnostic laparoscopy by a laparoscopist blinded to the ultrasound results. The final diagnosis was determined by laparoscopy, histology of the endometrium and other histology where relevant (reference standard).
   Of the 52 patients, 23 (44) had a final diagnosis unrelated to genital infection, while the other 29 had cervicitis (n 3), endometritis (n 9) or salpingitis (n 17; mild n 4, moderate n 8, severe, i.e. pyosalpinx n 5). Bilateral adnexal masses and bilateral masses lying adjacent to the ovary were seen more often on ultrasound in patients with salpingitis than with other diagnoses (bilateral adnexal masses: 82 versus 17, i.e. 14/17 versus 6/35, P 0.000, positive likelihood ratio 4.8, negative likelihood ratio 0.22; bilateral masses adjacent to ovary: 65 versus 17, i.e.11/17 versus 6/35, P 0.001, positive likelihood ratio 3.8, negative likelihood ratio 0.42). In cases of salpingitis, the masses lying adjacent to the ovaries were on average 23 cm in diameter, solid (n 14), unilocular cystic (n 4), multilocular cystic (n 3) or multilocular solid (n 1), with thick walls and well vascularized at colour Doppler. In no case were the cogwheel sign or incomplete septae seen. All 13 cases of moderate or severe salpingitis were diagnosed with ultrasound (detection rate 100, 95 confidence interval 78100) compared with 1 of 4 cases of mild salpingitis. Three of six cases of appendicitis, and two of two ovarian cysts were correctly diagnosed with ultrasound, and one case of adnexal torsion was suspected and then verified at laparoscopy.
   The sample size is small. This is explained by difficulties with patient recruitment. There are few cases of mild salpingitis, which means that we cannot estimate with any precision the ability of ultrasound to detect very early salpingitis. The proportion of cases with salpingitis of different grade affects the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound, and the sensitivity and specificity that we report here are applicable only to patient populations similar to ours.
   The information provided by transvaginal ultrasound is likely to be of help when deciding whether or not to proceed with diagnostic laparoscopy in patients with symptoms and signs suggesting PID and, if laparoscopy is not performed, to select treatment and plan follow-up.
   This work was supported by funds administered by Malm University Hospital and two Swedish governmental grants (ALF-medel and Landstingsfinansierad Regional Forskning). The authors have no conflict of interest.

TI  - <i>"And now I'm free</i>': Women's empowerment and emancipation through entrepreneurship in Saudi Arabia and Sweden
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Critical perspectives have called for the study of women's entrepreneurship as a route to social change. This social turn' claims women are empowered and/or emancipated through entrepreneurship with limited problematisation of how these interchangeably used concepts operate. Using an institutional perspective in combination with a narrative approach, we investigate women entrepreneurs' life stories on their road to freedom' where entrepreneurial activity enables them to break free' from particular gendered constraints. Through juxtaposing women's narratives in the contexts of Saudi Arabia and Sweden, the relationship between empowerment and emancipation is disentangled and (re)conceptualised. The findings distinguish between empowerment narrated as individual practices to achieve freedom for the self within institutional structures and emancipation as narrated as a wish to challenge and change structures of power and reach collative freedom. The yearning for collective emancipation propels women's stories of entrepreneurship by raising expectations for entrepreneurship as a vehicle for institutional change. Such stories may fascinate and inspire others to engage in entrepreneurial endeavours to become empowered, but whether they reach emancipation remains an empirical question to be answered. The performative dimension of entrepreneurial narratives is, however, their ability to turn emancipation into an (un)reachable object of desire, with a quest for even more individual empowerment and entrepreneurial activity, at the same time excluding other forms of human conduct as conducive for change.

TI  - Big data driven multi-tier architecture for electric mobility as a service in smart cities A design science approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY SECTOR MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose
   Electric mobility as a service (eMaaS) is suggested as a possible solution to ease transportation and lessen environmental issues by providing a collaborative transport sharing infrastructure that is based on electric vehicles (EVs) such as electric cars, electric bicycles and so on. Accordingly, this study aims to propose a multi-tier architecture to support the collection, processing, analytics and usage of mobility data in providing eMaaS within smart cities. The architecture uses application programming interfaces to enable interoperability between different infrastructures required for eMaaS and allow multiple partners to exchange and share data for making decision regarding electric mobility services.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Design science methodology based on a case study by interview was used to collect data from an infrastructure company in Norway to verify the applicability of the proposed multi-tier architecture.
   Findings
   Findings suggest that the architecture offers an approach for collecting, aggregating, processing and provisioning of data originating from sources to improve electric mobility in smart cities. More importantly, findings from this study provide guidance for municipalities and policymakers in improving electric mobility services. Moreover, the author's findings provide a practical data-driven mobility use case that can be used by transport companies in deploying eMaaS in smart cities.
   Social implications
   This study proposes the deployment of electric mobility to address increased usage of vehicles, which contributes to pollution of the environment that has a serious effect on citizen's quality of life.
   Originality/value
   This study proposes a multi-tier architecture that stores, processes, analyze and provides data and related services to improve electric mobility within smart cities. The multi-tier architecture aims to support and increase eMaaS operation of EVs toward improving transportation services for city transport operators and citizens for sustainable transport and mobility system.

TI  - Sustainability Analysis of Competition in Public Transport Systems: A Comparative Case Study in Hungary and Finland
T2  - PERIODICA POLYTECHNICA-CIVIL ENGINEERING
AB  - Ongoing competition between bus and railway systems in European (especially in the middle, south and east part) regional passenger transport is a current problem. Long term sustainability and efficiency in passenger transport requires a balanced transport policy. These subsectors need to be complement each other, not compete. The parallel bus and railway links can result in a competition. This research explores solutions to this issue for long term environmental and economic sustainability optimization. Some of the important factors include the number of inhabitants to be served, public transport availability, and efficiency in time of travel for vehicles and passengers. To ensure long term sustainability of the presented methodology, the effect of interventions was analyzed. The study compares Finland and Hungary in terms of the competition regional railway and bus links.

TI  - Infra-red thermometry of alpine landscapes challenges climatic warming projections
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Rough mountain terrain offers climatic conditions (niches) to plants and animals poorly represented by conventional climate station data. However, the extent to which actual temperatures deviate from those of the freely circulating atmosphere had never been assessed at a landscape level. Here, we quantify thermal life conditions across topographically rich mountain terrain by using a combination of thermal (IR) imagery of surface temperature with data from a large number of miniature data loggers buried at 3 cm soil depth. The data obtained from six alpine (Alps) and arctic-alpine slopes (Norway, Sweden, Svalbard) evidence persistent root zone temperatures of 2-4 K above air temperature during summer. Surface temperatures show strong positive (2-9 K) and negative (3-8 K) deviations from air temperature on bright days and clear nights, respectively. As to be expected, south oriented slopes are warmer than west and north slopes but microclimatic variation on clear sky days was strong within all slopes, with 8.4 +/- 2.5 K (mean +/- SD) surface temperature differences persisting over several hours per day along horizontal (i.e., equal elevation) transects. Life conditions of alpine organisms are thus strongly decoupled from conditions in the free atmosphere and cannot reliably be inferred from climate station data in both, temperate and arctic latitudes. Microtopography can mimic temperature differences of large elevational (or latitudinal) gradients over very short horizontal distances. This is important in the context of climate change because it shows that species do not necessarily need to climb several hundred meters in elevation to escape the warmth. Quite often, few meters of horizontal shift will do. For plants unable to, or too slow to adapt to a warmer climate, thermal microhabitat mosaics offer both refuge habitats as well as stepping stones as atmospheric temperatures rise.

TI  - Historical cadastral maps as a tool for identifying key biotopes in the cultural landscape
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IV, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - 4th International Conference on Ecosystems and Sustainable Development
AB  - GIS was used to refine information from a cadastral map of a Western Norwegian farm and a supplementary written protocol, both from 1874, and to identify areas of meadow presumed to be species-rich. To do this, information on hay meadows of low production capacity and meadows with stony soil was extracted from the cadastral map. The cadastral map was transformed onto a modem coordinate system and linked with a vegetation survey carried out in 2002. This enabled us to investigate how far areas identified from the 1874 map coincided. with the meadow types existing today. The results reveal that 85% of the biologically most interesting hay meadows found in the area today coincide with areas identified as presumably interesting from the 1874 cadastral map. Information from the cadastral map and the protocol also make it possible to construct specific historical profiles for the different hay meadow types. These seem to be a good tool for differentiating between meadow types and explaining some of-the vegetation variation found today.

TI  - Travel patterns and environmental effects now and in the future:: implications of differences in energy consumption among socio-economic groups
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - Travel patterns among different socio-economic groups in Sweden are investigated. It is shown that elderly persons, persons with low incomes and women in general do not travel extensively. Middle-aged persons, persons with high incomes and men travel much farther. Cars are the dominant transportation mode for all population groups. Aeroplanes are used mostly by high-income earners and men, while public transportation is mostly used by young people and women. Energy consumption for the different travel patterns differs substantially. Men with high incomes consume the most energy, with 94 000 MJ during one year, while elderly women consume 12 000 MJ. When compared to a calculated sustainable level of energy consumption for travel, most population groups are in excess. The level for sustainable energy consumption is calculated based on an assumed global potential for renewable energy of 360 EJ per year, divided equally among the global population. A certain share of this energy potential is supposed to be used for travelling. A scenario for 2020 is presented in which vehicle energy efficiency has increased and travel patterns have changed from what they are today. Sustainability can only be reached when both travel patterns and vehicle technology have changed radically. Differences in energy consumption for travel due to age and gender are likely to remain in the future. Scientific knowledge from the social domains seems to be important for devising efficient strategies for a sustainable society. Current focus on policy measures has been mainly on technical issues.

TI  - Can home care work be organized to promote health among the workers while maintaining productivity? An investigation into stakeholders' perspectives on organizational work redesign concepts based on the Goldilocks Work principles
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundDue to the aging population, the need for home care services is increasing in most Western countries, including Norway. However, the highly physical nature of this job could contribute to make recruiting and retaining qualified home care workers (HCWs) challenging. This issue may be overcome by adopting the Goldilocks Work principles, aiming at promoting workers' physical health by determining a "just right" balance between work demands and recovery periods while maintaining productivity. The aim of this study was to 1) gather suggestions from home care employees on suitable organizational (re)design concepts for promoting HCWs' physical health and 2) have researchers and managers define actionable behavioral aims for the HCWs for each proposed (re)design concept and evaluate them in the context of the Goldilocks Work principles.MethodsHCWs, safety representatives, and operation coordinators (n = 14) from three Norwegian home care units participated in digital workshops led by a researcher. They suggested, ranked, and discussed redesign concepts aimed at promoting HCWs' health. The redesign concepts were subsequently operationalized and evaluated by three researchers and three home care managers.ResultsWorkshop participants suggested five redesign concepts, namely "operation coordinators should distribute work lists with different occupational physical activity demands more evenly between HCWs", "operation coordinators should distribute transportation modes more evenly between HCWs", "Managers should facilitate correct use of ergonomic aids and techniques", "HCWs should use the stairs instead of the elevator", and "HCWs should participate in home-based exercise training with clients". Only the first two redesign concepts were considered to be aligned with the Goldilocks Work principles. A corresponding behavioral aim for a "just right" workload was defined: reduce inter-individual differences in occupational physical activity throughout a work week.ConclusionsOperation coordinators could have a key role in health-promoting organizational work redesign based on the Goldilocks Work principles in home care. By reducing the inter-individual differences in occupational physical activity throughout a work week, HCWs' health may be improved, thus reducing absenteeism and increasing the sustainability of home care services. The two suggested redesign concepts should be considered areas for evaluation and adoption in practice by researchers and home care services in similar settings.

TI  - Corporate social responsibility in global supply chains
T2  - SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to present a conceptual framework for analysing CSR practices in global supply chains. It also seeks to demonstrate how a pioneering Swedish company, IKEA, implements and manages CSR practices at its suppliers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A case analysis of IKEA illustrates the implementation and management of CSR practices in supply chains. The focus is on internal and external integration of CSR practices in the supply chain. IKEA holds a leading position in its supply chain and is a global brand-owner. Personal interviews are performed with employees from one of the company's trading areas.
   Findings - Practising CSR in supply chains requires that CSR is embedded within the entire organisation, including subsidiaries abroad and offshore suppliers. It includes employee training and sharing of experience, training of key personnel at the supplier level, positive incentives for suppliers in the form of long-term contracts and enlarged purchasing orders, and regular auditing of suppliers' performance.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper focuses on CSR practices in a specific company's supply chain. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalised to other companies. Also, the practices have been studied from the perspective of the focal company.
   Practical implications - The CSR practices of IKEA can serve as inspiration for other companies that are considering adopting corporate codes of conduct.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a company that has a long tradition for working with environmental and social issues. The paper demonstrates how the actual management of CSR practices is determined by context-dependent factors.

TI  - CHANGE OF THE NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS IN NEEDLES, STEM BARK AND STEM WOOD OF CONIFERS DEPENDING ON THE SAMPLING POSITION WITHIN THE TREE
T2  - REPORTS OF FORESTRY RESEARCH-ZPRAVY LESNICKEHO VYZKUMU
AB  - Analyses of nutrient content and nutrient pools in trees and forest stand are important for monitoring and evaluation of nutrients cycling and its changes, for verification of long-term sustainability of forest management methods etc. The analyses are mostly based on samples of tree compartments (needles, leaves, branch and stem wood etc.) taken from sample trees. Nutrient concentrations in a tree compartment can vary according to the position where the sample was taken. The article aims to evaluate nutrient concentrations variability and impact of sampling position on the tree. One-year-old needles (blue spruce) and stem wood and bark (Norway spruce and Scotch pine) were analysed in detail. There was found a significantly negative correlation of whorl position in spruce crown and Ca and Mg concentrations in needles. The most representative concentrations to compute total nutrient pools in one-year-old needles of young stands can be expected in samples from the middle part of the live crown. Stem wood and bark of Norway spruce showed positive correlations of macronutrient concentrations and height above ground with exception of Ca, which was negative. In pine, the correlations were positive with exception of P in stem wood. Most accurate estimation of the mean nutrient concentrations of stem wood and bark of conifers should be based on samples originated in the end of the first third of stem height.

TI  - Supportive and demanding managerial circumstances and associations with excellent workability: a cross-sectional study of Swedish school principals
T2  - BMC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Background The leadership of principals is important for school, teacher and student related outcomes. To be capable of doing their work (i.e., having sufficient workability), school principals need proper organisational preconditions, motivation, and good health. It is therefore concerning that some studies suggest that principals have a work situation that risks taxing their health and reducing their workability. However, few studies have examined the psychosocial working conditions of principals and no study has gauged principals' workability. Accordingly, we decided to examine Swedish principals' workability and their perceptions of eight demanding and five supportive managerial circumstances as well as the associations between managerial circumstances and reports of excellent workability. Methods The participants comprised 2219 Swedish principals (78% women) who completed a cross-sectional web survey in 2018. A brief version of the Gothenburg Manager Stress Inventory (GMSI-Mini) gauged managerial circumstances. Workability was assessed with the workability score (0-10; WAS). Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations between managerial circumstances and reports of excellent workability (WAS >= 9). Covariates were: length of work experience as a principal, school level, self-rated health, and general self-efficacy. Results The results showed that circa 30% of the principals reported excellent workability. The GMSI-Mini results showed that role conflicts, resource deficits, and having to harbour co-workers' frustrations were the most frequently encountered managerial demands. Meanwhile, cooperating co-workers, supportive manager colleagues, and a supportive private life were the most supportive managerial circumstances. Adjusted logistic regression analyses showed that role conflicts and role demands were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting less than excellent workability. In contrast, supportive managerial colleagues, a supportive private life and supportive organisational structures were associated with an increased likelihood of reporting excellent workability. Conclusion Circa 30% of the participating principals perceived their workability to be excellent. Reducing role demands, clarifying the principals' areas of responsibility and accountability in relation to other actors in the governing chain (role conflicts), striving for increased role clarity, and striving to find ways to separate work and private life, seem to be promising intervention areas if increasing principals' workability is desired.

TI  - Examining drivers of sustainable consumption: The influence of norms and opinion leadership on electric vehicle adoption in Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Transportation accounts for a large and growing part of carbon dioxide emissions. With an increasing vehicle fleet worldwide private car use is becoming an acute problem in need of urgent attention and action. Policy interference and cleaner cars are not enough; alternative fuel vehicles such as electric vehicles need to be adopted by consumers as well. Previous research on pro-environmental consumer behavior and sustainable consumption has proven the importance of norms and pro-environmental attitudes. However, little research has focused on understanding interpersonal influence found influential in consumer behavior research relating to innovation adoption. Consumer opinion leading and opinion seeking are two such interpersonal influence attitudinal constructs that have not been empirically analyzed in relation to sustainable consumption and alternative fuel vehicles. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the influence of a set of attitudinal constructs on electric and flexfuel vehicle adoption: personal norms, social norms, ecological attitudes, opinion leading, and opinion seeking. Data from a questionnaire survey on three groups of electric vehicle adopters and non-adopters is used (N = 1192). The results confirm the importance of personal norms, opinion leading and opinion seeking in the three groups also when controlling for socio-demographic factors. The main contribution of this study is that it shows the importance of both interpersonal influence and attitudinal factors as drivers for eco-innovation adoption. The study also contributes in showing that electric vehicle and flexfuel vehicle adopters differ in relation to non-adopters on several factors. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - FOURTEENTH ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM ON EXPLOSIVES AND BLASTING RESEARCH
CP  - 14th Annual Symposium on Explosives and Blasting Research
AB  - U.S. Bureau of Mines Report of Investigation 8507 was published in 1980. In a comprehensive analysis of all known blast damage studies plus new definitive data, the USBM authors adopted new safe level criteria of 0.5 & 0.75 in/sec for the frequency range corresponding to structure resonances. These were 3 to 4 times lower than the existing limit of 2 in/sec and are the most restrictive scientifically-based blasting criteria for the prevention of threshold hairline cracks in homes. The Bureau's own tests involved 76 homes in six states. In USBM RI 8507, those tests were combined with data from nine other studies from the US, Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden in an overall conservative summary analysis intended to preclude blasting damage.
   Since the publication of RI 8507, the following additional work was either completed or found. These studies support the safe-level criteria in RI 8507 as protective of structures from all blasting damage:
   Cracking and responses from blast vibration:
   A four-site USBM study of response and damage from low-frequency vibrations
   A seven-part fatigue study by the USBM, which also involved two Universities (Northwestern and Drexel) and two other Federal science labs (Bureau of Standards and Corps of Engineers)
   Additional blasting damage studies in England (Leeds University) and India (Ctrl. Mining Res. Station)
   An extensive study of structure responses from sonic booms by the FAA
   Natural and cultural stresses on homes:
   14 Reports or studies of weather-induced stresses from temperature & humidity
   9 Reports of soils, water and slope effects on foundations and pavements
   3 Reports which describe vibrations in homes from inside activities
   3 Reports related to construction characteristics
   The RI's criteria have been variously challenged in the 17 years since publication. Initial concerns were from industry, believing them to be too restrictive and not justified. More recently, claims have been made in courts, permit hearings, and by legislators that they are not protective enough. Technical reasons are sometimes given, but, all real issues such as low frequencies, fatigue, and preexisting strains, have been examined. The remaining concerns arise from cases of large numbers of claims and complaints from organized citizen groups. These are issues of perceptibility and attitude. Based on the science and all objective measures, the criteria in RI 8507 are still believed to represent appropriate, if not conservative, guidance for the prevention of threshold cosmetic cracking in homes.

TI  - Dynamic exposure and body burden models for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) enable management of food safety risks in cattle
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - With increasing global focus on planetary boundaries, food safety and quality, the presence of per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the food chain presents a challenge for the sustainable production and supply of quality assured food. Consumption of food is the primary PFAS exposure route for the general population. At contaminated sites, PFAS have been reported in a range of agricultural commodities including cattle. Consumer exposure assessments are complicated by the lack of validated modelling approaches to estimate PFAS bio-accumulation in cattle. Previous studies have shown that PFAS bioaccumulation in livestock is influenced by environmental, spatial and temporal factors that necessitate a dynamic modelling approach.This work presents an integrated exposure and population toxicokinetic (PopTK) model for cattle that esti-mates serum and tissue concentrations of PFAS over time. Daily exposures were estimated from intakes of water, pasture, and soil, and considered animal growth, seasonal variability (pasture moisture content and temperature) and variable PFAS concentrations across paddocks. Modelled serum and tissue estimates were validated against monitoring data from Australian and Swedish cattle farms. The models were also used to develop and test practical management options for reducing PFAS exposure and to prioritise remediation for farms. Model outputs for exposure management scenarios (testing cattle rotation and targeted supplementation of feed and water) showed potential for marked reductions in consumer exposures from cattle produce.

TI  - Bio-CCS: feasibility comparison of large scale carbon-negative solutions
T2  - 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES, GHGT-12
CP  - 12th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT)
AB  - The urgency to stabilize the global temperature rise at 2 degrees C as highlighted in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report calls for solutions that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Achieving negative CO2 emissions by removing CO2 from the atmosphere is possible by applying carbon capture in processes using biomass (Bio-CCS). Biomass has the capability of withdrawing and storing atmospheric CO2. As a result, CO2 released during biomass combustion can be captured and stored permanently underground, thus depriving the atmosphere of CO2.
   The objective of this paper is to assess the background for most rational deployment opportunities of Bio-CCS from climate and economic point of view; to evaluate what is the best way to use constrained biomass resources by assessing the effects that raw materials types, different processes and end products have on carbon stocks and on the overall GHG mitigation from the global perspective. A concrete example on how more thorough deployment of Bio-CCS could penetrate in near-term markets is given as a Finnish Bio-CCS roadmap with scenarios highlighting the bottlenecks and constrains. The roadmap assessment is based on power plant, industrial plant and emission database calculations with future projections for existing installations.
   The technical implementation of Bio-CCS in different industrial sectors goes hand in hand with the development of conventional CCS technology deployment. In general, similar solutions are suitable for capturing CO2 from biomass applications as for fossil fuels. The main differences relate to the size and the location of emission sources (biomass-based installations are often decentralized and of smaller scale compared to fossil-based installations) or to the different kind of impurities in the combustion process, ash and flue gas. However, no principal technical restrictions to the capture of biogenic CO2 exist in energy generation applications or industrial processes. As a consequence, certain Bio-CCS applications are low-hanging fruits for near future deployment of carbon capture assuming that negative emissions are accounted for.
   In this paper the potential technologies for Bio-CCS and the feasibility of some solutions are compared both from a sustainability and cost point of view. There are four major biomass conversion routes where Bio-CCS is applicable; biochemical conversion (fermentation and hydrolysis), thermo-chemical conversion (e.g. gasification), power production (gasification and combustion) and industrial processes. In addition to ethanol fermentation the thermo-chemical biomass conversion processes are considered the first-phase targets for applying capture of CO2, both from a logistic and cost point of view.
   The main Bio-CCS technologies assessed in this study are Fischer-Tropsch diesel production, bio-SNG production, lignocellulosic ethanol production, torrefaction and biomass based power production such as co-firing biomass in a coal-based condensing power plant and biomass-based CHP (combined heat and power) production. The most applicable industry sector for introduction of Bio-CCS is obviously pulp and paper industry but some potential exists also in cement industry, iron and steel industry and oil and gas refineries.
   The emission reduction potential in different technologies is very much bound to the scale of installations which again is generally limited by the scale of technologies and availability of biomass raw material. The biggest reduction potential for the studied cases per industrial site can take place in iron and steel industry (similar to 3 Mt/a), pulp and paper industry (similar to 1.3 Mt/a) and in combined heat power (CHP) production (similar to 2.5 Mt/a) as opposed to straw ethanol production of smaller scale (similar to 0.1 Mt/a). However, the CO2 avoidance potential per unit of biomass raw material utilized is highest in co-firing (20tCO(2)/toe), iron and steel industry (10tCO(2)/toe) and in CHP production (8tCO(2)/toe) whereas straw ethanol has lowest potential also in this category (1.5tCO(2)/toe). The cost estimations show a theoretical economic advantage of Bio-CCS over fossil CCS on carbon prices when the carbon sink effect is accounted for. The total costs for Bio-CCS vary from 35(sic)/ton to 300(sic)/ton CO2 stored depending on the technology.
   As the potential of Bio-CCS is bound to the availability and usage of biomass raw materials, the sustainability of the raw materials is of essence. The current biomass flows and potentials set the initial limits for the wider deployment of Bio-CCS. Efficient utilization of constrained resources is an essential question, when the target is to optimize the impact on the system level, from the society point of view. The ultimate objective is to suggest whether deployment of CCS has the desired impact on the atmospheric CO2 concentration. As biomass can be used in many ways, the primary purpose of utilization and products containing biogenic carbon also adds up to this. When biomass is utilized for products other than energy, the impact to environment and economy differs. The opportunities with these solutions, realistic potential and the main threats related to Bio-CCS are discussed in the light of sustainability and economic potential. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Lasius niger (Linnaeus 1758) is redescribed on the basis of 132 nest samples; a female specimen from S Sweden is determined as neotype.  Lasius platythorax n. sp. is described as new on the basis of 134 nest samples.  The morphological differences of Lasius niger and platythorax n. sp. are very distinct throughout the studied territories.  Using character combinations of weighted pronotal and gular hair length and clypeal pubescence distance in the female and of relative mesosoma height and clypeal pubescence distance in the female, it was possible to determine each individual in the whole material.  L. niger and platythorax are both widely distributed, but there is a very strong habitat segregation in Central Europe.  L. niger prefers moderately xerothermous cultural habitats and has a strong synanthropic trend.  L. platythorax is characteristic for different kinds of woodland, bogs and fens and avoids urban habitats.  At the rare spots of syntopic occurrence, clear differences in the mode of nest construction are observed:  L. niger is preferentially a digger and above-ground constructor with mineralic soil particles, while L. platythorax is more an excavator of various preformed organic spaces.  L. niger may reach much higher nest densities than platythorax and prefers habitats with lower soil moisture.  There is no evidence that the Palaerctic taxa alienoniger, grandis, transylvanica, flavescens, emeryi, nitidus, nigrescens, pilicornis, minimus, sakagamii, hayashi, japonicus and coloratus could be synonyms of platythorax n. sp.

TI  - Summer movements, predation and habitat use of wolves in human modified boreal forests
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Grey wolves (Canis lupus), formerly extirpated in Finland, have recolonized a boreal forest environment that has been significantly altered by humans, becoming a patchwork of managed forests and clearcuts crisscrossed by roads, power lines, and railways. Little is known about how the wolves utilize this impacted ecosystem, especially during the pup-rearing summer months. We tracked two wolves instrumented with GPS collars transmitting at 30-min intervals during two summers in eastern Finland, visiting all locations in the field, identifying prey items and classifying movement behaviors. We analyzed preference and avoidance of habitat types, linear elements and habitat edges, and tested the generality of our results against lower resolution summer movements of 23 other collared wolves. Wolves tended to show a strong preference for transitional woodlands (mostly harvested clearcuts) and mixed forests over coniferous forests and to use forest roads and low use linear elements to facilitate movement. The high density of primary roads in one wolf's territory led to more constrained use of the home territory compared to the wolf with fewer roads, suggesting avoidance of humans; however, there did not appear to be large differences on the hunting success or the success of pup rearing for the two packs. In total, 90 kills were identified, almost entirely moose (Alces alces) and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus sspp.) calves of which a large proportion were killed in transitional woodlands. Generally, wolves displayed a high level of adaptability, successfully exploiting direct and indirect human-derived modifications to the boreal forest environment.

TI  - Electric cars as a path to sustainable travel behaviour: Insights from Nord-Jæren
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This study examines whether promoting electric cars (EVs) to achieve greener mobility undermines the efforts to reduce car use. It specifically explores the concept of moral licensing, wherein individuals use EVs as a way to feel good about their environmental impact while continuing to drive. The study uses travel data (n = 1223) from Nord-J AE ren, Norway, to develop a Structural Equation Model (SEM) that explores the relationship between environmental beliefs, attitudes, and travel behaviour (i.e., use of conventional car, electric car, bus, and bicycle). The results confirm that pro-environmental beliefs have a "spillover effect" on EV use due to existing car attitudes. The relative convenience of the car over alternative options has been found to be the most important mitigating factor in the influence of environmental beliefs on behaviour. Consequently, to reduce car use and promote more sustainable travel options, it is essential to simultaneously improve these alternatives while restricting car traffic.

TI  - Green wastewater treatment technology for agritourism business in Romania
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
AB  - This article describes the first implementation of green treatment technology for wastewater from agritourism facilities in Romania. The general concept was based on the principles of a nature-based treatment system (NBTS) developed, tested and successfully operated in cold climate in Norway. Two NBTSs, each constituting a three-element system equipped with a septic tank, a pre-treatment section and a filter/wetland bed, were constructed and set in full operation in Mara and Vadu Izei villages (Maramures County, Northern Romania, Carpathian Mountains). Both systems revealed sufficient adaptation to wastewater treatment during the first year of operation. The highest removal rates of BOD5, CODCr, N-tot and P-tot reached 93-97%, 94-98%, 97-98% and 98-99%, respectively. In addition, these parameters did not exceed their permitted values in effluents discharged to water bodies. Both systems demonstrate integrated measures of ecological engineering implemented as "treatment gardens" perfectly suited to the tourist facilities, rural surroundings and cultural landscape of the region.

TI  - Person and Family Centeredness in Ethiopian Cancer Care: Proposal for a Project for Improving Communication, Ethics, Decision Making, and Health
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Cancer is a major burden in Ethiopia. The Oncology Department of Tikur Anbessa (Black Lion) Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa is the sole specialist unit for cancer care in the country. With only a handful of oncologists, a lack of resources, and a huge patient load, the work is challenging, especially in terms of achieving effective and ethical patient consultations. Patients, usually accompanied by family members, often wait for a long time to receive medical attention and frequently depart without treatment. Handling consultations effectively is essential to help patients as much as possible within such limitations.
   Objective: The project has the following three main aims: (1) to enhance and expand the understanding of communicative and associated ethical challenges in Ethiopian cancer care; (2) to enhance and expand the understanding of the implications and use of person- and family-centered solutions to address such communicative challenges in practice; and (3) to plan and evaluate interventions in this area.
   Methods: This project develops and consolidates a research collaboration to better understand and mitigate the communicative challenges in Ethiopian cancer care, with a focus on the handling and sharing of decision making and ethical tension among patients, staff, and family. Using theoretical models from linguistics, health communication, and health care ethics, multiple sources of data will be analyzed. Data sources currently include semistructured interviews with Ethiopian staff (n=16), patients (n=54), and family caregivers (n=22); survey data on cancer awareness (n=150) and attitudes toward breaking bad news (n=450); and video recordings of medical consultations (n=45). In addition, we will develop clinical and methodological solutions to formulate educational interventions.
   Results: The project was awarded funding by the Swedish Research Council in December 2017 for the period 2018 to 2021. The research ethics boards in Sweden and Ethiopia approved the project in May 2018. The results of the studies will be published in 2020 and 2021.
   Conclusions: The project is the first step toward providing unique and seminal knowledge for the specific context of Ethiopia in the areas of physician-patient communication research and ethics. It contributes to the understanding of the complexity of the role of family and ethical challenges in relation to patient involvement and decision making in Ethiopia. Improved knowledge in this area can provide a fundamental model for ways to improve cancer care in many other low-resource settings in Africa and the Middle East, which share central cultural prerequisites, such as a strong patriarchal family structure, along with strong and devout religiosity. The project will also serve to develop greater understanding about the current challenges in Western health systems associated with greater family and patient participation in decision making. In addition, the project will contribute to improving the education of Ethiopian health professionals working in cancer care by developing a training program to help them better understand and respond to identified challenges associated with communication.

TI  - Sharing costs in Swedish road ownership associations
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - Usually transport systems, and roads in particular, are viewed as public goods. However, this is not always the case. In Sweden a large part of the road system is privately owned. Most of these privately owned roads are rural roads used by farmers and summer cottage owners, or used for forest transport. These roads are mainly provided by ownership associations.
   An important difference between public roads and these privately owned roads is that all investments- and maintenance decisions are made by the users themselves, who also have to pay the costs, whereas the usual case is that the owners/providers of a road-system are different agents than the users. Here the question is not how to charge the roads but how to split the costs of the roads among the users in an efficient and "fair" way.
   The motivation of this paper is the practical problem of how such an ownership association can divide the costs for the road network among the members in an efficient and "fair" way. The problem is treated from a game theoretical point of view, making use of the Shapley value. This means that the problem is associated with a game - a mathematical representation of the conflict situation. The Shapley value is a very important solution concept for cooperative games, like the game in this case. For games corresponding to this specific type of problems, it is shown that the Shapley value has excellent properties, such as beeing an element of the core, and beeing very easy to compute.

TI  - GENETIC DIVERSITY OF <i>Picea orientalis</i> (L.) LINK POPULATIONS IN TURKEY
T2  - SUMARSKI LIST
AB  - Knowledge of genetic variation is needed to understanding the genetic structure in forest tree populations. In addition, the determination of the genetic structure in the natural distribution areas of forest trees has become easier depending on the development of the isoenzyme technique. Determining the genetic structure and variations of Picea orientalis (L.) Link, which is limited local natural distribution areas on the world, transfer of this genetic to the future generations with sustainable forestry is important to ensure the continuity of the species. In this study, genetic differences and similarities were determined for P. orientalis populations in selected regions (Artvin, Torul-orumcek, Tirebolu-Akilbaba, Ordu-cambasi, Artvin-Savsat, Ardanuc-Ovacik, Savsat-Sahara, Artvin-Sacinka, Ardahan-Posof and Macka-Hamsikoy) in Turkey. In the study using 10 gene loci in different enzyme systems to determine the genetic variation, the values of heterozygosity (H-o), number of alleles per locus (A(L)), genetic diversity (v), intrapopulational differentiation (d(T)), multilocus diversity (V-gam) and differentiation among populations (Dj) were determined in these populations. The grand means were obtained as 0.154, 1.74 and 1.719 for the observed heterozygosity, alleles per locus and genetic diversity, respectively. Moreover, when the genetic diversity was considered, three different groups arose in terms of selected populations. Since Torul-orumcek population had relatively higher results in contrast to other populations, this population has high importance for sustainability of gene resource of oriental spruce.

TI  - Evaluating WorldClim Version 1 (1961-1990) as the Baseline for Sustainable Use of Forest and Environmental Resources in a Changing Climate
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - WorldClim version 1 is a high-resolution, global climate gridded dataset covering 1961-1990; a normal climate. It has been widely used for ecological studies thanks to its free availability and global coverage. This study aims to evaluate the quality of WorldClim data by quantifying any discrepancies by comparison with an independent dataset of measured temperature and precipitation records across Europe. BIO1 (mean annual temperature, MAT) and BIO12 (mean total annual precipitation, MAP) were used as proxies to evaluate the spatial accuracy of the WorldClim grids. While good representativeness was detected for MAT, the study demonstrated a bias with respect to MAP. The average difference between WorldClim predictions and climate observations was around +0.2 degrees C for MAT and -48.7 mm for MAP, with large variability. The regression analysis revealed a good correlation and adequate proportion of explained variance for MAT (adjusted R-2 = 0.856) but results for MAP were poor, with just 64% of the variance explained (adjusted R-2 = 0.642). Moreover no spatial structure was found across Europe, nor any statistical relationship with elevation, latitude, or longitude, the environmental predictors used to generate climate surfaces. A detectable spatial autocorrelation was only detectable for the two most thoroughly sampled countries (Germany and Sweden). Although further adjustments might be evaluated by means of geostatistical methods (i.e., kriging), the huge environmental variability of the European environment deeply stressed the WorldClim database. Overall, these results show the importance of an adequate spatial structure of meteorological stations as fundamental to improve the reliability of climate surfaces and derived products of the research (i.e., statistical models, future projections).

TI  - Testing mechanistic modeling to assess impacts of biomass removal
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
CP  - Symposium on Development and Applications of Decision Support Tools in Multiple Purpose Forest Management
AB  - The impacts that stand treatments have on carbon, nitrogen and water cycles is a key question relating the sustainability of forests to individual forest management decisions. While the response of the above ground carbon cycle may be relatively easy to measure and is well understood, e.g. volume growth response due to thinning, the impact of stand treatment and different harvesting scenarios on the water, and nutritional status of the remaining trees and site as well as on the below ground carbon and nitrogen cycle is much more difficult to assess due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable data. An alternative that eliminates the need for detailed site-specific data is to use existing models that were explicitly designed for studying biogeochemical processes. In this paper we test and evaluate the applicability of a species-specific mechanistic biogeochemical model to assess the impact of different harvesting scenarios after thinning. Data are available from 36 Norway spruce stands covering three regions each with three harvesting scenarios after thinning and four replications. The different harvesting scenarios applied are: (1) whole tree harvest, (2) whole tree harvest after one vegetation period, i.e. without needles, and (3) commercial stem wood harvest. The modeling results suggest that the variant 3 exhibited the highest growth efficiency, a measure of net carbon uptake or growth, versus all other harvesting methods. This is confirmed by the available field observations. Nitrogen, an indicator of nutrient supply, behaved similarly. The important exception was nitrogen plant uptake, which was lower immediately after thinning on the sites where the lowest amount of biomass was removed. Significant relationships exist between observed versus modeled stand volume and volume growth suggesting that mechanistic modeling is a suitable diagnostic tool for analyzing the impacts of different management practices and thus, such models can be efficiently used to enhance silvicultural decision-making.

TI  - Using the Conflicting Incentives Risk Analysis Method
T2  - SECURITY AND PRIVACY PROTECTION IN INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
CP  - 28th IFIP TC11 International Information Security and Privacy Conference (IFIP SEC)
AB  - Risk is usually expressed as a combination of likelihood and consequence but obtaining credible likelihood estimates is difficult. The Conflicting Incentives Risk Analysis (CIRA) method uses an alternative notion of risk. In CIRA, risk is modeled in terms of conflicting incentives between the risk owner and other stakeholders in regards to the execution of actions. However, very little has been published regarding how CIRA performs in non-trivial settings. This paper addresses this issue by applying CIRA to an Identity Management System (IdMS) similar to the eGovernment IdMS of Norway. To reduce sensitivity and confidentiality issues the study uses the Case Study Role Play (CSRP) method. In CSRP, data is collected from the individuals playing the role of fictitious characters rather than from an operational setting. The study highlights several risk issues and has helped in identifying areas where CIRA can be improved.

TI  - Towards sustainable energy culture in the industrial sector: introducing an interdisciplinary method for understanding energy culture in business industries
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Background There have been numerous research papers focusing on improving energy consumption and energy behaviour in domestic and residential contexts. However, workplaces and especially industry settings have gained less attention in scientific literature, even though the industry sector is one of the largest energy consumers in the world. This article introduces a methodological framework that utilizes the energy culture concept, to support understanding the factors that influence energy culture at business industry companies. Methods Building on the concept of energy culture, we introduce an interdisciplinary method, which assesses organizations' energy culture from different perspectives and recognizes the possibilities for sustainability transitions. To validate this method, the developed energy culture survey has been verified by 27 expert participants from different industry-related companies located in Finland, Italy, Switzerland, Germany France, and Austria. Results Our analysis highlights the need to consider diverse, interdisciplinary aspects to create a successful method for enhancing energy culture in the industrial sector. This will take into consideration human aspects, related to cognitive norms, beliefs, and aspirations, as well as to human interaction with the material world. Conclusions Industrial energy cultures context differs from domestic and residential contexts, and the knowledge from one context cannot be transferred to another context as such. Based on investigated studies undertaken for residential, office, and other sectors and the lessons learned, we developed a systematic method for energy culture understanding in industries. Energy managers may use it, as well as other individuals involved in energy culture issues in the industrial business sector, to evaluate the state of energy culture and engage employees towards new energy-related practices.

TI  - Review of reintroduction of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in tributaries of the Rhine River in the German Federal States of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY
CP  - International Workshop on the Restoration of Fish Populations
AB  - The reintroduction of Atlantic salmon in to tributaries of the Rhine River in the German Federal States of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse is implemented by the fisheries authorities of the two States (Lander). Stocking is conducted in Rhineland-Palatinate since 1994 and in Hesse since 1995. In phase I (19942003) various strains were tested in parallel. In phase II (since 2003/2004) only the Swedish Atran strain was imported. It was hypothesized that the strain Atran would perform particularly well because of a similar spawning time to the original stock of River Sieg and a comparable Multiple-Sea-Winter ratio to many original stocks in the Rhine River. Returning salmon were monitored annually since 1996 in Rhineland-Palatinate and since 2002 in Hesse. Between 1996 and 2008 a total of 533 returners were recorded in the two programmes, with 52.9% being males and 38.4% females (sex unknown: 8.7%). 2007 and 2008 yielded the highest ratio of Multiple-Sea-Winter (MSW) salmon so far. In 2008 74% of the individuals with known length had spent two or more winter in the sea, thus raising the average length to 80.3 cm. Overall trends show an increase in the total number of recordings and MSW salmon ratio, together with an increase of mean length correlated with the latter. The percentage of female MSW returners increased by 1077% compared to 2007. Until 2008 natural reproduction was recorded in five river systems (total: 11 streams). In 2008 reproduction was demonstrated in 11 tributaries, an increase of three compared to 2007. The density of juvenile 0+ salmon found in immediate vicinity of several spawning sites in the rivers Saynbach, Wisper, Nister and Sieg exceeded 100 individuals per 100 m2. In 2008 approximately 85% of the suitable and accessible habitat in rivers Nister and Saynbach (Rhineland-Palatinate) were inhabited by wild 0+ salmon, followed by River Wisper (Hesse) with 80%. As a consequence of an increasing shortage of available stocking material a brood-stock programme was established in the Atlantic Salmon Centre Hasper Talsperre. The rearing-programme started in 2006 and aims to become independent from further imports by the year 2011. The brood-stock consists (almost) exclusively of the strain Atran (Sweden). Wild juveniles make up around 30% of the brood-stock. The wild juveniles were sampled from several spawning areas in nine streams with documented natural reproduction. A genetic examination of the brood-stock generation 2004 and 2005 and of the offspring of Atran returners to River Sieg indicated no loss of genetic diversity and revealed a similar genetic structure of the brood-stock and the offspring of Atran returners to River Sieg. It is concluded that the high reproductive success of the non-native strain Atran observed here corroborates the hypothesis of timing of spawning and Multiple-Sea-Winter ratio being key factors in the selection of a successful donor strain for reintroduction.

TI  - Patient-Reported Quality of Care for Osteoarthritis in General Practice in South Tyrol, Italy: Protocol for Translation, Validation and Assessment of the OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator Questionnaire (OA-QI)
T2  - METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis are similar internationally. Nevertheless, clinical practice varies across countries. Instruments for measuring quality have been developed to improve health care through targeted interventions. Studies on health service quality must consider the structural and cultural characteristics of countries, because each of their strengths and weaknesses differ. However, such instruments for health-related patient-reported outcomes for osteoarthritis have not yet been validated in German and Italian languages. Objectives: In order to be able to set targeted measures for the improvement of prevention and non-surgical treatment of osteoarthritis in South Tyrol, Italy, the quality of care must be recorded. Therefore, the aim of the project is to update, translate, and validate the OsteoArthritis Quality Indicator (OA-QI) questionnaire version 2, an established and validated questionnaire in Norwegian and English, for Germany and Italy. The second aim is to determine the quality of care for osteoarthritis of the hip and knee in a sample of patients who consult general practice in South Tyrol, and for comparison with patients who are admitted to rehabilitative spa-treatments for osteoarthritis in the state of Salzburg, Austria. Discussion: The results of this study will enable the identification and closure of gaps in osteoarthritis care. Although it is expected that body weight and exercise will play special roles, other areas of nonsurgical care might also be involved.

TI  - The Road to Retirement: A Life Course Perspective on Labor Market Trajectories and Retirement Behaviors
T2  - WORK AGING AND RETIREMENT
AB  - While a prolonged working life has been mainly feasible for people with the most advantageous working careers, knowledge about the barriers for those with vulnerable occupational paths is still scarce. This study explores the conditions for prolonged working life from a perspective on labor market trajectories. Drawing from a gendered life course perspective and that (dis)advantageous tends to accumulate over time, we investigate the opportunity structure for the most disadvantaged workers and which characteristics of labor market trajectories can explain the decision to work longer. To this end, a Swedish longitudinal survey and register data from the Panel Survey of Ageing and the Elderly (PSAE) were used, following people across a substantial part of their working life. With sequence analysis, we identified 5 trajectories that represent typical labor market trajectories from mid-life until retirement age. Our findings showed that labor market precarity in mid-life remained a key characteristic until the expected retirement age, showing both early signs of early labor market exit and a precarity trap into a prolonged working life. These findings emphasize the need to identify at-risk groups early in their careers and that mid-life interventions are needed to prevent involuntary labor market exits and to ensure a sustainable working life. In particular, the need to protect older workers with turbulent or precarious labor market trajectories against labor market risks and retirement schemes that could inadvertently contribute to increased social and economic inequality in later life.

TI  - Promotion of renewable energy sources in the Portuguese transport sector: A scenario analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Transport is one of the sectors of the energy consumption where the presence of renewable energies is lower and its increase is hard to achieve especially in countries that import all the fuels that they consume. This paper addresses the progress that Portugal is making toward a more sustainable transport sector. A near- and medium-term scenario analysis is performed, based on the energy consumption in the past and on a detailed evaluation of the trends for renewable energy in the transport sector. The near term scenarios aim at portraying the conditions that allow the country to fulfill the target of 10% renewable share in transportation established by the European Union. The medium-term scenarios highlight the implications, in terms of emission reduction and of energy independence, deriving from the use of electric vehicles and natural gas, synthetic and fossil, as alternatives to liquid fuels. The results show that electric vehicles would substantially reduce the total energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions, while the promotion of routes for synthetic natural gas would contribute to taking advantage of local resources. The paper also provides some insights about the design of future policies to build a more sustainable transport sector. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Seed dispersal between aquatic and agricultural habitats by greylag geese
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Waterbirds disperse plant seeds within and between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in their faeces. However, seed dispersal distances, connectivity among habitat types, and implications for dispersal of weeds remain unquantified in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, we GPS-tagged 31 greylag geese Anser anser and collected 300 faecal samples from feeding flocks in seven agricultural habitats (four cereals, hayfields, pasture, and strawberries) across two landscapes in southern Sweden. We identified intact seeds, determined key plant traits, and tested three hypotheses: (1) geese ingest, transport, and egest seeds from a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic plants, including weeds and alien species; (2) the community and trait composition of plant seeds in faeces vary between habitat types; and (3) seed dispersal by geese is a directional dispersal mechanism that connects some habitat types more than others. We recovered 131 seeds from 41 plant species (19 families), including nine agricultural weeds and one alien species. Many seeds were from aquatic plants (45%), dispersed into terrestrial habitats. A connectivity network formed between habitat types (as nodes) and direct flights (as links) revealed that all agricultural habitats were directly connected with each other, although 66% of flights were between aquatic and agricultural habitats. Geese spent most time at lakes (34%), pastures (14%), barley (10%) and wheat (8%) fields, which were also the most interconnected habitats, with high seed species richness and seed abundance in faecal samples. Combining waterfowl movement data with faecal analysis provided support for all three hypotheses. Geese may contribute to previously overlooked agricultural conflicts through weed dispersal. Proximity to aquatic habitats suitable for roosting may increases the use of agricultural habitats, and potentially the seed dispersal into them.

TI  - Simple Eco-Labels to Nudge Customers Toward the Most Environmentally Friendly Warm Dishes: An Empirical Study in a Cafeteria Setting
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Background: Food production and consumption contributes to one third of households' environmental impact. The environmental impact of different food categories varies and in general environmental footprint of meat is high than fish and vegetable options. Environmental food labels have been suggested as a means to sway consumption patterns. The purpose of this study is to test if different simple eco-labels in combination with posters can influence consumers to select environmentally friendly food options.
   Method: Three different labeling systems were tested on warm dishes in a University cafeteria in Oslo, Norway. The first system was traffic-light labels with three symbols (red, yellow and green), the second system was a single-green label that only labeled the environmentally friendliest dishes, and the third system was a single-red label that only labeled the least environmentally friendly option. Posters were placed in the cafeteria, explaining the labeling systems and the climate impact of different food categories. Outcome measures was sales share of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. The intervention period was separated in two; the first 20 days (period 1) and 22 last days (period 2) to evaluate if the effects of the labels was different when first introduced and after some months.
   Results: The traffic-light labels significantly reduced sales of meat dishes with 9% in the period 1 (p < 0.1) but not in period 2. Sales share of fish or vegetarian dishes were not impacted. Single-green and single-red labeling had no effect on sales share of meat, fish or vegetarian dishes. Posters were present during all interventions.
   Conclusion: Findings suggests that traffic-light labels in combination with posters can improve the eco-friendliness of customers food choices in a cafeteria setting, at least short-term. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects of simple eco-labels. Additionally, one should study the combined effect of symbols with other changes in the choice architecture.

TI  - Towards Sustainable Transport Assessment Considering Alternative Fuels Based on MCDA Methods
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2022 17TH CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS (FEDCSIS)
CP  - 17th Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)
AB  - Sustainable transport can contribute to many beneficial changes, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants into the atmosphere, improving the country's energy security, and enhancing energy efficiency. Therefore, it is essential to provide a framework for reliable measurement of sustainable transport, enabling its evaluation in terms of diversity and the significance of renewable energy sources (RES). This paper presents a methodological framework for a multi-criteria assessment of sustainable transportation. The proposed framework is based on three multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods: SPOTIS (Stable Preference Ordering Towards Ideal Solution), ARAS (Additive Ratio Assessment), and TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The application of the proposed tool is demonstrated in an illustrative example of the assessment of European countries in terms of the share of alternative fuels in final energy consumption in road transport. The authors used the proposed framework to perform a comparative analysis considering three MCDA methods and two methods for determining the significance of evaluation criteria: equal and entropy weighting methods. The investigation has proven the practical suitability of the proposed tool in the problem of multi-criteria sustainable transport assessment. Furthermore, conducted analysis indicated that Sweden is characterized by the most sustainable transport in terms of significance and share of alternative fuels and RES and their diversification.

TI  - Surface pollen deposition on glacier forelands in southern Norway I: local patterns of representation and source area at Storbreen, Jotunheimen
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - The relationship between vegetation and surface pollen deposition is examined at Storbreen glacier foreland where a clear plant succession exists. The aim is to determine whether the distinct plant communities present produce characteristic pollen assemblages. The influence of environmental factors is also considered. Pollen assemblages from moss polsters, collected from 22 paired sampling sites across the foreland, are compared with local vegetation. Two-way indicator species analysis and detrended correspondence analysis are employed to identify clusters and sequences, initially in the vegetation data and subsequently in the pollen data sets. Vegetation and pollen data are compared simultaneously using canonical correspondances analysis. Three main plant communities are distinguished: pioneer, health and snowbed. Broadly, each community produces characteristic pollen assemblages. Boundaries between groups are not clear-cut, reflecting the mosaic of plant communities present. Recognition of distinct plant communities is hampered by the prevalence of long-distance arboreal pollen and poor representation of entornophillously pollinated taxa. Late in the succession up to 78% of pollen could originate locally. Use of the non-arboreal pollen sum significantly improves correspondence with vegetation. The importance of indicator taxa is considered and both Salix and Empetrum are found to distinguish successfully early phases of succession from later phases. Strong correlations exist between the primary ordination axes of vegetation and pollen and with terrain age and altitude (for example, the correlation between altitude and total land pollen Axis 1 is r = -0.76). The surface data add new information to the interpretation of tree colonization in the area during the Holocene.

TI  - Modelling of nutrient concentrations in roundwood based on diameter and tissue proportion: Evidence for an additional site-age effect in the case of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i>
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate-mitigation strategies encourage the use of forest products and wood energy. This will likely increase the risk of soil depletion through nutrient exportation. Given the high variability in nutrient concentrations within and between trees, it is crucial to better understand the biochemical patterns of nutrient distribution and the related driving factors. Thus, predictions of nutrient concentrations can be improved, and used for assessing nutrient exportation through roundwood exploitation and for developing forest-management rules to maintain soil fertility. Our aims were to better determine (1) the shapes of the relationships between the total concentrations of different nutrients (N, S, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn) in roundwood and roundwood diameter; (2) the variation of these relationships between different tissues (wood, bark); and (3) potential effects of site conditions and/or stand age on nutrient concentrations. We therefore developed a new modelling approach that relied on empirical and mechanistic relationships, and allowed for sound predictions of both concentrations in individual tissues and in total. We applied the approach to Fagus sylvatica using 134 trees from 11 plots that covered large ranges of ecological conditions in terms of geographic region (from the northwest to the northeast of France), site index (from <25 m to >35 m), stand age (form 10 years to 159 years), and roundwood diameter with nutrient concentrations being measured separately for wood and bark tissues partly up to a minimum diameter of 1 cm. Relationships between total nutrient concentrations and roundwood diameter showed several different shapes: a reverse-J-shape for N, S and P; a U-shape for K; and no clear, more complex shapes for Ca, Mg and Mn. These shapes were related to concentration changes with roundwood diameter in both wood and bark for N, S and P (but with low goodness of fit for the models of N and S in the bark), while they were only related to concentration change in the wood for K, and in the bark for Ca and Mn (but with low goodness of fit for the model of Mn in the bark). Moreover, shifts of concentration-diameter curves (additive effect) were likely related to site conditions (chemical fertility), as assessed based on foliar nutrient concentrations. An additional effect of stand age could not be excluded, but so far it appeared difficult to clearly distinguish between influences of site and age. We argue that our modelling approach is particularly suitable to further tackle the issue of site and age effects, by combing data from several studies on the same species and/or on other species (genericness). Comprehensive forest-management rules based on silvicultural scenario simulation and assessment may finally be developed by coupling nutrient, biomass and site-sensitive tree-growth models.

TI  - Surface pollen deposition on glacier forelands in southern Norway II: Spatial patterns across the Jotunheimen-Jostedalsbreen region
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - This paper presents the results of a study of surface pollen deposition on 26 glacier forelands in the Jostedalsbreen-Jotunheimen region of southern Norway. Numerical techniques, including two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), are used to identify distinct plant assemblages, to examine the pollen-vegetation relationship and to distinguish broad trends in the data. The source of pollen is fundamental; the majority of samples, especially those from sparsely vegetated sites, are dominated by arboreal pollen (up to 90% of the total land pollen (TLP) sum), most with a long-distance source. However, indicator taxa, notably Salix and Empetrum, although present at low frequencies, can hold the key to the true nature of the local vegetation. Indicator taxa produce strong correlations between their presence in the vegetation and representation in the pollen spectra, at times essential to distinguish plant communities. Multivariate analysis of the 197 surface pollen samples and vegetation data indicates the broad division of the sub-alpine and alpine vegetation into four major groups: pioneer communities, snowbed communities, heath communities and woodland. The primary DCA ordination axes show significant correlations with altitude and terrain age (e.g. correlation r = 0.36 between altitude and non-arboreal pollen (NAP) Axis-1). The most readily interpretable results are produced by CCA simultaneous ordination of vegetation data and NAP data. The potential for improving the interpretation of Holocene vegetation is assessed.

TI  - The development of a measurement instrument focusing on team collaboration in patient transfer processes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITY AND SERVICE SCIENCES
AB  - Purpose
   Team collaboration is essential to ensure the quality of care and patient safety when critically ill patients are transferred from an intensive care unit (ICU) to a general ward. Measuring team collaboration in the patient transfer process can help gain insights into how team collaboration is perceived and how it can be improved. The purpose of this paper is to describe the development and testing of a questionnaire aiming to measure perceived team collaboration in the patient transfer process from ICU to the general ward. This study also aims to analyze the results to see how the survey could help improve team collaboration within ICU transitional care.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Statements, factors and main areas intended to measure perceived team collaboration were developed from a theory. The questionnaire was tested in two ICUs at two hospitals located in Sweden, and the results were analyzed statistically.
   Findings
   The results showed that the questionnaire could be used for measuring perceived team collaboration in this process. The results from the survey gave insights that can be useful when improving team collaboration in ICU transitional care.
   Research limitations/implications
   The collaboration between two research subjects, Nursing Science and Quality Management, has given new perspectives in how cultural and systemic differences and opportunities can help improving team collaboration in ICU transitional care, by shifting focus from the individual to team, culture, system, process and continuous improvement.
   Practical implications
   The developed questionnaire can be used to measure perceived team collaboration and to identify areas for improving team collaboration in the ICU transitional care process.
   Originality/value
   There is a sparse amount of research about measuring team collaboration in ICU transitional care, and this study contributes to filling this research gap.

TI  - Identifying economic costs and knowledge gaps of invasive aquatic crustaceans
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Despite voluminous literature identifying the impacts of invasive species, summaries of monetary costs for some taxonomic groups remain limited. Invasive alien crustaceans often have profound impacts on recipient ecosystems, but there may be great unknowns related to their economic costs. Using the InvaCost database, we quantify and analyse reported costs associated with invasive crustaceans globally across taxonomic, spatial, and temporal descriptors. Specifically, we quantify the costs of prominent aquatic crustaceans - crayfish, crabs, amphipods, and lobsters. Between 2000 and 2020, crayfish caused US$ 120.5 million in reported costs; the vast majority (99%) being attributed to representatives of Astacidae and Cambaridae. Crayfish-related costs were unevenly distributed across countries, with a strong bias towards European economies (US$ 116.4 million; mainly due to the signal crayfish in Sweden), followed by costs reported from North America , Asia. The costs were also largely predicted or extrapolated , thus not based on empirical observations. Despite these limitations, the costs of invasive crayfish have increased considerably over the past two decades, averaging US$ 5.7 million per year. Invasive crabs have caused costs of US$ 150.2 million since 1960 and the ratios were again uneven (57% in North America and 42% in Europe). Damage-related costs dom-inated for both crayfish (80%) and crabs (99%), with management costs lacking or even more under-reported. Re-ported costs for invasive amphipods (US$ 178.8 thousand) and lobsters (US$ 44.6 thousand) were considerably lower, suggesting a lack of effort in reporting costs for these groups or effects that are largely non-monetised. Despite the well-known damage caused by invasive crustaceans, we identify data limitations that prevent a full accounting of the economic costs of these invasive groups, while highlighting the increasing costs at several scales based on the avail-able literature. Further cost reports are needed to better assess the true magnitude of monetary costs caused by invasive aquatic crustaceans.

TI  - Bioeconomy Strategies: Contexts, Visions, Guiding Implementation Principles and Resulting Debates
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Over the last decade, bioeconomy policies, guided by integrated bioeconomy strategies, have developed. This paper presents a systematic and comparative analysis of official bioeconomy strategies of the EU, Germany, OECD, Sweden and the USA with regard to their context, visions and guiding implementation principles. In an additional step, the relationship between these strategies and important scientific and societal debates around bioeconomy is assessed. In conclusion, five major stumbling blocks for the further development of the bioeconomy are worked out. First, there is the risk of disappointment because far-reaching promises of the strategies are difficult to achieve. Second, the bioeconomy is not the only way to a low carbon economy so alternatives could impede the desired development. Third, persistent conflicts between the different uses of biomass for food, material and energy production could lead to unstable policy support with short-term shifts. Fourth, a broader success of new bioeconomy value chains could trigger new societal conflicts over bioeconomy if efficiency gains, cascading use, residue use and sustainability certification are not sufficient to ensure a sustainable supply of biomass. Fifth, the acceptance of bioeconomy could be compromised if bioeconomy policies continue to ignore the on-going societal debates on agriculture and food.

TI  - Perception of pesticide use by farmers and neighbors in two periurban areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Public concern about pesticide use is high although varying with social factors. Individual differences in 'perception' and attitude to pesticide use might be particularly evident in periurban regions where farmers and other people live together. This was investigated using a questionnaire sent to 600 farmers and 600 non-farmers in two periurban areas of Sweden. 'Neighbors'(1) were found to have a more negative attitude to pesticides than farmers, who were slightly positive to the use. Neighbors perceived pesticide use in agriculture to be more harmful to the environment than did farmers and also to reduce the quality of products. Both farmers and neighbors thought that farmers are the predominant users of pesticides. However, reported pesticide users within the home setting were just as common among the neighbors as among the farmers. Perceptions of pesticide use were also found to differ between periurban regions within the country. Attitudes and perceptions of pesticide use, as well as of who is the user, differ based on the group of people in a periurban environment and between different regions. Such differences might play a role for tensions and conflicts in the periurban area of a society and also for regulations of pesticide use. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Residential solar electricity adoption: how households in Sweden search for and use information
T2  - ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Background: As a renewable energy solution, photovoltaics (PVs) are crucial in the transition to a more sustainable energy system. Besides large PV installations, household adoption of PVs will be an important contribution to this transition. However, the adoption of PVs on a household level faces many barriers, with gathering and understanding information being one of the major barriers. The aim of this article is to do an in-depth analysis of how households search for and interpret information about PVs and to discuss how to reach different groups with information.
   Methods: The results in this paper are based on three interview studies made between autumn 2013 and autumn 2016. In the first interview study, seven non-adopters of photovoltaics were interviewed. In the second study, seven adopters of photovoltaics were addressed. In the third study, a total of 44 households were interviewed, with a mix of non-adopters and adopters. In total, 58 households were interviewed.
   Results: From the interviews, we developed four ideal types for PV adoption. The non-adopters use few sources of information, find the information complicated, and have a tendency to emphasize barriers rather than enablers for PV adoptions. The environmentally engaged adopters search a lot of information but find it difficult to know when they have enough or the right information. They also find information too technical and complicated and find it hard to compare quotes. The professionally skilled group easily accesses information but also experienced problems in comparing quotes and are critical to that many problems occur during the installation process. The accidental adopters more or less happen to get a PV system and needed little information. They usually took the offer from the provider first met.
   Conclusions: We can conclude that when dividing the households into different ideal types, it is possible to detect what kind of information measures different groups need. To get a future increase of the number of installed PVs, it is important to develop different measures in parallel, to meet the needs from the different groups.

TI  - Survey Study Reveals High Prevalence of Heterobasidion Root Rot Infection in Scots Pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>) Stands Established on Seemingly Low-Risk Sites
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Heterobasidion spp. are among the most destructive root rot pathogens, causing severe economic losses to conifer forestry. High infection frequency has been observed in Scots pine stands growing on dry sandy soils with low organic matter or former agricultural soils. In this study, we investigated the incidence of Heterobasidion spp. infection in Scots pine forests established on low-risk sites where the trees looked healthy and unlikely to be infected. In total, 135 healthy-looking pine trees from nine different stands were examined for Heterobasidion spp. presence. Heterobasidion spp. was detected in six stands and infection frequency was 13%-33%. There was a significant correlation between site index and infection frequency, which was higher in pine stands established on more fertile soils. There was no correlation between disease incidence and defoliation level, diameter of tree at breast height, root diameter, tree volume, or stand age. Overall, our results showed that, regardless of the soil type, Scots pine can be intensively infected by Heterobasidion pathogens while showing no outward signs. Therefore, the risk of Heterobasidion disease should be taken into consideration in management of pine forests growing on both low- and high-risk sites for more productive and sustainable forests.

TI  - Facile Synthesis of Sustainable Activated Biochars with Different Pore Structures as Efficient Additive-Carbon-Free Anodes for Lithium- and Sodium-Ion Batteries
T2  - ACS OMEGA
AB  - The present work elucidates facile one-pot synthesis from biomass forestry waste (Norway spruce bark) and its chemical activation yielding high specific surface area (SBET) biochars as efficient lithium-and sodium-ion storage anodes. The chemically activated biochar using ZnCl2 (Biochar-1) produced a highly mesoporous carbon containing 96.1% mesopores in its structure as compared to only 56.1% mesoporosity from KOH-activated biochars (Biochar-2). The latter exhibited a lower degree of graphitization with disordered and defective carbon structures, while the former presented more formation of ordered graphite sheets in its structure as analyzed from Raman spectra. In addition, both biochars presented a high degree of functionalities on their surfaces but Biochar-1 presented a pyridinic-nitrogen group, which helps improve its electrochemical response. When tested electrochemically, Biochar-1 showed an excellent rate capability and the longest capacity retentions of 370 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 (100 cycles), 332.4 mA h g-1 at 500 mA g-1 (1000 cycles), and 319 mA h g-1 at 1000 mA g-1 after 5000 cycles, rendering as an alternative biomass anode for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, as a negative electrode in sodium-ion batteries, Biochar-1 delivered discharge capacities of 147.7 mA h g-1 at 50 mA g-1 (140 cycles) and 126 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1 after 440 cycles.

TI  - Tree Species Site Suitability as a Combination of Occurrence Probability and Growth and Derivation of Priority Regions for Climate Change Adaptation
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Two aspects of site suitability were combined, namely species occurrence probability and tree growth as proxies for risk and productivity, aiming to improve climate impact assessments for forests. This measure was used to identify priority regions for climate change adaptation under consideration of current stands. The six most frequent tree species according to German national forest inventory data were used considering repeated measurements. Species distribution and growth models were calculated and combined into one measure. To identify priority regions regarding current forests, we aggregated species-specific negative development of site suitability for stands where a tree species actually occurred. Suitability under climate change increased or remained unchanged for current stands of silver fir, pedunculate oak and sessile oak. European beech and Scots pine showed large area shares with negative changes, but also areas with positive changes in site suitability. For Norway spruce, suitability decreased strongly. Priority regions were concentrated in the federal states Rhineland-Palatinate, Hesse, Baden-Wurttemberg, Thuringia, Lower Saxony, and Saxony-Anhalt. Certainly, the workflow contained several steps, at which decisions had to be made. Although this work did not resolve all issues of site suitability modeling for climate impact on forests, it provided a more comprehensive view on tree species site suitability in biogeographical modeling.

TI  - Investigating the possible impact of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> increase on <i>Araucaria araucana</i> wood density
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Our aim was to investigate the possible enhancing role of long-term atmospheric CO2 increase on wood density as an essential component of biomass sequestration. We therefore assessed the long-term evolution of wood density over pre-industrial and contemporary periods, in a regional context free of management practices, atmospheric deposition and with restricted climatic change. Dominant trees of Araucaria araucana were sampled in 37 stands distributed throughout its natural distribution over temperate forests of the Chilean Andes Cordillera. Mean ring density (MRD) at 1.30 m was measured by X-ray micro-densitometry. A third-century MRD chronology was built after MRD standardisation by the effects of cambial age and radial growth, simultaneously estimated from a statistical model from rings of the pre-industrial period (1700-1850) to avoid any temporal bias. The age-alone standardised MRD chronology showed restricted fluctuations ranging between 2.0 and 3.2 % over the last three centuries. Multi-decennial fluctuations between ring width and MRD were found qualitatively synchronous and opposed. Accordingly, MRD fluctuations were removed with the age and growth standardisation, highlighting the absence of a historical wood density trend at constant ring size over the whole period. Over the most recent decades however, a slight increase in density was identified, with loss of synchronisation to radial growth. The absence of a long-term signal in wood density of A. araucana, in a context of restricted anthropogenic influence, differs markedly from reports of significant decreases in the Northern Hemisphere. We conclude as part of the analysis done that until now, increasing atmospheric CO2 unlikely would have an impact in wood density.

TI  - Can geodiversity be predicted from space?
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
AB  - Identification of geodiversity at regional and national scales with traditional surveying techniques remains a logistically difficult and often financially prohibitive task. Earth observation data in combination with statistical modeling may provide a unique approach for mapping and analyzing geodiversity cost-efficiently. In this study, the possibility to map geodiversity using digital elevation models (DEMs) and remote sensing (RS) data was scrutinized in Finland, Northern Europe at a landscape scale. The main methods in the evaluation of spatial prediction ability of geodiversity and the relative contributions of DEM and RS data were generalized additive modeling (GAM) and variation partitioning. Based on the results, geodiversity was mainly determined by polygenetic bedrock topography and fluvial activity, and correlated most strongly with variables describing high potential energy and topographical heterogeneity. The spatial patterns of geodiversity were robustly predicted across the study areas using multivariate GAMs. The higher predictive performance of the DEM- versus RS-based variables was evident across the study areas. In conclusion, we propose that statistically-based spatial prediction offers an opportunity for characterizing geodiversity of a large area in a systematic, repeatable, and spatially exhaustive manner.

TI  - Crossing the Maelstrom: New Departures in Viking Archaeology
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - This paper reviews the achievements and challenges of archaeological research on Viking Age northern Europe and explores potential avenues for future research. We identify the reemergence of comparative and cross-cultural perspectives along with a turn toward studying mobility and maritime expansion, fueled by the introduction of biomolecular and isotopic data. The study of identity has seen a shift from a focus on collective beliefs and ritual to issues of personal identity and presentation, with a corresponding shift in attention to individual burials and the "animated objects." Network ontologies have brought new perspectives on the emergence of sea trade and urban nodes and to the significance of outfield production and resources. Field archaeology has seen an emphasis on elite manors, feasting halls, and monuments, as well as military sites and thing assembly places, using new data from remote sensing, geophysical surveys, geoarchaeology, and metal detectors. Concerns over current climate change have placed the study of environment as a key priority, in particular in the ecologically vulnerable North Atlantic settlements. Discussing future directions, we call for alignment between societal/economic and individual/cultural perspectives, and for more ethically grounded research. We point to diaspora theory and intersectionality as frameworks with the potential to integrate genomics, identity, and society, and to ecology as a framework for integrating landscape, mobility, and political power.

TI  - Democracy and mediation in territorial civil wars in Southeast Asia and the South Pacific
T2  - ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL
AB  - The awarding of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize to former President Martti Ahtisaari, Finland, cites his involvement in the settlement of the Aceh conflict. This at the same time highlights the lack of such efforts in the regions of Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. While internal conflicts throughout the world often tend to be resilient to conflict management initiatives, conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region have proven to be particularly difficult to resolve. Internal conflicts in Southeast Asia and the Pacific often concern territorial issue, for instance, East Timor and ethnically based conflicts in Myanmar. This is also true for conflicts in the South Pacific, notably in Bougainville (Papua New Guinea) and New Caledonia (France). Territorial conflicts last longer, are more difficult to manage, and generally produce more adverse consequences than those over other issues such as ideology, government, and national power. Further, conflicts in this region appear to be of low priority for third parties, with comparatively few interventions from third parties. The strong central governments seem to be a factor in preventing mediation-based solution to such conflicts. Nevertheless, there are reasons to be optimistic. Third party mediation, democratization, and the recent success in Aceh provide promise for the future, and the recent Nobel Prize confirms this.

TI  - The structure of ant assemblages in an urban area of Helsinki, southern Finland
T2  - ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI
AB  - We collected ants in ten replicated habitat types of an urban island and described their assemblages using Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling and Multivariate Regression Trees. Lasius niger was the most abundant species, followed by Myrmica rubra, Formica fusca, L. flavus and L. platythorax; these species comprised 87% of all 1133 nests of the 16 species found. Ant assemblages changed gradually from open habitats to sites with closed tree canopy. Species most tolerant to urban pressure were L. niger, L. flavus and M. rugulosa, whereas forest-associated species were scarce or absent. Successful urban species had extensive (Palaearctic) or more limited (Euro-Siberian) distribution. Common and abundant habitat generalists were overrepresented relative to rural areas; these were also efficiently dispersing pioneer species with independent colony founding. Lack of suitable (micro)habitat apparently hampered colonization of many species. Competitively superior, territorial species were rare or absent, as were species dependent on dead wood, and many species depending on other ants. The indicated reorganization of interspecific competitive relationships may be due to selective impoverishment of the urban species pool. Comparison with other urban studies suggested that in ants, faunal homogenization has not taken place on a European scale.

TI  - Sustainable Large-Scale Aquaculture of the Northern Hemisphere Sea Lettuce, <i>Ulva fenestrata</i>, in an Off-Shore Seafarm
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - The growing world population demands an increase in sustainable resources for biorefining. The opening of new farm grounds and the cultivation of extractive species, such as marine seaweeds, increases worldwide, aiming to provide renewable biomass for food and non-food applications. The potential for European large-scale open ocean farming of the commercial green seaweed crop Ulva is not yet fully realized. Here we conducted manipulative cultivation experiments in order to investigate the effects of hatchery temperature (10 and 15 degrees C), nutrient addition (PES and 3xPES) and swarmer density (500 and 10,000 swarmers ml(-1)) on the biomass yield and biochemical composition (fatty acid, protein, carbohydrate, pigment and phenolic content) of off-shore cultivated Ulva fenestrata in a Swedish seafarm. High seedling densities were optimal for the growth of this northern hemisphere crop strain and significantly increased the mean biomass yield by similar to 84% compared to low seedling densities. Variations of nutrients or changes in temperature levels during the hatchery phase were not necessary to increase the subsequent growth in an open-water seafarm, however effects of the factors on the thallus habitus (thallus length/width) were observed. We found no significant effect of the environmental factors applied in the hatchery on the total fatty acid or crude protein content in the off-shore cultivated Ulva. However, low seedling density and low temperature increased the total carbohydrate content and furthermore, high temperature in combination with high nutrient levels decreased the pigment content (chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids). Low temperature in combination with high nutrient levels increased the phenolic content. Our study confirms the successful and sustainable potential for large-scale off-shore cultivation of the Scandinavian crop U. fenestrata. We conclude that high seedling density in the hatchery is most important for increasing the total biomass yield of sea-farmed U. fenestrata, and that changing temperature or addition of nutrients overall does not have a large effect on the biochemical composition. To summarize, our study contributes novel insights into the large-scale off-shore cultivation potential of northern hemisphere U. fenestrata and underpins suitable pre-treatments during the hatchery phase of seedlings to facilitate a successful and cost-efficient large-scale rope cultivation.

TI  - A Multidisciplinary Approach for Improving Resource Efficiency in the Indian Surimi Supply Chain
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - With the world population set to approach an estimated 9 billion by 2050, against a background of finite natural resources, we need renewable biological resources for securing healthy food and animal feed to meet the nutritional requirements of the growing population. In this paper, key findings from ReValue Eranet project financed by Norway, India, and Spain are presented. The project aims to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target on food losses reduction, by developing innovative technologies for the surimi industry, namely reducing losses by improved cold chain management and efficient conversion of rest raw materials (RRM) and wash water into value-added protein and oil ingredients for food and feed applications. A multidisciplinary research approach was applied with expertise from supply chain management, life cycle assessment, biotechnology, energy, and process engineering to propose several solutions for improving the overall resource efficiency of the surimi supply chains in India. This paper presents a synthesis of proposed solutions from ReValue project and potential contribution towards SDGs as well as market exploitation strategies.

TI  - Alteration of natural gas during leakage from a North Sea salt diapir field
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Gas in Marine Sediments
AB  - Oil and gas are leaking from a salt diapir field in the Norwegian Sector of the Central North Sea. The gas is being biodegraded as it migrates to the surface. The seeping gas is pervasive in the sediments above the diapir and clearly visible on shallow and deep seismic records and on wireline logs. An exploration well was drilled to test a Cretaceous Chalk reservoir above the diapir and provided an opportunity to sample the gas along the seepage pathway. Carbon isotope ratios of gases released from sealed cuttings taken from the gas cloud interval above the diapir were determined to test the hypothesis that biodegradation of leaking hydrocarbons produces secondary methane with a biogenic isotope signature.
   Generally high, but variable, concentrations of CO2 were detected all the way from the surface to the salt diapir. This results from biodegradation of hydrocarbons, and particularly oil. The source of oxygen for this process is problematic since most of the migration takes place through shales and there is no obvious aquifer source of dissolved oxygen.
   The effect of biodegradation of gases escaping from this structure results in a comparable increase in delta(13)C for both methane and ethane (up to 10 parts per thousand), with a lesser effect on propane and less still for butane and pentane. This conflicts with published data on such effects which suggest that methane and propane should be most affected, with little effect on ethane. Isotopically light methane was found only in the very deepest samples, within the salt of the diapir itself, and this is thought to be biogenic gas trapped in the salt at the time of deposition. No evidence was found that any ''secondary'' biogenic methane is being produced during gas seepage and biodegradation at this site.

TI  - The subsurface thermal state of Svalbard and implications for geothermal potential
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
AB  - Svalbard is a High Arctic Archipelago at 74-81 degrees N and 15-35 degrees E under the sovereignty of Norway. All settlements in Svalbard, including the capital of Longyearbyen (population 2400), currently have isolated energy systems with coal or diesel as the main energy source. Geothermal energy is considered as a possible alternative for electricity production, as a heat source in district heating systems or harnessed for heating and cooling using geothermal heat pump installations. In this contribution we present the until now fragmented data sets relevant to characterize and assess the geothermal potential of Svalbard. Data sets include petroleum and deep research boreholes drilled onshore Svalbard, 14 of which have recorded subsurface temperature data at depths below 200 m. Geothermal gradients on Spitsbergen vary from 24 degrees C/km in the west to 55 degrees C/km in the south-east, with an average of 33 degrees C/km. Four deep research boreholes were fully cored and analyzed for thermal conductivity. These analyses were complemented by thermal conductivity calculated from wireline logs in selected boreholes and four measurements on outcrop samples. 1D heat flow modelling on five boreholes calibrated with the measured thermal conductivities offers insights into heat transfer through the heterogeneous sedimentary suc-cession. Offshore petroleum boreholes in the south-western Barents Sea and marine heat flow stations around Svalbard provide a regional framework for discussing spatial variation in heat flow onshore Svalbard, with emphasis on the effects of erosion and deposition on the thermal regime. We conclude that Svalbard's geology is well suited for geothermal exploration and potential production, though challenges related to permafrost, the presence of natural gas, heterogeneous reservoir quality and strongly lateral varying heat flow need to be adequately addressed prior to geothermal energy production. Specifically for Longyearbyen, high geothermal gradients of 40-43 degrees C/km in the nearest borehole (DH4) suggest promising sub-surface thermal conditions for further exploration of deep geothermal potential near the settlement.

TI  - Cultivating resilience by empirically revealing response diversity
T2  - GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB  - Intensified climate and market turbulence requires resilience to a multitude of changes. Diversity reduces the sensitivity to disturbance and fosters the capacity to adapt to various future scenarios. What really matters is diversity of responses. Despite appeals to manage resilience, conceptual developments have not yet yielded a break-through in empirical applications. Here, we present an approach to empirically reveal the 'response diversity': the factors of change that are critical to a system are identified, and the response diversity is determined based on the documented component responses to these factors. We illustrate this approach and its added value using an example of securing food supply in the face of climate variability and change. This example demonstrates that quantifying response diversity allows for a new perspective: despite continued increase in cultivar diversity of barley, the diversity in responses to weather declined during the last decade in the regions where most of the barley is grown in Finland. This was due to greater homogeneity in responses among new cultivars than among older ones. Such a decline in the response diversity indicates increased vulnerability and reduced resilience. The assessment serves adaptive management in the face of both ecological and socioeconomic drivers. Supplier diversity in the food retail industry in order to secure affordable food in spite of global price volatility could represent another application. The approach is, indeed, applicable to any system for which it is possible to adopt empirical information regarding the response by its components to the critical factors of variability and change. Targeting diversification in response to critical change brings efficiency into diversity. We propose the generic procedure that is demonstrated in this study as a means to efficiently enhance resilience at multiple levels of agrifood systems and beyond. (C) 2014 The Authors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to conceptualise our understanding of public value accounting (PVA) by studying the use and usefulness of performance measurements (PM) as a management tool. The authors do this from a perspective in which they address the complexity of various (sometimes conflicting) assessments of performance measurement and management (PMM) by different stakeholders. Design/methodology/approachAn interpretative case study using qualitative methods. The paper is based on 30 interviews conducted in 2018 and 2019 with respondents working with PMM at different levels, such as politicians, officials and health-care professionals. The study context was Region Stockholm (RS) in Sweden and its health-care division. FindingsPMs become an instrumental tool for PMM, which led to output being promoted above outcome. The authors show that there is a conceptual shortcoming in the discussion of PVA, as the effort needed to achieve outcome-based information might exceed the ability of an organisation to deliver it. The authors address the importance of studying the interaction among different stakeholders, including politicians, the public and media, in research on PVA, as well as possible power relationships among stakeholders. Originality/valueThe authors contribute to the growing research on PVA and its call for more empirical research by offering a more nuanced interpretation of PVA activities. The authors do this by studying PMM and the nature of these activities in a public sector organisation from a multiple-stakeholder perspective.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Disruptive Events on Port Performance and Choice: The Case of Gothenburg
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB  - This paper assesses the impact of a major disruptive event at the port of Gothenburg, Scandinavia's largest container port. Automatic Identification System (AIS) data is analyzed, in combination with official port statistics on container handling in the four main container ports in Sweden, from 2014-2018. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between container volumes handled and calculated performance metrics at the specific times of the intense labour dispute at the port of Gothenburg during the periods Q2 (2016) and Q4 (2016)-Q2 (2017). The paper concludes that the decline in container volumes handled at Gothenburg over the period is specifically due to fewer ships calling at the port following each of the intense periods of the labour dispute. It is also concluded that the effect on competitor ports in the region were significant in terms of both increased volumes of gateway container traffic and the resulting short-term and medium term impacts on both port user profiles and port efficiency levels.

T2  - ADVANCES IN INTEGRATED SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
CP  - Biannual Meeting on Advances in Intergrated Soil Fertility Management in Sub-Saharan Africa - Challenges and Opportunities
AB  - The Gumuz people in Ethiopia is a minority group with a population of about 100,000 in Ethiopia. Most of them live in the Blue Nile valley. They traditionally practice shifting cultivation and lead semi-nomadic lives, settling for four to five years before moving on to clear new land. Population increase and more permanent settlements have led to increasing pressure on available land, shorter cultivation -fallow cycles and widespread soil fertility decline. The introduction of striga (Striga spp.) further exacerbates the situation. Forests, bushland and grasslands are burned annually to clear the land, thus removing valuable organic matter from the ecosystem. Nutrients in the ash are to some extent lost through runoff and erosion. Efforts are being made through Agallo Meti Sirba Community Development Project (ASCDP) to contain and reverse the situation. The project is run by the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus, with cooperation and funds from NORAD and The Norwegian Missionary Society (NMS). This paper is based on results and field observations during the period September 2001 to February 2003, focusing on current trends in soil fertility, making recommendations on what should be done to reverse the general decline in soil fertility and to ensure agricultural sustainability in the area.

TI  - Can we fly less? Evaluating the 'necessity' of air travel
T2  - JOURNAL OF AIR TRANSPORT MANAGEMENT
AB  - Air travel is often justified as 'necessary' or 'unavoidable', in the sense that trips have purpose and value. Yet it is evident that people travel for reasons that may include forced and voluntary movement, with motives ranging from visiting friends and family, to leisure, or business. In light of the challenge to decarbonise transport, and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this paper discusses the perceived necessity of flight from individual and societal perspectives, while considering moral and economic viewpoints. It suggests that travel motives have different degrees of 'urgency', and that the 'necessity of flight' cannot be generalised. To empirically test this hypothesis in an exploratory survey, we used mixed methods to examine the perspectives of 29 international students at Lund University, Sweden on the perceived importance of their flights (n = 587) over a six-year period (2012-2017). Results show that the value associated with individual flights depends on flight motive, experience, life stage, or situational factors. Notably, almost half of the leisure flights made lack importance. Implications are discussed in the context of climate policy and the future development of the aviation system.

TI  - Measuring the progress towards a resource-efficient European Union under the Europe 2020 strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Resource efficiency is an essential priority of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which under the Flagship Initiative for a resource efficient Europe calls for a shift towards a resource-efficient economy. In this context, indicators and composite indexes could be useful in order to evaluate the progress of the European Union towards the objectives of the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe.
   This paper benchmarks the 28 European members based on a composite index, namely the Resource Efficiency Capacity Index. The index is based on the calculations of 29 indicators, which are grouped in three dimensions. The first dimension benchmarks EU-28 members according to the promotion of waste recycling, to the support of research and innovation in resource efficiency and to the implementation of environmental taxation. The second dimension benchmarks EU members according to energy efficiency in residential buildings and the third dimension according to the development of more sustainable transport modes. The three dimensions are aggregated for a final ranking.
   The results indicate that Denmark received the highest ranking with a composite index value of 3.35, followed by Sweden (3.22) and Finland (3.13) in 2013. The establishment of more effective policies is necessary in the member states with the lowest scores in the Resource-Efficiency Capacity Index: Slovakia (1.8), Malta (1.92) and Poland (1.93). Although the European Union has made considerable progress in this issue in the last decade, many actions should still be faced to increase resource efficiency to inform more about the concept of life-cycle thinking to increase waste recycling, to make more attractive the system of public passenger transport, or to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, among others.

TI  - A unified scale for female reproductive stages in the Norway lobster (<i>Nephrops norvegicus</i>): Evidence from macroscopic and microscopic characterization
T2  - JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY
AB  - Knowledge of the reproductive cycle in exploited species is important for a sustainable management of fisheries. Standardized scales to assess maturity stages are a fundamental tool to understand the demographic composition of exploited populations. Staging scales for female Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, have been subject to a series of changes, and multiple inconsistent scales are in use in different fisheries regions. A unified, evidence-based scale has not previously been established. We reviewed previous staging scales for the female ovary maturation and propose a revised scale based on the correlation between macroscopic and microscopic ovary characteristics. To provide better-informed tools for future stock assessment, female stages were characterized through external observation on ovary color and size, and the progress of vitellogenesis. This study clarifies several biological phases that were conflated in previous scales. First, we demonstrate how to distinguish between immature ovaries in juvenile females versus the earliest ovary maturation stage in adults. Second, the new scale differentiates between "mottled" ovaries seen in two separate biological stages: the spent ovaries that undergo partial resorption in berried females, versus ovaries of females which failed to spawn and undergo full resorption. To ensure consistent application, colors are assessed relative to international standards (RAL/Pantone). This new, practical staging scheme clarifies the correlation between microscopic characteristics and macroscopically observable details in ovary maturation. Adoption of this unified staging scale will improve maturity analyses, help to identify stocks with potentially reduced reproductive capacity, and facilitate broad-scale comparisons.

TI  - Thermal stress resistance of the brown alga <i>Fucus serratus</i> along the North-Atlantic coast: Acclimatization potential to climate change
T2  - MARINE GENOMICS
AB  - Seaweed-dominated communities are predicted to disappear south of 45 degrees latitude on North-Atlantic rocky shores by 2200 because of climate change. The extent of predicted habitat loss, however, could be mitigated if the seaweeds' physiology is sufficiently plastic to rapidly acclimatize to the warmer temperatures. The main objectives of this study were to identify whether the thermal tolerance of the canopy-forming seaweed Fucus serratus is population-specific and where temperatures are likely to exceed its tolerance limits in the next 200 years. We measured the stress response of seaweed samples from four populations (Norway, Denmark, Brittany and Spain) to common-garden heat stress (20 degrees C-36 degrees C) in both photosynthetic performance and transcriptomic upregulation of heat shock protein genes. The two stress indicators did not correlate and likely measured different cellular components of the stress response, but both indicators revealed population-specific differences, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. Our results confirmed that thermal extremes will regularly reach physiologically stressful levels in Brittany (France) and further south by the end of the 22nd century. Although heat stress resilience in photosynthetic performance was higher at the species' southern distributional edge in Spain, the hsp expression pattern suggested that this edge-population experienced reduced fitness and limited responsiveness to further stressors. Thus, F. serratus may be unable to mitigate its predicted northward shift and may be at high risk to lose its center of genetic diversity and adaptability in Brittany (France). As it is an important intertidal key species, the disappearance of this seaweed will likely trigger major ecological changes in the entire associated ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - ACCSEAS an e-Navigation Test Bed in Europe
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2012)
CP  - 25th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation
AB  - The General Lighthouse Authorities of the UK and Ireland are participating and leading an international project in the North Sea Region (NSR) of Europe to plan and deliver prototype e-Navigation services. ACCessibility for Shipping, Efficiency Advantages and Sustainability (ACCSEAS) aims to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the North Sea, identify solutions, prototype and demonstrate these successful solutions in an e-Navigation test-bed at the North Sea regional level as 'proof-of-concept' and to develop a sustainability plan for future e-Navigation provision in the NSR and will look to inform e-Navigation initiative globally The entire process of the implementation of prototype solutions in the e-Navigation test-bed will be supported by training and simulation, so that the test-bed will have aspects of both real-world and simulated implementation. The project is part funded through the European Regional Development Fund's INTERREG IVB NSR initiative. European transport policy provides a shift to seaborne transport, using Short Sea Shipping to avoid road bottle necks to the movement of goods, services and people. This modal shift requires efficient and effective marine navigation services. The NSR, as a maritime hub, is at risk from increased shipping congestion and transport delays, safety issues and pollution/environmental risks that would inhibit the socio-economic development of the NSR. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of offshore installations (such as wind farms) for renewable energy.
   Globally, there is a trend towards larger bulk cargo and container carrying ships, which operate side-by-side with fishing boats and leisure craft in the same congested waters. Without the innovative services of e-Navigation, berth-to-berth operations may become less efficient. There may be increased risk of collisions and groundings, adversely impacting accessibility of ports and the effectiveness of logistics in the region. Consequences could be severe in terms of reduced economic sustainability, more environmental pollution incidents and the threat to safety-of-life.
   The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) concept of e-Navigation, formally recognised by the EU and the US, provides a potential solution via harmonised, integrated and exchangeable electronic maritime information on-board and ashore. The NSR, as a crossroads of regional and global shipping, is well positioned to benefit from an implementation of e-Navigation that can increase the efficient use of resources, provide better voyage planning and track-keeping and deliver improvements in regional accessibility.
   ACCSEAS aims to implement and demonstrate e-Navigation systems to alleviate NSR navigation risks. The aim of ACCSEAS is to identify issues which obstruct maritime access to the NSR, identify solutions, pilot and then demonstrate these successful solutions at regional level to develop a strategy for future e-Navigation provision. ACCSEAS builds on findings of previous and currently implemented related European projects and the ACCSEAS partnership includes several partners from those projects, allowing a smooth, efficient coordination between the projects and ensuring work is seamless without overlap.
   A regional e-Navigation service for the North Sea inherently requires a transnational approach. Improved maritime access can only be achieved by closer cooperation between competent authorities, navigation service providers and maritime stakeholders which encompasses: technology, infrastructure, services and operations within the broad policy, guidance and regulatory frame work of the European Union (EU), the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) and IMO. ACCSEAS is a transnational project that brings together Beneficiaries (including competent navigation authorities from Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom).
   The North Sea presents unique challenges that will demand unique solutions both at priority locations and at the regional scale. Only through the NSR and the ACCSEAS project specifically, can the maritime administrations in the region be coordinated to address implementation of the e-Navigation solution to accessibility and to integrate with regional research providers, training organisations and suppliers.
   ACCSEAS produces four types of results and outputs: firstly, a practical test bed (real equipment and infrastructure in the form of e-Navigation prototypes and complementary simulations to test these); secondly, a database of information which demonstrates the effectiveness of the prototypes, primarily in the form of baseline information concerning vessel routes in the NSR and Coverage Maps of the geographical extent in the NSR of e-Navigation services for the prototypes that improve safe and efficient regional accessibility. This information will be stored within an ACCSEAS Geographical Information System (GIS); thirdly, 'system of systems engineering' documentation concerning maritime access issues in the NSR, how the e-Navigation Prototypes and Simulations were developed to address these and an assessment of best practices involved in establishing e-Navigation regional solutions; fourthly, analysis of the lessons learned, advice and training needs for practical e-Navigation solutions; with training modules developed from this analysis.
   By the completion of the project in 2015, the ACCSEAS Partnership will have undertaken all activities to produce validated real world prototypes and simulations (validated by test/demonstrations to satisfy user requirements) including: a ship positioning unit and terrestrial Back-up; ship-to-shore based communications; e-Navigation services on ship and shore. The project should also have put in place a structure for co-ordination of future e-Navigation development across the NSR. The structure will comprise a road map for service expansion and a plan for the sustainability and harmonisation of e-Navigation in NSR.
   The prototypes, systems engineering lessons and training information will advise the further extension of e-Navigation across the NSR using a sustainability plan and roadmap. The results and outputs will allow the e-Navigation Architecture developed in the NSR by ACCSEAS to be readily "transferable" to other EU regions and internationally. To achieve the transferability of outputs and results, ACCSEAS will disseminate information about the project to users, stakeholders, competent authorities, ports, policy and decision makers at national, regional European and International levels.

TI  - Railway Transport Adaptation Strategies to Climate Change at High Latitudes: A Review of Experience from Canada, Sweden and China
T2  - TRANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATION JOURNAL
AB  - Impact of climate change on railway transport manifests in a variety of consequences, such as rail buckling, rail flooding, expansion of swing bridges, overheating of electrical equipment and its damage, bridge scour, failure of earthworks, ground settlement, pavement deterioration, damage to sea walls, coastal erosion of tracks and earthworks, and an increased number of railway accidents in general. Such impacts can cause considerable disruption of railway operations and lead to substantial financial expenses for repair of the railway infrastructure. Therefore, it is crucial to include adaptation strategies already in the design phase of the railway construction to ensure stability and integrity of the railway operations. This paper provides a literature review of adaptation considerations in Canada, China and Sweden and discusses climate change challenges that these countries face in their railway systems. In conclusion, the authors provide recommendations for adaptation approaches based on the reviewed international experience which can be useful for policymakers and managers of railway companies.

TI  - Species composition modulates seedling competitiveness of temperate tree species under hemiboreal conditions
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Mixed stands are advised for reduction of impacts of natural hazards, and species composition can largely affect sustainability and productivity of the stands. Early development of a stands after a stand-replacing disturbance can have considerable legacy effects on growth via alterations in the diversity-productivity relationships. Accordingly compatibility of growth and competitiveness of different species is one of the key issues for susceptibility of mixed stands. A two-year chamber experiment was conducted to assess early growth and infra- and inter-specific competition for light and soil resources among the seedlings of temperate tree species simulating the predicted effect of warming (presuming optimal moisture regime). Five species, which have high economic importance or potential to become so in the eastern Baltic region (Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver birch, red oak, and European beech) were studied. Among the studied species, European beech had the fastest height growth and competitiveness, suggesting ability to concur a stable niche outside its natural range, particularly under increased temperature. Beech also maintained high competitiveness despite the damages suffered during the overwintering, supporting legacy effects of early development and suggesting invasive properties. Among the studied, Norway spruce had the slowest growth and suffered the highest competition, which is in line with predicted changes in forest composition. Scots pine, silver birch, and red oak showed intermediate growth and competitiveness, particularly when growing together, suggesting balanced development and optimal productivity of such mixed stands. Nevertheless, growth and competitiveness of these species was reduced by increased temperature, indicating negative effects of warming.

TI  - Radioactive waste partitioning and transmutation within advanced fuel cycles: Achievements and challenges
T2  - PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS
AB  - If nuclear power becomes a sustainable source of energy, a safe, robust, and acceptable solution must be pursued for existing and projected inventories of high-activity, long-lived radioactive waste. Remarkable progress in the field of geological disposal has been made in the last two decades. Some countries have reached important milestones, and geological disposal (of spent fuel) is expected to start in 2020 in Finland and in 2022 in Sweden. In fact, the licensing of the geological repositories in both countries is now entering into its final phase. In France, disposal of intermediate-level waste (ILW) and vitrified high-level waste (HLW) is expected to start around 2025, according to the roadmap defined by an Act of Parliament in 2006. In this context, transmutation of part of the waste through use of advanced fuel cycles, probably feasible in the coming decades, can reduce the burden on the geological repository. This article presents the physical principle of transmutation and reviews several strategies of partitioning and transmutation (P&T). Many recent studies have demonstrated that the impact of P&T on geological disposal concepts is not overwhelmingly high. However, by reducing waste heat production, a more efficient utilization of repository space is likely. Moreover, even if radionuclide release from the waste to the environment and related calculated doses to the population are only partially reduced by P&T, it is important to point out that a clear reduction of the actinide inventory in the HLW definitely reduces risks arising from less probable evolutions of a repository (i.e., an increase of actinide mobility in certain geochemical situations and radiological impact by human intrusion).

TI  - Developing an indicator-modelling approach to forecast changes in nitrogen critical load exceedance across Europe arising from agricultural reform
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition above the critical load causes eutrophication with adverse impacts on biodiversity. Average Accumulated critical load Exceedance (AAE) is a measure of the amount of critical load exceedance and the area of habitat which is affected, and has been adopted in Europe as a pressure indicator for biodiversity. In Europe, AAE is calculated by the Coordination Centre for Effects (CCE) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe based on modelled nitrogen deposition and country-level reporting of critical load thresholds and ecosystem area. Due to differences in country-level reporting, AAE values for semi-natural habitats may show large differences across Europe. This paper therefore describes the development of a simpler approach to the modelling of habitat eutrophication. The eutrophication indicator model is applicable to all habitats for which empirical critical loads for nutrient nitrogen have been defined and is easily configured to assess impacts of modelled policies or scenarios on AAE. Outputs from the model showed a high correlation with published AAE data (R-2 = 0.80) and replicated broad spatial patterns in AAE, but under-estimated actual values by a factor of 2.5. This variation was traced primarily to the use of habitat-specific nitrogen deposition by the CCE which calculates higher nitrogen deposition to forest areas, but also to differences between countries in the critical load thresholds used and the areas of sensitive ecosystems reported. Sensitivity testing showed that exceedance calculations were particularly sensitive to the critical load threshold used, since nitrogen deposition across Europe lies in the middle of most critical load ranges. The indicator model was used to forecast AAE under two scenarios: socio-economic changes under a business as usual scenario to 2025, and the additional effect of agricultural reform where both direct support to farmers and market support were removed. Ammonia emissions showed a net decrease by 2025, with strong regional differentiation. Emissions increased in former Soviet bloc countries and decreased mainly in south west Europe and Finland. Agricultural reform had little additional impact on ammonia emissions. ME was forecast to decrease by 49% by 2025, due mainly to reductions in emissions of oxidised N from industry and transport, independent of agricultural reform. However, as oxidised N decreases, the relative contribution of N from agricultural sources will increase, and policy measures which reduce ammonia emissions will have increasing relevance for reducing ME.

TI  - Ultra-processed food advertisements dominate the food advertising landscape in two Stockholm areas with low vs high socioeconomic status. Is it time for regulatory action?
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background Ultra-processed food consumption is a risk factor for obesity and has a negative environmental impact. Food companies spend billions of dollars on advertisements each year to increase the consumption of ultra-processed food. In Australia, USA, and New Zealand, most food advertisements around schools and in train stations promote ultra-processed food, but no similar studies have been conducted in Sweden. The aim of this study was to explore the proportion of ultra-processed food advertisements in two districts of Stockholm, Sweden with low vs. high socioeconomic status (SES). Methods Two independent researchers (per area) mapped all advertisements, including storefronts, in two Stockholm districts. During consecutive days, all advertisements were photographed in Skarholmen (low SES district), and ostermalmstorg (high SES district), on the streets inside and outside the subway stations, as well as inside and outside of local shopping malls. Advertisements promoting food products were identified and a trained dietician categorized whether they promoted ultra-processed foods. Chi-Square test was conducted to test for differences in the proportion of ultra-processed food advertisements between the two study areas. Results In total, 4092 advertisements were photographed in Skarholmen (n = 1935) and ostermalm (n = 2157). 32.8% of all advertisements promoted food, while 65.4% of food advertisements promoted ultra-processed foods. A significantly higher proportion of ultra-processed food advertisements out of total food advertisements was identified in the low SES area, irrespective of the researcher taking the pictures (74.6% vs. 61.8%, p < 0.001 and 70.4% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in the proportion of food advertisements out of total advertisements between the two areas. Conclusions This study provides initial evidence about the scale and the differences in exposure to food advertisements across areas in Stockholm. The observed high proportion of ultra-processed food advertisements is concerning and is in sharp contrast to the Swedish dietary guidelines that recommend reduced consumption of such foods. Based on our results, residents in low SES areas might be more exposed to ultra-processed food advertisements than those in high SES areas in Stockholm. If such findings are confirmed in additional areas, they should be considered during the deployment of food advertisement regulatory actions.

TI  - Pathways to Aesthetic Education in a World of Profitability
T2  - YOUNG
AB  - The cultural sector has become an important part of the 'new economy' and has affected artistic practices as well as the road to becoming an artist. By discussing two female students' paths to aesthetic education, the article sheds light on some of the sociopolitical and economic conditions that students in transition between elementary and upper secondary school in Sweden encounter when entering aesthetic education with musical aspirations. The results give insight into the ways in which young people reason when entering a precarious sector that demands a high amount of personal investment and planning. It also shows the ways in which social class still plays a pivotal role in the choice of and reflection on educational goals. Further, the article discusses how creative desires can transcend the economic instrumental expectations that surround the world in which the students live. Thus, it provides a contemporary understanding of how young people navigate a world of profitability.

TI  - Barriers and opportunities for bioenergy expansion in Chinese rural areas
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Bioenergy can contribute to the development of a more sustainable environmental friendly alternative in rural areas in China. The perceptions, preferences and awareness concerning bioenergy among farmers are assessed in a systematic study of 594 Chinese farmers in 33 towns in the province of Shaanxi, using a generalized mixed model approach. In addition to the farmer's background and socio-economic variables, the spatial varia-tion in the perceptions is addressed by mapping the residual between-county variation. The overall awareness of bioenergy as a viable alternative is still low (N = 80). Education and preferences on centralized heating sys-tems play the most important role to explain the willingness to use biomass for domestic use or bioenergy from power plants. Users of large amounts of coal and electricity for heating increase the willingness to pay for bioenergy; users of firewood and raw residues are less prone to change their current energy uses. Nearly 75 % of farmers see bioenergy as a promising alternative to current consumption and production patterns of energy. The results show that not only the farmer's profile but the local context concerning energy mix, land uses and socio-economic factors are influencing their views, presenting defined spatial patterns and reflecting local geog-raphies. Over one-third of respondents provide spontaneous recommendations to develop bioenergy markets. The results contribute to a better understanding of farmers' motivations, perceptions and views concerning en-ergy uses, and can be used as an empirical basis for local energy planning towards a more sustainable energy transition in rural areas.

TI  - Population size, pollinator visitation and fruit production in the deceptive orchid Calypso bulbosa
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - It has been proposed that in non-rewarding animal-pollinated plants the pollination intensity should decrease with increasing population size and should increase with increasing local abundance of reward-producing plants. To test these hypotheses, we examined how population size, local abundance of Salix caprea, and tree cover were related to pollen removal and fruit production in 16 populations of the deceptive, early-flowering and bumblebee-pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa in northern Sweden in 3 consecutive years. To determine whether fruit production was limited by pollinator visitation, supplemental hand-pollinations were performed in three populations in 3 years. Finally, to examine whether increased fruit production was associated with a reduction in future flower production, vegetative growth or survival, supplemental hand-pollination was repeated for 5 years in one population. The levels of pollen export, pollen deposition, and fruit set of C. bulbosa varied considerably among years and among populations. The proportion of plants exporting pollen was negatively related to population size, and positively related to density of S. caprea and to tree cover in 1 of the 3 years. In the other 2 years, no significant relationship was detected between proportion of plants exporting pollen and the latter three variables. In no year was there a significant relationship between fruit set and population size, density of S. caprea and tree cover. There was substantial among-year variation in the extent to which fruit production was limited by insufficient pollen deposition and in the amount of weather-induced damage to flowers and developing fruits. Fruit set was consistently higher in hand-pollinated than in open-pollinated plants, but this difference was statistically significant in only one of 3 years. Supplemental hand-pollination in 5 consecutive years increased cumulative fruit production 1.8 times, but did not affect flower production, plant size, or survival. Tree cover was negatively correlated with the incidence of frost damage in 1 year. The results indicate that life-time seed production may be pollen limited in C. bulbosa, and that variation in population size and local abundance of the early-flowering, nectar-producing S. caprea can only partly explain the extensive variation in pollinator visitation among populations of this species.

TI  - Contrasting distribution of enzyme activities in the rhizosphere of European beech and Norway spruce
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Recent policies and silvicultural management call for forest regeneration that involve the selection of tree species able to cope with low soil nutrient availability in forest ecosystems. Understanding the impact of different tree species on the rhizosphere processes (e.g., enzyme activities) involved in nutrient mobilisation is critical in selecting suitable species to adapt forests to environmental change. Here, we visualised and investigated the rhizosphere distribution of enzyme activities (cellobiohydrolase, leucine-aminopeptidase, and acid phosphomonoesterase) using zymography. We related the distribution of enzyme activities to the seedling root morphological traits of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea abies), the two most cultivated temperate tree species that employ contrasting strategies in soil nutrient acquisition. We found that spruce showed a higher morphological heterogeneity along the roots than beech, resulting in a more robust relationship between rhizoplane-associated enzyme activities and the longitudinal distance from the root apex. The rhizoplane enzyme activities decreased in spruce and increased in beech with the distance from the root apex over a power-law equation. Spruce revealed broader rhizosphere extents of all three enzymes, but only acid phosphomonoesterase activity was higher compared with beech. This latter result was determined by a larger root system found in beech compared with spruce that enhanced cellobiohydrolase and leucine-aminopeptidase activities. The root hair zone and hair lengths were significant variables determining the distribution of enzyme activities in the rhizosphere. Our findings indicate that spruce has a more substantial influence on rhizosphere enzyme production and diffusion than beech, enabling spruce to better mobilise nutrients from organic sources in heterogeneous forest soils.

TI  - Deep-water fisheries at the Atlantic Frontier
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB  - The deep sea is often thought of as a cold, dark and uniform environment with a low-fish biomass, much of which is highly adapted for life in a food-poor environment. While this might be true of the pelagic fish living in the water column, it is certainly not true of the demersal fish which live on or close to the bottom on the continental slopes around the British Isles (the Atlantic Frontier). These fish are currently being commercially exploited. There is growing evidence to support the view that success of the demersal fish assemblages depends on the pelagic or benthopelagic food sources that impinge both vertically and horizontally onto the slope.
   There are several quite separate and distinct deep-water fisheries on the Atlantic Frontier. It is a physical barrier, the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, which results in the most significant division of the fisheries. The Ridge, which has a minimum depth of about 500 m, separates the warmer deep Atlantic waters from the much colder Norwegian Sea water and as a result, the deep-water fisheries to the west of the Hebrides and around the offshore banks are quite different from those of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (West of Shetland).
   The fisheries to the West of the Hebrides can be further divided by the fishing method used into bottom trawl, semipelagic trawl and longline. The bottom-trawl fisheries extend from the shelf-slope break down to about 1700 m and the target species varies with depth. The smallest vessels in the fleet fish on the upper slope, where an important target species is the anglerfish or monkfish (Lophius spp.). On the mid-slope the main target species are blue ling (Molva dypterygia) and roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), with bycatches of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and deep-water sharks. On the lower slope orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is an important target species. The major semipelagic trawl fishery is a seasonal fishery on spawning aggregations of blue whiting (Micromesistitus poutassou). The other semipelagic fishery is on spawning aggregations of the greater silver smelt or argentine (Argentina silus). Spanish and UK vessels that target mainly hake (Merluccius merluccius) and a Norwegian fleet that targets ling (Molva molva), blue ling and tusk (Biosme brosme) dominate the upper slope longline fishery. West of Shetland, the fishery on the upper slope has some similarities with that of the Hebridean slope, with anglerfish and blue ling being important target species. A quite different fishery occurs in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Norwegian Sea waters. Here the main target species is Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Below the transition zone biomass decreases rapidly and there is no fishery.
   It is generally agreed that many deep-water species have slow growth, a high age at first maturity and a low fecundity, which makes them vulnerable to over-exploitation. Other features of these fishes such as high mortality of discards and escapees will add to the problems. Despite this the only management procedures in place are general limitation of effort measures within the area of jurisdiction of the European Union. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - The Saga of the Management of Fisheries in the Adriatic Sea: History Flaws, Difficulties, and Successes toward the Application of the Common Fisheries Policy in the Mediterranean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - In the past 40 years, the fishery in the Mediterranean Sea has seen numerous changes in technology, fleet composition, effort allocation, and management strategies. In this paper, our aim is to summarize the improvements, and highlight the flaws and difficulties that have characterized fisheries management in the Mediterranean Sea in the past decades. We (the authors) advocate the importance of the regionalization of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in the Mediterranean. We focussed on the Adriatic Sea, with two case studies the fishery for sardine and anchovy, and the fishery for Nephrops. The former is emblematic as it is one of the most valuable and well-studied fisheries in the Mediterranean but it is also an example of a management process that is slowly bearing fruit. Nephrops, on the other hand, has been facing the same destiny as other stocks in the Mediterranean; namely, its peculiar biology, a complex fishery, a poorly tailored data collection and inadequate assessments, have delayed action until very recent times. We use these examples to cover several aspects of Mediterranean fisheries management: (i) a historical overview of the development of these fisheries and their management; (ii) an overview of the main players involved in the scientific analysis and management process and their current and ideal roles; (iii) the flaws of the current stock assessment system; and (iv) recent developments and potential solutions to comply with the latest reform of the CFP before 2020. We argue that to align Mediterranean management with the CFP and achieve MSY targets, the lack of coordination and definition of roles between the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, the European Commission Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries and the Joint Research Centre need to be resolved. There is a need for adequate assessment models and data to answer increasingly complex management questions, as well as regular external review of the stock assessment models to assure their quality. Finally, the need for the implementation of a TAC system as an effective tool for Mediterranean fisheries to achieve sustainability is discussed and advocated.

TI  - Trophic levels and habitat specialization of beetles caught on experimentally added aspen wood: Does trap type really matter?
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Saproxylic (wood living) beetles make up an important part of forest biodiversity and are of importance for conservation practices. The beetles are commonly surveyed on various dead wood resources by use of flight interception traps (window traps), catching both species depending on the resource and vagrant (irrelevant) species. Enclosed traps have been suggested as an alternative sampling method, as they sample only the beetles utilizing the dead wood resource. This is the first study to compare the two trap types based on catches from experimentally added identical wood units. Our main aim was to test whether enclosed window traps catch a higher proportion of specialized species and species of a lower trophic level than open window traps, and whether proportions of vagrant species decrease with habitat specialization and trophic level in both trap types. The study was carried out during two summers with traps mounted on replicated, identical units of fresh aspen dead wood in boreal forest in south-eastern Norway. Contrary to our expectations and earlier findings, the enclosed window traps did not catch a higher proportion of habitat specialists (aspen-associated species) or species at the lowest trophic level (wood feeding) compared to the open traps. Rather, the proportion of predators was higher and fungivores lower in enclosed versus open window traps, and no difference was found between different categories of habitat specialization. The proportion of vagrant species was lowest among the beetles with the strongest specialization (aspen-associated) whereas there was no difference with trophic levels. We suggest that keeping vagrants but selecting species based on host tree affinity is the best way to use catches from open window traps on dead wood units. Studies of predators and fungivores should be interpreted with care.

TI  - Acoustic seal deterrents in mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts in the whitefish fishery of the River Iijoki in the northern Baltic Sea area
T2  - FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY
AB  - Recovery of many seal populations has intensified seal-fishery conflicts. Acoustic deterrent devices (ADDs), designed to deter seals while minimising collateral harm, provide a potential solution. We investigated feasibility of ADDs to protect a European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) fishery in the River Iijoki, Finland, which enters the Baltic Sea. A sound barrier produced by a line of ADDs across the river efficiently prevented grey (Halichoerus grypus) and ringed (Pusa hispida) seals from passing the barrier line, thereby increasing catches, decreasing damage to fishing gear and catch and resulting in fewer seal sightings in the area safeguarded by ADDs. Hence, blocking access of seals to a river or its section by ADDs during a critical fishing period is a promising method for reducing seal-induced catch losses. However, long-term assessments of impacts of ADDs are still needed to verify the overall effectiveness.

TI  - Ranking EU Agricultural Sectors under the Prism of Alternative Widths on Window DEA
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Providing food security while preserving natural resources and reducing the use of production factors (land, labor, and capital), is a critical challenge for EU agricultural sectors in the 21st century. Sustainable Development goals adoption has increased the need for eliminating Greenhouse gas emissions across all EU sectors, while production should remain stable or even increase. For this purpose, Window Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been selected as a benchmarking technique, in order to assess input use efficiency of agricultural sectors of EU countries for the 2005-2019 period. Moreover, three-year projections (until 2022) have been calculated in order to acquire future efficiency scores. Emphasis has been given on the selection of alternative window widths, examining their influence on calculating efficiency scores for both projected and actual dataset. From a methodological point of view, this paper aims to highlight the assumption of zero technological change within Window DEA frames and present their differences. At the same time, results indicate that Estonia (1.000), the Netherlands (0.999) and Slovenia (0.999) are the most efficient countries in terms of input use efficiency, while Finland, UK, and Hungary (0.670, 0.755 and 0.771) score the least. Countries of central Europe (Hungary, Czech Rep., Croatia, Slovakia, and Austria) should redesign their agricultural strategies, so as to achieve the nine objectives of the upcoming CAP (2021-2027).

TI  - NITROGEN CYCLING IN 2 NORWAY SPRUCE (PICEA-ABIES) ECOSYSTEMS AND EFFECTS OF A (NH4)2SO4 ADDITION
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
AB  - Nitrogen cycling in two Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) ecosystems in the ARINUS experimental watershed areas Schluchsee and Villingen (Black Forest, SW Germany) and initial effects of a (NH4)2SO4 treatment are discussed. Although N reserves in the soils are similar and atmospheric N input is the same low to moderate level characteristic for many forested areas in SW Germany, N export by both seepage and streamwater differs considerably. At Villingen, deposited N is almost totally retained in the ecosystem, whereas at Schluchsee N export is the order of the input. This is explained by differences in forest management history. The Villingen site had been subject to excessive biomass export (e.g., litter raking) leading to unfavorable microbial transformations in the soil. In contrast, as a 'relic' of the former beech stand, the Schluchsee site is characterized by high biological activity in the soil with vigorous nitrification despite low pH values. Accordingly, the two ecosystems responded differently to the additional N input (150 kg NH4+-N ha-1 as (NH4)2SO4). Nitrification starting immediately in the Schluchsee soils led to continued Al mobilization and leaching of basic cations and NO3-. The availability of Mg, already deficient before treatment, further decreased due to Mg leaching and marked N uptake by the stand. In contrast, most of the added N in Villingen was immobilized in the soil. Hence, uptake by the stand and leaching of NO3- and cations was correspondingly lower than at Schluchsee. The results emphasize the problems associated with the definition of generally applicable values for 'critical loads' of N deposition.

TI  - Improved trawl selectivity:: effects on the ecosystem in the South Catalan Sea (NW Mediterranean)
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - We explored the potential ecosystem effects of improved selectivity in the South Catalan Sea demersal trawl fishery. A calibrated food web model representing current conditions of the ecosystem and selectivity data from recent fishing experiments were used to perform temporal dynamic simulations. This enabled the evaluation of direct and indirect impacts of fishing and provided insights into the sustainability of various management options for the trawl fishery. This fishery has the biggest fleet in the area, it is highly multispecies, and catches are largely composed of juveniles of target species and non-target species, which are often discarded in large quantities. Simulations indicate that improvement of trawl selectivity would have noticeable and complex direct and indirect effects on target and non-target demersal species. The biomass and catch of various commercial species (e.g. anglerfish, adult hake) would increase, while that of invertebrates (e.g. suprabenthos, Norway lobster) and juvenile and small-sized fish species (e.g. juvenile hake, blue whiting) would decrease due to higher predation mortalities and trophic cascades in the food web. Impacts on the pelagic compartment would also be noticeable. A slight increase in the mean trophic level of the community and of the catch is predicted, as well as of ecosystem biomass diversity. Generally, however, a greater reduction of fishing effort would be necessary for the recovery of highly exploited or overexploited demersal species. Trawling would experience moderate decreases in catches, while long-lining and bait-trolling would benefit. This work highlights the importance of including the mortality incurred during or post-escape from trawl nets when assessing the ecosystem effects of improved trawl selectivity.

TI  - Linking spatial pattern of bottom fish assemblages with water masses in the North Sea
T2  - FISHERIES OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Understanding the links between large scale spatial structuring of fish assemblages and shaping factors is essential to develop comprehensive ecosystem-based fisheries management. In this study, we investigated spatial patterns of bottom fish assemblages in the North Sea in relation to prevailing water masses in the region. We based our analysis on catch data from the German Small-Scale Bottom Trawl Survey conducted between 1987 and 2005 and used both ordination techniques and Mantel tests. Spatial variability of bottom fish assemblages was larger than inter-annual variability. Five significantly different bottom fish assemblages were associated with the following prevailing hydrographical regimes: i) the English Channel, ii) Continental Coastal, iii) central North Sea, iv) northern North Sea, and v) northern Atlantic water masses. Associations were generated by gradients in relative proportions of abundant species such as grey gurnard (Eutrigla gurnardus), dab (Limanda limanda), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Norway pout (Trisopterus esmarki). Taking into account large scale spatial structuring of catch data Mantel tests confirmed significant correlation between the fish assemblages and hydrographical variables. In summary, our results strongly support the hypotheses that hydrographical features such as water masses, fronts, and residual currents could shape bottom fish associations in the North Sea. Spatial demarcations of bottom fish assemblages indicated by this study can be used to support ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies.

TI  - Shift schedules, work factors, and mental health among onshore and offshore workers in the Norwegian petroleum industry
T2  - INDUSTRIAL HEALTH
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to answer the following research questions: (1) Do workers in different shift schedules differ in mental distress? (2) Do workers in different shift schedules differ in neuroticism? (3) Do shift schedules differ in psychosocial work exposures? (4) Do psychosocial work exposures contribute to mental distress among onshore- and offshore workers? (5) Does neuroticism confound the association between work exposures and mental distress? Workers on six shift-schedules answered a questionnaire (1,471 of 2,628 employees). Psychological and social work factors were measured by QPS(Nordic), mental distress was measured by HADS and neuroticism was measured by EPQ. The results showed 1) No differences in mental distress between workers in different shift schedules, 2) Revolving-shift workers reported higher neuroticism compared to day workers, 3) Swing-shift workers and revolving-shift workers reported lower job control compared to permanent-night and -day workers, 4) Job demands and role conflict were associated with more mental distress. Job control, role clarity, support, and leadership were associated with lower mental distress, 5) Neuroticism influenced the relationship between psychosocial work factors and mental distress. The present study did not find differences in mental distress between shift schedules. Job characteristics may be contributing factors when determining health effects of shift work.

TI  - Uneven-aged management options to promote forest resilience for climate change adaptation: effects of group selection and harvesting intensity
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Climate change is expected to increase forest vulnerability through disturbances such as windstorms and droughts. Forest managers are therefore investigating strategies to increase forest resistance and resilience, especially by promoting uneven-aged and mixed forests through group selection, and by reducing stand stocking and large trees proportion. However, there is little information on the long-term impacts of these two practices.
   The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an original silviculture algorithm designed for uneven-aged management and (2) to use it to assess the effects of the above-mentioned management methods in long-term simulations.
   We simulated individual and group selection techniques in order to study the effects of group size, harvesting intensity and their interactions on wood production, stand heterogeneity, and regeneration in mountain spruce-fir forests. We used the spatially explicit individual-based forest model Samsara2 to simulate forest dynamics.
   Our simulation results confirmed the positive effect of group selection practices on structure diversity and regeneration but not on spruce maintenance. Increasing harvesting intensity enabled forest destocking but decreased structure diversity and led to non-sustained yields for the most intensive scenarios.
   As adaptation measure, we thus recommend moderate group selection harvesting creating 500 m(2) gaps.

TI  - PUBLIC BICYCLES: HOW THE CONCEPT OF HUMAN-ORIENTED "MOBILITY SHARING" TECHNOLOGY CAN INFLUENCE TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR NORMS AND RESHAPE DESIGN EDUCATION
T2  - DS 78: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING AND PRODUCT DESIGN EDUCATION (E&PDE14): DESIGN EDUCATION AND HUMAN TECHNOLOGY RELATIONS
CP  - 16th International conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (E&PDE)
AB  - Although at the moment an excess of 500 public bicycle schemes of variable sizes operate in almost 50 countries worldwide, the impact of their use on travel behaviour and modal change have neither been studied extensively nor have been understood thoroughly as yet. This work negotiates the initial stages of an international research scheme that means to look into the attitudes and system user experiences (the latter only when it is applicable) that could define the design ( or re-design) criteria for three public bicycle schemes in three cities of different size and culture. These systems are currently on three dissimilar operational phases spanning from bidding for funding to actually having a fairly successful system already in place. As a matter of fact, the choice of the three case study cities represent an effort to frame the dynamics of the bike-sharing phenomenon in a micro-scale (Drama, Greece, 50.000 residents), meso-scale ( Gothenburg, Sweden, 500.000 residents) and mega-scale (Shanghai, China, 23 million residents) looking also into the attitude-shaping process before and after the implementation of a scheme. This project's didactic role is a twin one; it aims to reinforce education practice on sustainable mobilities design by using student projects as an apparatus for supporting research and promoting urban change in real societal terms and subsequently to integrate the findings of the research into future postgraduate and undergraduate course material. Thus, bike-sharing design, for the means of this paper, aims to serve as an academic platform for integrating and synchronising research and education by promoting a balanced and timely development of technological opportunities that capture the mobility needs of tomorrow.

CP  - 40th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE)
AB  - Wind load is one of the major design load considerations for the hull and mooring of offshore floating facilities. The first step to minimize the uncertainties in wind load is generating an accurate wind profile that satisfies design requirements.
   Recently, there was a joint-industry effort to develop CFD modeling practices on wind-load estimation in SNAME OC-8 CFD Task Force (OMAE2018-78699). The Task Force developed the modeling practice for the NPD (Norwegian Petroleum Directorate) model commonly used for offshore platform design, and several independent participants in the Task Force successfully validated the practice for a topsides of a semi-submersible platform. The sustainable wind profile was able to be generated within 1% tolerance of the target wind profile, and the calculated wind loads on the topsides from CFD simulations were close to the model test data with low uncertainty levels.
   In the present study, the numerical modeling for the sustainable ABL is extended to other popular wind models such as the ESDU (Engineering Science Data Unit) and the power-law models. The study is a part of a joint-development project between TechnipFMC, Chevron, and Samsung Heavy Industries. The analytic or numerical formulae of wind speed and turbulent quantities for several RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes) models are derived for the wind models, and the sustainability of wind profiles are verified.

TI  - Analysis of inland waterway ship performance in ice: Operation Time Window
T2  - OCEAN ENGINEERING
AB  - Inland waterway (IWW) shipping is a sustainable opportunity to reduce traffic on, in many times very congested, roads and railways. This is especially true for cities and urban areas. However, for an operator, the ship Oper-ation Time Window (OTW) is important in order to predict possible business cases, especially for regions with long-term winter seasons with icy conditions. The OTW indicates the probable number of navigable days for the ship. The operability is in relation with ship speed, ice thickness, whereas the ship resistance is of significant relevance. This study proposes a model to investigate the possibility of a certain operating condition for ice-going ships based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a statistical model. To demonstrate the proposed method for calculating the ship OTW of an IWW, a case study is performed. Ice condition in Lake Ma center dot laren (in Sweden) and an IWW ship designed to maximise its dimension restrictions are used for this case. The Radial Basis Function-Particle swarm optimization (RBF-PSO) ANN model is used to predict ice resistance in level ice con-ditions. Given the ice resistance prediction, a statistical analysis is further conducted regarding to the ice thickness distribution and the operational ship speed distribution to obtain ship OTW. Comparisons are made between semi-empirical ice resistance prediction methods and the ANN model. The influence of different ship speed distribution profiles is investigated by performing a parametric study. The OTW model can be used to evaluate ship operational scenarios in ice-covered waters for ship designers and owners.

TI  - GEMAS: Establishing geochemical background and threshold for 53 chemical elements in European agricultural soil
T2  - APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY
CP  - Joint Conference of the 9th International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry (ISEG) held in Combination with the 3rd International Symposium on Environment and Health (ISEH) / Geoinformatics Conference
AB  - The GEMAS (geochemical mapping of agricultural soil) project collected 2108 Ap horizon soil samples from regularly ploughed fields in 33 European countries, covering 5.6 million km(2). The <2 mm fraction of these samples was analysed for 53 elements by ICP-MS and ICP-AES, following a HNO3/HCl/H2O (modified aqua regia) digestion. Results are used here to establish the geochemical background variation and threshold values, derived statistically from the data set, in order to identify unusually high element concentrations for these elements in the Ap samples. Potentially toxic elements (PTEs), namely Ag, B, As, Ba, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, U, V and Zn, and emerging 'high-tech' critical elements (HTCEs), i.e., lanthanides (e.g., Ce, La), Be, Ga, Ge, In, Li and Tl, are of particular interest. For the latter, neither geochemical background nor threshold at the European scale has been established before. Large differences in the spatial distribution of many elements are observed between northern and southern Europe. It was thus necessary to establish three different sets of geochemical threshold values, one for the whole of Europe, a second for northern and a third for southern Europe. These values were then compared to existing soil guideline values for (eco) toxicological effects of these elements, as defined by various European authorities. The regional sample distribution with concentrations above the threshold values is studied, based on the GEMAS data set, following different methods of determination. Occasionally local contamination sources (e.g., cities, metal smelters, power plants, agriculture) can be identified. No indications could be detected at the continental scale for a significant impact of diffuse contamination on the regional distribution of element concentrations in the European agricultural soil samples. At this European scale, the variation in the natural background concentration of all investigated elements in the agricultural soil samples is much larger than any anthropogenic impact.

TI  - Serving whom? Immigrant entrepreneurs in a new local context
T2  - FENNIA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB  - In Helsinki, the current number of immigrants is quickly rising. Ethnic retail has emerged as a new, but visible, part of the city landscape. Compared to other European countries, becoming an entrepreneur is typically not very popular in Finland. Therefore, in this paper, we seek to comprehend this phenomenon and more specifically discover: what motivates immigrants to become entrepreneurs; what is the impact of their background and culture on the phenomenon; and finally, is the help provided by the city useful for them? Based on interviews and observations, we conclude that immigrant entrepreneurship facilitates in fluid ways the maintenance of cultural practices, while simultaneously enhancing meaningful encounters between immigrants and mainstream society. In our sample, we identify three types of entrepreneurs: growth-oriented, investors and status builders, as well as freedom and stability seekers. Although the groups are neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive, they display differences in certain aspects, which include their ways of entering into entrepreneurship, how their business is run, who their main clientele is, as well as in the future prospects for their businesses. We further infer that immigrant entrepreneurs, via their practices, also participate in making immigrant needs visible to politicians and policy-makers, thus also adding a layer to the local context within which they operate. However, we surmise that more effort is needed in addressing the freedom and stability seeker entrepreneurs if the aim of the city is to anchor immigrant retail in the city.

TI  - Sustainable Mixed Cropping Systems for the Boreal-Nemoral Region
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS
AB  - Mixed cropping, including intercropping, is the oldest form of systemized agricultural production and involves the growing of two or more species or cultivars of the same species simultaneously in the same field. However, mixed cropping has been little by little replaced by sole crop systems, especially in developed countries. Some of the advantages of mixed cropping are, for example, resource use efficiency and yield stability, but there are also several challenges, such as weed management and competition. The boreal-nemoral region lies within the region 55 to 70 degrees N. In this area, for example in Finland, the length of the thermal growing season varies from >105 to over 185 days. Typically, variation between locations and years is marked. However, during the year, there can be a wide range of temperature extremes between -70 and +30 degrees C. The majority of cropping systems in this region are usually monocultures, except for forage grass mixtures. The possibility of having several crops in a mixture is very challenging in the region due to the short growing season and extreme cold temperatures, meaning that crop earliness and overwintering capacity are a considerable restriction for year-round mixed cropping. A further restriction is the quality requirements set by the industry. Our review will explore a range of mixed cropping possibilities for the boreal-nemoral region, including different possible combinations of spring, winter, perennial, biennial, catch, and cover crops. The reviewed mixed cropping systems could considerably improve the sustainability and efficiency of crop production.

TI  - Time constraints and flexibility of growth strategies: geographic variation in catch-up growth responses in amphibian larvae
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. As size is tightly associated with fitness, compensatory strategies for growth loss can be vital for restoring individual fitness. However, immediate and delayed costs of compensatory responses may prevent their generalization, and the optimal strategy may depend on environmental conditions. Compensatory responses may be particularly important in high-latitude habitats with short growing seasons, and thus, high-latitude organisms might be more efficient at compensating after periods of unfavourable growth conditions than low-latitude organisms.
   2. We investigated geographical differences in catch-up growth strategies of populations of the common frog (Rana temporaria) from southern and northern Sweden in two factorial common garden experiments involving predation risk and two different causes of growth arrest (nutritional stress and low temperatures) to evaluate how the compensatory strategies can be affected by context-dependent costs of compensation. Larval and metamorphic traits, and post-metamorphic performance were used as response variables.
   3. Only northern tadpoles exposed to low food completely caught up in terms of metamorphic size, mainly by extending the larval period. Low food decreased survival and post-metamorphic jumping performance in southern, but not in northern tadpoles, suggesting that northern tadpoles have a better ability to compensate after periods of restricted food.
   4. Both northern and southern tadpoles were able to metamorphose at the same size as control tadpoles after being exposed to low temperatures, indicating that consequences of variation in temperature and food availability differed for tadpoles. However, the combination of low temperatures and predation risk reduced survival in both southern and northern tadpoles. Also, predation risk decreased energy storage in both experiments.
   5. Our results highlight the influence of climatic variation and the type of stressor as selective factors shaping compensatory strategies.

TI  - The trans-boundary importance of artificial bat hibernacula in managed European forests
T2  - BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION
AB  - Many European migratory bat species hibernate in large hollow trees, a decreasing resource in present day silviculture. Here, we report on the importance of man-made hibernacula to support trans-boundary populations of noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula), a species that performs seasonal long distance movements throughout Europe. In winter, we surveyed nine bat roosts (eight artificial and one natural) in Germany and collected small tufts of fur from a total of 608 individuals. We then measured the stable isotope ratios of the non-exchangeable hydrogen in fur keratin and estimated the origin of migrants using a refined isoscape origin model that included information on expected flight distances and migration directions. According to the stable isotope signature, 78 % of hibernating bats originated from local populations. The remaining 22 % of hibernacula occupants originated from distant populations, mostly from places in northern or eastern countries such as Sweden, Poland and Baltic countries. Our results confirm that many noctule bats cross one or several political borders during migration. Data on the breeding origin of hibernating noctule bats also suggest that artificial roosts may not only be important for local but also for distant populations. Protection of natural and artificial hibernacula in managed forests may support the trans-boundary populations of migratory bats when hollow trees are scarce in managed forests.

TI  - Identification of pegmatite bodies, at a province scale, using machine learning algorithms: preliminary results
T2  - EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS XII
CP  - Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications XII / SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
AB  - Several raw materials for "green" energy production, such as high purity quartz, lithium, rare earth elements, beryllium, tantalum, and caesium, can be sourced from a rock type known as pegmatite. The GREENPEG project (https://www.greenpeg.eu/), started in May 2020, is developing and testing new and advanced exploration technologies and algorithms to be integrated and upscaled into flexible, ready-to-use economically efficient and sustainable methods for finding buried pegmatites and their "green" technology raw materials. One of the tasks of this project aims to apply different image processing techniques to different satellite images (Landsat, ASTER, and Sentinel-2) in order to automatically identify pegmatite bodies. In this work, we will present the preliminary results, regarding the application of machine learning algorithms (ML), more specifically, random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) to one of the study areas of the project in Tysfjord, northern Norway, to identify pegmatite bodies. To be able to determine the classes that would make up the study area, geological data of the region, such as lithological maps, aeromagnetic data, and high-resolution aerial photographs, were used to define the four classes (1. pegmatites, 2. water bodies, 3. vegetation, 4. granite). All training locations were randomly selected, with 25% of the samples split into testing, and the remaining 75% split for training. The SVM algorithm presented more promising results in relation to overfitting and final image classification than RF. Testing the algorithms with several variables of parameters was able to make the process more efficient.

TI  - Harpacticoid and cyclopoid fauna of groundwater and springs in southern Finland
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
CP  - 6th International Conference on Copepoda
AB  - The groundwater fauna, of which scarcely anything has previously been studied in formerly glaciated areas, was richest close to the water table and diminished markedly at greater depths. However, few individuals were generally recorded per 1 m(3) of water. Bryocamptus minutus was the most abundant species of copepod at an esker site, the other species recorded being Attheyella crassa, Bryocamptus pygmaeus, Moraria brevipes and Parastenocaris phyllura, and some species from the genus Diacyclops. At a shore bank infiltration site M. brevipes was the most numerous species. However, one esker site examined did not have any animals. Springs, which were grouped into those in a natural state and those under anthropogenic influence, had some species in common with esker groundwater, but also Paracyclops fimbriatus, Acanthocyclops robustus, Acanthocyclops vernalis, Diacyclops bicuspidatus, Megacyclops viridis, and the harpacticoid species Bryocamptus cuspidatus, Bryocamptus echinatus and Canthocamptus staphylinus. Of the spring copepods, P. fimbriatus appeared to withstand the influence of road de-icing with NaCl, but numbers of Moraria brevipes were reduced under this influence. Bryocamptus echinatus was more numerous in springs having a high oxygen content and high pH. The species found in esker groundwaters and springs were in part the same evidently cold-stenotherm species which inhabit the profundal zone of oligotrophic lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Hydrologic effects on riparian vegetation in a boreal river: an experiment testing climate change predictions
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change is expected to alter the magnitude and variation of flow in streams and rivers, hence providing new conditions for riverine communities. We evaluated plant ecological responses to climate change by transplanting turfs of riparian vegetation to new elevations in the riparian zone, thus simulating expected changes in water-level variation, and monitored the results over 6 years. Turfs moved to higher elevations decreased in biomass and increased in species richness, whereas turfs transplanted to lower elevations gained biomass but lost species. Transplanted plant communities responded slowly to the new hydrologic conditions. After 6 years, biomass of transplanted turfs was statistically indistinguishable from target level controls, but species richness and species composition of transplants were intermediate between original and target levels. By using projections of future stream flow according to IPCC climate change scenarios, we predict likely changes to riparian vegetation in boreal rivers. Climate-driven hydrologic changes are predicted to result in narrower riparian zones along the studied Vindel River in northern Sweden towards the end of the 21st century. Present riparian plant communities are projected to be replaced by terrestrial communities at high elevations as a result of lower-magnitude spring floods, and by amphibious or aquatic communities at low elevations as a result of higher autumn and winter flows. Changes to riparian vegetation may be larger in other boreal climate regions: snow melt fed spring floods are predicted to disappear in southern parts of the boreal zone, which would result in considerable loss of riparian habitat. Our study emphasizes the importance of long-term ecological field experiments given that plant communities often respond slowly and in a nonlinear fashion to external pressures.

TI  - Fast and Automatic Activation of an Abstract Representation of Money in the Human Ventral Visual Pathway
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Money, when used as an incentive, activates the same neural circuits as rewards associated with physiological needs. However, unlike physiological rewards, monetary stimuli are cultural artifacts: how are monetary stimuli identified in the first place? How and when does the brain identify a valid coin, i.e. a disc of metal that is, by social agreement, endowed with monetary properties? We took advantage of the changes in the Euro area in 2002 to compare neural responses to valid coins (Euros, Australian Dollars) with neural responses to invalid coins that have lost all monetary properties (French Francs, Finnish Marks). We show in magneto-encephalographic recordings, that the ventral visual pathway automatically distinguishes between valid and invalid coins, within only similar to 150 ms. This automatic categorization operates as well on coins subjects were familiar with as on unfamiliar coins. No difference between neural responses to scrambled controls could be detected. These results could suggest the existence of a generic, all-purpose neural representation of money that is independent of experience. This finding is reminiscent of a central assumption in economics, money fungibility, or the fact that a unit of money is substitutable to another. From a neural point of view, our findings may indicate that the ventral visual pathway, a system previously thought to analyze visual features such as shape or color and to be influenced by daily experience, could also able to use conceptual attributes such as monetary validity to categorize familiar as well as unfamiliar visual objects. The symbolic abilities of the posterior fusiform region suggested here could constitute an efficient neural substrate to deal with culturally defined symbols, independently of experience, which probably fostered money's cultural emergence and success.

TI  - Early Holocene bark-stripping damages as an indicator of large herbivores: Evidence from a submerged Mesolithic landscape in the Havang area, southern Baltic basin
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - A unique assemblage consisting of 113 pine samples collected from a submerged Mesolithic landscape in the Havang area, southern Sweden, was examined to assess the presence of large herbivores, as well as changes in wild-game population density and composition. Bark-stripping damages on prehistoric trees is an extremely underutilized source of information about past game-population dynamics, yet our analyzes of wood samples - dated to around 10 500 cal. yr. BP - shows that such material can be successfully used to study the presence and activities of large herbivores, most likely ungulates. To evaluate our results, comparisons have been made with subfossil peatland trees that grew around 6000 years ago, as well as trees from two present day clearcut logging sites in southern Sweden. Furthermore, studies in a wild-game reserve were performed to recognize and understand different types of damages on trees caused by ungulates. Bark-stripping indicate the presence of ungulates, and the rate of damage is commonly associated with the density of the wild game. Bark-stripping was most frequently observed in the submerged wood material from the early Holocene, where damages were detected in 15% of the trees. In comparisons, 11% of the mid-Holocene trees show bark-stripping damages, whereas marks could be detected in the range between 0% and 6% of the trees from the two present-day clearcut logging sites. Our results show that tree-ring analyzes of prehistoric wood can generate information about wild-game dynamics of the past, and thereby being a valuable complement to more commonly used paleoecological and zooarcheological records.

TI  - Examining the Process of Modal Choice for Everyday Travel Among Older People
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Modal choice is a prominent concept within transport studies. However, the term is often used quite loosely, with little known about the factors lying behind the choice, the alternatives available to a person, and whether the person had a 'choice' to begin with. This study draws on a travel survey among older people living in Sweden's large metropolitan regions. The questions posed as part of this survey facilitate a greater insight into the processes at play behind modal choice. An analysis of the differences between: (1) the range of modal options available to respondents and (2) the modes selected from this range (modal choice) is presented. An analysis of the respondents' reasoning for choosing the modes they did and not the others they could have chosen is also presented. It was found that more than a quarter of respondents have the option to use and actually use all modes for everyday travel. The car is more inclined to be selected among those who have a range of different modal options. Suitability and comfort are the two main reasons given for modal choice. More positive reasons are given for actively selecting walking and cycling, whereas the motives behind the selection of the car instead tend to be framed as reasons for not selecting other modes. Adaptive preference and adjustment effects are also apparent in the selection processes. This study gives us a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms and reasoning at play behind the process of modal choice among this group. In this way, we have a better basis for shaping and implementing measures to promote and encourage sustainable mobility, in such a way that the well-being of older people is also supported.

TI  - The sustainable development of mobility in the green transition: Renewable energy, local industrial chain, and battery recycling
T2  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
AB  - The transportation sector has a strong negative impact on the environment and therefore requires new sustainable development measures. This paper proposes a new indicator of sustainability in transport obtained through a multi-criteria analysis based on Eurostat data and a panel of 10 academics. The results show a positive performance of Sweden in the period 2015-2019 and a small number of countries above the European average. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis based on these experts identifies the critical success factors associated with purchasing electric vehicles. The greatest importance is assigned to purchase cost, followed by battery autonomy. Our analysis proposes that electric vehicles are unable to achieve a sustainable transition unless three conditions are met: (i) use of renewable sources, (ii) local industrial development of the sector, and (iii) battery recycling. Therefore, Europe urgently needs to realize new industrial activities and avoid social unsustainability. The long-term objective of a policy plan is to promote independence from external sources of energy, materials, and other resources.

TI  - Automating the first and last mile? Reframing the 'challenges' of everyday mobilities
T2  - MOBILITIES
AB  - In this article, we interrogate the utility of conceptualising the 'first and last mile' (FLM) as a 'challenge' to be addressed through automated and integrated mobility services. We critically engage with the concept through a design anthropological approach which takes two steps so as: to complicate literatures that construct the FLM as a place where automated, service-based and micro-mobility innovations will engender sustainable modal choices above individual automobility; and to demonstrate how people's situated mobility competencies and values, shape social and material realities and future imaginaries of everyday mobilities. To do so, we draw on ethnographic research into everyday mobility practices, meanings and imaginaries in a suburban neighbourhood in Sweden. We show how locally situated mobilities both challenge the spatial and temporal underpinnings of the first and last mile concept, and resist universalist technology-driven automation narratives. We argue that instead of attempting to bridge gaps in seemingly linear journeys through automated systems, there is a need to account for the practices, tensions and desires embedded in everyday mobilities.

TI  - Interspecific and intraspecific variation of ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with <i>Eucalyptus</i> ecosystems as revealed by ribosomal DNA PCR-RFLP
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Gondwanan vegetation, and the Australian region in particular, is species rich for ectomycorrhizal fungi in epigeous and hypogeous forms with over 100 species recorded in small (I ha) patches of forests. Distinguishing co-occurring ectomycorrhizal fungi as root associations in native (natural or wildlands) vegetation or plantations and discriminating them from other larger basidiomycetes, e.g. wood and leaf litter decomposer fungi, places large demands on molecular identification, especially if interspecific similarities and intraspecific variation occur in target sequences. One hundred and nine species of larger basidiomycetes from a single forest location were characterised by PCR-RFLP profiles of two genomic regions (nuclear rDNA ITS and mtLSU). Over one-third of the species for which multiple isolates were tested showed intraspecific variation in either one or both genomic regions. This remarkably high variation questions previous assumptions about intraspecific ITS sequence variation and highlights the value of integrated molecular and morphological databases including voucher specimens. It also emphasises the value of molecular investigations that use more than one genomic region. Interspecific similarities were common among the Cortinariaceae, especially in the ITS region. Discrimination of most Cortinariaceae species was achieved using variation in the mtLSU region in conjunction with the ITS. This new information raises the possibilities that the ITS sequence is more conserved and the mtLSU more variable than among species of the other 23 families. In the other families, interspecific ITS variation was greater and the mtLSU profiles grouped species within families. The high variation in the two genomic regions indicated possible differences in the fungal population structure between two adjacent, differently managed blocks of Eucalyptus marginata forest. The significance of this variation to ecology, biodiversity assessment and ecosystem management are discussed.

TI  - Generation, functional annotation and comparative analysis of black spruce (<i>Picea mariana</i>) ESTs: an important conifer genomic resource
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - Background: EST (expressed sequence tag) sequences and their annotation provide a highly valuable resource for gene discovery, genome sequence annotation, and other genomics studies that can be applied in genetics, breeding and conservation programs for non-model organisms. Conifers are long-lived plants that are ecologically and economically important globally, and have a large genome size. Black spruce (Picea mariana), is a transcontinental species of the North American boreal and temperate forests. However, there are limited transcriptomic and genomic resources for this species. The primary objective of our study was to develop a black spruce transcriptomic resource to facilitate on-going functional genomics projects related to growth and adaptation to climate change.
   Results: We conducted bidirectional sequencing of cDNA clones from a standard cDNA library constructed from black spruce needle tissues. We obtained 4,594 high quality (2,455 5' end and 2,139 3' end) sequence reads, with an average read-length of 532 bp. Clustering and assembly of ESTs resulted in 2,731 unique sequences, consisting of 2,234 singletons and 497 contigs. Approximately two-thirds (63%) of unique sequences were functionally annotated. Genes involved in 36 molecular functions and 90 biological processes were discovered, including 24 putative transcription factors and 232 genes involved in photosynthesis. Most abundantly expressed transcripts were associated with photosynthesis, growth factors, stress and disease response, and transcription factors. A total of 216 full-length genes were identified. About 18% (493) of the transcripts were novel, representing an important addition to the Genbank EST database (dbEST). Fifty-seven di-, tri-, tetra-and penta-nucleotide simple sequence repeats were identified.
   Conclusions: We have developed the first high quality EST resource for black spruce and identified 493 novel transcripts, which may be species-specific related to life history and ecological traits. We have also identified full-length genes and microsatellite-containing ESTs. Based on EST sequence similarities, black spruce showed close evolutionary relationships with congeneric Picea glauca and Picea sitchensis compared to other Pinaceae members and angiosperms. The EST sequences reported here provide an important resource for genome annotation, functional and comparative genomics, molecular breeding, conservation and management studies and applications in black spruce and related conifer species.

AB  - The different steps in the development of the floodplain or overbank sediment sampling procedure for continental-scale geochemical mapping are described with examples from the Greek pilot project of the Western European Geological Surveys' Working Group on 'Regional Geochemical Mapping'. The Greek overbank and stream sediment results were compared statistically with those of the national regional stream sediment survey. The purpose was (1) to compare the geochemistry of overbank sediment, collected from a single site, with that of several tens or hundreds of regional stream sediment samples taken from the upstream drainage basin, and (2) to develop a cost-effective procedure to assess the geochemistry of a drainage basin. 'Composite' samples taken over the whole thickness of the overbank sediment sequence showed that element contents were close to the median, or within the interquartile range, of the same elements in the regional stream sediment samples. Overbank sediment samples collected from pre-defined intervals were not considered satisfactory, for they were taken across overbank sediment layers. Therefore, the method was subsequently refined by collecting samples from different overbank sediment layers, with the recommendation to collect samples at 25-cm intervals when thick layers of over 1 m were encountered.
   In selected river basins, surficial overbank and active stream sediments reflect contamination, whereas overbank sediment layers at depth show natural element contents, or pristine conditions. Such data are required for a realistic assessment of the degree of contamination of individual drainage basins. After considering results from Greece and other countries, it is recommended to sample both the surface overbank sediment (0-10 cm), and the deepest possible layer in order to measure pristine or pre-industrial conditions. The Greek results demonstrate that overbank sediments are useful for mapping natural geochemical conditions and baseline concentrations, as well as assessing anthropogenic contamination. The cost-effectiveness of overbank sediment sampling for the 'Global Geochemical Baselines' project of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and International Association of GeoChemistry (IAGC) is verified.

TI  - The effects of salt stones on moose browsing in managed forests in Finland
T2  - ALCES, VOL 34, NO 2 - 1998
CP  - 33rd North American Moose Conference and Workshop / 4th International Moose Symposium
AB  - Forest trees mainly used by moose are known to contain relatively small amounts of sodium. Young Scots pine stands are an important food source for moose in winter, and are often used for several years after the risk of stem damage is over. The lateral twigs of advanced pine saplings represent considerable browse reserves. The availability of sodium can gradually decrease in areas that are permanently subjected to high-density moose browsing. Sodium losses can be compensated by providing salt stones. The provision of salt stones was studied in relation to winter browsing during 1995-96 in central Finland. In autumn 1994 and 1995,a 10 kg stone was placed in each of 17 advanced young Scots pine stands. Experimental stands were selected according to the accessibility of food on the pines estimated on the basis of the height of the lowest living twigs. Each stand was inspected after winter in 1995 and 1996 using 17 plots (50 m(2)) centered around the stones. In 1996, 10 control stands without stones were also included. During the first winter, on average, 8.3 kg/ha of pine twigs were consumed by moose in stands with low twig accessibility and 72 kg/ha in those with high twig accessibility. The total consumption from saplings of different tree species was respectively 10.9 kg/ha and 79.3 kg/ha (P < 0.05) and the number of pellet groups 113 and 429 per ha(P < 0.05). During the second winter the amount of pine consumed was 7.1 kg/ha and 45.3 kg/ha (P < 0.05), respectively. In the control stands twig accessibility was also relatively high and the consumption (14.1 kg/ha) was significantly less than in salt stone stands with high twig accessibility (P < 0.01). The total consumption per ha was 11.7 kg, 53.3 kg, and 17.2 kg (P < 0.01), respectively, and the corresponding number of pellet groups per ha was 71,205, and 106 (P < 0.01). The average weight of the salt stones by the end of the winter was 4.8 kg in the low-consumption stands and 2.3 kg (P < 0.01)in the high-consumption stands. Twig biomass consumption correlated negatively with the weight of the salt stones (r = -0.67, P < 0.01). The amount of pine consumed by moose decreased with increasing distance from the salt stones. There was relatively little damage in seedling stands near the salt stone stands. Using salt to direct moose browsing in winter could be used to increase the residence time in habitats with a high food availability and thus reduce the risk of damage in young stands.

TI  - Aspects on cultivation of vegetable soybean in Sweden - cultivars, soil requirements, inoculation and nitrogen contribution
T2  - ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Background. Global soybean production is expected to double in the coming decades, driven by a request for animal feed to meet increasing meat consumption. Demand for locally produced food and feed is also increasing, making it interesting to explore the potential for soybean production in high-latitude regions. Scope. To present information on the potential for cultivating vegetable soybean, edamame, under cold-temperate conditions. Conclusions. For the successful establishment, sowing at low soil temperatures should be avoided. Commercial inoculants are effective, irrespective of soybean cultivar. There is no need to re-inoculate fields if the crop has been included in the crop rotation. Little nitrogen remains in the soil after harvest, resulting in a low risk of leaching but a need for nitrogen fertilisation of the following crop. Suitable vegetable soybean cultivars are available on the market and are preferred compared to cultivars intended for dry harvest. The cropping system needs to be improved, e.g. by moderating the microclimate by plastic tunnels, in order to secure harvest.

TI  - Exploring Perception of Vibrations from Rail: An Interview Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Rail transport is an environmentally responsible approach and traffic is expected to increase in the coming decades. Little is known about the implications for quality of life of populations living close to railways. This study explores the way in which vibrations from rail are perceived and described by these populations. The study took place in the Vastra Gotaland and Varmland regions of Sweden. A qualitative study approach was undertaken using semi-structured interviews within a framework of predetermined questions in participants' homes. A 26.3% response rate was achieved and 17 participants were interviewed. The experience of vibrations was described in tangible terms through different senses. Important emerging themes included habituation to and acceptance of vibrations, worry about property damage, worry about family members and general safety. Participants did not reflect on health effects, however, chronic exposure to vibrations through multimodal senses in individual living environments may reduce the possibility for restoration in the home. Lack of empowerment to reduce exposure to vibrations was important. This may alter individual coping strategies, as taking actions to avoid the stressor is not possible. The adoption of other strategies, such as avoidance, may negatively affect an individual's ability to cope with the stressor and their health.

TI  - Prospects for expanded utilization of biogas in Germany
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - The prospects for expanded utilization of biogas systems in German was analysed, by identifying the operational and policy factors affecting the complete chain of processes from implementation process for biogas plants, through to biogas production and utilization. It was found that the Renewable Energies Act (EEG) and energy tax reliefs provide bases for the support of expanded utilization. Upgrading of biogas to natural gas quality for utilization in the transportation sector was arguably the most promising technology that could support rapid utilization expansion. Sustainable deployment of biogas systems in light of the unstable feedstock prices and availability, and the need for subsidy-free operation in the long term requires: enhancement of feedstock flexibility and quality characteristics to maximise gas yield, and optimisation of the anaerobic digestion process management. Assessment of energy balance and potential environmental impacts of the integrated process chain provides a holistic assessment of sustainability. The results also support the development and foster of policies and framework for development of biogas as environmentally friendly energy resource, among a mix of renewable energy sources, hence, compete favourably with fossil fuels to enhance the prospects for expanded utilization.

TI  - Business models for sustainable biofuel transport: the potential for intermodal transport
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The use of solid wood biofuels for energy production in heating plants has increased drastically during the last decades. Great interest has been shown in replacing unsustainable road transport of wood fuel with more sustainable intermodal transport. This paper maps the common business models for biofuel transport in Sweden and suggests how these models may be developed to accommodate intermodal transport. A view of the biofuel supply chain as five overlapping networks (industry, material, operations, transport, and infrastructure) connected by four transaction markets (sourcing, operations, transport, and traffic) have been used. Four typical business models have been found: Regional/National Biofuel Company, Local Biofuel Company, Heating Plant Own Account, and Wood Processing Industry. Cooperation and vertical integration among the actors are important to reach the large transport volumes required for intermodal transport. Key issues to increase the intermodal potential are: increased vertical integration and cooperation, sharing of transport resources and infrastructure, joint purchases, outsourcing to expert actors, building trust and open communication, and not underestimating the complexity of intermodal transport. The results have implications for any actor interested in developing intermodal transport or policy measures. The contribution includes the new approach of developing business models by using the five-layer network-market model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF SELECTED EU COUNTRIES IN AGE OF GLOBALISATION A CASE STUDY
T2  - GLOBALIZATION AND ITS SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES, PTS I - VI
CP  - 17th International Scientific Conference on Globalization and Its Socio-Economic Consequences
AB  - Sustainable development has belonged to strategic priorities of all developed countries since the last century. Along with globalisation, a discussion has started whether globalisation and sustainable development are in opposite or not. Many various sustainable development indicators are recognized by The European Council. They are grouped in ten headline indicators (SDI 1-10). According to SDI 1-10 metrics, the European Council assesses sustainable development of each EU country. Developed EU countries are performing better in comparison with lower-income economies from the point of view of normalised sustainable development indicators. Four countries are selected for the case study evaluating their performance in sustainable development in age of globalisation. Sweden represents the group of the most successful countries in EU in sustainability building. On the other side, Poland represents developing EU countries with low values of indicators but with the highest benefit from the EU investments and funding. The Czech Republic and Estonia demonstrate middle developed countries within the EU. The selected countries have implement the EU-formulated sustainability development strategy in different ways with consideration of different country's historical background, location within the EU, population, GDP, achievement in socioeconomic development, sustainable consumption and production, social inclusion, demographic changes, public health, climate change and energy, sustainable transport, natural resources, global partnership, and good governance. Data are analysed by various methods and some results are visualised by means of cartographic outputs.

TI  - Forest fragmentation assessment using field-based sampling data from forest inventories
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Forest fragmentation has a relevant impact on biodiversity. An interesting alternative to estimate these indices is to use sampling data. This study aims to estimate aggregation index (AI) and the degree of clumping of forested landscape based on AI. The assessment was conducted using different point distances, inventory regions and cardinal directions. For this purpose, a dataset from one five-year periods (2007-2011) of the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) was used. The estimation of AI from field-based inventory can give us a general picture of the current status of forest landscape. The results also show that the estimated AI is a distance dependent function. The corresponding estimated variance of the index is smaller for longer distances. The obtained results indicate that the estimated variance depends on both sample size and pair point distances. Estimated AI showed different values in different cardinal directions. To compare two regions or a given region over time, a given point distance should be used. The main advantage of the applied procedure is that a range of AI values can be produced rather than a single number. Furthermore, in field-based inventory, the obtained results are more reliable, because one works implicitly with a single forest definition only.

TI  - From file to factory: Innovative design solutions for multi-storey timber buildings applied to project Zemblain Kalmar, Sweden
T2  - FRONTIERS OF ARCHITECTURAL RESEARCH
AB  - A file-to-factory process of computer technology is a way to both maximise efficiency throughout the building process, increase a building?s performance, and be able to add interesting architectural possibilities throughout the design phase. The authors investigate a novel approach that produces a set of building trajectories rather than a set of buildings, yet yields a series of build-able examples of those trajectories. This paper evaluates how this series of stacked multi-storey timber buildings can be both incorporated within a file-to-factory process, and give rise to creating new innovative solutions throughout the entire design and manufacturing process.
   This process is applied to a real Swedish project called Zembla. It redefines the notion of sprawl, turning it into a progressive tactics for linking the city fabric to rural areas. It is a post-sustainable file-to-factory-produced timber ground-scraper; soaring above ground and water, suggesting a new way of making city-sized buildings for the future.
   A plug-in grid-shell structure is designed to contain a minimal amount of timber elements, beams make up the lattice, cross-laminated panels add structural support, surfaces come together to form the living capsules. Having the structure undulate across the topography and touching the ground in as few places as possible uses the dichotomy between landscape and urbanism, bringing the city to the people living in less densified areas. Each living unit is customised to its topological conditions within the grid. (C) 2019 Higher Education Press Limited Company. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of KeAi.

TI  - Imprint of Climate Change on Pan-Arctic Marine Vegetation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - The Arctic climate is changing rapidly. The warming and resultant longer open water periods suggest a potential for expansion of marine vegetation along the vast Arctic coastline. We compiled and reviewed the scattered time series on Arctic marine vegetation and explored trends for macroalgae and eelgrass (Zostera marina). We identified a total of 38 sites, distributed between Arctic coastal regions in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway/Svalbard, and Russia, having time series extending into the 21st Century. The majority of these exhibited increase in abundance, productivity or species richness, and/or expansion of geographical distribution limits, several time series showed no significant trend. Only four time series displayed a negative trend, largely due to urchin grazing or increased turbidity. Overall, the observations support with medium confidence (i.e., 5-8 in 10 chance of being correct, adopting the IPCC confidence scale) the prediction that macrophytes are expanding in the Arctic. Species distribution modeling was challenged by limited observations and lack of information on substrate, but suggested a current (20002017) potential pan-Arctic macroalgal distribution area of 820.000 km(2) (145.000 km 2 intertidal, 675.000 km(2) subtidal), representing an increase of about 30% for subtidaland 6% for intertidal macroalgae since 1940-1950, and associated polar migration rates averaging 18-23 km decade(-1). Adjusting the potential macroalgal distribution area by the fraction of shores represented by cliffs halves the estimate (412,634 km(2)). Warming and reduced sea ice cover along the Arctic coastlines are expected to stimulate further expansion of marine vegetation from boreal latitudes. The changes likely affect the functioning of coastal Arctic ecosystems because of the vegetation's roles as habitat, and for carbon and nutrient cycling and storage. We encourage a pan-Arctic science- and management agenda to incorporate marine vegetation into a coherent understanding of Arctic changes by quantifying distribution and status beyond the scattered studies now available to develop sustainable management strategies for these important ecosystems.

TI  - Could the increased use of e-bikes (pedelecs) in Sweden contribute to a more sustainable transport system?
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (9TH ICEE) - SELECTED PAPERS
CP  - 9th International Conference on Environmental Engineering (ICEE)
AB  - The transport sector accounts for large proportions of greenhouse gas emissions and energy usage in Sweden, about 40% and 30%, respectively. Most of this, 93%, comes from road transports. There is, therefore, a strong political desire to reduce the use of fossil fuels in road transport. Several alternatives to fossil fuels have been discussed and, more recently, interest in electrically driven vehicles has increased substantially. Numerous studies have been made with respect to electric cars, but there is insufficient knowledge about the use of electrically assisted bicycles. With increased knowledge of the potential of these new bicycles, society can better meet the new trend. The main aim here is to present the effects of pedelec (in this paper referred to as e-bike) usage on CO2 emissions. Based on a web questionnaire sent to users of /e-bikes, this paper also attempts to gain insight into the actual usage and users' motives for buying e-bikes. The survey uses a sample consisting of customers who bought e-bikes through a retailer in Sweden. The results indicate that, contrary to other European studies, the majority of users switched from using their cars to e-bikes. Furthermore, most of the users were men with a driver's license and good access to a car. Calculations suggest that there are large gains to be made in terms of decreased CO2 emissions through a reduction in car mileage. Considering the CO2 reduction potential, and that e-bikes seem to attract men with good access to a car, the results are very interesting indeed. However, the survey is based on a small sample from a single retailer, and to what extent these users mirror the average e-bike user in Sweden is open to question. On the other hand, there is scant evidence to suggest that this would not be the case if standardized e-bikes are focused on.

TI  - Arctic tundra caribou and climatic change: Questions of temporal and spatial scales
T2  - GEOSCIENCE CANADA
CP  - Geological-Association-of-Canada Nuna Meeting - Nunavut Environment Assessment Transect on Looking to the Future: Nunavut Environments, Past and Present
AB  - Climatic changes have affected populations of caribou and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) at scales ranging from a single winter to tens of thousands of years, and from micro-habitats to entire continents. Individuals, populations and the species have adapted to these climatic changes, however, producing complex evolutionary and ecological issues requiring multi-scale, interdisciplinary research. Caribou populations wintering on arctic tundra may be most susceptible to the impacts of anthropogenic climatic change, given the low productivity of their forage, the severity and duration of the winters, and the physical barriers that limit dispersal.
   Sub-speciation of Rangifer tarandus hypothetically occurred during the Wisconsin glaciation. Recent genetic analyses support the current classification of subspecies, except that Baffin Island caribou may be distinct from barren-ground caribou, R. t. groenlandicus, on mainland Northwest Territories. Baffin caribou may have originated from a small ancestral population in a refugium on Baffin Island during the Wisconsin glaciation; or, they may have originated from immigrants after the Wisconsin glaciation, later experiencing a severe population bottleneck.
   On a shorter time scale, recent research has suggested that density-independent climatic events occurring over a single winter have caused at least one major population decline among Peary caribou on the Queen Elizabeth islands. Dramatic fluctuations of Greenland populations over the past 200 years have been attributed to climatic changes. However, the onset of some population changes on western Greenland have been inconsistent with the timing of climatic changes. Inuit knowledge of Baffin caribou and studies of tundra caribou on Svalbard, Coats and Southampton islands, South Georgia, and Norway suggest that caribou populations are affected primarily by density-dependent grazing impacts on forage that can last several decades. The discrepancy between these views may be caused by differences in the temporal and spatial scales over which scientific investigations have been conducted, and the measurement of only some ecological factors. Arctic ecological studies require extensive spatial and temporal data before impacts of anthropogenic climate change can be assessed. This will require a longterm interdisciplinary study integrating scientific data from several disciplines, as well as Inuit knowledge.

TI  - A consideration of rainfall, runoff and losses at Plynlimon in the context of long term hydrological variability in the UK and maritime Western Europe
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB  - Important questions concerning the resilience of current water management strategies have been raised by the recent volatility of climatic conditions across large parts of western Europe. The last decade, overall, has been exceptionally warm and there have been very large spatial and temporal variations in rainfall, river flows and aquifer recharge rates. Examination of historical rainfall and runoff records for parts of maritime western Europe confirms that there is no close modern parallel to the conditions experienced recently. Some-but far from complete-consistency with a number of favoured climate change scenarios may be recognised.
   Analyses of recent trends in lengthy rainfall and runoff series for the UK demonstrate significant regional differences and provide conflicting signals especially in relation to trends in catchment losses. Difficulties in reconciling the results from different areas may reflect both real hydroclimatological differences between catchments and variations in the precision of hydrometric time series-uncertainties in the assessment of areal precipitation in upland areas in particular. The dense monitoring networks at Plynlimon together with a rigorous data quality control programme underpins the value of the hydrometric datasets as important benchmarks against which to assess the significance of the very unusual patterns of rainfall and runoff which have characterised the recent past.
   This paper places the rainfall, runoff and losses data for Plynlimon in the perspective provided by a number of long hydrometric records for maritime western Europe. The representativeness of the Plynlimon base period is considered with particular reference to both the historical stability which typifies the great majority of European hydrometric time series and the recent extension in the recorded range of accumulated rainfall and runoff totals which has been identified in some regions (e.g. western Scotland and Norway). Particular attention is directed to changes in seasonal rainfall and runoff patterns and the recent increases in evaporative demands. Some of the implications for the overall water balance and for water resource management are considered.

TI  - Feral American mink <i>Neogale vison</i> continues to expand its European range: time to harmonise population monitoring and coordinate control
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - The American mink Neogale vison is an invasive alien species in Europe that threatens endemic biodiversity and can transmit zoonotic diseases, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The last attempt to map the geographic range of this species in Europe, at continental scale, dates back to 2007. We aimed to update the distribution map of the feral American mink and assess its temporal trends. The information we collected was critically analysed with the aim of improving future monitoring protocols and data collection. We gathered and standardised data from 34 databases, covering 32 countries. Through 3 five-year periods from 2007 to 2021, changes in range size, hunting bags and capture statistics were analysed. We also reviewed the current situation of mink farming in the different European countries and recorded population control schemes. The American mink is now widespread in the Baltic States, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Poland, Scandinavia, Spain and the UK. The species is reported to be absent in some areas (e.g. parts of the UK, Iceland and Norway). Data are deficient for several countries, mainly in south-eastern Europe. These findings indicate that, during the last 15 years, the species has continued to spread across the continent, increasing its potential extent of occurrence in most countries. Our effort to collect and harmonise data across international borders highlighted information gaps and heterogeneity in data quality. Updated distribution data on the species provided here will aid risk assessment and risk management policies. These actions require a coordinated effort for population monitoring at continental level. Monitoring effort and data collection should be intensified in south-eastern Europe to improve data on the current distribution of this invasive species.

TI  - Projected decrease in wintertime bearing capacity on different forest and soil types in Finland under a warming climate
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
AB  - Trafficability in forest terrain is controlled by ground-bearing capacity, which is crucial from the timber harvesting point of view. In winter, soil frost affects the most the bearing capacity, especially on peatland soils which have in general low bearing capacity. Ground frost similarly affects the bearing capacity of forest truck roads. A 20 cm thick layer of frozen soil or 40 cm thick layer of snow on the ground may already be sufficient for heavy forest harvesters. In this work, we studied the impacts of climate change on soil frost conditions and, consequently, on ground-bearing capacity from the timber harvesting point of view. The number of days with good wintertime bearing capacity was modelled by using a soil temperature model with a snow accumulation model and wide set of downscaled climate model data until the end of the 21st century. The model was calibrated for different forest and soil types. The results show that by the mid-21st century, the conditions with good bearing capacity will decrease in wintertime in Finland, most likely by about 1 month. The decrease in soil frost and wintertime bearing capacity will be more pronounced during the latter half of the century, when drained peatlands may virtually lack soil frost in most of winters in southern and western Finland. The projected decrease in the bearing capacity, accompanied with increasing demand for wood harvesting from drained peatlands, induces a clear need for the development of sustainable and resource-efficient logging practices for drained peatlands. This is also needed to avoid unnecessary harvesting damages, like rut formation on soils and damage to tree roots and stems.

TI  - Effects of water browning on freshwater biodiversity: the case of the predatory phantom midge <i>Chaoborus nyblaei</i>
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
AB  - Water browning, due to increased runoff of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (DOC), has recently gained considerable attention. While it is well settled how browning affects light regime and thereby aquatic primary production, other impacts on the aquatic biota is less explored. Water browning shelters against UV radiation, and may thus benefit range expansion of UV sensitive organisms, such as midges. We mapped occurrence of Chaoborids in 148 subalpine and alpine ponds in Norway, and identified an apparent threshold for their presence around 3 mg total organic carbon (TOC) l(-1). The field study was complemented with laboratory experiments on Chaoborus nyblaei (Zetterstedt, 1838), to test if this species is able to identify and select water colour (concentrations of DOC) for oviposition. Number of egg rafts on brown water tanks was significantly higher than in clear water tanks, indicating that C. nyblaei performs oviposition habitat selection. Chaoborids are effective predators in planktonic habitats, and our findings support the hypothesis that climate change may cascade through the ecosystem and promote range shifts of species due to alternated habitat frame conditions.

TI  - <i>Cystobasidium alpinum</i> sp nov and <i>Rhodosporidiobolus oreadorum</i> sp nov from European Cold Environments and Arctic Region
T2  - LIFE-BASEL
AB  - Over 80% of the Earth's environments are permanently or periodically exposed to temperatures below 5 degrees C. Cold habitats harbour a wide diversity of psychrophilic and psychrotolerant yeasts. During ecological studies of yeast communities carried out in cold ecosystem in the Italian Alps, Svalbard (Norway, Arctic region), and Portugal, 23 yeast strains that could not be assigned to any known fungal taxa were isolated. In particular, two of them were first identified as Rhodotorula sp., showing the highest degree of D1/D2 sequence identity with Cystobasidum laryngis accounted to only 97% with the type strain (C. laryngis CBS 2221). The other 21 strains, exhibiting identical D1/D2 sequences, had low identity (97%) with Rhodosporidiobolus lusitaniae and Rhodosporidiobolus colostri. Similarly, ITS sequences of the type strains of the most closely related species (93-94%). In a 2-genes multilocus D1/D2 and ITS ML phylogenetic tree, the studied strains pooled in two well separated and supported groups. In order to classify the new 23 isolates based on phylogenetic evidences, we propose the description of two novel species Cystobasidium alpinum sp. nov. and Rhodosporidiobolus oreadorum sp. nov.

TI  - Site factors are more important than salvage logging for tree regeneration after wind disturbance in Central European forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Wind disturbance is the main natural driver of forest dynamics in Central and Northern Europe, but little is known regarding the general patterns of tree regeneration following windthrow in this region. On the basis of 89 windthrow gaps, we quantified natural tree regeneration 10 and 20 years after wind disturbance, and identified the factors influencing tree regeneration dynamics, with a special emphasis on the post-storm management practices "salvage logging" and "no intervention". The sample encompasses gaps of >= 3 ha and total overstory mortality caused by wind disturbance. The gaps date back to the two catastrophic storm events Vivian in 1990 and Lothar in 1999. Gaps covered an ecologically diverse region extending over 20,000 km(2) and ranging from 370 to 1780 m a.s.l. on the Central Plateau and in the Alps of Switzerland (Central Europe). Regeneration status was assessed on six circular sample plots per windthrow gap in 2010/2011. We recorded soil pH, organic layer, post-windthrow treatment, elevation, aspect, slope, browsing damage, and presence of predominant vegetation cover. We compared regeneration density and composition in gaps with and without salvage logging and elucidated the most important environmental factors influencing tree regeneration after wind disturbance using generalized linear models (GLMs). Ten and twenty years after wind disturbance, late-successional tree species such as beech (Fagus sylvatica L) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) frequently dominated, independent of the post-storm treatment. Salvage logging did not negatively affect pre-storm regeneration and even positively influenced post-storm tree regeneration. GLMs revealed soil pH (+) and ground vegetation cover (-) to be the most important predictors of sapling density. The findings demonstrate that site factors have a stronger effect than post-storm treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Denuder/filter sampling of organic acids and organosulfates at urban and boreal forest sites: Gas/particle distribution and possible sampling artifacts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Carboxylic acids and organosulfates comprise an important fraction of atmospheric secondary organic aerosols formed from both anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. The partitioning of these compounds between the gas and particle phase is still unclear and further research is warranted to better understand the abundance and effect of organic acids and organosulfates on the formation and properties of atmospheric aerosols. This work compares atmospheric aerosols collected at an urban and a boreal forest site using two side-by-side sampling systems; a high volume sampler (HVS) and a low volume (LVS) denuder/filter sampling system allowing for separate collection of gas- and particle-phase organics. All particle filters and denuder samples were collected at H.C. Andersen Boulevard (HCAB), Copenhagen, Denmark in the summer of 2010, and at the remote boreal forest site at Hyytiala forestry field station in Finland in the summer of 2012. The chemical composition of gas- and particle-phase secondary organic aerosol was investigated by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q-TOFMS), with a focus on carboxylic acids and organosulfates. Results show gas-phase concentrations higher than those observed in the particle phase by a factor of 5-6 in HCAB 2010 and 50-80 in Hyytiala 2012. Although abundant in the particle phase, no organosulfates were detected in the gas phase at either site. Through a comparison of samples collected by the HVS and the LVS denuder/filter sampling system we evaluate the potential artifacts associated with sampling of atmospheric aerosols. Such comparison shows that particle phase concentrations of semi-volatile organic acids obtained from the filters collected by HVS are more than two times higher than concentrations obtained from filters collected using LVS denuder/filter system. In most cases, higher concentrations of organosulfates are observed in particles collected by HVS compared to samples collected by LVS denuder/filter sampling system. The present study shows that volatile organics may absorb onto filter materials in the HVS (and similar sampling systems without denuder) and furthermore undergo subsequent on-filter oxidation and sulfation resulting in formation of both organic acids and organosulfates.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions from different sewage sludge treatment methods in north
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The most sustainable method for treating sewage sludge depends strongly on the situation and local circumstances. In sparsely populated northerly areas are demanding boundary conditions, e.g. cold and long winter, long transport distances and low amounts of generated sludge. In this study, commonly used calculators and emissions coefficients for calculating the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sewage sludge treatment methods were assessed to create a calculator suitable for the Northern Finland context. The calculator was then used to determine which sewage sludge treatment method (composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), incineration (with and without thermal drying)) resulted in the lowest emissions of the GHG gases in different situations in Northern Finland. GHG gases included carbon dioxide (CO2; including biobased), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), measured as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)eq). According to the calculator, AD generated the least CO(2)eq emissions of all treatment methods studied. The second best option was incineration of sludge without thermal drying, while the third best was composting or incineration of sludge after thermal drying with e.g. fossil or other fuels. Most of the emissions were generated from the treatment process itself and the share of emissions generated during transport was minimal, despite the long transport distances when all CO2 emissions (incl. biobased) were considered. The role of users of the end-products and the possibility to use the CO2 generated were highly important when considering environmental perspective. These results can be utilised when selecting the locally most suitable method. In future, some of the treatment methods (i.e. AD, incineration) with CO2 capture could be considered carbon sinks, as they also remove biobased CO2 emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mercury in waste in the European Union: sources, disposal methods and risks
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
CP  - 6th International Conference on Mercury as a Global Pollutant
AB  - Over the recent decades, there has been widespread concern regarding the toxic impact of mercury (Hg) in the ecosystem due to its mobility, volatility and potential for bioaccumulation. Hg in fish and the aquatic environment is also a great problem in the Nordic region of the EU1 (European Union). Ho is classified as a dangerous chemical in the countries of the EU. Hg in the regulation of waste is regarded as a dangerous substance which, when contained in waste, is one of the properties, leading to a classification of waste as hazardous. Estimation of the quantity of Hg in waste within the EU countries is an important task although still incomplete.
   In this present study, Hg in waste in the EU has been estimated at around 990 metric tonnes (t) (including coal combustion products, landfills, chlor-alkali waste and incinerator slag) for the year 1995, and it is suggested that if complete information was available for the 15 member states, the amount would be 2-4 times larger. During the 1990s there were 45 Hg cell chlorine facilities in the EU and the amount of Hg in chlorine (Cl-2) was calculated at 95.2 t based on 14-17 g Hg t(-1) of Cl, capacity. The waste from coal-fired power plants in the EU member states contained about 16.5 t of Ha, which was transferred to products for road construction, and other industrial uses or stored in landfills. This Hg can then be exchanged between the atmospheric, aquatic and terrestrial compartments. Hg is occasionally recovered from waste, but this is often discouraged for economic reasons. Recovery units are found, for example, in Germany, France, Austria, and Sweden. The total amount of secondary Hg recovered from waste is not known. Metallic Hg and Hg-bearing waste are exported and imported from the EU member states, except for export from Sweden, which is banned by national legislation.
   The use of Hg in lamps and batteries is declining, and the Nordic countries, Germany and Austria have stringent regulations on the use of amalgam and Hg thermometers. It is found that 18% of municipal solid waste generated in the EU is burnt in incinerators, in order to decrease the volume. 88 t of Hg enter into the landfills of the EU through waste and residues from waste incineration. Prevention of the generation of hazardous waste containing Hg is one of the most challenging tasks for the EU, with regard to sustainable waste management. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measuring the impacts of weather variability on home-based trip chaining behaviour: a focus on spatial heterogeneity
T2  - TRANSPORTATION
AB  - Using the 2011 Swedish national travel survey data, this paper explores the influence of weather characteristics on individuals' home-based trip chaining complexity. A series of panel mixed ordered Probit models are estimated to examine the influence of individual/household social demographics, land use characteristics, and weather characteristics on individuals' home-based trip chaining complexity. A thermal index, the universal thermal climate index (UTCI), is used in this study instead of using directly measured weather variables in order to better approximate the effects of the thermal environment. The effects of UTCI are segmented into different seasons to account for the seasonal difference of UTCI effects. Moreover, a spatial expansion method is applied to allow the impacts of UTCI to vary across geographical locations, as individuals in different regions have different weather/climate adaptions. The effects of weather are examined in subsistence, routine, and discretionary trip chains. The results reveal that the 'ground covered with snow' condition is the most influential factor on the number of trips chained per trip chain among all other weather factors. The variation of UTCI significantly influences trip chaining complexity in autumn but not in spring and winter. The routine trip chains are found to be most elastic towards the variation of UTCI. The marginal effects of UTCI on the expected number of trips per routine trip chain have considerable spatial variations, while these spatial trends of UTCI effects are found to be not consistent over seasons.

TI  - Fauna associated with cold water gorgonians and sea pens
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
AB  - This paper describes the fauna associated with the gorgonians Paragorgia arborea (530 colonies), Primnoa resedaeformis (370 colonies) and Paramuricea placomus (68 colonies) and the sea pens Kophobelemnon stelliferum (584 colonies), Virgularia mirabilis (114 colonies), Funiculina quadrangularis (278 colonies) and Pennatula phosphorea (36 colonies) recorded by video from 18 locations on the Norwegian continental margin. The fauna associated with gorgonians was more diverse than that of the sea pens, with 21 and 12 taxa recorded. P. arborea had the highest number of associates; in total 38% of the colonies had associates on them. Amphipods dominated numerically contributing with 72% to the total number of taxa observed. Shrimps and the basket star Gorgonocephalus sp. were frequently observed on all gorgonian species. Rarefaction analysis indicated that the number of associated taxa was richest for P. resedaeformis. The fauna associated with the sea pens consisted mainly of shrimps and ophiuroids, for which the sea pens play a key role as a shelter and/or as a feeding platform. The ophiuroid Asteronyx loveni was only observed on E quadrangularis, which is used as a platform to reach better feeding conditions. The squat lobster Munida sp. was often observed close to the sea pen K. stelliferum which presumably offer shelter against predators. We argue that both sea pens and gorgonians play an important role as a habitat, and that a better understanding of their ecological importance is essential to develop sound scientific advice on sustainable habitats and fisheries management of deep-water ecosystems.

TI  - HYDROPROCESSING AND FUTURE DIESEL QUALITY
T2  - OIL GAS-EUROPEAN MAGAZINE
AB  - The diesel engine offers a very attractive option for road transportation It is intrinsically robust, clean and efficient, and is therefore increasingly popular worldwide.
   Environmental concerns are driving towards lower exhaust emissions, and the diesel engine star ts from a good position in that its hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide emissions can only be matched by gasoline engines equipped with three way catalysts. However, particulate emissions are a con cern and this is the main driving force towards tighter diesel fuel specifications.
   These two factors - increasing demand for diesel fuel and tighter specifications - may conflict with one another because the processing required to improve quality reduces the gasoil yield on crude and thus the availability of diesel.
   Shell has developed a portfolio of hydroprocessing technologies to upgrade the quality of gasoil components at very high yields. These technologies can meet the highest quality demands as, for example, demonstrated in Sweden by the commercial production of Class I Gasoil (Green Diesel) at the Gothenburg refinery.
   However, application of these advanced technologies should be assessed carefully. Cost increases rapidly, not only in capex and opex, bur also in terms of energy requirements, CO2 emissions and diesel availability. Environmental benefits im prove only gradually or not at all; for example, it has been shown that reducing the aromatics content has no effect on particulate emissions. Therefore a balanced approach is needed, taking all factors into account (cost, air quality, equipment & fuel developments), and it should be appreciated that as a result the optimum solution will differ across the world.

TI  - Detection of REEs with lightweight UAV-based hyperspectral imaging
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) supply is important to ensure the energy transition, e-mobility and ultimately to achieve the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Conventional exploration techniques usually rely on substantial geological field work including dense in-situ sampling with long delays until provision of analytical results. However, this approach is limited by land accessibility, financial status, climate and public opposition. Efficient and innovative methods are required to mitigate these limitations. The use of lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides a unique opportunity to conduct rapid and non-invasive exploration even in socially sensitive areas and in relatively inaccessible locations. We employ drones with hyperspectral sensors to detect REEs at the earth's surface and thus contribute to a rapidly evolving field at the cutting edge of exploration technologies. We showcase for the first time the direct mapping of REEs with lightweight hyperspectral UAV platforms. Our solution has the advantage of quick turn-around times (< 1 d), low detection limits (< 200 ppm for Nd) and is ideally suited to support exploration campaigns. This procedure was successfully tested and validated in two areas: Marinkas Quellen, Namibia, and Siilinjarvi, Finland. This strategy should invigorate the use of drones in exploration and for the monitoring of mining activities.

TI  - Colonization of the Scottish islands via long-distance Neolithic transport of red deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>)
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) have played a key role in human societies throughout history, with important cultural significance and as a source of food and materials. This relationship can be traced back to the earliest human cultures and continues to the present day. Humans are thought to be responsible for the movement of a considerable number of deer throughout history, although the majority of these movements are poorly described or understood. Studying such translocations allows us to better understand ancient human wildlife interactions, and in the case of island colonizations, informs us about ancient human maritime practices. This study uses DNA sequences to characterise red deer genetic diversity across the Scottish islands (Inner and Outer Hebrides and Orkney) and mainland using ancient deer samples, and attempts to infer historical colonization events. We show that deer from the Outer Hebrides and Orkney are unlikely to have originated from mainland Scotland, implying that humans introduced red deer from a greater distance. Our results are also inconsistent with an origin from Ireland or Norway, suggesting long-distance maritime travel by Neolithic people to the outer Scottish Isles from an unknown source. Common haplotypes and low genetic differentiation between the Outer Hebrides and Orkney imply common ancestry and/or gene flow across these islands. Close genetic proximity between the Inner Hebrides and Ireland, however, corroborates previous studies identifying mainland Britain as a source for red deer introductions into Ireland. This study provides important information on the processes that led to the current distribution of the largest surviving indigenous land mammal in the British Isles.

TI  - The failure failure of agri-environment measures to promote and conserve conserve for grassland biodiversity in Slovenia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - The effectiveness of four grassland-specific agri-environment measures (AEM), implemented in the frame of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in the period 2007-2013 in Slovenia was studied. We questioned whether the measures - "extensive grassland maintenance"; "preservation of special grassland habitats"; "preservation of grassland habitats for butterflies" and "bird conservation in humid extensive meadows in Natura 2000 sites" did genuinely support the conservation (maintenance or improvement) of high nature value (HNV) grasslands in Slovenia. The HNV grasslands were defined on the basis of national fine-resolution field mapping of habitat types. Two main outcomes emerged: AEM did not reach the vast majority of HNV grasslands in Slovenia (only 3%); the proportion of HNV grassland area included in AEM was negligibly low (1). Moreover, even this very limited interest in AEM did not target only grasslands of HNV, but any permanent grasslands regardless of their conservation value: forty-one percent (41%) of the grassland areas included in the AEM were actually non-HNV grasslands (2). The absence of pre-selection criteria for grasslands along with an absence of monitoring of the effectiveness and efficiency of the measures and low interest in the subsidies among farmers, led to almost complete failure of the AEM to promote and conserve species-rich extensive grasslands in Slovenia between 2007 and 2013. Even with some minor differences, the same concept was maintained for the currently running EAFRD 2014-2020, which raises serious concern.

TI  - Increased growth and phenolic compounds in bilberry (<i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> L.) following forest clear-cutting
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is a keystone species in boreal forests, but the few studies available concerning influence of forestry on bilberry growth, reproduction and chemical composition reveal conflicting results. We compared bilberry from mature stands and clear-cuts in a spruce forest landscape in south-central Norway, and applied the following experimental treatments: fertilisation, root cutting and flower removal to evaluate the effect of resource availability. During the second growing season we estimated bilberry shoot biomass as well as flowering and berry production, while bilberry shoots and leaves were collected in early summer and autumn for analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phenolic compound concentrations. The biomass of bilberry shoots was highest on clear-cuts and after fertilisation. All groups of phenolic compounds were also highest on clear-cuts, and phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in non-fertilised plots. Catechins and condensed tannins were highest in autumn, while phenolic acids and flavonols were highest in summer. Removal of flowers and root cutting had no effects. Nitrogen concentrations in shoots were highest in summer, after fertilisation, and when flowers were removed. The amount of flowers was highest in non-fertilised, mature forest sites, while the berry production was not significantly affected by any of the treatments or the site type. Our results indicate that in the studied area, the performance of bilberry is not negatively affected by clear-cutting, it rather seems that the environment on the clear-cuts give the plants abundant resources for enhancements both in growth, reproduction and defence compared with the mature forest sites. In the eyes of a herbivore, however, the quality of bilberry shoots as a feed-plant may be reduced on a clear-cut because of the higher phenolic concentration.

TI  - Particular Interests Sacrificed for the General Good: The Protagonists of the Great Northern War at the Perpetual Diet of Regensburg Between their Own Interests and those of the Empire
T2  - HISTORISCHES JAHRBUCH
AB  - The Perpetual Imperial Diet was a showplace for the conflict that escalated in the Baltic Sea area during the Great Northern War of 1700-1721. In 1712, a kind of 'paper war' came into being between the emissary of the Empire's Swedish provinces and the representative of Electoral Saxony. Both endeavored to dissolve the competing roles of their princes as external monarchs and members of the Empire in favor of their role as sovereigns of Imperial Estates. In this way, they hoped to profit from the conflict -balancing measures of the Imperial constitution. To that end, they attempted to persuade the Imperial Estates that they shared a common framework of values and norms with the Estates. In doing so, both parties also offered their own interpretations of events. In this way, the Imperial Diet became a forum for regulated conflict management, for which the Reich constitution laid down structures and procedures.

TI  - Entrepreneurial Sustainability Engagement of Insiders Initiating Energy System Transition
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The central point in this article is that energy system transition can be initiated by a team of individuals interacting entrepreneurially beyond their different home-grounds in business, research, or regional development. Such entrepreneurial engagement of insiders with belongings to an established socio-technical system has not been captured in prevalent sustainability transitions or entrepreneurship perspectives. Insiders have mostly been expected to act within (and not outside) of their role expectations. This study investigates who individuals initiating energy transition are, what motives they have, and how they accomplish institutional change. The purpose is to qualify a perspective that can help us better appreciate how transitions, such as in energy systems, can be initiated. The new perspective recognizes the importance of insiders, their personal sustainability beliefs, their choice to teamwork entrepreneurially, and their narratives about the initiative affecting institutional change. It explains how transition in a heavily regulated Swedish energy system can occur. Implications are drawn for research, policy and entrepreneurial teamwork.

TI  - The impact of future climate change on bean cultivation in the Prespa Lake catchment, northern Greece
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
AB  - Local impact projections for the Prespa Lake catchment (northern Greece) were generated using the regional climate model RCA4 of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, as driven by the global climate model MPI-ESM-LR of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology under two RCP future emissions scenarios: RCP 4.5 (some mitigating measures applied) and RCP 8.5 (business as usual). These projections indicate that temperatures in this region will rise statistically significantly-by 1-3 degrees C (RCP 4.5) and 3-6 degrees C (RCP 8.5)-by the end of the century. Future wet season precipitation is not projected to change, but precipitation variability and maximum dry spell (P < 1 mm) length will increase statistically significantly. Bean cultivation using current species and methods will be adversely affected by future climate change. Temperature-based indices that are relevant to the seed and growth stages point to deteriorating conditions in the future under both climate change scenarios tested. Harmful days with mean temperatures of > 16 degrees C during the seed stage (15/04-15/05) will increase, while days with maximum temperatures that fall within the optimum range (21 degrees C < T-max < 26 degrees C) during the growth and blossoming stages (15/05-30/08) will decrease. Current irrigation methods using lake water will become more difficult to sustain in the future, as very low lake levels will become more frequent. Based on these simulations, we recommend that heat- and drought-resistant varieties of bean crops that do not require (much) irrigation should be prioritized and promoted for climate-proof agriculture. Sustainable irrigation methods, such as drip irrigation and the use of recycled wastewater, should be selected in the future. These recommendations will be integrated into local farming practice and policy recommendations for regional agricultural adaptation measures.

TI  - WHAT ABOUT THE HYPERLOCALS? The drivers, organization and economy of independent news media in Sweden
T2  - JOURNALISM PRACTICE
AB  - Using a survey of a sample of hyperlocal actors in Sweden (N = 178), this article examines preconditions, motivations and sustainability for hyperlocal media operations, outside the traditional media chains, in order to provide a picture of their function in the current media landscape, and to further build on the understanding of the hyperlocal business model. This study extends the hyperlocal definition by including media platforms other than websites. The results show that the operations indeed aim to support and foster citizenship, strengthen democracy and mirror the local community. At the same time, as shown by other studies, the fact that they are not large-scale, highly profitable operations may challenge their sustainability. Nonetheless, most of them claim to be profitable, largely because of the print platform, and have a positive outlook on the future. Revenues from advertising and readership are currently less substantial for Web-based operations, which reinforces the need to broaden the definition of hyperlocal publishing platforms when talking about financial sustainability. Currently, hyperlocal media in Sweden, with small resources and a lower publishing frequency, cannot be viewed as a replacement of established media, but play important roles as complementary alternative voices and contribute to media plurality in the local community.

TI  - Spectacular language and creative marketing in a Singapore tailor shop
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUALISM
AB  - A tailor shop located in Singapore's Chinatown is explored as a case of creative linguistic marketing practice, examining how such practice can be understood in relation to the interaction of local and global forces on the linguistic landscape. The shop uses a range of Scandinavian semiotic resources (language and artefacts) which for us, coming upon the shop, seemed unexpected or, using Sweetland's term, spectacular. Following in the spirit of linguistic landscape analysis, we investigate one particular dimension of the visual semiosis of this shop, namely the signage. Drawing upon photographic and interview data, we trace the history of this semiosis, charting how its purpose and meaning has changed over time. What emerges from our study is that what seems idiosyncratic to researchers can have rich local meaning in context. What appears to be an outlier on the linguistic landscape can offer insight into situated experiences. In this light, our study of a shop and its semiotic landscape contributes to an understanding of the changing sociolinguistic patterns and creativity that occur in spaces like Singapore, and that reflect not just contemporary but also previous eras of globalisation and contact across historical, political and cultural borders.

TI  - Evolution of anthropogenic aerosols in the coastal town of Salina Cruz, Mexico: part III. Size-segregated elemental composition analysed by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - Heavy metals in various size modes of the atmospheric aerosol are a concern for human health. Their and other elements' concentrations are indicative for anthropogenic and natural aerosol sources. Si, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Hg, and Pb were determined as a complementary contribution to a study on aerosol cycling during the wet season, June 2004, in a humid, subtropical climate, i.e. in the city of Salina Cruz, situated on the Pacific coast of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (16.2 degrees N, 95.2 degrees W), Mexico. For mass ( gravimetry) and elemental analyses, particles were collected by a Berner low-pressure round nozzle cascade impactor using four stages corresponding to 0.1-0.25, 0.25-1.0, 1.0-4.0, and 4-16 mm of aerodynamic particle size. The impaction plates were modified such that approx. 1/6 consisted of a plastic support (Persplex(R)) for total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF). The elements' total content was determined by TXRF without any further sample pretreatment. Limits of quantification (LOQ) for elemental content in individual impactor stages corresponded to 25-60 ng m(-3) for Si; 0.8-4 ng m(-3) for Cl, K, Ca, Ti, and V; 3-20 pg m(-3) for Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, and Zn; and 7-50 pg m(-3) for As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Hg, and Pb. In some samples, however, high blank values for the supports gave an LOQ 6-19 ng m(-3) for Cl; 3-7 ng m(-3) for Ca; 3-7 ng m(-3) for Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn; and 60-70 ng m(-3) for Pb. The influence of local natural, industrial, and vehicle traffic sources for heavy-metal mobilization was obvious. Heavy-metal abundances did not coincide with regionally distributed pollutants. V and Ni were found at particularly elevated levels advected with the sea breeze, which points to ships as sources. Br and Pb were found at particularly low levels. The concentrations of Br, Rb, Sr, and Pb were found below LOQ at least in some, As, Co, Se, and Hg in all of the samples. The elements' characteristic differences in mass size distributions were obvious despite the coarse size resolution. During the cycling of air masses from land to sea and back again, enrichment of super-micrometre particles in the near ground aerosol was observed under dry weather conditions. Rain preferentially removed the large particles with which heavy metals have been associated.

TI  - Classification of the Lakkasuo peatland ecosystem using remote sensing
T2  - Environmental Informatics, Proceedings
CP  - Conference of the International-Society-for-Environmental-Information-Sciences on Environmental Informatics
AB  - This study focused on classification of sample plots on a peatland ecosystem in Southern Finland using remote sensing. A new hierarchical peatland classification system was developed consisting of four classification levels, and in which two, two, seven and sixteen biotope types were included. The study area was at Lakkasuo near the Forestry Field Station of Helsinki University in Southern Finland. 496 plots were sampled and measured using 50 meter square grids. Estimates were based on 250 plots and 246 plots were used for testing. Traditional peatland classification was used as a starting point and refinements to the classification were further made using remote sensing data. The auxiliary data included digitized blue, green and red channels obtained by scanning a negative infrared aerial photograph taken in 1995. For comparison, Landsat TM images of seven channels taken in 1995 were also used.
   The method is similar to two phase sampling for unsupervised stratification. Optimal window size for obtaining the window values from the digital aerial photos for each biotope type in the classification system was studied. The effectiveness of classifying peatland ecosystems using digital aerial photos were assessed. The effect of location variables including photo coordinates, distance between plots, the principal point of the photo, and azimuth, zenith and camera angle of plot were analyzed for calibration purposes. Texture features from digital aerial photos were analyzed and used for stratification. The window values and texture features from the digital aerial photos, and the radiation values from TM images were used separately, as well as together with the location variables for stratification of the first phase plots. There were, thus, a total of 16 combinations of auxiliary data to generate the stratifications. Correct percentages and Kappa values of the stratifications were used for comparing and assessing the accuracy of classifying peatland ecosystems.
   The results from the digital aerial photos showed that the combination of the window values in blue and red channels and six location variables led to the best classification. The total correct percentage and Kappa value were 90.9% and 0.416 for separating peatland and mineral soil, 92.9% and 0.849 for discriminating drained and undrained peatlands, 68.6% and 0.597 for classifying 7 biotope types, and 59.5% and 0.544 for classifying 16 biotope types. In addition, the optimal window size was different for each of the biotope types and digital channels. The classification was improved by location variables. TM images in addition to digital aerial photos did not improve the results.

TI  - All in the ears: unlocking the early life history biology and spatial ecology of fishes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS
AB  - Obtaining biological and spatial information of the early life history (ELH) phases of fishes has been problematic, such that larval and juvenile phases are often referred to as the 'black box' of fish population biology and ecology. However, a potent source of life-history data has been mined from the earstones (otoliths) of bony fishes. We systematically reviewed 476 empirical papers published between 2005 and 2012 (inclusive) that used otoliths to examine fish ELH phases, which has been an area of increasing attention over this period. We found that otolith-based research during this period could be split into two broad themes according to whether studies examined: (i) biological objectives related to intrinsic processes such as larval and juvenile age, growth and mortality, and/or (ii) spatial objectives, such as habitat use, dispersal and migration. Surprisingly, just 24 studies (5%) explored a combined biological-spatial objective by simultaneously exploiting biological and spatial information from otoliths, suggesting much more scope for such integrated research objectives to be answered via the use of multiple otolith-based techniques in a single study. Mapping otolith analytical techniques across these two approaches revealed that otolith structural analysis was mainly used to investigate biological processes, while otolith chemical analyses were most often applied to spatial questions. Heavy skew in research effort was apparent across biomes, with most (62%) publications specific to marine species, despite comparable levels of species richness and the importance of freshwater taxa (just 15% of papers). Indeed, around 1% (380 species) of a possible 31400+ extant species were examined in our surveyed papers, with a strong emphasis on temperate marine species of commercial value. Potential model species for otolith-based ELH ecology research are arising, with the eel genus Anguilla (24 studies) and the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolis (14 studies) attracting more research effort than most other taxa. While there is a preponderance of common techniques (e.g. daily otolith increment counts, increment widths), novel techniques such as transgenerational marking and computed X-ray tomography, are increasingly being applied in published studies. The application of an integrative approach based on a combination of emerging techniques and traditional methods holds promise for major advances in our understanding of ELH fish ecology and to shine light into the 'black box' of fish ecology.

TI  - Presence of microplastics in benthic and epibenthic organisms: Influence of habitat, feeding mode and trophic level
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - The exponential production and use of plastics has generated increasing environmental release over the past decades, and microplastics (MPs) have been reported across all the oceans. Field studies have documented the occurrence of MPs in several species, but important knowledge gaps still remain. In the present study, we characterized the distribution of MPs in ten sediment-dwelling and epibenthic species representative of different habitat, feeding modes and trophic levels within the inner Oslofjord (Oslo, Norway), an area subjected to moderate anthropogenic pressures. Analysed species included fish, bivalves, echinoderms, crustaceans and polychaetes. MPs were present in all the species with a frequency up to 65% of positive individuals for some species. In most cases, 1 or 2 MPs were found per individual, but some organisms contained up to 7 particles. A total of 8 polymer typologies were identified, with PE and PP being the most common according to our extraction protocol. MP sizes ranged from 41 mu m to lines as long as 9 mm. Our results indicate that occurrence of MPs in analysed biota is not influenced by organism habitat or trophic level, while characteristics and typology of polymers might be significantly affected by feeding mode of organisms.

TI  - Determinants of serum manganese levels in an Italian population
T2  - MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS
AB  - Manganese (Mn) is both essential and toxic for humans, mainly depending on the total levels and its species. Main sources of exposure include food and air pollution, particularly motorized traffic. We sought to determine the potential influence of these sources on serum total levels of Mn and Mn species. We selected a random sample of municipality residents from an Italian urban municipality, from whom we collected detailed personal information, dietary habits and a blood sample for serum Mn determination. We also assessed outdoor air Mn exposure, by modeling levels of particulate matter <= 10 mu m (PM10) from motorized traffic at the residence of geocoded subjects. Serum Mn species generally showed higher levels in males and positive correlation with age, while no such differences were found according to smoking habits or use of dietary supplements. Among nutrients, only iron intake showed a relation with Mn [ an inverse correlation with Mn-ferritin (Mn-Fer) and a direct one with inorganic-Mn (Inorg-Mn)]. Meat consumption directly correlated and fish and seafood inversely correlated with total Mn, Mn-transferrin (Mn-Tf) and Mn-citrate (Mn-Cit). Fruits and vegetables, including legumes and nuts, generally showed a positive correlation with all Mn species, especially Mn-Cit, and an inverse one with Inorg-Mn. Odds ratios (ORs) of having serum Mn levels above median value increased with increasing PM10 tertiles, with an OR for highest-to-lowest tertile of 7.40 (1.36-40.25) in multivariate analysis. Analyses for Mn species did not highlight a clear comparable pattern. In conclusion, our results seem to demonstrate that PM10 exposure positively influences total Mn serum levels, while single Mn species show conflicting results.

TI  - A pre-European settlement pollen-climate calibration set for Minnesota, USA: developing tools for palaeoclimatic reconstructions
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim The bias in modern North American pollen assemblages by landscape disturbance from Euro-American settlement has long been overlooked in the construction of pollen-climate transfer functions. Our aim is to examine this problem and to develop an unbiased pre-settlement pollen-climate transfer function, and to test its performance and inference power in comparison with commonly used techniques.
   Location Minnesota, USA, is of palaeoclimatic interest because within the state are located two continental-scale ecotones, controlled by temperature and available moisture. Shifts of these ecotones can be tracked using palaeoecological techniques.
   Methods Using a data set of pre-settlement pollen assemblages from 133 lakes, which were coupled to climate data from the earliest instrumental records (i.e. 1895-1924), a pre-settlement pollen-climate data set was developed that lacked the influence of anthropogenic landscape disturbance. A corresponding modern pollen data set (from lake sediment core tops) and a modern climate (i.e. 1961-90) data set were also developed. The two pollen sets were compared to demonstrate the effects of landscape disturbance from human activities. Ordination (redundancy analysis with Monte Carlo permutation tests) and regression techniques (generalized linear modelling) were used to establish the relationships between the early instrumental climate variables and pre-settlement pollen assemblages and individual taxa, respectively. Transfer functions for the most suitable climate variables (i.e. those forming a minimal set of non-collinear climate variables that explained the greatest amount of pollen variance) were developed from the pre-settlement data set using bootstrapping.
   Results Comparison of pre-settlement pollen and modern pollen showed an over-representation of Ambrosia, Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae, and an under-representation of arboreal taxa (e.g. Pinus, Quercus, Ostrya) in the modern assemblages. Not surprisingly, ordination and regression techniques showed a strong relationship between the early instrumental climate variables and pre-settlement pollen assemblages and taxa. Transfer functions were developed for May and February mean temperature and available moisture. Pre-settlement transfer functions substantially improved the root mean squared error by 37-72% in comparison with modern transfer functions inferring pre-settlement conditions, suggesting that the modern transfer functions have poorer predictive abilities.
   Main conclusions For climatic reconstructions, there can be a serious distortion of inferences based solely on modern pollen-climate data sets in regions where anthropogenic landscape disturbance has occurred. By using historical climate data, coupled with pre-disturbance pollen assemblages, robust transfer functions for temperature and effective moisture were developed.

TI  - Understanding user practices in mobility service systems: Results from studying large scale corporate MaaS in practice
T2  - TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY
AB  - Mobility as a Service (MaaS), where different shared modes of transportation are bundled into one easily accessible service, plays an important role in the shift towards more sustainable transport systems. In this article, we present empirical research with the aim to understand how the barriers to increased shared travel with MaaS can be lowered. The concept of corporate MaaS (CMaaS) is introduced, and empirical results are presented from a study of CMaaS at a workplace of 14,000 employees in Sweden. The findings are based on 77 interviews with CMaaS users, performed in four iterative rounds using service design methods. Social practice theories are used as analytical lens to attempt to understand travel practices in the context of CMaaS. As CMaaS (and MaaS) are socio-technical systems, several perspectives need to be integrated in order to reach this understanding; all system components, including materials (e.g. the user application, the transport modes), competences (knowledge of how to use the materials), and meanings (understandings of travel habits, lifestyle choices, and employer relations) need to be analysed. Through this analytical lens, three barriers to adoption of CMaaS and sustainable transport were identified: inadequate integration of the internal transport system with external transport systems; corporate policy, culture and norms that conflict with using the services; and system limitations due to laws and regulations. All these barriers are also relevant for understanding MaaS services in general.

TI  - The multi-year comparisons of chlorophyll and sea ice in Greenland Sea and Barents Sea and their relationships with the North Atlantic Oscillation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
AB  - The Arctic Ocean (AO) has experienced very significant warming in recent decades with clear impacts on the extent and depth of sea ice cover. Sea ice serves as a primary habitat and plays an important role in the AO marine food web. The surface distributions of chlorophyll_a (CHL), sea ice concentration (ICE), sea surface temperature (SST) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are analyzed in the study region (20 degrees W-50 degrees E, 70 degrees N80 degrees N) over the decade (2003-2014). This region spans the Barents Sea (BS), Norwegian (NS) and Greenland Sea (GS). In general, the peak of spatial averaged CHL in the BS was about 60% higher than the GS. Due to elevated SST in the southern BS, CHL was much higher especially in 2010 and 2013. In 2011, there was a strong meridional gradient in CHL decreasing from south to north of the BS, and also a strong zonal gradient from the southern GS to the southern BS. The northern GS had higher CHL than the southern GS due to the increased ice melting and nutrient-enriched runoff from east Greenland glaciers to the northern and western coastal regions of the GS. Seasonal peaks of spatially averaged CHL occurred in April or May and were about two weeks earlier in the BS than the GS. Higher ice melt in the northern BS was the main reason for CHL blooms especially in 2010 and 2011. Earlier and more extensive ice melting and a persistent negative NAO index causing atmospheric circulation patterns that favoured ice loss were the possible drivers of enhanced phytoplankton blooms in 2010. A previous negative winter NAO is thought to be linked to an increase in ICE in the following spring. NAO is mostly negative during spring in the GS. Sea ice melt was positively correlated with CHL in the northern sector of the study region.

TI  - Manufacturing and Testing the Panels with a Transverse Texture Obtained from Branches of Norway Spruce (<i>Picea abies</i> L. Karst.)
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - As a result of the imbalances in the forestry market and the increased demand for wood products worldwide, the resource of branches resulting from the exploitation of a forest has attracted special attention from researchers, in order to use these secondary resources judiciously and obtain an added value superior to classic uses. In this context, the current research took into consideration the use of spruce branches to obtain panels with a transverse structure. The work methodology has focused on the process of obtaining panels with a transverse texture and on determining the physical-mechanical properties of the created panels. The results regarding the panel density (determined as a ratio between mass and volume of specimens) showed about 693 kg/m(3), static bending resistance parallel to the face of 5.5 N/mm(2), resistance of adhesion of 5.6 N/mm(2), shear strength parallel to face of 4.1 N/mm(2), and screw pull-out resistance perpendicular to the face of 31.3 N/mm(2), highlighting that the properties were in accordance with the European standards and that the panels obtained were suitable for obtaining furniture products with a special aesthetic aspect. As a general conclusion of the research, it can be stated that spruce branches are a sustainable wood resource with great possibilities to add more value in the form of panels with a traverse texture.

Several methods and models within operations research have been applied to explore such decision contexts, but little is reported on the problem structure itself and the key values, concerns, and uncertainties that apply to them. The objective of the paper is to present a problem structure for acquisition of marine emission reduction technologies in the Norwegian ferry fleet drawing on methods from decision science and systems engineering. To attain this objective, we utilize the SPADE methodology, which details five problem-solving activities covering stakeholders, problem formulation, alternatives, decisions, and continuous evaluation. Each activity is informed by data collected through stakeholder interviews and literature analysis to establish an initial representation of acquisition decision issues. To keep a consistent and traceable problem structure, we provide a stakeholder diagram, value network, systemigram, and decision hierarchy centered around stakeholders and their values. These models may serve to inform decision-makers in the development and appraisal of emission reduction technologies and strategies. The paper demonstrates the application of systems engineering as a problem-structuring framework for complex, multidimensional marine technology acquisition decisions.

TI  - Crossing borders - European forest reproductive material moving in trade
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Forest reproductive material (FRM) is constantly traded between European countries, but bilateral trade statistics on a European scale are limited. For the first time we analysed national datasets according Council Directly 1999/105/EC for the tree species Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, P. pinaster, Fagus sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus robur, Q. rubra, and Q. petraea. Based on the period 2004-2014 we (i) quantified the amount and identified European FRM trade and production routes, (Ii) applied a gravity model of economic trade to examine the determinants of trade, (iii) discussed the putative genetic impact of transferred FRM on native tree populations, and (iv) considered legislation and documentation processes to their compliance, purpose, and benefit in producing data relevant to sustainable forest management. On average, 30 million plants and 400,000 kg seeds were annually traded. About 85% of traded seedlings were Norway spruce. Coniferous FRM trade is dominated by Scandinavian and Baltic countries, while broad-leaved species are extensively traded in Central Europe. FRM trade and production are interconnected on a multinational level, and besides domestic FRM, most countries are also trading with foreign material. The results of the gravity model indicate that among other significant factors the bilateral trade is driven by geographical distance, currency, and forestry contribution to the domestic gross product. As no detailed data on seed transfer were made available by most countries, the total FRM transfer is biased and probably underestimated.

TI  - Problems of trophic status diagnosis in the forest habitats on former arable alluvial soils
T2  - SYLWAN
AB  - The morphology and properties of the post-arable soils that influence the trophic status of forest habitats on the Barycz river terraces (south-western Poland) were analyzed. The fieldwork included the characterization of the soil, tree layer, and the vegetation of the forest floor, as required for the forest habitat evaluation. In the collected soil samples, a set of physico-chemical analysis was carried out, that included: soil texture, bulk density, pH in KCl and water, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, hydrolytic acidity, base cations, and the content of plant-available phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Sandy post-arable soils in the Barycz valley have a thick, double- or triple-layered ploughed humus horizon, and the high stock of humified organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus, that emphasizes anthropogenic transformation of soils and differentiates them from the natural soils of river valleys. The diagnosis based on the soil trophic index (SIG) indicates generally lower trophic status (mesotrophic) as compared to the diagnoses based on forest floor vegetation and tree-stand (eutrophic status). The SIG model for the post-agrar moist valley habitats should be supplemented with the factors, which improve the apparent trophic status of sandy soils, including the thick humus horizon (post-ploughing) and shallow table of eutrophic ground water.

TI  - Using deep neural networks on airborne laser scanning data: Results from a case study of semi-automatic mapping of archaeological topography on Arran, Scotland
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
AB  - This article presents results of a case study within a project that seeks to develop heavily automated analysis of digital topographic data to extract archaeological information and to expedite large area mapping. Drawing on developments in computer vision and machine learning, this has the potential to fundamentally recast the capacity of archaeological prospection to cover large areas and deal with mass data, breaking a dependency on human resource. Without such developments, the potential of the vast amount of archaeological information embedded in large topographic and image-based datasets cannot be realized. The purpose of the case study reported on here is to assess existing developments in a Norwegian study against digital topographic data for the island of Arran, Scotland, examining the transferability of the approach and providing a proof of concept in a Scottish context. For Arran, three monument classes were assessed - prehistoric roundhouses, shieling huts of medieval or post-medieval date, and small clearance cairns. These present different challenges to detection, with preliminary results ranging from a manageable mix of false positives and true identifications to the chaotic. The influence of variable morphology and the occurrence of other, largely natural, objects of confusion in the landscape is discussed, highlighting the potential improvements in automated detection routines offered by adding anthropogenic and natural false positives to additional confusion classes.

TI  - Microhabitat type determines the composition of nematode communities associated with sediment-clogged cold-water coral framework in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic)
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
AB  - The nematofauna associated with a cold-water coral degradation zone in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic) was investigated. This is the first comprehensive study of nematodes associated with cold-water corals. This research mainly aimed to investigate the influence of microhabitat type on nematode community structure. Three distinct microhabitats for nematodes were distinguished: dead coral fragments, glass sponge skeletons and the underlying sediment. The nematode assemblages associated with these three microhabitats were significantly different from each other. Coral and sponge substrata lie relatively unprotected on the seafloor and are consequently more subjected to strong currents than the underlying sediment. As a result, both large biogenic substrata were characterized by higher abundances of taxa that are less vulnerable and more adapted to physical disturbance, whereas the underlying sediment yielded more slender, sediment-dwelling taxa. Typically epifaunal taxa, such as Epsilonematidae and Draconematidae, were especially abundant on dead coral fragments, where they are thought to feed on the microbial biofilm which covers the coral surface. Several epifaunal genera showed significant preferences for this microhabitat, and Epsilonema (Epsilonematidae) was dominant here. Sponge skeletons are thought to act as efficient sediment traps, resulting in a lower abundance of epifaunal taxa compared to coral fragments. The underlying sediment was dominated by taxa typical for slope sediments. The considerable degree of overlap between the communities of each microhabitat is attributed to sediment infill between the coral branches and sponge spicules. It is assumed that the nematofauna associated with large biogenic substrata is composed of a typical sediment-dwelling background community, supplemented with taxa adapted to an epifaunal life strategy. The extent to which these taxa contribute to the community depends on the type of the substratum. Selective deposit feeders were dominant on sponge skeletons and in the underlying sediment, whereas coral fragments were dominated by epistratum feeders. The presence of a microbial biofilm on the coral fragments is proposed as an explanation for the significant preference of epistratum feeders for this microhabitat. Densities in the underlying sediment were low in comparison with other studies, but biodiversity was higher here than on the coral and sponge fragments, a difference which is attributed to lower disturbance. Nevertheless, the large biogenic substrata provide a microhabitat for rare, epifaunal taxa, and fragments of both substrata within the sediment increase habitat complexity and hence biodiversity.

TI  - Springtime grazing by Arctic-breeding geese reduces first- and second-harvest yields on sub-Arctic agricultural grasslands
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Large population increases of Arctic-breeding waterfowls over recent decades have intensified the conflict with agricultural interests in both Eurasia and North America. In the spring-staging region Vesteralen in sub-Arctic Norway, sheep, dairy and meat farmers have reported reduced agricultural grassland yields due to pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis that rest and forage in the region for 3-4 weeks in spring on their way to their breeding grounds on Svalbard. Here, we report from an experimental exclosure design where goose access to plots at three grassland fields in Vesteralen was prevented. The experiment was conducted over 3 years between 2012 and 2014. Goose abundance varied greatly between fields and years as a function of variable spring weather and forage quantity, facilitating evaluation of longer-term impacts under contrasting grazing intensities. First and second harvest yields across fields and years were 20% and 19% higher in exclosures than in plots open for grazing, while total yields (sum of first and second harvests) were on average 27% higher. Within-year effects on harvest yields varied substantially, primarily due to highly contrasting sward development during the spring-staging periods. Cool weather (2012) led to slow sward development and little or no effects on harvest yields, warmer weather (2013) resulted in generally large effects, while variable weather (2014) led to treatment effects varying across fields, with one field experiencing 61% higher yields in exclosures while there were no significant impacts on first-harvest yields at the two other fields. Goose grazing did not increase dry weight-based proportions of weeds. Overall, the farmers' reports on yield-loss due to goose grazing were confirmed, although impacts varied substantially between years. A novel finding is that second-harvest yields were also reduced. For the most affected farmers, it is unlikely that the current subsidy scheme is sufficient to cover all the their losses. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Changes in humus forms, soil invertebrate communities and soil functioning with forest dynamics
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - Three field studies have been performed, in order to assess changes in the composition of soil animal communities, soil physical and chemical features and mineralization processes with Norway spruce (Picea abies, L.) phases of the forest cycle. These field studies were conducted in three sites that differed in the acidity level of their bedrock (acidic, sub-acidic, and basic). The influence of exposure, through modifying microclimatic conditions, was also taken in consideration by comparing north and south exposures at each site. The data issued from each of these studies have already been published separately, and the aim of the present paper is to confront the three series of data in order to assess: 1) The general trend of changes in soil invertebrate communities, humus forms and mineralization processes with the age of spruce; 2) The impact of the type of bedrock and exposure on these changes.
   The results indicate that deep modifications occurred in animal communities, humus forms and soil functioning among clearing, regeneration and mature tree stands. The changes consist in an increase of Humus Index and the density of mites, especially oribatids, with a decrease in mineralization rate and animal diversity, from clearing to mature stands.
   Regeneration stands occupy an intermediate level as regards soil features but cumulates highest densities of most groups, highest levels of zoological diversity and mineralization activity. This higher level of richness and functional activity in regeneration stands could be explained by a more heterogeneous habitat in this phase of the forest cycle. Our results thus support the hypothesis that forest dynamics drives soil functioning and diversity, at least during the phase of intense growth of trees.
   The evolution of humus forms and animal communities along the developmental phases of forest stands were considerably more pronounced in south-facing sites than in north-facing sites. Unexpectedly, no increase in animal diversity was observed from the more to the less acidic bedrock. Suggestions for forest management are proposed.

TI  - Towards sustainable product development - Insights from testing and evaluating a profile model for management of sustainability integration into design requirements
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Product development and manufacturing continues to be a profound contributor to the socio-ecological problems and challenges we are facing in our world today. For products to contribute to sustainability requires not only that socio-ecological lifecycle impacts are considered in the initial stages of the product innovation process, but that they are maintained as integral product requirements. Although research offers a plethora of approaches, methods, and tools for sustainable product development, the implementation in industry remains low. The focus of this research is a less explored area of sustainable product development implementation, the management of needs identification and propagation of design requirements. The purpose is to: i) add to state of knowledge about current practices of sustainability integration into requirements, and ii) the academic discussion on implementation of sustainable design and product development. A self-assessment approach for sustainability integration into requirements is tested. The purpose of the approach is to support improvement of the requirements management process design, including activities and competencies, for engineering design. Four Swedish product development and manufacturing companies tested the approach, from which the results are used to evaluate usefulness, usability, and effect potential. The findings are discussed together with key characteristics for requirements and sustainability criteria, providing insights to ensure that socio-ecological considerations are both influencing the initial requirement specification, and maintained as decision parameters throughout the product development process.

TI  - Development of a benthic macroinvertebrate predictive model based on the physical and chemical variables of rivers in the Republic of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY
AB  - Predictive models for the benthic macroinvertebrate community based on environmental variables facilitate the identification of the organisms expected to inhabit an area according to the target environmental conditions when restoring rivers. In this investigation, a biotic community predictive model was developed using benthic macroinvertebrate and environmental variable data collected from 1,210 sites in the Republic of Korea from 2010 to 2020. The sites were classified into six groups according to Two Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and based on their individual abundance/m(2) of benthic macroinvertebrates. The TWINSPAN groups were related to 14 variables by stepwise multi-discriminant analysis. The relative importance of the environmental variables that classified each TWINSPAN group was in the order of mean diameter of particle size, catchment area, altitude, velocity, total phosphorus, latitude, pH, longitude, conductivity, water depth, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, stream order, and total nitrogen. Discriminant functions 1-4 showed statistically significant and a predictive model was developed using functions 1 and 2 based on Wilks' lambda values. The fit of the derived model was confirmed using Sorensen similarity (number of taxa) and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (individual abundance/m(2)) analyses between the predicted organisms and those observed at the sites. The distributions of similarity and dissimilarity that were confirmed by stream type ranged from 0.60 to 0.72 and 0.46-0.56, respectively, based on the mean. Based on the predicted and observed values, the ratio of shredders and scrapers to collectors showed similar results overall for each stream type. The predictive model derived using nationally managed available data is expected to be applicable to stream and river restorations in the future, as it provides a statistical assessment of the biotic communities that are expected to inhabit a given environment.

TI  - Multi-trophic consequences of kelp harvest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Coastal kelp forest ecosystems provide important habitats for a diverse assemblage of invertebrates, fish and marine top-predators such as seabirds and sea mammals. Although kelp is harvested industrially on a worldwide scale little is known about the multi-trophic consequences of this habitat removal. We investigated how kelp fisheries, which remove feeding and nursery grounds of coastal fish, influence local food webs and the availability of food to a marine top predator, the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). We conducted experimental harvesting of the canopy-forming kelp (Laminaria hyperborea) during a 3 year period (2001-2003) in an area at the coast of Central Norway while synoptically monitoring fish occurrence and cormorant foraging parameters. Our results demonstrate that cormorants preferentially foraged within kelp-forested areas and performed significantly more dives when feeding in harvested versus un-harvested areas suggesting lower foraging yield in the former case. In kelp areas that were newly harvested the number of small (<15 cm) gadid fish was 92% lower than in un-harvested areas. This effect was persistent for at least 1 year following harvest. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the ecological consequences of kelp harvesting have been tested at a multi-trophic level. The results presented strongly suggest that kelp harvesting affects fish abundance and diminishes coastal seabird foraging efficiency. Kelp fisheries are currently managed in order to maximize the net harvest of kelp biomass, and the underlying effects on the ecosystems are partly ignored. This study calls for re-assessment of such management practices. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implementation of a telemedicine, stroke evaluation service; a qualitative study
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background Acute ischemic stroke requires early medical imaging with a computed tomography (CT) scan and immediate thrombolysis treatment. In rural areas, the long distance to the nearest hospital reduce the patients' probability of receiving medical assistance within the 4.5-h period. The aim of this study was to assess how the service was set-up, and how managers and personnel experience the organisation and value of a rural telemedicine, remote controlled CT stroke service. Methods Ten semi-structured individual interviews and one semi-structured focus group interview were conducted. The sample included 15 participants involved in the telemedicine service in Hallingdal, Norway. The interview guide consisted of questions on the service, experience of working with the service, value and quality, management, and challenges. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis was used to develop a narrative of the findings. Results Findings were categorised into three main categories; value of the service, organisation of the project, and from project to permanent service. Participants perceived the service to be valuable for patients and the local community. The service included task shifting from radiographers and junior doctors to the local paramedics. To enable long- term operation of the service the participants suggested management, coordination, and continuous training as important factors. Conclusions The service was perceived as valuable to the local community, providing a sense of healthcare security and equitability. Management's involvement, flexibility, and coordination appears to be a key factor for successful implementation and long-term sustainability of the service.

TI  - Value creation for tenants in environmentally certified buildings
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - Previous research suggests that environmental certification (EC) affects rental rates in non-residential buildings, but there is still little understanding of how tenants differentiate such buildings from those without EC. This paper examines whether and how tenants perceive value creation in EC premises in Sweden. The findings (based on 29 questionnaire responses and 14 interviews with tenants in EC buildings) inform landlords and tenants on the development of EC strategies for improved organizational outcomes. EC creates value for tenants principally as support for their environmental management and reporting (e.g., low energy demand). EC is important for tenants internally, raising employee environmental awareness and improving employee attraction and retention. Tenants are generally positive about employee morale, indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and rental costs. However, it is not clear if such perceptions are dependent on features of modern premises in general, such as new fixtures, fittings and furnishings, and space-efficiency or from some EC-related feature. Tenants do not identify health or productivity increase in their EC premises. Findings suggest that the research focus should be shifted from investigating health and productivity increases through IEQ improvement to understanding the motivational improvement through value alignment with employees through EC.

TI  - Addressing Malawi's surgical workforce crisis: A sustainable paradigm for training and collaboration in Africa
T2  - SURGERY
AB  - Background. The exodus of health professionals including surgeons from sub-Saharan Africa has been well documented, but few effective, long-term solutions have been described. There is an increasing burden of surgical diseases in Africa attributable to trauma (road traffic injuries), burns, and other noncommunicable diseases such as cancer, increasing the need for surgeons.
   Methods. We conducted a Descriptive analysis of surgical academic partnership between Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Malawi, the University of Malawi-College of Medicine, the University of North Carolina in the United States, and Haukeland University Hospital, Norway, to locally train Malawian surgical residents in a College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA) approved program.
   Results. The KCH Surgery Residency program began in 2009 with 3 residents, adding 3 general surgery and 2 orthopedic residents in 2010. The intention is to enroll >= 3 residents per year to fill the 5-year program and the training has been fully accredited by COSECSA. International partners have provided near-continuous presence of attending surgeons for direct training and support of the local staff surgeons, while providing monetary support in addition to the Malawi Ministry of Health salary.
   Conclusion. This collaborative, academic model of local surgery training is designed to limit brain drain by keeping future surgeons in their country of origin as they establish themselves professionally and personally, with ongoing collaboration with international colleagues.

TI  - Reforms to the Social Security System. Lessons from an Organizational Vision
T2  - REVISTA DEL CLAD REFORMA Y DEMOCRACIA
AB  - The article discusses the organizational implications as a result of the new forms of social security systems in the areas of health, pensions and unemployment insurance, as a result of set of reforms implemented in the last decades. Accordingly, the purpose is to examine to what extent these changes can be understood from an organizational vision. The paper focuses on studying and analyzing the organizational dimension of the social security systems as an important step to understand the current effects, practices and routines of the actors involved in such reforms. To achieve this, the document attempts to carry out an exploration of the experiences from other countries based on the implementation of comprehensive reforms of social security systems; in which such changes have been made aimed at creating financially sustainable systems, but at the same time in comprehensive terms of regulation and administration. We have chosen the cases of Norway, Australia and Colombia, for its ability to draw lessons, looking to highlight the differences in size, type of economy and political system, region and culture. This is to maximize the range of observation of the effects and organizational challenges and full of ambitious reforms in the social security system, under regulation strategies and comprehensive management.
   In order to accomplish the above, the main organizational dimensions are presented as well as the methodological considerations that guide the cases. That is to say, the nature of the public organizations involved, the coordination mechanisms as well as the instruments of regulation. Then, we describe these cases, in order to construct lessons and dilemmas of the social security systems. Finally, some lessons, reflections and conclusions are shown, among which the fact that the current design of social security systems is the product not only of economic, fiscal and financial pressures, but also a set of particular dynamics of an organizational nature such as the existence of a weak coordination between the main bodies of both the financing and the provision of services, which has led to greater organizational complexity, the generation of fragmentation processes within governments and hybrid models of organization, either through partnership schemes or through the construction of new types of organizational networks.

TI  - Do commercial gill-net fisheries impact polymorphic European whitefish in Lake Femund, Norway?
T2  - ADVANCES IN LIMNOLOGY 57: BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 1999
CP  - 7th International Symposium on Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes (ISBMCF)
AB  - Lake Femund is a large (204 km(2)) oligotrophic Norwegian lake inhabited by eight fish species. European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) is the dominating fish species and can, for management purposes, be subdivided in three different morphs: Deep water spawning (D-) whitefish; River spawning (R-) whitefish; and Shallow water spawning (S-) whitefish. These morphs differ in habitat use, growth and life history characteristics and can be separated by differences in gill raker number. Traditionally, European whitefish was exploited with bottom gill nets and beach seine in subsistence fisheries. In 198 1, the start of a commercial fishery with pelagic gill nets increased the exploitation. The yield from this fishery has varied between 6 and 22 tone with declining yield in later years. This decline in yield was caused by a lower effort. CPUE of European whitefish decreased from 4.3 kg/netnight in 1982 to 1.2 kg/ netnight in 1987, but increased to a new peak in 1993, with 3.7 kg/netnight. The variation in overall CPUE closely followed the fluctuations in CPUE for D-whitefish, the most numerous morph in the lake. These fluctuations in CPUE were connected to variations in year class strength for D-whitefish, where recruitment appeared to alternate between stronger and weaker year classes over several years. Fewer variations were observed in the CPUE of R- and S-whitefish. Total annual mortality in adult fish was about 25-40% indicating that the catch mortality was not very high. Length-at-age of juvenile D-whitefish has decreased since the start of the commercial fishery, whereas that of adult fish has not changed much from 1983 to 1994. At the present level of exploitation, the fisheries in Lake Femund seems to be sustainable without strong effects on the density of adult European whitefish.

TI  - What is a fair CO<sub>2</sub> tax increase?: On fair emission reductions in the transport sector
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
AB  - We examine how individual preferences for fair reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions affect the support for increases in the CO2 tax on gasoline and diesel. We assume that people not only care about their own material welfare, but also have preferences for fairness in policy design, and we explore the implications using original data from a mail questionnaire sent to a representative sample of the Swedish population. The main result is that fairness in policy design does matter. Those respondents who adhere to a fairness principle tend to be relatively more positive to increases in the CO2 tax. One possible explanation for this result is that there is a relatively high degree of reciprocity regarding the origin of emissions and the fairness regarding who should bear the burden of CO2 reductions. via a split sample analysis, we also find that the relative importance of fairness principles is dependent upon whether one uses a car often or not. This sheds light on the potential goal conflict between the importance of fairness principles and self-interest in the form of a need for private car transportation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Relative importance of coarse and fine woody debris for the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi in temperate broadleaf forests
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Dead wood is considered important in forest conservation, but patterns of fungal diversity on dead wood have rarely been quantified. We investigated the relative importance of coarse (diameter > 10 cm) and fine woody debris (1-10 cm) for fungi in broadleaf forests in southern Sweden. The numbers of species per unit wood volume and per forest area were significantly higher for fine than for coarse woody debris for both ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. When the number of species was plotted against the number of records, coarse woody debris was more species rich than fine woody debris for a given number of basidiomycete records. Of the ascomycetes. 75% were found exclusively on fine woody debris (the corresponding proportion for basidiomycetes is 30%), 2% Were found exclusively on coarse woody debris (basidiomycetes 26%, and 23%,) of the species were found on both diameter classes (basidiomycetes 44%). We conclude that fine woody debris is important for diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi, especially ascomycctes. in this forest type. However, coarse woody debris must also be provided to insure the occurrence of many species of basidiomycetes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bryophyte species associations with coarse woody debris and stand ages in Oregon
T2  - BRYOLOGIST
AB  - We quantified the relationships of 93 forest floor bryophyte species, including epiphytes from incorporated litterfall, to substrate and stand age in Pseudotsuga menziesii-Tsuga heterophylla stands at two sites in western Oregon. We used the method of Dufrene and Legendre that combines a species' relative abundance and relative frequency, to calculate that species' importance in relation to environmental variables. The resulting "indicator value" describes a species' reliability for indicating the given environmental parameter: Thirty-nine species were indicative of either humus, a decay class of coarse woody debris, or stand age. Bryophyte community composition changed along the continuum of coarse woody debris decomposition from recently fallen trees with intact bark to forest floor humus. Richness afforest floor bryophytes will be enhanced when a full range of coarse woody debris decay classes is present. A suite of bryophytes indicated old-growth forest. These were mainly either epiphytes associated with order conifers or liverworts associated with coarse woody debris. Hardwood-associated epiphytes mainly indicated young stands. Mature conifers, hardwoods, and coarse woody debris are biological legacies that can be protected when thinning managed stands to foster habitat complexity and biodiversity, consistent with an ecosystem approach to forest management.

TI  - Environmental variables driving species composition in subarctic springs in the face of climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Questions Which environmental variables are most important in determining plant species composition in subarctic springs? Do observed patterns differ between typical wetland and general matrix-derived species? Location Helocrenic (seepage) springs, Northern Norway. Methods We sampled 49 helocrenic spring sites, measuring environmental variables (water temperature, water pH, electrical conductivity, discharge volume, geographic position) and recording all species present. We performed a partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA) to determine the relative importance of water quality, spatial, and climatic variables for patterns in species composition and to compare the differences in these patterns between wetland and matrix-derived species. Results We found that climatic and water quality variables were almost equally important in determining species composition in subarctic springs, with climatic variables explaining 26.62% of variation in species composition and water quality variables explaining 26.14%. Spatial variables explained the least variation (21.53%). When looking at the variables individually, altitude (10.93%) and mean summer temperature (9.25%) explained the most variation. The trend was the same for matrix-derived species and wetland species, with climatic variables explaining the most variation (matrix-derived: 27.26%; wetland: 24.42%), followed by water quality (matrix-derived: 26.40%; wetland: 24.13%) and spatial variables (matrix-derived: 24.87%; wetland: 16.27%). The main difference between matrix-derived species and typical wetland species was that the spatial variables explained less variation for wetland species. Conclusions The close relationship of species composition (total vegetation as well as separated into wetland and matrix-derived species) with climatic and water quality conditions indicates a sensitivity of subarctic springs to future climate change. In combination with altitude, which was found to be the most important individual variable, it is likely that the future distribution of spring species tracking climate change will be limited by the occurrence of suitable spring habitats, especially at high altitudes.

TI  - The clothes swapping phenomenon - when consumers become suppliers
T2  - JOURNAL OF FASHION MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore swap-shops, which emerged as part of the collaborative consumption phenomenon, by investigating what the implications are of consumers acting as suppliers and how this affects supply chain management within the context of the fashion industry. Design/methodology/approach This study explores the collaborative consumption phenomenon through swap-shops in three countries: the UK, Finland and Germany. In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with swappers, non-swappers and organisers. To further enhance the data set six observations of swap-shop events were conducted. Data were transcribed and analysed using multiple coding cycles and using a grounded research approach. Findings Findings indicate that consumers were most concerned with availability/sizing and quality of garments, whilst organisers felt uncertainty was the biggest issue. Data allowed creating a framework that blueprints the swapping supply chain, in which consumers emerge as suppliers. It highlights possible activities in different cycles, whilst furthermore indicates that consumption cycles can move from monetary (e.g. selling) to non-monetary transactions (e.g. swapping) and vice versa. Originality/value The authors extended the knowledge on swapping by describing how this phenomenon can activate consumers, and extend and intensify the use of garments and therefore swapping can slow the material throughput in the system. It is the first paper to focus solely on swapping within a three country context.

TI  - Implementation of physical activity on prescription for children with obesity in paediatric health care (IMPA): protocol for a feasibility and evaluation study using quantitative and qualitative methods
T2  - PILOT AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES
AB  - Background: Physical inactivity is a main cause of childhood obesity which tracks into adulthood obesity, making it important to address early in life. Physical activity on prescription (PAP) is an evidence-based intervention that has shown good effect on physical activity levels in adults, but has not been evaluated in children with obesity. This project aims to evaluate the prerequisites, determinants, and feasibility of implementing PAP adapted to children with obesity and to explore children's, parents', and healthcare providers' experiences of PAP.
   Methods: In the first phase of the project, healthcare providers and managers from 26 paediatric clinics in Region Vastra Gotaland, Sweden, will be invited to participate in a web-based survey and a subset of this sample for a focus group study. Findings from these two data collections will form the basis for adaptation of PAP to the target group and context. In a second phase, this adapted PAP intervention will be evaluated in a clinical study in a sample of approximately 60 children with obesity (ISO-BMI > 30) between 6 and 12 years of age and one of their parents/legal guardians. Implementation process and clinical outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 8 and 12 months' follow-up. Implementation outcomes are the four core constructs of the Normalization Process Theory; coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring; and appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility of the PAP intervention. Additional implementation process outcomes are recruitment and attrition rates, intervention fidelity, dose, and adherence. Clinical outcomes are physical activity pattern, BMI, metabolic risk factors, health-related quality of life, sleep, and self-efficacy and motivation for physical activity. Lastly, we will explore the perspectives of children and parents in semi-structured interviews. Design and analysis of the included studies are guided by the Normalization Process Theory.
   Discussion: This project will provide new knowledge regarding the feasibility of PAP for children with obesity and about whether and how an evidence-based intervention can be fitted and adapted to new contexts and populations. The results may inform a larger scale trial and future implementation and may enhance the role of PAP in the management of obesity in paediatric health care in Sweden.

TI  - Ecological correlates of distribution change and range shift in butterflies
T2  - INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY
AB  - 1. In order to be effective custodians of biodiversity, one must understand what ecological characteristics predispose species to population decline, range contraction, and, eventually, to extinction.
   2. The present paper analyses distribution change (area of occupancy) and range shift (extent and direction) of the threatened and non-threatened butterfly species in Finland, and identifies species-specific ecological characteristics promoting changes in distribution and range.
   3. Overall, the range of butterflies has shifted along the climatic isotherms, suggesting that climate change has influenced species' ranges. Interestingly, though, threatened species have moved very little and not to any consistent direction.
   4. The most obvious pattern observed is that ecological specialisation, be it at larval or at adult stage, promotes distribution decline. The analysis further revealed that poor dispersal ability and large body size predispose species to distribution decline.
   5. Species ecological traits influence their susceptibility to distribution change and range shift. Thus, as a result of climate change, biological communities may become over-represented by highly dispersive generalists. It is argued that with the kind of ecological information provided here, managers should become proactive and initiate the necessary measures for conservation of species when their populations are still viable instead of reacting only to the imminent extinction risk when it already may be too late.

TI  - Variation in hydrochory among lakes and streams: Effects of channel planform, roughness, and currents
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - The configuration of channels in stream networks is vital for their connectivity, biodiversity, and metacommunity dynamics. We compared the capacity of three process domains-lakes, slow-flowing reaches, and rapids-to disperse and retain plant propagules by releasing small wooden cubes as propagule mimics during the spring flood and recording their final locations. We also measured the geomorphic characteristics (planform, longitudinal profile, cross-sectional morphology, and wood) of each process domain. The three process domains all differed in morphology and hydraulics, and those characteristics were important in shaping the transport capacity of mimics. On average, lakes retained more mimics than slow-flowing reaches but did not differ from the retainment of rapids. Living macrophytes were the most efficient element trapping mimics. In rapids and slow-flowing reaches, most trapped mimics remained floating, whereas in lakes, most mimics ended up on the banks. The decay curves of retention varied substantially among and within process domains. The results suggest that managers who rely on natural recovery of restored sites by means of plant immigration may benefit from understanding landscape patterns when deciding upon the location of restoration measures in stream networks.

TI  - Blogging for Sustainability: The Intermediary Role of Personal Green Blogs in Promoting Sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
AB  - The rise of social media radically broadens the sources and platforms used for environmental communication. Especially personal green blogs are worthy of study as they are spaces of everyday cultural politics through which people make sense of sustainability issues, and because they entail a radical break from conventional media in terms of legitimacy, form, and content of environmental communication processes. This paper studies the representation of sustainability on personal green blogs, and the communication processes through which these representations are constructed. It does so through a qualitative study of Swedish-language blogs. We study three blogs in-depth: a living experiment blog on sustainable food practices; a lifestyle blog centered around green family life; and a blog about consuming green beauty products. The analysis shows that all three blogs translate the complex landscape of sustainability to individual everyday practices. Yet, what these sustainability practices entail differs considerably between the blogs, ranging from a-political and doable lifestyle choices to an onset to radical redefining of consumption. Also, the communication processes on the blogs differ in quality and quantity. The paper uses these insights to reflect on the debates about how environmental communication is shaped by blogging and social media practices.

TI  - COVID-19 impact on teleactivities: Role of built environment and implications for mobility
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
AB  - This paper presents new evidence on changes in a broad range of teleactivities due to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and investigates how the built environment relates to these changes. The paper relies on survey and geospatial data from Oslo and its surrounding Viken region in Norway. Findings suggest that most teleactivities increased due to COVID-19. Telework, teleconferencing, online learning, telehealth, and virtual meetings with friends and family all increased during COVID-19 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. The next step in the analysis examined relationships between built environment characteristics and teleactivities before and during COVID-19. Telework and virtual meetings increased to a greater extent in denser neighborhoods than in lower-density neighborhoods. A larger increase in online learning was associated with lower neighborhood density, lower accessibility to public transport, and more local facilities. Numerous local facilities were associated with more frequent telework and virtual meetings both before and during COVID-19. The substantial COVID-19-induced increase in teleactivities found in the study highlights the potential of information and communications technology (ICT) for replacing travel for various activities.

TI  - Between rationalism and romanticism: metaphors in managing conflicting institutional logics in science and technology parks
T2  - CULTURE AND ORGANIZATION
AB  - This article examines how metaphors act as a semiotic resource for managing conflicting institutional logics. Due to their polysemic nature, metaphors help to bridge contending logics and facilitate their long-term co-existence without a need for a battle over dominance. Hence, metaphors provide a similar tool for reconciling competing logics as images and polysemic targets have been shown to offer in earlier studies. The study looks at the workings of metaphors by analysing discourse concerning science and technology parks (STPs) from the UK and Finland. The dataset includes interviews with park managers and representatives of client companies, parliamentary debates and self-presentations by the parks. The article shows how the six key metaphors used to describe STPs (the garden, the incubator, the accelerator, the conduit, the village, and the landlord) are utilized by various actor groups to reconcile the two conflicting institutional logics prevalent in the STPs: instrumental rationalism and romanticism.

TI  - Quantifying risk of overharvest when implementation is uncertain
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Sustainable harvest management implies an ability to control harvest rates. This is challenging in systems that have limited control of resources and resource users, which is often the case in small game harvest management. The difference - between management strategies and actual harvest bag size (i.e. implementation uncertainty) may be substantial, but few studies have explored this.
   2. We investigated how different management strategies and ecosystem variables affected realised harvest of willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus L.) among nine independently managed, state-owned hunting areas in Central and South Norway during 2008-2015. First, we focused our empirical analysis around three response variables of interest: hunting bag (scaled by area), hunting effort (number of hunting days scaled by area) and hunter efficiency (shot birds per hunting day). Akaike information criteria (AIC) guided model selection among candidate GLMMs. Then, we used model-averaged parameter estimating from the statistical models in numerical simulations to explore risk of overharvest due to implementation uncertainty.
   3. The most parsimonious model explaining hunting bag included total allowable catch (TAC) and willow ptarmigan density. Hunting effort was explained by number of permits sold and type of quota (daily vs. weekly quota). The most parsimonious model describing hunter efficiency only included the effect of willow ptarmigan density.
   4. Our results show that managers have only partial control over harvest rates in this system, and that hunters were relatively more efficient and harvest rates higher at low densities. This effect was present for all management strategy scenarios, -including when managers adjusted TAC according to population estimates from monitoring programmes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Quantifying risk of unsustainable harvest rates under different scenarios enables managers to make informed decisions, when dealing with competing objectives of harvest opportunities and sustainability. The substantial risk of high harvest rates at low densities reported here should encourage frequent use of threshold strategies. This study is one of the first approaches for quantifying implementation uncertainty in small game harvest, and shows how estimates from empirical analyses could be used to quantify risk of overharvest.

TI  - Circular economy - From review of theories and practices to development of implementation tools
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - The paper provides an overview of the literature on Circular Economy (CE) theoretical approaches, strategies and implementation cases. After analyzing different CE approaches and the underlying principles the paper then proceeds with the main goal of developing tools for CE implementation. Two tools are presented. The first is a CE Strategies Database, which includes 45 CE strategies that are applicable to different parts of the value chain. The second is a CE Implementation Database, which includes over 100 case studies categorized by Scope, Parts of the Value Chain that are involved, as well as by the used Strategy and Implementation Level. An analysis of the state of the art in CE implementation is also included in the paper. One of the observations from the analysis is that while such Parts of the Value Chain as Recovery/Recycling and Consumption/Use are prominently featured, others, including Manufacturing and Distribution, are rarely involved in CE. On the other hand, the Implementation Levels of the used Strategies indicate that many market-ready solutions exist already. The Scope of current CE implementation considers selected products, materials and sectors, while system changes to economy are rarely suggested. Finally, the CE monitoring methods and suggestions for future development are also discussed in this paper. The analysis of the theoretical approaches can serve as an introduction to CE concept, while the developed tools can be instrumental for designing new CE cases.

TI  - Craft beer - building social terroir through connecting people, place and business
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to propose the concept of social terroir to help navigate phenomenological and epistemological conditions of small-scale food entrepreneurship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study used a qualitative research approach and was implemented in the peripheral region of Jamtland in northern Sweden. The study interrogated the ambitions of craft brewers when starting up, their long-term goals and visions, including questions about the reason for starting up a brewery, how the different brewers cooperate and how and why the products are designed and labelled the way they are.
   Findings
   This study shows that the production of craft beer is an inherently social practice that is part of a particular sociocultural milieu. This milieu informs production in distinct and interrelated ways: through connecting to place and locality in the different aspects of production and marketing, through cooperation to develop production and overcome barriers, and through embedding their work in sustainability discourses.
   Originality/value
   The study addresses how, in the context of craft beer, terroir or taste of place, is a matter of social ties to place and community-social terroir. What is novel is the way in which social terroir becomes a critical ingredient in the production of craft beer. This illustrates how small-scale food production and gastronomic efforts can link people, places and businesses.

TI  - Comparative quality evaluation of processed clusters obtained from red king crab (<i>Paralithodes camtschaticus</i>) typical of spring and autumn harvests in the Barents Sea
T2  - FOOD CONTROL
AB  - The red king crab (RKC, Paralithodes camtschaticus) is a highly-valued decapod species of key importance for the economy of the northern Norwegian coastal region. Nearly the entire harvested volume (1727 t in 2019) is exported to high-end markets, mostly as live crabs, although RKC can also be processed into two sections (i.e., clusters) commercialized as a frozen or ready-to-eat product under refrigeration. The fact that the Norwegian RKC fishery is a year-round activity constitutes an advantage over competing RKC fisheries, which are inactive during the winter and the spring. Nonetheless, this also involves the commercialization of RKC harvested between March and May, when its quality is considered poorer due to the physiological changes related to molting. This study aimed to acquire quantitative information on the seasonal quality variation of RKC by comparatively evaluating the quality attributes of spring and autumn harvests, which are, respectively, associated predominantly with a postmolt and intermolt population. Specifically, in the processed clusters obtained from spring postmolt RKCs, it was observed significantly (p < 0.05) lower exoskeleton thickness, yield (by between 8 and 15 percentage points), and leg meat content. The cooked meat of spring postmolt RKCs had significantly lower textural firmness and whiteness index. Furthermore, during refrigerated storage, cooked clusters of spring postmolt RKCs were characterized by significantly higher drip loss, and their leg meat reached significantly earlier the acceptability limit of 5 log CFU g(-1) in the total viable psychrotrophic count. The present study highlighted the risk of incurring economic losses for stakeholders along the value chain when dealing with postmolt RKC harvested in the spring. It should be questioned if the commercialization of the RKCs with poorer eating quality attributes in the spring season is an appropriate way to utilize at best this natural resource in terms of value creation, market reputation, and sustainability.

The half of primary energy is spent for space heating even under quite a mild European climate. Implementation of the district heating in urban areas is currently seen as one of the key conditions of sustainable development. The clear understanding of main problems of the urban climate-energy demand interaction is crucial for both small towns and megacities.
   The specific features of the urban energy systems in Finland, Russia and China under the changing climate conditions were studied. Regional manifestations of the climate change were examined. The climate projections were established for urban regions of the Northern Eurasia. It was shown that the climate warming is likely to continue intensively there.
   History and actual development trends were discussed for the urban district heating systems in Russia, China and Finland. Common challenges linked with the climate change have been identified for the considered areas. Adaptation possibilities were discussed taking into account climate-energy interactions.

TI  - Do Advocacy Coalitions Matter? Crisis and Change in Swedish Nuclear Energy Policy
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY
AB  - This study applies the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) to developments in Swedish nuclear energy policy in the 1970s and 80s. In an effort to contribute to the refinement and debate regarding the generalizability of ACF theory, the objective is to assess the utility of ACF assumptions when applied in this case. The study explores hypotheses about advocacy coalition stability and examines the motivations explaining policy change in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Utilizing different sources of data, the study confirms patterns of coalition stability and shows that interests and political learning were important in explaining policy change in this case. Theoretical implications derived from this study call for further specification of basic ACF concepts (external perturbations, dominant coalitions, and skillful exploitation) and posit the intensity and breadth of political conflict and strategic action as critical factors contributing to the explanation of policy change in contested policy areas.

TI  - Effects of an offshore wind farm on temporal and spatial patterns in the demersal fish community
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - The rapid increase in offshore wind energy worldwide has raised concern about its potential risks to marine biodiversity due to habitat alteration, disturbance from noise and electromagnetic fields. This study presents results of surveillance studies performed at the Lillgrund wind farm in Sweden to investigate the integrated effects of these factors on the abundance and distribution patterns of benthic fish communities. The studies revealed no large-scale effects on fish diversity and abundance after establishment of the wind farm when compared to the development in 2 reference areas. Changes in some species and in community composition were observed over time but occurred in parallel in at least one reference area, indicating that fish communities in the wind farm area were mainly driven by the same environmental factors as those in surrounding areas. However, changes at smaller spatial scales were evident. Increased densities of all studied piscivores (cod, eel, shorthorn sculpin), as well as the reef-associated goldsinny wrasse, were observed close to the foundations in the first years of operation. The increase was probably attributed mainly to local changes in distribution rather than to immigration or increased local productivity. Simultaneously, weak or no aggregation of black goby, eelpout and shore crab, all potentially reef-associated but also prey species of the studied piscivores, was observed, which may indicate enhanced top-down control near the foundations.

TI  - Sustainability, perceived quality and country of origin of farmed salmon: Impact on consumer choices in the USA, France and Japan
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Technological advancements that enable countries to produce farmed seafood domestically, including land-based production, could potentially improve sustainability measures. However, whether consumers prefer domestic farmed seafood to imported seafood is unclear. This paper aims to fill this gap by employing hypothetical choice experiments from the US, France, and Japan. We find that, in each country, there is a sizable consumer segment (varying from one-quarter to two-thirds of the market) with a strong preference for domestic farmed salmon, including those from land-based production. These consumers associate domestic origin with higher qualities in all relevant dimensions and are willing to pay a price premium. There is also a segment of consumers with a strong preference for imported Norwegian salmon (from one-fifth to two-thirds of the market), linking Norwe-gian origin to higher qualities, and willing to pay higher prices. Consumers' attitudes towards the environment and food, usage of label information, age, income, and consumption frequencies, are among the characteristics that explain consumer heterogeneity. Our results show the market potential for domestic farmed seafood, thus, providing consumers with reliable origin information for farmed seafood that also covers land-based production would be important. At the same time, the existence of a segment with a preference for imported seafood implies that active trade will remain, indicating the importance of continued international corporation for a holistic and transparent policy framework and common standards for a sustainable aquatic food system.

TI  - Causes of episodic acidification in Alpine streams
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. Despite their global importance as mountain landscapes, the effect of acid deposition on running waters in the Alps is still incompletely described. The acid-base status of 30 clearwater streams in Canton Ticino ( Switzerland) was therefore assessed at low and high flow across a south / north gradient of acid deposition in 2000.
   2. At low flow, no stream was acidic, alkalinity being greater than or equal to 29 mueq L-1 and pH greater than or equal to6.4. However, NO3- was present in streamwater at these flows in concentrations that suggested anthropogenic enrichment, and its concentration correlated with spatial patterns of N deposition from the atmosphere.
   3. Severe loss of alkalinity occurred in most streams at high flow during snowmelt ( spring) or rainstorms ( spring and autumn). Autumn episodes were because of dilution of streamwater alkalinity by rainwater. By contrast, spring episodes involved dilution and NO3- titration, the increase in nitrate being correlated with patterns of N deposition. SO42- declined during most episodes.
   4. High NO3- leaching at low flow suggests that catchment soils in Canton Ticino are approaching saturation in N. These data are among the first to illustrate that NO3- can drive episodic acidification in Europe, paralleling locations in north-eastern United States.

TI  - Cladoceran (Crustacea) Niches, Sex, and Sun Bathing-A Long-Term Record of Tundra Lake (Lapland) Functioning and Paleo-Optics
T2  - WATER
AB  - Under fundamental ecosystem changes in high latitude lakes, a functional paleolimnological approach may increase holistic understanding of lake responses and resilience to climate warming. A similar to 2000-year sediment record from Lake Loaejavri in the tundra of northern Finnish Lapland was examined for fossil Cladocera assemblages to examine long-term environmental controls on aquatic communities. In addition, cladoceran functional attributes, including functional diversity (FD), UV absorbance (ABS(UV)) of Alona carapaces, and sexual reproduction (ephippia) in Bosmina and Chydoridae were analyzed. Cladoceran communities responded to a major change in benthic habitat quality, reflected as elevated (increasingly benthic) sediment organic matter delta C-13 signal since the 17th century. FD fluctuations showed association with climate oscillation, FD being generally higher during warm climate periods. These ecological changes were likely attributable to diversification of littoral-benthic consumer habitat space. ABS(UV), irrespective of increases during the Little Ice Age (LIA) due to higher UV transparency of lake water, was lower under increasing autochthony (benthic production) suggesting establishment of physical UV refugia by the benthic vegetative substrata. Bosmina ephippia exhibited a decreasing trend associated with increasing benthic production, indicating favorable environmental regime, and, together with chydorid ephippia, transient increases during the climate cooling of the LIA driven by shorter open-water season.

TI  - A new era for restocking, stock enhancement and sea ranching of coastal fisheries resources
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE
AB  - The growing number of countries investigating the potential for releasing cultured juveniles to augment coastal fisheries resulted in the First International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and Sea Ranching (ISSESR) in Norway in 1997. The 1st and 2nd ISSESR, in Japan in 2002, were instrumental in developing methods for mass production of environmentally fit juveniles and for releasing them in responsible ways. The 3rd ISSESR, held in the U.S.A. in 2006 (www.SeaRanching.org), ushered the discipline into a new era. The major advances included: (1) definitions of the various objectives for releasing cultured juveniles (restocking, stock enhancement, and sea ranching); (2) a framework for integrating releases within their fisheries management context, including tools for quantitative assessment; (3) a systematic, transparent, and stakeholder-participatory planning process to determine whether releases have a cost-effective role to play in managing a fishery; (4) a comprehensive case study (blue crabs in Chesapeake Bay) describing the multi-disciplinary approach needed to evaluate the potential benefits of releases; and (5) a suite of other lessons to guide stakeholders in evaluating the potential for and implementation of releases. The papers in this Special Issue of Reviews in Fisheries Science elaborate how restocking, stock enhancement and sea ranching programs can create synergies between aquaculture and some coastal fisheries to help meet the future demand for seafood and aid in restoring depleted stocks.

TI  - The impact of restricted decision-making autonomy on health care managers' health and work performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to investigate how restricted decision-making autonomy and conflicting demands impact operational managers' work performance and health. Background Managers at operational level (first- and second-line managers') in health care organisations are commonly exposed to strain in their work situation with high demands and a challenging work context. Although they play an important role, the knowledge about the causal associations between stressful job demands and their consequences is limited. Methods A prospective design with questionnaire data collected at two points in time, 1 year apart, from a sample of operational managers (N = 162) at five Swedish hospitals was used to conduct a structural equation model analysis with cross-lagged paths. Results Restricted decision-making autonomy was negatively associated with both the managers' health and their managerial work performance over time. Conclusions Health care managers' work performance and health may be sustained by the top management allowing them a higher degree of autonomy in their decision-making. Implications for nursing management This study suggests that nursing leaders should create the circumstances for operational managers' to have higher levels of autonomy in their area of responsibility and the freedom to prioritize their managerial workload.

TI  - Characterising functional trait diversity and trait-environment relationships in fish assemblages of boreal lakes
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. Characterisation of biodiversity is typically based on taxonomic approaches, while much less is known about other related aspects. Functional trait diversity is one such component of biodiversity that has not been addressed rigorously in ecological research until recently. We tested the congruence between taxonomic- and trait-based approaches, and examined how spatial configuration, local abiotic environmental factors and biotic effects interact to influence taxonomic- and trait-based characterisation of freshwater fish assemblages.
   2. Fish assemblage data were compiled for 124 lakes in southern Finland. Variance partitioning in both linear regression analyses and redundancy analysis was used to quantify the relative contribution of spatial and environmental variables to taxonomic and functional trait diversity and structure. Additionally, a null model analysis was used to test for the potential effects of interspecific segregation and biotic interactions on the co-occurrence of species.
   3. The species pool was relatively poor. However, trait-based classification of species indicated that most species belonged to unique functional entities, which suggested low redundancy in species composition. Correlation analysis indicated a very strong relationship between species richness (SR) and the number of unique trait combinations (UTC). Ecoregion-level heterogeneity in SR and UTC were well represented in a relatively small group of randomly selected lakes (c. 30 lakes). Multiple regressions indicated moderate roles for abiotic environmental variables (i.e. lake surface area, depth, total phosphorous, colour and pH) in determining SR, UTC and the distribution of single trait categories, whereas geographical location was not generally influential.
   4. Redundancy analysis revealed similar patterns to those of diversity analyses for taxonomic and associated trait-based structure, emphasising the effect of abiotic environmental variables and the negligible effect of geographical position.
   5. Co-occurrence analysis indicated significant checkerboard distribution at the whole assemblage level, but interspecific segregation proved to be of relatively minor importance in the constrained analyses, where species pair combinations within trait category groups were evaluated.
   6. Our results suggest that taxonomic- and trait-based patterns of boreal lake fish assemblages are strongly interrelated. Environmental filtering through the effects of local abiotic variables seems to have the most prominent role in determining trait-based assemblage patterns among lakes, which may also be secondarily shaped by biotic interactions.
   7. From the applied perspective, it may not necessarily matter whether traditional taxonomic or more novel trait-based approaches are used in characterising spatial patterns in boreal fish assemblages. However, trait-based approaches may provide complementary information which cannot be directly revealed by taxonomic data.

TI  - Do Scandinavian brown bears approach settlements to obtain high-quality food?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Large carnivores that approach human settlements are usually considered a threat to human property and safety. The prevailing paradigm, that such 'problem' animals approach settlements in search of food, ignores their social organization. Based on feces, we compared the diet of individual brown bears (ursus arctos) in Sweden in relation to settlements. Nutritive quality was quantified using near-infrared spectroscopy, and food items were identified using a DNA metabarcoding approach. We analyzed the diet of 21 bears during 36 visits near (<150 m) settlements, and the corresponding diet when the same bears were in remote areas (>600 m from settlements; constituting 95% of bears' habitat use). The food-search hypothesis predicted a different and higher-quality diet when an individual was close to settlements than when in a remote area. Less than 1.9% of the variation in diet was associated with location, giving no support for the food-search hypothesis. However, females with yearlings had 5.1% +/- 2.9 (SE) lower fecal protein content than adult males. In addition, females with young (cubs-of-the-year or yearlings) exploited slaughter remains less often than other bears. This suggests that the diet of predation-vulnerable bears may have been affected by despotic behavior of dominant conspecifics. We provide evidence against the paradigm that food search explained the occurrence of brown bears near settlements and suggest that predation-vulnerable bears may use habitation as a human shield without being food conditioned. Management authorities should consider this knowledge when dealing with large carnivores near settlements. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Local Moral Economies: The Space, Place, and Locality of Social Media Mobilisation
T2  - GLOBALIZATIONS
AB  - This study is a case study of a locally rooted environmental campaign on the Swedish island of Gotland. We aim to enhance the understanding of how locality is manifested in social movements that emerge in today's networked world. We analyse how the double goals of speaking to, as well as beyond, the local context came into expression in the movement's social media activities. We draw on data from tweets and Facebook posts and include interactions between activists and critics as well as the resources linked to in the posts. Analysis indicates that the conflict must be seen as spanning across local, national and global levels. In line with earlier research, activists used social media to link their struggle with other struggles. Also, it was used to charge the local struggle with symbolic content by framing it as one of many struggles between local communities, authorities and multinational corporations. Beyond this, posts from the island signalled dedication to the history and long-term interests of the community. We argue that future studies should recognise the crucial role that reciprocity norms in the local community can play for outcomes of conflicts and that the notion of a local moral economy' can be used to reach a deeper understanding of this.

TI  - Measuring the safety effect of raised bicycle crossings using a new research methodology
T2  - BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN RESEARCH 1998
CP  - 77th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - Before-and-after study methodology was developed and applied to evaluating the effect on bicyclists' safety of raising urban bicycle crossings by 4 to 12 cm. In total, 44 junctions were reconstructed in this way in Gothenburg, Sweden. Four of these were studied in detail. Before the implementations, bicyclists were riding either in the roadway or on separate paths parallel to the roadway. The paths then ended with short ramps or curb cuts at each cross street, and bicyclists used nonelevated, marked bicycle crossings, similar to pedestrian crosswalks but delineated by white painted rectangles rather than zebra stripes. The results show that the paths with raised crossings attracted more than 50 percent more bicyclists and that the safety per bicyclist was improved by approximately 20 percent due to the increase in bicycle flow, and with an additional 10 to 50 percent due to the improved layout. However, the increased bicyclist volume means that the total number of bicycle accidents is expected to increase. Besides accident analysis, the change in risk was estimated using four different methods: surveys of bicyclists and experts, respectively; conflict data; and a quantitative expert model. Using a Bayesian approach for combining the results shows that the most likely effect of raising the bicycle crossing is a risk reduction of around 30 percent, compared with the before situation with a conventional bicycle crossing. Motorists and pedestrians also saw safety benefits from this traffic-calming measure.

TI  - A Participatory Approach to Identify Key Areas for Sustainable Work Environment and Health in Employees with Flexible Work Arrangements
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Flexible work arrangements are common worldwide, but knowledge on how to achieve a sustainable work environment is sparse. The aim of this study was to use a participatory approach to identify concrete suggestions and key areas for improvement that were considered relevant, effective, and feasible for promoting good work environment and health at organizational, work group and individual level (O-G-I), among office employees with flexible work arrangements. Eight focus group interviews (including 45 employees) were conducted in a large Swedish government agency in 2017. By using a Tree diagram approach, employees made a total of 279 suggestions for improvements, which were sorted into O-G-I levels and mapped into 18 key areas. We found that 13 key areas addressed organizational level (e.g., improving leadership, policy, job demands, and work efficiency), two key areas addressed group level (create common rules of availability and activity-based working), and three key areas addressed individual level (e.g., individuals' responsibility to clearly communicate their availability). The participatory process was effective in obtaining concrete suggestions and key areas in need of improvement, which may provide an action plan that can guide organizations in developing interventions to promote good work environment and health in flexible work.

TI  - Using local initiatives to envision sustainable and resilient food systems in the Stockholm city-region
T2  - GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Globally, food systems face multifaceted sustainability challenges and the need for food system transformation is increasingly acknowledged. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the pathways for transformation and how they will play out in diverse regional social-ecological contexts. We explored transformation towards more sustainable and resilient food systems in a specific regional context - the Stockholm city-region in Sweden. The approach we used is based on a new methodology for bottom-up, participatory narrative scenarios that has been developed in the international sustainability science project "Bright Spots: Seeds of the Good Anthropocene". Through a workshop and a survey with a diverse set of regional actors, we developed a vision of a positive food future and identified conflicts and opportunities for moving towards it. The vision highlights four components from across different sectors and represents a significant change from the current situation. The direction of change aligns with global goals of sustainable and healthy diets and promotes increased diversity in crops and landscapes that could strengthen the resilience of regional food systems. However, potential trade-offs between local diversity and global resource efficiency need to be better understood. While the approach revealed barriers in existing economic and socio-cultural mechanisms of global food systems, it also allowed us to identify several opportunities for local initiatives to expand the regional niche, for example by using the leverage of actors situated between producers and consumers. The Seeds of Good Anthropocene scenario methodology helped to understand more of the cross-scale dynamics in a transformation process in a specific social-ecological context and can be useful to navigate food system change in other places as well.

TI  - The combined effect of vehicle frontal design, speed reduction, autonomous emergency braking and helmet use in reducing real life bicycle injuries
T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
CP  - 3rd International Cycling Safety Conference (ICSC)
AB  - Vulnerable road users as bicyclists and pedestrians account for a significant share of fatalities and serious injuries in the road transport system. Traditionally, the protection for bicyclists has been addressed by speed management and separating vulnerable road users from motorized traffic. Also, the use of bicycle helmet has been prompted and regulated in some countries. Pedestrian protection by improving the car fontal design has been around since the late 1990s and has proven to be effective in reducing injury risk on pedestrians (Strandroth et al., 2011) as well as on bicyclists (Strandroth et al., 2014). Pedestrian detection with Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) has also been introduced on the market to prevent and mitigate pedestrian and bicyclist injuries. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the different interventions promoting safety for vulnerable road users, and an additional purpose was to look at the combined effect of the interventions. Swedish emergency hospital reports from approximately 2000 bicyclists and 1200 pedestrians between Jan 1st 2003 and March 2014 were included in the study. Hospital reports including injury diagnosis were combined with police data and the vehicle registry in order to obtain detailed vehicle information. Euro NCAP pedestrian test score, speed limit restriction and helmet use was correlated with real-life pedestrian and bicyclist injuries. The results showed that on pedestrians, large injury reductions were found comparing low scoring cars (1-9 p) in the Euro NCAP pedestrian test to high scoring cars (>18 p). Also for bicyclists significant injury reductions were found. Focusing on bicyclist's injury level, large reductions were found on all body regions, with the highest reduction on head injuries. The effect of speed limit restriction showed few statistically significant results, although across both pedestrian and bicyclist injuries the trends showed overall small but positive effects. The effect of helmet use on bicyclist injuries was investigated both on individual level and on head injury level. Helmet showed to significantly reduce the risk of head injuries. However, on individual level, the results were quiet conflicting, and only on mRPMI10+ level a positive and statistically significant reduction was found. The calculated combined effect of speed-reduction, helmet-use and car frontal design was 79%. Also, preliminary calculations, based on a limited number of cases, and including both bicyclists and pedestrians, showed that when adding the effect of AEB, the risk of long-term impairment decreased by more than 90%.

TI  - Evaluating a Mobility Service Application for Business Travel: Lessons Learnt from a Demonstration Project
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Business travel contributes to significant greenhouse gas emissions, and there is a need for measures that reduce the demand for trips made with energy-intensive means of transport. In this study, a mobility service application (MSA) introduced in 13 Swedish organisations was tested and evaluated to facilitate booking and handling of business trips, in particular public transport. A before and after study consisting of surveys and interviews with employees at the organisations were conducted. The results show that the MSA was mostly used for regional and local public transport trips, and the users stated that the MSA made it easier to travel by public transport, although this particular result should be seen as tentative due to the small sample size. Three factors that influence the success of a new MSA as a means to increase sustainable business trips were identified: management control and proactiveness; perceived improvement of intervention; functions and technical sufficiency. The results also highlight the need to establish organisational conditions that facilitate sustainable business travel, such as coherent travel policy, accessibility to sustainable modes of transport, and a culture that encourages environmentally friendly behaviour. The study suggests improvements that can be made to similar interventions and strategies that can be introduced to promote sustainable business travel.

TI  - Report by German Federal Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs Official Henning von Wistinghausen on the UN Symposium on Oil Shale Held in Tallinn in 1968
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
AB  - The UN's first symposium on developing the utilisation of oil shale resources was held in Tallinn on 28 August - 4 September 1968, only a week after Soviet armed forces were sent into the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic (which took place on 21 August). This was also the first international conference to be held in Tallinn after 1939 that included participants from Western countries as well. The aim of the symposium was to encourage the adoption of oil shale resources for utilisation in developing countries. Henning von Wistinghausen's report describes the Soviet Union's ambitions to increase its influence in developing countries by way of the field of oil shale. This ambition became evident to him at the symposium. He also characterises the political atmosphere and general conditions in Estonia at the end of the 1960s. The scientific-technical part of the report relies on the summary of the symposium drawn up by another German delegate, Hans Kroepelin, the director of the Chemistry Technology Institute at the Braunschweig Institute of Technology.
   Twenty nine countries were represented in Tallinn with a total of 266 participants. Of this group, 221 participants were from the Soviet Union, most of whom in turn were Estonian scientists, engineers and captains of industry. Eleven scientists represented the USA, while each of the remaining countries sent 1-3 representatives (Brazil, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Burma, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Jordan, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Panama, Romania, Somalia, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, the United Arab Republic, England, Yugoslavia and the German Federal Republic). In the strained political situation resulting from the recent events in Czechoslovakia, the delegates of several Western countries declined to participate. A few isolated American scientists followed the advice of the US government to boycott the event. The German government considered it necessary for a representative of Germany's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to participate in order to curb the influence of representatives from the German Democratic Republic, but no East German delegates ended up coming to the symposium. The symposium's working sessions were held at the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute (currently the Tallinn University of Technology). A total of 89 presentations were given. At the final session, decisions were adopted that had to be taken into consideration in the future within the framework of the UN technical aid programme aimed at developing countries. The visitors were shown an oil shale mine, the Narva electric power plant, and the Kohtla-Jarve oil shale integrated refining plant on field trips to Eastern Viru County. According to Hans Kroepelin, Estonia's oil shale industry and scientific research were at as high a level as Soviet technical and economic conditions permitted. According to Wistinghausen's impression, the introduction of these enterprises to foreigners appeared to present the leaderships of these enterprises with difficulties since, for instance, only vague information was permitted to be presented concerning the technical aspects that especially interested the Americans.
   The symposium was reported daily on Estonian Television, which broadcast interviews with foreign delegates, among other things. Estonia had also prepared a cultural and social programme for its foreign guests: a concert by Estonian musicians, visits to a poultry farm and a collective fishing enterprise, a sauna evening, a boat trip in the Bay of Tallinn, a picnic on a beach near the city with performances by an Estonian folk dancing troupe and Estonian choirs, a visit to the opera, and other such events. It was found that the programme far surpassed the level of comparable conferences. The conversations between Estonians and foreigners often ranged beyond the framework of the usual small talk. Delegates from the Western countries (as well as delegates from Moscow and Leningrad) experienced that the quality of life and the ordering of the affairs of life in Estonia differed significantly from that in the rest of the Soviet Union. Among other things, it was noted that Soviet Estonian scientists and captains of industry lived relatively comfortably in material terms, but many of them had not resigned themselves to the absence of national independence and spiritual and intellectual freedom. Occasioned by the events in Czechoslovakia, a particular humane solidarity was clearly felt between Estonians and participants from Western countries, regardless of the fact that these events were not expressly spoken about. The report also refers to the observation noted by a representative of a South American country as an example of the contradictory emotions that emerged among the foreign guests in Estonia: he stated that he had always loved freedom, yet he had never before experienced what it means to be deprived of it. He continued that he now knew that he would fight for the preservation of freedom.
   The commentary of Enno Reinsalu, a young Estonian mining scientist at that time who participated in the symposium who is currently a professor emeritus at the Tallinn University of Technology, and Henning von Wistinghausen's review of the symposium are appended to the report. In many respects, Reinsalu affirms the observations presented in the report and adds explanations to them based on the viewpoint of a professional specialist. Wistinghausen's review adds a humane and personal dimension to his official overview drawn up half a century ago.

TI  - An Assessment of the Applicability of Sustainability Measurement Tools to Resource-Based Economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The concept of sustainable development (SD) is aimed at ensuring public well-being for the present and future generations. Hundreds of methods have been proposed for assessing and comparing the sustainable development of countries and analyzing their contribution to the future of the world. When applied to resource-based economies (RBEs), assessment tools do not take into account the value and impact of mineral resources on SD indicators. The purpose of the study is to reveal the limitations of applying some tools by taking into consideration the specific features of RBEs. Research methods include a correlation analysis between gross national income (GNI) per capita and aggregated indices (the Sustainable Society Index (SSI), the Human Development Index (HDI), and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI)), a comparative analysis of these indices and mining companies' performance indicators. Object Eurasian RBEs were selected, but Norway was analyzed separately from the sample. The results of the study show that correlations between GNI per capita and SD indicators are heterogeneous. There is no statistically significant correlation between GNI per capita and SSI, a strong correlation with HDI, and a weak correlation with EPI. The EPI and SSI structures do not reflect the specific features of RBEs.

TI  - High demand for local area level statistics - How do National Statistical Institutes respond?
T2  - REGIONAL STATISTICS
AB  - Linking people to place is becoming increasingly important, not least because of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. Enhancing traditional statistics at the regional level with those at the local area level enriches the way National Statistical Institutes provide information to society. To provide such statistics at local level in a timely manner, the production of statistics needs to be modernised and based on various data sources, such as administrative registers and geospatial information.
   The United Nations has recognised the importance of statistical-geospatial integration by creating an Expert Group under the UN Global Geospatial Information Management initiative. The European Statistical System has also paved the way for such an integration by funding the GEOSTAT projects.
   For National Statistical Institutes looking to improve their capability to produce statistics at the local level, the Global Statistical Geospatial Framework is a starting point that describes the requirements that need to be fulfilled. For guidance on how to start with a more bottom-up approach, the GEOSTAT 2 project has developed key actions aligned with the Generic Statistical Business Process Model. Statistics Sweden's capability assessment might also provide some inspiration.

TI  - Financial sustainability of biogas technology: Barriers, opportunities, and solutions
T2  - ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY
AB  - Biogas technology, which converts biological waste into energy, is considered as an excellent tool to improve the lives, livelihoods, health, and ecosystem. The demand and prospect of biogas technology as a renewable energy source in terms of market value have not been adequately addressed, although it offers a large revenue opportunity that supports the socioeconomic development in rural areas. For more sustainable development of this technology, policy-makers should reform the existing institutional framework by reorganizing subsidies, motivating and attracting investors with flexible financial conditions, liberalizing the management of gas grids, and involving farmers in local projects. Therefore, it is a great challenge to find a proper mode of marketing policy, business models, and multi-profit options and a sustainable financing mechanism. This paper covers the state-of-the-art enlargements and future consequences of the hastily emerging biogas market, starting with a universal viewpoint and going through special market characteristics of Europe, USA, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

TI  - Exploring built environment stock metabolism and sustainability by systems analysis approaches
T2  - BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION
AB  - The material and energy metabolism of the built environment stocks can be examined by use of a generic model framework that allows for a dynamic analysis where the stock's quantity, composition and quality are related to the demand for service provided to the population. The stock is classified by use of type-age matrices, according to what are the important functions, age structure and material composition of the stock. A mathematical model is demonstrated for calculating the relationship between annual stock size, annual stock change, past inflows and present outflows. This allows for quantification of the material and energy metabolism, in a system life cycle perspective, and its corresponding economic and environmental performance. Various aspects of the approach are applied to selected built environment stocks in Norway, and this paper documents part of this approach for building stocks and road bridge stocks.

TI  - Creating transitions to electric road transport in Norway: The role of user imaginaries
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - The aim of this paper is to study the role of user imaginaries in relation to electric cars and the role these imaginaries play in the ongoing transition towards electrification of the transport sector. We conducted interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders to explore how imaginaries of the public are constructed and how the shared expectations of a user trajectory shaped by user groups with different concerns and different expected technology developments influence policy. We identified a range of implications and influences of this shared imagination for different aspects of the development of strategies and policies related to electrification of the transport sector in Norway. Finally, we discuss how these user imaginaries, that we call imagined publics, appear to have become part of the process of sociotechnical changes and what the consequences may be for a transformation to sustainable mobility.

TI  - Analysis of business models for potential 3Mode transport corridor
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB  - This paper focuses on a potential, sustainable, intermodal transport option in the EU connecting two geographical areas: the Nordic and Southeast European countries. The different parties included in this potential corridor constitute a complex, intermodal transport corridor network. In this paper our aim is not to focus on the infrastructure itself; rather, it is to discuss potential business models for this corridor based on a combination of three modes of transport: road, sea and rail. In this study the potential corridor is referred to as the 3ModeCorridor, and the study examines potential business models for this type of corridor. We use four business model options from the literature for intermodal transport and describe their content. Then, based on the case study findings, we describe which of the business models are realistic and which can exist at the same time. We also analyze the starting model with the most potential and the possible evolution of the business models in a 5-year time frame. For the analysis we use results from in-depth interviews conducted in 51 companies from Norway, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece. The interviewed companies represent potential service buyers and transport service operators for the potential corridor. Based on the results, most of the interviewees believe a balanced model (the Operator-3PL Model) will be the starting business model with the most potential. In this model, the logistics service providers (LSPs) and operators have a rather equal relationship and there are few customers using the service. Concerning evolution, the results indicate that the models with the most potential will be those that cater for the needs of different clients. As a consequence, the role of LSP would seem to grow over time. It seems that in this type of business model the operators (rail, shipping and trucking companies) will increasingly focus on their basic function, transport. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Habitat type mediates equilibrium with climatic conditions in the distribution of Iberian diving beetles
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim The contrasting habitat permanence over geological time-scales of lotic and lentic habitats may impose different constraints on the dispersal ability of their macroinvertebrate populations, and ultimately on the degree of equilibrium with current climate. We aim to test for differences between species typical of either habitat type in their potential versus realized distributions as a surrogate measure of degree of climate equilibrium, both in refuges and more recently deglaciated areas. Location Western Europe. Methods We focus on 99 Iberian diving beetles (family Dytiscidae). A multidimensional envelope procedure was used to estimate their potential distributions, which were projected for different spatial scales. At the continental scale we calculated the percentage of countries with climatically suitable conditions for each species over those actually occupied (range filling). At the regional scale, we estimated realized distributions using: (1) convex hull polygons for Sweden and the Iberian Peninsula; and (2) generalized linear models for the Iberian Peninsula. Results In the Iberian Peninsula, differences in the degree of equilibrium with climatic conditions between lotic and lentic species were few, if any. However, at the continental scale we found significant differences, with lentic species closer to equilibrium than lotic species. In the recently deglaciated area (Sweden) the subset of species with ranges wide enough to encompass Iberia and Scandinavia were mostly lentic, and all were closer to climatic equilibrium without significant differences between habitat types. Main conclusions Our results show that, at continental scales, climate equilibrium is not concordant between the habitat types across western Europe. We hypothesize that: (1) the differences between refuge areas in dispersal ability are erased probably due to long-term climatic stability, allowing enough time to reach equilibrium, and (2) the species with wide geographical ranges able to recolonize recently deglaciated areas should have the highest dispersal abilities, and are closer to climatic equilibrium.

TI  - Information potential of long term experiments and inventory data for forest research
T2  - ALLGEMEINE FORST UND JAGDZEITUNG
AB  - Title of the paper: Information potential of long term experiments and inventory data for forest research. The tradition of long term forest experiments started in 1873 with a manual for thinning experiments published by the Society of German Forest Research. Many of these experiments are still in observation and have been used to understand the principles of forest growth, to test hypothesis, to derive models for sustainable management and to give advice to forest managers. Since the 1970s many permanent forest inventories have been established to describe the forest on a national, regional or company level. The availability of growth information from inventory data puts the amount of the long term experiments into question. The main difference between both sources of information is that long term experiments are designed to study cause and effects by active variation of one variable. Inventories are made to estimate unbiased the state or the change of a variable of interest, in example the standing volume or the volume growth. Inventory data represents usually average conditions and rarely extreme conditions which are important for understanding and modelling. However long term experiments are expensive in time and effort. Therefore, it is often not possible to establish the experiments on wide amplitude of site conditions. The use of existing inventory data in combination with long term experiment is a possibility to enlarge the data base and derive fast results for current issues. For example Albert and Schmidt (2010) used this approach to model climatic effects on the site index of Norway spruce and European beech. Long term experiments will still be essential for forest research. Available inventory data can be useful to fill in data gaps and to project the long term experiment results to a regional or overall site level.

TI  - ARCHAEOLOGY OF PURGATORY AND HELL: ON THE TYPOLOGY OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR ENDINGS IN EUROPE
T2  - ACTA HISTRIAE
AB  - Not only beginnings, but also endings and consequences of the WWII differed greatly across Europe. Thus, the main aim of the present article is to sketch an attempt at typology of the beforementioned endings.
   Of course, the form of entrance into the world conflict must be considered also as a major influence contributing to the war's ending in respective area. Also, role of the racist ideology of the German war efforts can harldly be overestimated. On the other hand, both the Soviet Union's initial alliance with the Germans as well as its contribution to the ultimate victory over Hitler largely contributed to the paradoxes of the WWII endings, since the Soviet Union on the one hand secured for itself almost all gains won by its pact with Germany, and on the other hand earned absolution from Western allies for its actions as well as pretty much unimpended control over much of Central and Eastern Europe. Hence, a basic division arose between western and eastern parts of the continent. Western Europe wasn't the main strategic goal of German war plans and was also rated higher in the racial landscape of Nazi ideologists. This greatly diminished loss of life in these parts of Europe. Even Jewish communities - with the exception of, perhaps, the Dutch one - fared better in comparison to their Eastern counterparts. Even among Western countries, Denmark can be regarded as an exception, since there the occupation system was by far the mildest, even allowing for a free election during the war. France can be put to the other end of the line, since the collaboration there was partly fed by the genuine domestic opposition to the post-revolutionary and Republican system of the Third Republic, leading to many civil-war like conflicts. The differences notwithstanding, almost all occupied territories of the Western Europe experienced a strong sense of national humiliation.
   Among German war-time allies, a pretty sharp divide between Italy and Finland, remaining as part of the Western bloc after the war, and other countries must be drawn. Finland successfully withdrew from the war, something which Italy (and Hungary) weren't able to achieve. For all countries of this group the prevalence of military victims over the civil ones is characteristic. In Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary the end of the war also brought Soviet military presence and mostly brutal purges of the prewar political elite.
   Among the German-occupied countries in the European Southeast, the German racist ideology dictated harsh and merciless occupations in all Slavic countries except Czech Protectorate where the ecomomic benefits seemed to overcome the racial prejudice, as well as in Greece where population was striken by famine and plague of division between three occupying forces (something that also happened in Poland in Yugoslavia). The lot of Jewish population was also by far hardest in this part of Europe, leading to mortality rates of approximately 90 per cent in Poland, Lithuania and great parts of Greece.
   Yugoslavia can be described as "little Europe" in regard to the dynamics and endings of the WWII. In general, the misconcepted puppet state of Croatia must be seen as a major negative factor contributing to the brutality of war in Yugoslavia. Like the state as a whole, the prewar Drava county experienced division between different occupation systems. Like in Montenegro, the mildest, Italian, occupation system, proved to be the best starting point for an excruciating civil war, greatly influencing the end of the WWII in present-day Slovenia and its aftermath.

TI  - Successional pathways in Swiss mountain forest reserves
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Knowledge on the natural dynamics of Norway spruce-European silver fir forests is scarce, but is of high importance for the sustainable management of these ecosystems. Using a unique data set from five forest reserves in the Swiss Alps that covers up to 35 years, we elucidated communalities and differences in stand structure and species composition across the reserves and over time and investigated the role of site conditions versus intrinsic forest dynamics. For the early and late successional phases, we found a clear relationship between stand structure (diameter distributions) and species composition. Two pathways of early succession were evident as a function of the disturbance regime. Thus, the spatial extent of disturbances in spruce-fir forests strongly determines the pathway in early succession. Contrary to earlier descriptions of clearly distinguishable optima phases, our data did not reveal a relationship between stand structure and species composition for the early, mid-, and late optimum phases. Although the reserves investigated here are characterized by highly different climatic and soil conditions, their temporal development was found to fit well into a single successional scheme, suggesting that in spruce-fir mountain forests, the life-history strategies of the tree species may have a stronger influence on successional trajectories than site conditions per se.

TI  - Novel root zone soil water retention improves production with half the water in arid sands
T2  - AGRONOMY JOURNAL
AB  - Urbanization and industrial competition continue to reduce both farmland and available water for food production. Therefore, a new root zone soil water retention technology was modified to transform highly permeable soils into sustainable agriculture. This long-term drought avoidance technology was tested in two arid regions of Iraq, an arid country with declining irrigation water supplies. Manually installed U-shaped impermeable membrane troughs were compared with manually installed thin layers of partially decomposed organic matter. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) variety Dafnis (Syngenta Sweden) and spicy pepper (Capsicum solanaceae L.) crops were spring planted at Najaf and Diyala field sites during a 2-yr study. Soil water, temperature, and salinity were measured hourly, and compared to crop growth parameters, yields, and irrigation water use efficiency. Combined weights of four tomato and spicy pepper harvests were (P = .05) 15 and 25% greater on sand soils equipped with root zone soil water retaining technology (SWRT) membranes and required 61% less irrigation water than crops grown on locally practiced organic matter-lined and no water retaining control soils. Spicy pepper production on SWRT membranes (P = .05) increased 30% with concomitant (P = .05) 125% greater irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) than organic matter-layered and control soils at Diyala.

TI  - Sustainability and automobility among the elderly: An international assessment
T2  - TRANSPORTATION
AB  - In the next three decades there will a huge increase in both the absolute number of older people and in their percentage of the population in almost all Western European countries, North America, and Australia. Most older people will have active lifestyles in which mobility and access play a major role and almost all older men and a majority of older women will be car drivers, used to the convenience and flexibility which the car provides.
   Using data from the US, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom, the paper shows that, in spite of cultural and policy differences, older people around the world are more likely to have a license, to take more trips, and to do so more often as the driver of a car than older people just a decade ago; they are also less likely to use public transit. These trends have a number of sustainability implications - the most obvious one is increased environmental pollution. For example, even though older people may travel less than younger drivers they may be polluting proportionately more because a) they are less likely to make as great a proportion of trips in public transit as younger people and b) the trips they do make may create more pollutants. In addition, older drivers may incur more wasted miles due to wayfinding errors and trip-scouting behavior. And when older people curtail their driving, younger family members may have to increase (or lengthen) their trip-making to provide needed services or additional transportation.
   While this paper stresses the environmental problems posed by an aging population, effective strategies arise from a focus on a broader definition of sustainability. The most important approach is to accept the inevitable and work to make the private car "greener" and safer. New transit service concepts and strategic community and neighborhood design and service elements can complement the development of cleaner cars.
   Although many of the potential strategies are not new, or can be expensive to implement, the convergence of environmental concerns with other problems arising from the automobility of the elderly - including increasing crash rates and serious loss of mobility among those unable to drive - may make these policies more politically viable than in the past.

TI  - A Winter-to-Summer Transition of Bacterial and Archaeal Communities in Arctic Sea Ice
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
AB  - The Arctic is warming 2-3 times faster than the global average, leading to a decrease in Arctic sea ice extent, thickness, and associated changes in sea ice structure. These changes impact sea ice habitat properties and the ice-associated ecosystems. Sea-ice algal blooms provide various algal-derived carbon sources for the bacterial and archaeal communities within the sea ice. Here, we detail the transition of these communities from winter through spring to early summer during the Norwegian young sea ICE (N-ICE2015) expedition. The winter community was dominated by the archaeon Candidatus Nitrosopumilus and bacteria belonging to the Gammaproteobacteria (Colwellia, Kangiellaceae, and Nitrinocolaceae), indicating that nitrogen-based metabolisms, particularly ammonia oxidation to nitrite by Cand. Nitrosopumilus was prevalent. At the onset of the vernal sea-ice algae bloom, the community shifted to the dominance of Gammaproteobacteria (Kangiellaceae, Nitrinocolaceae) and Bacteroidia (Polaribacter), while Cand. Nitrosopumilus almost disappeared. The bioinformatically predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes increased during spring and summer, indicating that sea-ice algae-derived carbon sources are a strong driver of bacterial and archaeal community succession in Arctic sea ice during the change of seasons. This implies a succession from a nitrogen metabolism-based winter community to an algal-derived carbon metabolism-based spring/ summer community.

TI  - Microbial diversity and community-environment relationships in boreal streams
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimThe perspective that microbial communities are controlled solely by environmental factors (everything is everywhere, but the environment selects') has persisted for a long time, notwithstanding that recent studies have found that both environmental factors and spatial processes are important. We examined variation in the structure of fungal and bacterial communities in boreal streams along large local environmental gradients (e.g. stream size, acidity and nutrients) at intermediate spatial extent. Owing to the intermediate spatial extent of our study area and high dispersal rates of microbes, we expected that local environmental factors would structure stream fungal and bacterial communities.
   LocationA set of 30 streams was sampled along a geographical transect from western to eastern Finland.
   MethodsLeaf packs were used as sampling units in each stream. Fungal and bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined using pyrosequencing in the laboratory. Species accumulation curves were used to assess how well the regional species pools were sampled. Partial redundancy analysis and partial linear regression were used to determine the relative contributions of environmental and spatial variables to community structure and OTU richness, respectively.
   ResultsWe found that environmental control was important in structuring fungal and bacterial communities, yet much of the variation was attributable to the shared effects of environmental and spatial predictors, or remained unexplained. The composition of fungal and bacterial communities was most strongly related to water chemistry variables (i.e. pH, aluminium and total phosphorus), whereas habitat variables (i.e. riparian deciduous trees, moss cover, substratum particle size and stream width) were clearly less important. We also found that fungal richness was negatively related to water iron concentration, whereas bacterial richness showed only a weak relationship with water pH.
   Main conclusionsThe composition and richness of stream microbial communities are mostly related to water chemistry variables at the spatial extent studied, emphasizing an important role for species sorting. This finding supports the traditional perspective that local environmental conditions are important drivers of variation in microbial communities. However, much of the variation in fungal and bacterial communities remained unexplained, suggesting that drivers of these communities are likely to be complex and not yet fully understood.

TI  - FARMER'S FREEDOM IN THE PRODUCTIVE WORLD ORDER: STANDARD TAKERS, CONTESTERS AND NEGOTIATORS, OR DISSENTERS?
T2  - TRANSFORMING THE RURAL: GLOBAL PROCESSES AND LOCAL FUTURES
CP  - 13th World Congress of Rural Sociology
AB  - Today, governance of food safety and quality as well as environmental aspects of food chains increasingly operates through public and private standards. This governance, as led by retail power, is often interpreted to undermine farmer's agrarian independence by dictating detailed agricultural practices on the farm, thereby conditioning access into the food chain. Focusing on farmers' discursive resources, agrarian writing implies an alternative social force, constructed here as farmer's freedom. By analysing qualitative data from Finland along the theoretical axes of farmers' interest in socio-economic achievement and willingness to comply with standards, a more nuanced understanding of farmers' occupational freedom emerges. Freedom in economic interests and organic farming represents farmers as standard takers as standards supported values most important for them. Realizing freedom in economic creativity can be antagonistic to (public) standards and lead to contestations and negotiations for feasibility. Finally, freedom in self-sufficiency is antithetical to the commercial food chain; how-ever, dissenting from standards displays a strong capacity to close the metabolic rift, along with organic farming. The evidence from the study suggests that farmers' freedom has the character of a social force to modify food chains and to increase their socio-economic and environmental sustainability and to call for consumers' freedom to join farmers' efforts.

TI  - A decision theoretic approach to an accident sequence: when feedwater and auxiliary feedwater fail in a nuclear power plant
T2  - RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB  - This study applies a decision theoretic perspective on a severe accident management sequence in a processing industry. The sequence contains loss of feedwater and auxiliary feedwater in a boiling water nuclear reactor (BWR), which necessitates manual depressurization of the reactor pressure vessel to enable low pressure cooling of the core. The sequence is fast and is a major contributor to core damage in probabilistic risk analyses (PRAs) of this kind of plant. The management of the sequence also includes important, difficult and fast human decision making. The decision theoretic perspective, which is applied to a Swedish ABB-type reactor, stresses the roles played by uncertainties about plant state, consequences of different actions and goals during the management of a severe accident sequence. Based on a theoretical analysis and empirical simulator data the human error probabilities in the PRA for the plant are considered to be too small. Recommendations for how to improve safety are given and they include full automation of the sequence, improved operator training, and/or actions to assist the operators' decision making through reduction of uncertainties, for example, concerning water/steam level for sufficient cooling, time remaining before insufficient cooling level in the tank is reached and organizational cost-benefit evaluations of the events following a false alarm depressurization as well as the events following a successful depressurization at different points in time. Finally, it is pointed out that the approach exemplified in this study is applicable to any accident scenario which includes difficult human decision making with conflicting goals, uncertain information and with very serious consequences.

TI  - Advantages of grass-legume mixture for improvement of crop growth and reducing potential nitrogen loss in a boreal climate
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE
AB  - A three-year field experiment was established to assess intercropping for sustainable forage production in Finland. In split-plot design, fertilizer treatment with unfertilized control, organic fertilizer, and synthetic fertilizer was the main plot factor, and crop treatment with fallow, red clover (Trifolium pratense), timothy (Phleum pratense), and a mixture of red clover and timothy was the sub-plot factor. Dry matter, carbon and nitrogen yields in mixture plots were highest with relatively high N% and the optimum C:N ratio (p < 0.05). Fertilization increased annual yields of mixture and timothy but not that of red clover. Soil NO3-N changed over time (p < 0.05) and was highest in fallow, followed by red clover, mixture, and timothy (p < 0.05), and the decrease during late growing season was smaller in the mixture and timothy plots. At the end of the experiment, soil C/NO3-N ratio was higher in timothy and mixture while lower in red clover and fallow plots (p < 0.05), and the relationship between soil DNA and NO3-N content may indicate that the potential nitrogen loss was lower in mixture and timothy than that in fallow and red clover plots.

TI  - How does wing length relate to distribution patterns of stoneflies (Plecoptera) and mayflies (Ephemeroptera)?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Short wings, and hence a potential for reduced dispersal capacity, can be one of several reasons for rarity in freshwater insects. To test this hypothesis, I compared wing lengths, standardised for body length differences, of stoneflies and mayflies based on published Swedish material. Taking 25% presence as the limit between rare and not rare, rare species indeed had shorter wings than those that were classified as not rare. Wing length was not the sole explanation for rarity as seen in the presence of rare species along the entire range of wing to body lengths. In both stoneflies and mayflies wing lengths were positively related to range sizes. Occupancy showed a positive relationship with wing size in mayflies, whereas in stoneflies the relationship was not significant, probably because there was no difference in wing lengths over a range of occupancy values in the common species. Implications for conservation include the importance to identify poor dispersers among these groups and describe their habitats, since it can be expected that recolonisation by poor flyers can be very uncertain and slow after local extinction. Therefore, localities with rare, poorly-dispersing species should be protected but if extinction occurs, re-introduction might offer a possibility to re-establish such insects.

TI  - Soil Nematode Assemblages in Natural European Peatlands of the Horna Orava Protected Landscape Area, Slovakia
T2  - WETLANDS
AB  - An investigation of the soil nematode communities in four natural European peatlands of the Protected Landscape Area Horna Orava, Slovakia, was conducted to determine the diversity of the associated soil nematode community structures. A total of 112 nematode species belonging to 66 nematode genera were detected. Nineteen species, including a root-knot nematode species Meloidogyne kralli, were recorded in Slovakia for the first time, increasing the number of soil nematodes recorded from 704 to 723. This high diversity was associated with the occurrence of taxa preferring the wet soil conditions such as Ditylenchus intermedius, Epidorylaimus agilis, Metateratocephalus crassidens, Helicotylenchus hydrophilus, Mesorhabditis irregularis, Semitobrilus pellucidus. The number of species and genera did not correlate with the nematode abundance, as the highest number of species and genera where not found in sites with the highest number of nematodes. Feeding type composition was similar at all of the investigated peatlands and bacteriovores were the dominant trophic group (50 %) with a preponderance of Rhabditis nematodes. The ecological indices (MI, PPI, aMI, MI2-5 and PPI/MI ratio) indicated that the native ecosystems studied were relatively mature and stable, with a B/F ratio indicating a prevalence of bacterial decomposition pathways corresponding to high values of the NCR index.

TI  - Revenue efficiency of bioenergy industry: the case of European Union (EU) member countries
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
AB  - Bioenergy plays a crucial role in numerous sectors such as industry, electricity, heating, cooling, and transportation. Previous research on bioenergy focused on the production and strategies to improve bioenergy development and distribution in the EU. This study computes the revenue efficiency level and investigates the economic determinants of revenue efficiency of the bioenergy industry in EU28 countries between 1995 and 2018. The study employed the nonparametric data envelopment analysis method to compute the revenue efficiency level, and ordinary least squares, random effects, and fixed effects models were applied to investigate the determinants of revenue efficiency. The results show that most of the countries are efficient, given a high-efficiency score, with France, Malta, Sweden, and Slovakia as the most efficient, while Cyprus is the least efficient. Furthermore, empirical results indicate that capital and labor have a negative impact, while GDP and the size of biomass have positive and significant impact on revenue efficiency of the bioenergy industry in EU28 countries during the period studied. This study provides an insight for bioenergy policymakers and investors-to the understanding of the impact of revenue efficiency on the sustainability of the bioenergy industry.

TI  - "In the evening, I don't walk in the park": The interplay between street lighting and greenery in perceived safety
T2  - URBAN DESIGN INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Walking as a means of transportation is a key feature in sustainable urban design, but few studies have examined the influence of micro-level environmental features, such as vegetation and street lighting, on perceived safety and people's choice to walk. This study applied a non-explicit approach to examine the relationship between greenery, street lighting, perceived safety, and walking in an urban context. Participants from three neighbourhoods in Malmo, Sweden, took part in focus group discussions concerning neighbourhood qualities related to walking. A qualitative analysis revealed four inter-related themes relevant for perceived safety after dark: avoidance, entrapment, presence of others, and prospect (visual overview of the nearby surroundings). The quality of urban greenery and street lighting impacted people's route choices after dark, and some participants felt compelled to make detours. Entrapment, partly due to unkempt greenery in combination with darkness, contributed to avoidance, whereas the presence of other people had the opposite effect. The results indicate that urban greenery and street lighting must be considered together, since their interaction influences perceived safety and impacts the walkability of the neighbourhood.

TI  - Activating Dance Records Conceptualizing research into the Swedish, Nordic and global archives pertaining to the Russian dancer Anna Robenne
T2  - NORDIC THEATRE STUDIES
AB  - This article explores the following research question: In what ways can activations of dance records (archived materials and other recordings of activities) be conceptualized to contribute to the making of a critically productive dance history in the digital age? Drawing on an extensive study of the Russian dancer Anna Robenne, the article focuses on the archival explorations (or road trip) as such, and in particular the multifaceted ways in which the records themselves can be active agents in processes of memory making and history production. Adopting recent theoretical developments concerning the concept of pluralization in archival studies, the exploration discards the conventional and rather static understanding of records as neutral containers of facts to emphasize instead an inclusive and infinitely evolving process. Working within an interdisciplinary archive-oriented realm, the author reflexively makes use of practices and methods belonging to both art history and classical and contemporary dance tradition. The article first maps recent pluralizing approaches within archival studies including re-theorizations of the key concepts records, provenance, value and representation. It then conceptualizes archival activation through examples from the archival road trip. The article concludes by offering the reader clear arguments for archival pluralization in the form of intimate, invasive, and imaginary activation, and demonstrates the importance and relevance of closely, critically and imaginatively engaging with records. The article highlights the role the archive can play in breaking down cultural barriers and re-evaluating notions of dance historiography, heritage and cultural identity.

TI  - Digital platforms as common goods or economic goods? Constructing the worth of a nascent agricultural data platform
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - The potential of digital platforms to deliver on both economic and societal values is contested, with many arguing that economic value is prioritized to the detriment of more social values. Yet, the literature lacks indepth empirical studies on how these perceptions of worth in the early stage of platform development are developed and settled upon. This paper draws on valuation studies to provide insight into how multiple platform founders construct the worth of a nascent agriculture data-sharing platform in Sweden. Using qualitative methods, the study shows that initially, the platform founders consider a number of values (accessible and transparent data, profitability, sustainability and innovation) that are defined through 'common good' and 'economic good' aspects. However, the need to articulate the worth to potential funders and partners encourages a reliance on measurable qualities, which subsequently leads to a shift in how values are defined and discussed, foregrounding and backgrounding different values and stakeholders in the process. These insights point to the complexity for firms grappling with economic and social values and highlight the need for the re-evaluation of the frameworks used to determine the value of innovation in the agri-food sector.

TI  - The role of spatial scale and area in determining richness-altitude gradients in Swedish lake phytoplankton communities
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Lake phytoplankton richness data were analyzed to reveal the effects of area and scale on the richness-elevation relationship. Lakes provide a unique opportunity to accomplish this because of their well-defined boundaries, which clearly define local communities and their habitat area. Local phytoplankton richness (alpha diversity) was found to decrease with increasing elevation, even when the effect of lake area was accounted for. This decrease coincided with a decrease in lake productivity with increasing elevation. Additionally, pairwise dissimilarity calculations suggested that isolation by distance was less important in structuring local phytoplankton richness than isolation by either elevation or environmental distance. In contrast, phytoplankton richness calculated for elevation bands (gamma diversity) showed a hump-shaped dependence on elevation, with a mid-elevation maximum, consistent with the predictions of a mid-domain null model. Moreover, mean pairwise dissimilarity within elevation bands shows compositional dissimilarity to be highest at high elevations and low environmental distances, emphasizing the isolated character of high-elevation lakes. We suggest that the form of the phytoplankton richness-elevation relationship is scale-dependent, and that geometric constraints, differences in the possibility of horizontal and vertical dispersal, environmental heterogeneity and an underlying monotonic trend in productivity, are likely to be responsible for the patterns in alpha and gamma diversity observed along elevation gradients.

TI  - Soil water and root distribution of apple tree (<i>Malus pumila Mill</i>) stands in relation to stand age and rainwater collection and infiltration system (RWCI) in a hilly region of the Loess Plateau, China
T2  - CATENA
AB  - Soil water status and fine root distribution is the basis of implementing water management in semiarid rain-fed orchards. Exploitation of rainwater is an effective avenue for alleviating water scarcity in semiarid regions since ground water is generally unavailable there. Through the method of space-for-time substitution, we investigated the soil moisture and root distribution along a range of stand ages (6, 9, 12, 18 and 21 years) in rain-fed apple (Malus pumila Mill) orchards and the effects of rainwater collection and infiltration systems (RWCI) on root-zone soil water and fine root distributions in matures apple orchards (21 years) in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that the mean soil moisture content (SMC) in the shallow layer (< 2 m) decreased with apple tree age (6 to 18 years); the deep SMC (> 2 m) was higher than shallow soil layers (< 2 m) in most cases and the SMC increased with depth in stands of all ages. Fine roots (< 2 mm diameter) showed an obvious trend of extending deeper with apple tree age - nearly 8 m in a 12-yr-old apple plantation and > 8 m in plantations > 12 years old. Dry root weight density (RWD) decreased sharply with depth, but densities at each depth were greater in older stands. The RWCI system significantly increased SMCs from the surface down to the maximum rainfall infiltration depth (MRID) (2 m depth) (P < 0.05), especially in the 0.2-1 m soil layer. Further, we found that apple tree water requirements could be sustainably met when RWCI system and a low-volume of irrigation water was applied. The distribution of root system was greatly affected by the RWCI system, which led to higher root densities close to the wetted area in the shallow soil layers (2 m soil depth) under RWCI system, down to a depth of 3 m in the soil. Overall, the application of RWCI system could be an effective water management strategy for providing sustainable water resources for semiarid orchards.

TI  - Antler size of Alaskan moose <i>Alces alces gigas</i>:: effects of population density, hunter harvest and use of guides
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
AB  - Moose Alces alces gigas in Alaska, USA, exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with adult males possessing large, elaborate antlers. Antler size and conformation are influenced by age, nutrition and genetics, and these bony structures serve to establish social rank and affect mating success. Population density, combined with anthropogenic effects such as harvest, is thought to influence antler size. Antler size increased as densities of moose decreased, ostensibly a density-dependent response related to enhanced nutrition at low densities. The vegetation type where moose were harvested also affected antler size, with the largest-antlered males occupying more open habitats. Hunts with guides occurred in areas with low moose density, minimized hunter interference and increased rates of success. Such hunts harvested moose with larger antler spreads than did non-guided hunts. Knowledge and abilities allowed guides to satisfy demands of trophy hunters, who are an integral part of the Alaskan economy. Heavy harvest by humans was also associated with decreased antler size of moose, probably via a downward shift in the age structure of the population resulting in younger males with smaller antlers. Nevertheless, density-dependence was more influential than effects of harvest on age structure in determining antler size of male moose. Indeed, antlers are likely under strong sexual selection, but we demonstrate that resource availability influenced the distribution of these sexually selected characters across the landscape. We argue that understanding population density in relation to carrying capacity (K) and the age structure of males is necessary to interpret potential consequences of harvest on the genetics of moose and other large herbivores. Our results provide researchers and managers with a better understanding of variables that affect the physical condition, antler size, and perhaps the genetic composition of populations, which may be useful in managing and modelling moose populations.

TI  - Sustainable energy development in the major power-generating countries of the European Union: The Pinch Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - In the European Union, the 2020 Climate & Energy Package and 2030 Climate & Energy Framework envisaged gains in energy efficiency and reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions in order to ensure sustainable development of the economy. However, the European Union Member States differ in their energy systems and level of economic development. In this context, the paper seeks to identify the possible outcomes of increase in the production of cleaner energy in the major European Union countries. This provides evidence on the possible energy-mix across different European Union Member States. The study applied the Pinch Analysis in order to identify the energy-mix for electricity generation which corresponds to the goal of the GHG emission reduction of major electricity producers in Europe taking into account the possible promotion of the different types of RES. The countries chosen for the analysis include Poland, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Sweden. The carried out Pinch Analysis revealed the possible pathways for increasing the penetration of specific types of renewables in selected countries which may lead to GHG emission reduction.

TI  - Estimating species colonization dates using DNA in lake sediment
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Detection of DNA in lake sediments holds promise as a tool to study processes like extinction, colonization, adaptation and evolutionary divergence. However, low concentrations make sediment DNA difficult to detect, leading to high false negative rates. Additionally, contamination could potentially lead to high false positive rates. Careful laboratory procedures can reduce false positive and negative rates, but should not be assumed to completely eliminate them. Therefore, methods are needed that identify potential false positive and negative results, and use this information to judge the plausibility of different interpretations of DNA data from natural archives. We developed a Bayesian algorithm to infer the colonization history of a species using records of DNA from lake-sediment cores, explicitly labelling some observations as false positive or false negative. We illustrate the method by analysing DNA of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus L.) from sediment cores covering the past 10,000years from two central Swedish lakes. We provide the algorithm as an R-script, and the data from this study as example input files. In one lake, Stora Logdasjon, where connectivity with the proto-Baltic Sea and the degree of whitefish ecotype differentiation suggested colonization immediately after deglaciation, DNA was indeed successfully recovered and amplified throughout the post-glacial sediment. For this lake, we found no loss of detection probability over time, but a high false negative rate. In the other lake, Hotagen, where connectivity and ecotype differentiation suggested colonization long after deglaciation, DNA was amplified only in the upper part of the sediment, and colonization was estimated at 2,200bp based on the assumption that successful amplicons represent whitefish presence. Here the earliest amplification represents a false positive with a posterior probability of 41%, which increases the uncertainty in the estimated time of colonization. Complementing careful laboratory procedures aimed at preventing contamination, our method estimates contamination rates from the data. By combining these results with estimates of false negative rates, our models facilitate unbiased interpretation of data from natural DNA archives.

This study on BAYV infection among sympatric, non-oryzomyine rodents ("spillover") in Freeport, TX, is the first to link patterns of hantavirus interspecific spillover with the spatiotemporal ecology of the primary host (marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris). Mark-recapture and/or harvest methods were employed from March 2002 through May 2004 in two macrohabitat types. Rodent blood samples were screened for the presence of IgG antibody to BAYV antigen by IFA after which Ab-positive blood, saliva, and urine were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA by nested RT-PCR. From 727 non-oryzomyine captures, five seropositive (but not viral RNA positive) individuals were detected: one each of Baiomys taylori, Peromyscus leucopus, and Reithrodontomys fulvescens; and two Sigmodon hispidus. Spillover hosts were not associated with macrohabitat where O. palustris abundance, density, or seroprevalence was highest. Rather, spillover occurred in the macrohabitat indicative of greater overall disturbance (as indicated by grazing and exotic plant diversity) and overall biodiversity. Spillover occurred during periods of high seroprevalence detected elsewhere within the study region. Spillover locations differed significantly from all other capture locations in terms of percent water, shrub, and grass cover. Although greater habitat and mammal diversity of old-fields may serve to reduce seroprevalence levels by tempering intraspecific contacts between rice rats, greater diversity also may create an ecologically opportunistic setting for BAYV spillover. Impacts of varying levels of disturbance and biodiversity on transmission dynamics represent a vastly uncharacterized component of the evolutionary ecology of hantaviruses.

TI  - Population size, pollinator limitation, and seed set in the self-incompatible herb Lythrum salicaria
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - In reward-producing animal-pollinated plants, small populations are likely to be less attractive to pollinators than large populations. The likelihood of pollinator limitation of seed production should therefore increase with decreasing population size. I documented the number of flowering plants and plant fecundity in 18 populations of the self-incompatible, tristylous herb Lythrum salicaria within an archipelago in northern Sweden in two consecutive years. To test the hypothesis that a positive correlation between population size and seed set is due to a higher degree of pollinator limitation in small than in large populations, I performed supplemental hand-pollinations in eight (1993) and 13 (1994) of the study populations. To test the hypothesis that common mating types are more likely than rare types to experience inadequate pollination, I compared the natural level of seed production and the effect of supplemental pollination in different style morphs in the five populations in which greater than or equal to 10 plants per morph were included in the experiment. There was no significant correlation between population size and plant size in terms of number of floral shoots or number of flower-producing leaf nodes per shoot. However, there was a positive relationship between population size and seed production per flower and between population size and total seed number per plant. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between population size and seed production of flowers that had received supplemental pollination. In both years, the difference in mean seed production per flower between hand-pollinated flowers and controls decreased with increasing population size. In two of five populations, the effect of supplemental pollination differed significantly among morphs. Seed production was more likely to be pollinator limited in long-styled than in short-styled plants, but this difference could not be attributed to a preponderance of the long-styled morph in the studied populations. Results of the supplemental hand-pollinations indicate that the positive correlation between population size and seed production is a function of insufficient pollen transfer in small populations. Additional demographic studies are needed to determine to what extent the reduced level of seed production in small populations limits the growth of young populations, and to what extent it may threaten the local persistence of L. salicaria.

TI  - The Impact of Strip Roads on the Productivity of Spruce Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Strip roads serve to enable silviculture operations, maintain biodiversity, and decrease damages to the soil and environment. At the same time, strip roads decrease the productive area. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of strip roads on the productivity of spruce plantations growing in different density regimes. Five trials, each of 0.234 ha area, with different density regimes and two replications in an experimental spruce plantation were used for this study. The permanent plots were established in the plantation of 15 years of age and were remeasured every 4-5 years over 24 years. Differences in tree growth between outer rows bordering strip roads and inner rows, 1.75 and 3.5 m from the strip road, were estimated using t statistics. The gross annual increment of trees in outer rows at age 39 years exceeded the increment of trees in inner rows by up to 60%-78%. Increase of productivity occurred primarily due to the more intensive diameter growth and higher density of trees in the outer rows. In general, the influence of strip roads on the total productivity of plantation depends on the ratio of the growth intensity of trees between outer and inner rows as well as ratio of the width of treed strips to the width of the strip road.

TI  - GREENS IN THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF WESTERN EUROPE (<i>Recent</i> <i>Trends</i>)
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB  - The article analyzes the latest trends in political developments, specific for the west-european ecological parties during the second decade of the 21st century. Common features and peculiarities of each party's electoral activities, place and role in the European "green party family" are investigated. Special attention is given to the contemporary "green" ideology which reflects the patterns of the Post-materialism epoch. Today, the "green" parties present themselves as a political force committed to the principles of environmental responsibility, global sustainable development, "universal democracy", respect for diversity, personal freedom, gender equality and non-violence, etc., which constitute post-materialistic values. In the political sphere, the European "greens" have undergone a gradual transformation from a radical alternative political force into a moderate alternative one. They have become less critical towards the State, support economic development, but are skeptical when it comes to any military activity. The author concludes that the popularity of "green" parties in Europe generally grows, although slowly and unevenly. The ecological parties have been most successful in the countries with proportional election system (Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Iceland), which initially became the core of the European "green party family". The case of the German "Bandnis 90/Die Granen" as the biggest ecological party in Europe is particularly examined. In all countries, temporary fluctuations take place - whether the increase or, on the contrary, the decrease of the parties' electoral support, which depends on changes in general political conjuncture. Nevertheless, the data and facts are witnessing a common tendency of strengthening of the "greens' positions in elected bodies at all levels (including the European Parliament). Similar elements and trends in political advancement of the European ecological parties during the latest decades, despite country-related differences, confirm the "green partyfamily" concept, which is thus a correct approach to the European Green Movement.

TI  - The value of retained Scots pines and their dead wood legacies for lichen diversity in clear-cut forests: The effects of retention level and prescribed burning
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - To mitigate the negative impact of intensive forest management on biodiversity, several silvicultural measures are used in production forests. We studied the effect of two such treatments, green-tree retention and prescribed burning on epiphytic lichens 11 years after timber harvests in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) dominated forests of middle boreal Finland. Lichen assemblages were sampled from retained Scots pines and their dead wood legacies (snags and logs) below a height of 2 m. Twelve study sites were harvested with two retention levels (10 and 50 m(3)/ha) and six uncut old-growth sites were used as controls. Prescribed burning was applied to half of the sites immediately after harvest. A total of 42 and 65 lichen species was found in the burned (B) and unburned (UB) sites with 10 m(3)/ha retention, 41 and 74 in the B and UB sites with 50 m(3)/ha retention, and 63 and 80 in the B and UB controls respectively. Mean species richness per tree did not differ between the control and harvested sites at either retention level on any of the substratum types. However, microlichen species richness was significantly lower on harvested sites on both living trees and snags. The species richness of both micro- and macrolichens was lower on burned sites. In addition, the composition of lichen assemblages differed between burned and unburned sites. The negative effect of fire was significant for lichens growing on living trees and snags, but not on logs. We conclude that the retention of Scots pines is a successful measure for maintaining epiphytic lichen richness over a timescale of 11 years after harvest, and that roughly equal numbers of living trees and their dead wood legacies are needed to support the lichen species richness on harvested sites. Given that the negative effect of prescribed burning is relatively longer for lichens than for other wood-dependent organisms, burning should not be applied to stands with particularly rich lichen communities. However, these conclusions may have limitations as our inventory was limited to the lowermost part of tree trunks only. Hence inventories of whole trees are useful to assess the full effect of prescribed burning. Our results also imply that the specific impact of prescribed burning for specialist lichen species should be evaluated over a longer timescale. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Biogeography of Fungal Communities Associated with <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L. and <i>Picea abies</i> (L.) H. Karst. along the Latitudinal Gradient in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - We assessed the diversity and composition of fungal communities in different functional tissues and the rhizosphere soil of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies stands along the latitudinal gradient of these tree species distributions in Europe to model possible changes in fungal communities imposed by climate change. For each tree species, living needles, shoots, roots, and the rhizosphere soil were sampled and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that the latitude and the host tree species had a limited effect on the diversity and composition of fungal communities, which were largely explained by the environmental variables of each site and the substrate they colonize. The mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation had a strong effect on root fungal communities, isothermality on needle fungal communities, mean temperature of the warmest quarter and precipitation of the driest month on shoot fungal communities, and precipitation seasonality on soil fungal communities. Fungal communities of both tree species are predicted to shift to habitats with a lower annual temperature amplitude and with increasing precipitation during the driest month, but the suitability of these habitats as compared to the present conditions is predicted to decrease in the future.

TI  - Habitat conditions and phenological tree traits overrule the influence of tree genotype in the needle mycobiome-<i>Picea glauca</i> system at an arctic treeline ecotone
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Plant-associated mycobiomes in extreme habitats are understudied and poorly understood. We analysed Illumina-generated ITS1 sequences from the needle mycobiome of white spruce (Picea glauca) at the northern treeline in Alaska (USA). Sequences were obtained from the same DNA that was used for tree genotyping. In the present study, fungal metabarcoding and tree microsatellite data were compared for the first time. In general, neighbouring trees shared more fungal taxa with each other than trees growing in further distance. Mycobiomes correlated strongly with phenological host traits and local habitat characteristics contrasting a dense forest stand with an open treeline site. Genetic similarity between trees did not influence fungal composition and no significant correlation existed between needle mycobiome and tree genotype. Our results suggest the pronounced influence of local habitat conditions and phenotypic tree traits on needle-inhabiting fungi. By contrast, the tree genetic identity cannot be benchmarked as a dominant driver for needle-inhabiting mycobiomes, at least not for white spruce in this extreme environment.

TI  - Predicting the Distribution of Indicator Taxa of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems in the Arctic and Sub-arctic Waters of the Nordic Seas
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - In the deep waters of the Nordic Seas and adjacent areas, several benthic habitats such as cold-water coral reefs, coral gardens, and deep-sea sponge aggregations have been classified as vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs), due to their uniqueness, limited spatial extent, physical fragility, and slow recovery rate. In the last decade observations carried out by habitat mapping programmes in Norway, Iceland, and more recently in the Faroe Islands have substantially increased knowledge on the distribution of VMEs in the Nordic Seas. Nevertheless, large areas have not been explored due to the cost and logistics of obtaining observations in the deep-sea. Species distribution models can be used to predict the distribution of VMEs and their indicator species. Here we present the predicted distribution of 44 VME indicator taxa including 20 sponges, 17 cold-water corals, and 7 seapens in the Nordic Seas based on data compiled and models developed by the NovasArc project (2016-2018). Models for 44 VME indicator species were developed using the maximum entropy algorithm MaxEnt, using an extensive database compiled from habitat mapping surveys, by-catch data from bottom fish surveys, and records from reports and peer reviewed publications. Modeled distributions showed good agreement with observations. Niche overlap measures were used to identify seven groups and four subgroups of VME indicator taxa that co-occur. These were consistent with the species composition of known biotopes in the study area. A VME Index that combine the predictions for all VME indicator species was computed to identify particularly valuable and vulnerable ecosystems that should be targets of further exploration and conservation efforts. Such areas were identified at shelf break and slope off Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and central Norway, and the continental shelf off southern Greenland. The predicted distribution of VMEs in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters allows for the evaluation of interactions with fisheries and other anthropogenic activities and provides an important input for managers.

TI  - High pathogenicity avian influenza (H5N1) in Northern Gannets (<i>Morus bassanus</i>): Global spread, clinical signs and demographic consequences
T2  - IBIS
AB  - During 2021 and 2022 High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) killed thousands of wild birds across Europe and North America, suggesting a change in infection dynamics and a shift to new hosts, including seabirds. Northern Gannets Morus bassanus appeared to be especially severely impacted, but a detailed account of the data available is required to help understand how the HPAI virus (HPAIV) spread across the meta-population, and the ensuing demographic consequences. Accordingly, we analyse information on confirmed and suspected HPAIV outbreaks across most North Atlantic Gannet colonies and, for the largest colony (Bass Rock, UK), provide impacts on population size, breeding success, and preliminary results on apparent adult survival and serology. Unusually high numbers of dead Gannets were first noted at colonies in Iceland during April 2022. Outbreaks in May occurred in many Scottish colonies, followed by colonies in Canada, Germany and Norway. By the end of June, outbreaks had occurred in colonies in Canada and the English Channel. Outbreaks in 12 UK and Ireland colonies appeared to follow a clockwise pattern with the last infected colonies recorded in late August/September. Unusually high mortality was recorded at 40 colonies (75% of global total colonies). Dead birds testing positive for HPAIV H5N1 were associated with 58% of these colonies. At Bass Rock, the number of occupied nest-sites decreased by at least 71%, breeding success declined by c. 66% compared with the long-term UK mean and the resighting of marked individuals suggested that apparent adult survival between 2021 and 2022 could have been substantially lower than the preceding 10-year average. Serological investigation detected antibodies specific to H5 in apparently healthy birds, indicating that some Gannets recover from HPAIV infection. Further, most of these recovered birds had black irises, suggestive of a phenotypic indicator of previous infection. Untangling the impacts of HPAIV infection from other challenges faced by seabirds is key to establishing effective conservation strategies for threatened seabird populations as the likelihood of further epizootics increases, due to increasing habitat loss and the industrialization of poultry production.

TI  - Where does Arctic beach debris come from? Analyzing debris composition and provenance on Svalbard aided by citizen scientists
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Plastic debris is ubiquitous in all ecosystems and has even reached locations that humans will hardly reach such as the deep ocean floor and the atmosphere. Research has highlighted that plastic debris is now pervasive even in remote Arctic regions. While modeling projections indicated local sources and long-distance transport as causes, empirical data about its origin and sources are scarce. Data collected by citizen scientists can increase the scale of observations, especially in such remote regions. Here, we report abundance and composition data of marine debris collected by citizen scientists on 14 remote Arctic beaches on the Spitsbergen archipelago. In addition, citizen scientists collected three large, industrial sized canvas bags (hereafter: big packs), filled with beached debris, of which composition, sources and origin were determined. A total debris mass of 1,620 kg was collected on about 38,000 m(2) (total mean = 41.83 g m(-2), SEM = +/- 31.62). In terms of abundance, 23,000 pieces of debris were collected on 25,500 m(2) (total mean = 0.37 items of debris m(-2), SEM = +/- 0.17). Although most items were plastic in both abundance and mass, fisheries waste, such as nets, rope, and large containers, dominated in mass (87%), and general plastics, such as packaging and plastic articles, dominated in abundance (80%). Fisheries-related debris points to local sea-based sources from vessels operating in the Arctic and nearby. General plastics could point to both land- and ship based sources, as household items are also used on ships and debris can be transported to the north via the oceans current. Overall, 1% of the items (206 out of 14,707 pieces) collected in two big packs (2017 and 2021), bore imprints or labels allowing an analysis of their origin. If the categories 'global' and 'English language' were excluded, most of identifiable items originated from Arctic states (65%), especially from Russia (32%) and Norway (16%). But almost a third of the items (30%) was of European provenance, especially from Germany (8%). Five percent originated from more distant sources (e.g. USA, China, Korea, Brazil). Global measures such as an efficient and legally binding plastic treaty with improved upstream measures and waste management are urgently needed, to lower the amount of plastic entering our environments and in turn lifting the pressure on the Arctic region and its sensitive biota.

TI  - Differences in Soil Physicochemical Properties in Different-Aged <i>Pinus massoniana</i> Plantations in Southwest China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - With increasing age, plants will cause changes in soil physicochemical properties. The objective of this study was to investigate differences in the soil physicochemical properties in different-aged Masson pine forest plantations (i.e., 10, 20, 40, and 60 years old). Soil samples were collected in a pure Masson pine forest plantation in Southwest China. The soil determination indexes included organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents, water content, bulk density, and pH. The soil pH of a 20-year-old forest was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of a 10, 40, and 60-year-old forest. In addition, soil-available phosphorus in a 60-year-old forest was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that in the other three age forest groups. With increasing forest age, available phosphorus increased, while available nitrogen decreased at 20 years old and then increased at 40 years old. There was a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) between total nitrogen and available potassium; no significant correlation (p > 0.05) between total phosphorus and total potassium, organic carbon, bulk density, and pH; and a significant negative correlation (p < 0.05) between available phosphorus and the water content. The availability and utilization efficiency of soil nutrients in young forests were higher than those in old forests and the intermediate forest age was an important time point that affected the soil properties. To improve the availability of soil nutrients and ensure the sustainable utilization of soil resources, it is necessary to increase the input of nitrogen and especially phosphorus. More attention should be given to the phytochemometric response with respect to the age of plantations.

TI  - The influence of multiple introduced predators on a littoral pond community
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - In a replicated field experiment we studied the effects of natural densities of two exotic consumers, the predatory and herbivorous signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and the predatory rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), on multiple trophic levels of a pond community. The goals were to: (1) determine the individual and combined effects of predators on macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and periphytic algae; (2) evaluate the strength of direct and indirect interactions in a food web influenced by omnivores; and (3) evaluate the relative importance of direct and indirect predator effects on mortality and growth of a native frog species, Rana temporaria.
   The experiment showed that both signal crayfish and rainbow trout had strong effects on multitrophic levels of a littoral pond community, through direct consumption and indirect effects on lower trophic levels. Crayfish had weak but significant negative effects on the biomass of predatory invertebrates and greatly reduced the biomass of snails, the most abundant invertebrate grazers. Although the number of active herbivorous tadpoles tended to be higher in crayfish cages relative to control cages, the proportion of surviving froglets was lower in crayfish cages than in control cages, possibly due to crayfish predation on injured tadpoles. The size of surviving froglets did not differ from controls, but tadpoles in crayfish cages often suffered tail injuries. Macrophyte coverage decreased as a result of crayfish consumption and nonconsumptive fragmentation. However, the biomass of periphyton increased in crayfish cages relative to controls, probably due to reduced grazing from snails. In contrast, trout had strong negative effects on the biomass of both predatory invertebrates and insect grazers, whereas trout had less effect on snail biomass than did crayfish. Also, in contrast to crayfish cages, the number of active tadpoles in trout cages was lower than in controls, probably due to a combination of trout predation and trout-induced reduced tadpole activity. Trout had a strong negative impact on froglet survival, and froglets in trout cages metamorphosed at a smaller size and had reduced growth rates compared to froglets in crayfish and control cages. As with crayfish, the biomass of periphyton increased in trout cages relative to controls, which may be due to a combination of both density and trait-mediated trout effects on tadpole grazing.
   In treatments with multiple predators the effects of crayfish and trout on caged communities were independent, and there were few interactions. Mostly effects of combined predators reflected those in single predator cages. Our results demonstrate that noninteracting, introduced multiple predators can have strong direct and indirect effects on multiple trophic levels in pond communities. Trophic cascades may develop in aquatic food webs even with omnivores such as crayfish, and in complex habitats with trout. These strong indirect effects are mediated through both predation on important grazers (i.e., the crayfish-snail-periphyton link) and a combination of density and behavioral responses of grazers to predators (i.e., the trout-tadpole-periphyton link). When two noninteracting predators have strong but different effects on prey survival or activity, their combined effects on intermediate trophic levels reflect responses to the more dangerous predator.

TI  - ENERGY SECURITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY: EVIDENCE FROM OECD COUNTRIES
T2  - SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB  - Assessment of energy and environmental issues has received a special focus due to global warming and climate vulnerabilities. Energy, environment and economic development simultaneously yielded a combined effect, which is favorable from the economic point of view while unfavorable for environmental aspects. It is necessary to measure the energy, economic and environmental performance with appropriate methods. Therefore, this study measures the energy security and environmental efficiency. Data used in this study were collected from the official website of International Energy Agency (IEA), British Petroleum (BP) and World Bank. We employ a non-radial DEA technology for assessing energy and environmental efficiency for OECD countries. Results reveal that the values of energy intensity range from 0.93 to 0.30, while GHG emission per capita values range from 24.61 to 5.28. As far as energy efficiency is concerned, Iceland and Greece have the highest value (0.99) of energy efficiency, whereas Ireland has the lowest value (0.34) of energy efficiency. Further analysis shows that Austria, Australia, Portugal and Spain have values between 0.70 and 0.80 for energy intensity, whereas UK, Sweden, Germany and the USA have values of energy intensity, between 0.40 and 0.50. The study proposes some valuable policy implications for policy and decision-makers to make the environment more sustainable.

TI  - Tree diameter distributions in natural and managed old <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>-dominated forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The characteristics and variability of tree diameter distributions were studied in natural and managed old Pinus sylvestris L.-dominated forests in the middle boreal vegetation zone of eastern Fennoscandia. The managed forest stands in the study were located in Hame in southwestern Finland, and the natural stands were located in the Vienansalo wilderness area in northwestern Russia. In natural stands, the mean tree density (tree height > 1.3 m) was significantly higher compared to managed stands, but the two stand categories did not differ in their total basal areas. The shape of the pooled diameter distribution was descending in natural stands and bimodal in managed stands. Within the two stand categories, there was considerable stand-to-stand variation in the shapes of diameter distributions. In general, the range in diameters was larger in natural stands compared to managed ones. This was because large living trees (diameter > 40 cm) were common in natural stands, while in managed stands they were almost totally lacking. Natural stands where the last forest fire occurred 50-60 years ago differed clearly from stands with a longer time lapse since the last fire, particularly in having a higher density of small trees. Diameter distributions were characterized with indices, such as Shannon and Siipilehto, and the Gini coefficient. Taken separately, these indices poorly described and segregated diameter distributions, but with several indices it was possible to characterize the differences between diameter distributions. Both natural and managed stands had heterogeneous diameter distributions, but managed stands lacked some structural features, such as large trees and trees with structural diversity characteristics, which are likely to reduce their ability to sustain high biodiversity. Our results demonstrate that high variability of tree sizes and stand structures is an important diversity feature of naturally dynamic Pinus-dominated forests in Fermoscandia. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Could gaps and diverse topography compensate for habitat deficiency by the forest-dwelling bird Hazel Grouse (<i>Tetrastes bonasia</i>)?
T2  - AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - The Hazel Grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) is considered an indicator of the naturalness and heterogeneity of the forest environment. This species occurs in various woods and forages on a variety of plants. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that, in Norway spruce-dominated forest stands, the Hazel Grouse compensates for habitat poverty using non-forest areas and harsh topography, which deliver food resources and shelter for the birds. We compared 14 environmental and topographic variables in forest patches occupied and unoccupied by the Hazel Grouse in the Tatra Mountains (South Poland). Multivariate modelling showed that crucial factors for Hazel Grouse occurrence in spruce-dominated high-mountain forests were southern or western exposures, the presence of streams or glades and a multilayer forest structure with lower plant species richness in the undergrowth layer. Moreover, this species avoided clearcuts and depended either on wild sites (with a high share of deadwood and treefall gaps in mature stands at higher altitudes) or juvenile stands. The results of our study confirmed that gaps in forests and diverse topography could compensate the Hazel Grouse for habitat deficiency. These findings may be important for effective protection of this species in high-mountain spruce-only dominated forests.

TI  - An Approach to Estimate Individual Tree Ages Based on Time Series Diameter Data-A Test Case for Three Subtropical Tree Species in China
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Accurate knowledge of individual tree ages is critical for forestry and ecological research. However, previous methods suffer from flaws such as tree damage, low efficiency, or ignoring autocorrelation among residuals. In this paper, an approach for estimating the ages of individual trees is proposed based on the diameter series of Cinnamomum camphora (Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl), Schima superba (Schima superba Gardn. et Champ.), and Liquidambar formosana (Liquidambar formosana Hance). Diameter series were obtained by stem analysis. Panel data contains more information, more variability, and more efficiency than pure time series data or cross-sectional data, which is why diameter series at stump and breast heights were chosen to form the panel data. After choosing a base growth equation, a constraint was added to the equation to improve stability. The difference method was used to reduce autocorrelation and the parameter classification method was used to improve model suitability. Finally, the diameter increment equation of parameter a-classification was developed. The mean errors of estimated ages based on the panel data at breast height for C. camphora, S. superba, and L. formosana were 0.47, 2.46, and -0.56 years and the root mean square errors were 2.04, 3.15 and 2.47 years, respectively. For C. camphora and L. formosana, the estimated accuracy based on the panel data was higher at breast height than at stump height. This approach to estimating individual tree ages is highly accurate and reliable, and provides a feasible way to obtain tree ages by field measurement.

CP  - OCEANS Conference
AB  - Exploring the oceans, much like space, requires innovative solutions and new technology. The growing demand to protect, exploit and learn about some of our most precious resources calls for particular knowledge and skills to respond to the challenges of a harsh and unforgiving environment.
   The new Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree (EMJMD) Programme in Marine and Maritime Intelligent Robotics (MIR) (http://www.master- mir.eu) combines robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance marine and maritime science and its technological applications. It aims at building the capacity to enable advances in far reaching sea exploration, autonomous deep sea robots, teleoperations and the use of AI in these endeavours. The MIR programme is shaped to provide training in data science and state of the art applied robotics targeted at enhancing the efficiency, health, safety and environmental performance of the offshore industry and maritime operations.
   The EMJMD MIR programme offers competitive scholarships to welcome students worldwide and provides them with a common space to develop their shared passion for marine robotics and AI. The programme fosters cultural exchange and sharing of individual experiences. The master's is conducted by a consortium of 4 well-established academic institutions in the domain of marine robotics research. The institutions are in 4 countries France (UTLN), Norway (NTNU), Portugal (UL-IST) and Spain (UJI), for which the ocean has played a key role in history and is anchored in society.
   The goal of the programme is to develop specialists in marine and maritime intelligent robotic systems, providing them with: a) a solid theoretical background in the marine physical processes and technical skills in robotics engineering control systems and sensors, b) grounded knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, enabling them to develop cutting edge robotics solutions to real world challenges, c) applied knowledge in subsea and maritime application fields, including blue growth of maritime and offshore sectors, as well as deep sea surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, subsea resources exploration, offshore structure maintenance, e-navigation and maritime security enhancement.
   Students completing the MIR Masters will be well equipped with skills and state of the art knowledge, enabling them to pursue a career in robotics engineering for the offshore oil and gas, renewable, naval, and maritime sectors. Additionally, the knowledge acquired in the use and function of intelligent robotics for the underwater environment will enable them to easily continue on to a PhD in multiple different fields, should they so desire.
   The programme was designed to address global challenges identified by the consortium, the gap between industry and academia, the slow convergence of AI and robotics communities and the geopolitical and cultural differences among participating countries. The MIR programme contains a growing worldwide network of more than 58 academic and industrial associate partners spanning more than 21 countries and covering all oceans. Associate partners participate by providing industry-led lectures, internships, research collaborations and scholarships. Learning-by-doing courses cover the fundamentals of the marine environment, robotics and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on the interconnections between these fields. A set of transversal skills is developed through courses in languages, scientific writing and entrepreneurship. Furthermore. the MIR consortium organises a yearly symposium hosting presentations from the students' work, keynotes from distinguished scholars, industry representatives and competitive challenges in AI and robotics.
   While the first year of the course takes place at UTLN, each student specialises in one of the three study tracks, encompassing a 3rd semester at one of the other main partners' institutions. Applied robotics for underwater intervention missions (UJI) aims to endow underwater robots with the capability to interact with the environment using manipulators, thus paving the way for the development of advanced systems for close-range underwater infrastructures inspection and maintenance as well as materials sampling. Safe Autonomous subsea operations (NTNU) targets increasing the level of automation and autonomy in routine or otherwise tedious operations which can improve safety, efficiency and performance, supporting the human operator in decisionmaking and supervision and reducing human workload. Cooperative marine robotics for scientific and commercial applications (IST-UL) focuses on groups of autonomous marine robots working in cooperation, networked via aerial, acoustic, and optical links to dramatically improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation at unprecedented temporal and spatial scales.
   MIR students write a master thesis related to their study track and supervised by one of the main partners and their work is presented at the MIR annual symposium. Graduates receive a double diploma from UTLN and the institution of their study track.
   The MIR programme fills a gap in the current EU education landscape by responding to a pressing demand for specialists in ocean technology. It does so by building a consortium of actors around the globe with the common goal of advancing education and research in AI and robotics for ocean applications.

TI  - The "Old Testaments" of the peoples. Grundtvig's discernment of life's true order (human first, Christian next) and its relevance for the new eco-recognition of ancestral bonds in time and space
T2  - DIALOG-A JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
AB  - The intellectual distinction between Jews and Gentiles, Christians and Pagans is a division between true and false religion. Danish theologian N. F. S. Grundtvig (1783-1872) refuted this binary when he "matchlessly discovered" that pagan simply denotes a natural, pre-Christian human, created in the image of God. Inborn and cultured spirits of life simply convey a people's "Old Testament," which may also be treasured as independent sources of pride, cultural knowledge, community, and historicity. In this article, I approach Grundtvig's discovery as method, and discuss its potential to teach a climate sensitive age kinship with a particular linage of dwellers (nomads, peasants, Sami, Vikings, moderns), a specific landscape, and with spirit as breath and sensory belonging to a larger-than-human community. It will include a brief reflection on how native Christian scholars treat this problematic, how gendered rereadings of Norse mythology may still enlighten the present, and how new ecological concerns about deep entanglements may open Norwegian memory to its first migrants: nomadic hunters and gatherers.

TI  - Work exposures and mental and musculoskeletal symptoms in organic farming
T2  - ERGONOMICS
AB  - This study focussed on harmful exposures and mental and musculoskeletal symptoms in organic and conventional farming using interview data of Finnish farmers over the winter of 2014-2015. The data consisted of 2,169 full-time farmers, out of whom 231 (11%) practiced organic farming and 1,938 (89%) conventional farming. Exposure to poisonous and irritating substances was less frequent while exposures to vibration and mould ('smell of root cellar') were more frequent on organic farms. Mental and musculoskeletal symptoms were slightly more common among organic farmers, but the associations were not statistically significant in regression modelling. Risk factors for mental symptoms included animal production, hired labour, female gender, constant hurry, working alone, economic uncertainty, and inadequate recovery from workdays. Risk factors for musculoskeletal symptoms included older age, female gender, constant hurry, economic uncertainty, difficult working postures, heavy lifting and carrying, and inadequate recovery. Workload and recovery, managing the transition period and better follow-up of the occupational well-being were identified as concerns among organic farmers. Practitioner summary: Converting from conventional to organic farming has become increasingly common. Farmer interviews indicated that exposure to poisonous and irritating substances was less frequent while exposures to vibration and mould were more frequent on organic farms. Mental and musculoskeletal symptoms and risk factors were similar in both types of farming.

TI  - FOREST REGENERATION QUALITY - FACTORS AFFECTING FIRST YEAR SURVIVAL OF PLANTED TREES
T2  - RESEARCH FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT 2018, VOL 1
CP  - 24th Annual International Scientific Conference on Research for Rural Development
AB  - The early stage of forestry is crucial for successful and sustainable forest management. One third of the reforested forest in Latvia is regenerated by planting with different kinds of tree seedlings. The success of forest regeneration by planting depends on correctly prepared soil and choice of the right seedling material. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of different soil preparation methods and used type of seedlings on tree survival and growth rate after the first growing season. For this study six young stand sites located in the north-west and central part of Latvia were established in three forest types and in each site soil was prepared in furrows by disc trenching, in mound and left untreated. Reforestation was conducted in the spring of 2017 with four tree species Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Alnus glutinosa and Betula pendula and three seedling types were used, bare roots, containerized and improved root system. The evaluation of survival and measure of annual increment was conducted at the end of the first growing season in the autumn of 2017. Results showed that overall the highest seedling survival rate provided soil prepared in mound (90%), and seedlings with improved root system, though the lowest survival rate was observed for bare root seedlings. Containerized seedlings have a higher proportional increment if compared to bare root and improved root system seedlings, but differences are not significant yet (p>0.05). In conclusion, the survival rate of outplanted seedlings differs by chosen stocktype and soil preparation method used in forest regeneration and for various tree species impact of chosen stock type on survival rate differs.

TI  - Small-scale removal of seagrass (<i>Zostera marina</i> L.): effects on the infaunal community
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - Eelgrass meadows are a common feature in shallow waters along the Norwegian coast, where they provide a habitat for a diverse infaunal community. Recreational boat anchoring and moorings physically scour seagrass and may affect the ecosystem functioning and resilience of the system to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. A small-scale eelgrass (Zostera marina) removal experiment was conducted to study the effects on macro-and meiofauna. Entire plants, including the rhizomes, were removed from 4 m(2) patches in three eelgrass meadows in the inner Oslofjord in October 2010. Core samples were taken after a recovery period of 10 months, from the removed patches as well as from the surrounding meadow. Macrofauna (>500 mu m) and meiofauna (63-500 mu m) in the sediment were investigated for possible effects of the eelgrass removal. Macrofauna and meiofauna composition were site specific and therefore location was identified as the main determinant for the infaunal community. The eelgrass did not regrow within the recovery period and bare sediment patches with only single eelgrass shoots were present during the sampling. Our analyses support an influence of the removal on individual species, but not the complete community. In particular one species, the gastropod Peringia ulvae, was encountered in higher numbers in samples from the removed patches than in control samples. From a management perspective, such minor removal of eelgrass, on the scale of square metres, appears to have no long-lasting detrimental effect to the infaunal community in sheltered meadows with muddy sediments.

TI  - Bottom Water Acidification and Warming on the Western Eurasian Arctic Shelves: Dynamical Downscaling Projections
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB  - The impacts of oceanic CO2 uptake and global warming on the surface ocean environment have received substantial attention, but few studies have focused on shelf bottom water, despite its importance as habitat for benthic organisms and demersal fisheries such as cod. We used a downscaling ocean biogeochemical model to project bottom water acidification and warming on the western Eurasian Arctic shelves. A model hindcast produced 14-18 year acidification trends that were largely consistent with observational estimates at stations in the Iceland and Irminger Seas. Projections under SRES A1B scenario revealed a rapid and spatially variable decline in bottom pH by 0.10-0.20 units over 50 years (2.5%-97.5% quantiles) at depths 50-500 m on the Norwegian, Barents, Kara, and East Greenland shelves. Bottom water undersaturation with respect to aragonite occurred over the entire Kara shelf by 2040 and over most of the Barents and East Greenland shelves by 2070. Shelf acidification was predominantly driven by the accumulation of anthropogenic CO2, and was concurrent with warming of 0.1-2.7 degrees C over 50 years. These combined perturbations will act as significant multistressors on the Barents and Kara shelves. Future studies should aim to improve the resolution of shelf bottom processes in models, and should consider the Kara Sea and Russian shelves as possible bellwethers of shelf acidification.

TI  - Diversity and Distribution of Macrofungi in Protected Mountain Forest Habitats in Serbia and Its Relation to Abiotic Factors
T2  - JOURNAL OF FUNGI
AB  - Fungal diversity is one of the most important indicators of overall forest biodiversity and its health. However, scarce information exists on the state of macrofungal communities of mountain forests in Serbia, making it one of the countries with the least-published mycological data in the Mediterranean and Balkan region of Europe. This paper presents the results of the first comprehensive, long-term study of macrofungal communities in some of the most important mountain forest ecosystems in Serbia (Tara, Kopaonik and Vidlic). In the course of three consecutive years, the sampling of five permanent experimental plots resulted in 245 species of macrofungi, classified into three functional groups (terricolous saprothrophs, lignicolous, and mycorrhizal fungi). Special attention was given to protected and indicator species, which point out the great value of studied forest habitats and the importance of their conservation. It was found that precipitation, habitat humidity, and temperature significantly influence the occurrence and distribution, primarily of mycorrhizal and lignicolous group of fungi. Thus, the continuation of long-term monitoring is crucial in order to more precisely determine which groups/species of macrofungi would, and to what extent they would, adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

TI  - College Students' Choice Behavior of Electric Two-Wheeled Vehicle
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION
AB  - Many countries have made great efforts to boost the use of electric vehicles in recent years; for example, advanced countries including Norway and the Netherlands in Europe and the United States have enhanced people's willingness to use electric vehicles by means of appropriate subsidies and suppression of private vehicles. In Asia, Taiwan has been promoting the policy of replacing traditional fuel two-wheeled vehicles (FTWVs) with electric two-wheeled vehicles (ETWVs) and strengthening the policy by means of replacing a large number of old FTWVs and subsidizing the purchase of ETWVs. This study took college students as the subjects, as they were the first potential group to buy ETWVs, and their concept of environmental sustainability can be shaped for cultivating vehicle use habits. This study applies a questionnaire to probe into the ETWV usage preferences of college students and explores the significant factors affecting college students' purchase of ETWVs. This study uses a mixed logit (MXL) model for estimation. The results of model estimation show that those who are younger, have higher income, have good experience in using ETWVs, and are in user-friendly external traffic environments, are more inclined to choose ETWVs. In the future, government units can formulate policies to promote ETWVs according to the characteristics of different relevant factors.

TI  - Can EMMA solve the puzzle of the knee?
T2  - PROGRESS IN PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS
AB  - The knee is a change in the slope of the cosmic ray spectrum at approximate energy of 3 PeV. There are multiple competing models for the knee giving conflicting predictions about this change for different masses of the primary particle. Accurate mass measurements of cosmic rays spectra around 3 PeV would be able to exclude some of these models. Cosmic-ray experiment EMMA uses a new method for studying the composition of cosmic rays at the knee area. It is able to determine the multiplicity, the lateral distribution, and the arrival direction of incoming muons produced early in the shower evolution on an event-by-event basis and deduce from these measurements the mass and the energy of the primary particle. EMMA is situated at the depth of 75 m in the Pyhasalmi mine, Finland. This rock overburden, which corresponds to 210 m of water equivalent, gives EMMA a cut-off energy of 50 GeV for vertical muons. Since the simulations using different air-shower models give similar predictions for the lateral distribution of these high energy muons, we are confident that EMMA should yield a reliable and an air-shower model independent data on the composition of cosmic rays around the knee region.

TI  - Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) decline, mortality and healthcare resource utilization in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
T2  - EUROPEAN CLINICAL RESPIRATORY JOURNAL
AB  - Aim of the study: Potential care implications of antifibrotic reimbursement restrictions were studied by forced vital capacity (FVC) decline, mortality and specialty care related healthcare resource utilization in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
   Material and methods: IPF patients were identified from the electronic medical records of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland between 2005 and 2017. Text-mining was used for patient identification to exclude other interstitial lung diseases (ILD) from the cohort. FVC reimbursement restriction (FVC 50-90%) was used for stratification.
   Results: Out of all patients with ILD, 27% (N = 266) were identified to have IPF. At baseline, 24% presented with FVC>90% and 63% with FVC 50-90% predicted. FVC at diagnosis did not improve during the study period. Median survival decreased by severity from 6.7 years in FVC>90% at baseline to 0.7 years in patient with FVC<50% predicted. In the FVC>90% group, 14% died before a change in FVC category could be noted. Overall, 4.7 million euro worth of specialty care resources were spent on IPF patients. The highest cost driver was inpatient days.
   Conclusions: IPF is associated with a high burden of disease, and reimbursement restrictions are in conflict with early care. As there are antifibrotic treatment options for IPF patients, early diagnosis is important.

T2  - BIOMASS: A GROWTH OPPORTUNITY IN GREEN ENERGY AND VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - 4th Biomass Conference of the Americas on Growth Opportunity in Green Energy and Value-Added Products
AB  - Short rotation coppices (SRC), when applied to the solution of water and soil-related environmental problems, generate unique added value that no other energy source can achieve. The fundamental idea behind EKOKRAFT(TM), a US$ 30 million economically and ecologically sustainable development program started in 1998 and run by the Municipality of Hedemora, is the conversion of "glocal" environmental problems into local bioenergy assets. The program is based on the full-scale implementation of newly developed SRC cultivation methods, willow clones, harvesting technology and logistics. The results expected are primarily minimising of eutrophication on watercourses the improvement of the biomass energy balance at lower biofuel production costs, the creation of new high-quality biofuels and the further reduction of COP emissions. The program is divided into various main projects: KOMBIBRUK(TM) is a new method for sustainable food and energy farming; use of urban and industrial effluents as a nutritional resource for willow production; the establishment of a biomass cover on today's sterile mining soil as a new biofuel source; and installation of two new district heating systems and the conversion of 15 small oil-fuelled boilers, all to be fuelled with a new SRC-based biofuel, EKOPELLETS(TM). The program is also intended as a model for replication. An EKOKRAFT(TM) international network is established.

TI  - Personal understandings of illness among people with type 2 diabetes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Background. Professionals and patients understand the experience of illness from different worlds. Professionals' explanatory models focus on aetiology, diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment, while patients' explanatory models are more focused on consequences and influences on daily life. The differences between patients and professionals in their understanding often result in conflicting expectations about treatment, priorities and outcomes of care.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to describe personal understandings of illness among people with type 2 diabetes in Sweden.
   A sample of 44 patients, 47-80 years, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the last 2 years, was recruited from four health care centres. Narrative thematic interviews were used covering the areas of developing, coping with and living with diabetes. Qualitative content analysis was performed.
   Findings. The findings were formulated into six categories: image of the disease, meaning of the diagnosis, integration of the illness, space for the illness, responsibility for care and future prospects.
   Conclusions. The findings demonstrate that patients' personal understanding of illness is an important complement to the traditional professional view of diabetes. They could serve as a foundation for development of health history interviewing, as well as development of systems of documentation. Patients' personal understandings of diabetes in their daily lives are considered to be an important shared source of information for planning meaningful care.

TI  - Gone with the wind? Wind farm-induced wakes and regulatory gaps
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Wind farm-induced wakes can propagate dozens of kilometres, decreasing the power production and the fatigue lifetime of wind turbines between neighbouring farms. This phenomenon termed hereinafter "wind theft", may lead to legal conflicts between wind farm operators and even States as power production from a wind farm is affected by the wake effects generated by another, reducing power output. Wind theft can substantially slow down the development of offshore wind if it is not regulated by a clear legal framework. In this study, we present the case of Sorlige Nordsjo II, a large offshore area that opened for wind turbine licensing application in 2020, is explored. This area is located in the Norwegian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) on the border to the Danish equivalent zone. Using state-of-the-art reanalysis data covering 1992-2020, it is shown that long farm-induced wake will likely propagate regularly from SN2 into the Danish EEZ and vice versa. This research shows how the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention 1982 leaves a regulatory gap regarding cross-border wind wake effects. As Europe crucially needs to expand its renewable energy production and work towards its net zero objectives by 2050, coastal States should cooperate to find regulatory solutions to wake effects such that wind resource management can be optimised. While some North Sea coastal States demonstrate a political will to cooperate, such policies must proliferate into legal instruments which lend certainty and predictability to wind resource management.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of permanent magnet electric traction motors
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Ongoing development of electrified road vehicles entails a risk of conflict between resource issues and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, the environmental impact of the core design and magnet material for three electric vehicle traction motors was explored with life cycle assessment (LCA): two permanent magnet synchronous machines with neodymium-dysprosium-iron-boron or samarium-cobalt magnets, and a permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PM-assisted SynRM) with strontium-ferrite magnets. These combinations of motor types and magnets, although highly relevant for vehicles, are new subjects for LCA. The study included substantial data compilation, machine design and drive-cycle calculations. All motors handle equal take-off, top speed, and driving conditions. The production (except of magnets) and use phases are modeled for two countries - Sweden and the USA - to exemplify the effects of different electricity supply. Impacts on climate change and human toxicity were found to be most important. Complete manufacturing range within 1.7-2.0 g CO2-eq./km for all options. The PM-assisted SynRM has the highest efficiency and lowest emissions of CO2. Copper production is significant for toxicity impacts and effects on human health, with problematic emissions from mining. Resource depletion results are divergent depending on evaluation method, but a sensitivity analysis proved other results to be robust. Key motor design targets are identified: high energy efficiency, slender housings, compact end-windings, segmented laminates to reduce production scrap, and easy disassembly.

TI  - Environmental regulation, renewable electricity, industrialization, economic complexity, technological innovation, and sustainable environment: testing the N-shaped EKC hypothesis for the G-10 economies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and the role of environmental regulation, renewable electricity, industrialization, economic complexity, and technological innovation in sustainable environment for the G-10 economies, namely, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the USA, from 1994 to 2020. We employed CS-ARDL (cross-sectional augmented distributed lag (CS-ARDL), FMOLS (fully modified ordinary least squares), and DOLS (dynamic ordinary least squares) for the analysis of the data. The estimates confirm the N-shaped EKC hypothesis between the GDP and CO2 emission. Moreover, the long-run estimates exhibit that environmental tax, renewable electricity, economic complexity, and technological innovation have negative effect on CO2 emission, while GDP, industrialization and arable land have positive effect on CO2 emission. Based on these findings, we propose that governments must implement large-scale government plans and initiatives to encourage the development of environmentally friendly technologies and ideas based on renewable energy. Moreover, further growing renewable energy, environmental policies like a carbon tax, investments in green technologies, subsidies, and rewards for renewable energy infrastructure investment should be taken into account.

TI  - Assessing the Effects of Longer Vehicles: The Case of Pre- and Post-haulage in Intermodal Transport Chains
T2  - TRANSPORT REVIEWS
AB  - The demand for inland freight transport in Europe is mainly met by road transport, leading to unsustainable impacts such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and congestion. Since rail transport has lower externalities than road transport, a modal shift from road to rail is an accepted policy goal for achieving a more sustainable and competitive transport system. However, intermodal road-rail transport is mainly competitive for long-distance transport, and as a consequence, the potential for modal shift is limited. The cost efficiency of road-rail intermodal transport is particularly sensitive to pre- and post-haulage (PPH) costs, since this activity typically has a larger cost compared with its share of the total distance in the transport chain. For intermodal transportation over shorter distances, for example, below 300 km and where there are substantial PPH activities at both ends of the chain, the competitiveness of the intermodal transport system compared with that of direct road is low. Improving the efficiency of PPH activities is, therefore, of utmost importance for the competitiveness of the intermodal transport system. This paper looks into the issue of improving the cost efficiency of an intermodal transport chain by implementing an innovative and flexible legal framework regarding the PPH activities in the chain. By extending the legal framework with exemptions for longer vehicles in PPH, the cost efficiency could be greatly improved. The purpose of such a framework is to allow and enable, for PPH exclusively, the use of 2 x 40 foot or even two semi-trailers using only one vehicle in the context of the Swedish regulatory framework. This paper develops a strategic calculation model for assessing and investigating the consequences of such a framework and investigates the framework's potential in terms of cost efficiency. The model in combination with a sensitivity analysis of input variables gives a comprehensive understanding of the effects of PPH under different circumstances. From the results, it is evident that there are substantial positive effects associated with a PPH framework of longer vehicles. Results indicate that a typical shipper may experience cost reductions of about 5-10% of the total costs of the intermodal transport chain. In summary, a more innovative and flexible legal framework regarding vehicle length in the PPH links can contribute to a greater modal shift, improved cost efficiency and more environmentally friendly transportation systems.

TI  - Maritime Durees: Long-Term Structures in a Coastal Landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - The interaction between humans and the maritime coastal landscape must be one of the central theoretical questions for maritime archaeology. How should an academic discipline, which is defined by its studies in a certain physical milieu, avoid the trap of environmental determinism and still be able to argue for the special influence of the maritime factor? And how should this long-term relation to the sea be interpreted and described? In this article, based mainly on material from the central Swedish Baltic Sea coast, three examples of long-term structures regarding the relationship between people and the sea are discussed. The structures, here called "maritime durees", which almost all coastal habitants in the analyzed area seem to have had in common are linked to: exploitation of marine resources, communication over water and the mental presence of the sea. In conclusion the actual meaning of these long-term structures for everyday life and for cultural and social change are discussed in comparison to more short term structures: the changing historical circumstances and possibilities for people to choose different strategies.

TI  - Assessing long term change of <i>Fucus</i> spp. communities in the northern Baltic Sea using monitoring data and spatial modeling
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - Changes in nutrient and sediment concentrations alter the light availability on the seafloor, and consequently the aquatic ecosystems. Decreasing light availability limits plant growth and causes changes in species composition. Local changes in marine biodiversity caused by human activities have been documented around the Baltic Sea, but large-scale changes in species' spatial distributions remain unreported due to a lack of data and methodological solutions. The available monitoring data of the underwater nature and the new applications for the modeling of species distribution has enabled the evaluation of past environmental conditions. We have utilized two separate analysis processes with separate datasets to assess the reduction of suitable seafloor areas for Fucus spp. in the Northern Baltic Sea. The change in depth distribution of Fucus spp. was first analyzed using monitoring data for the lower growth limit of Fucus vesiculosus from 70 monitoring stations along the Finnish coast; the measurements were taken between 1936 and 2017. The second analysis was performed by modeling the current and past favorable seafloor areas for a Fucus spp. dominated biotope. Using Secchi depth data from the early 20th century to the present day, we created a spatial variable, which represents light availability on the seafloor for over a century. The analysis results of the measurements and modeling reveal a dramatic decrease of suitable seafloor for Fucus spp.. Site by site evaluation of F. vesiculosus lower growth limit shows a strong reduction when comparing older measurements from literature sources to more recent monitoring. The change in the lower growth limit was evaluated using the methodologies of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Water Framework Directive (WFD) with results indicating severe degradation and a negative development towards a collapsed state. The observed long term trend could result in the habitat reaching a collapsed state within 10-15 years. Modeling results derived with the centennial Secchi data indicate on average that the decrease in light availability has reduced favorable sea floor areas for the Fucus spp. dominated biotope by 45%. Even though the Fucus spp. dominated biotope is still relatively common along the Finnish coastal areas, the drastic scale of change makes it a threatened species group.

TI  - Service innovation research: a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer
T2  - COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW
AB  - Purpose "The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on service innovation during the past two decades and provide an analysis of sources of publication, citations and authorship using bibliometric analysis techniques (VOSviewer)." This paper aims to assesses the important trends, enhance the academic debate, identify research gaps and propose future directions and a research agenda.Design/methodology/approachThis paper examines 176 articles in English language published from 2002 to 2022 from the Scopus database by adopting the bibliometric technique using VOSviewer software. This paper analyzes the different levels and boundaries of service innovation using bibliometric analysis of "service innovation research" using VOSviewer software. The methodology analyzes the number of citations, co-citations, keywords, authors, journals and countries.Findings The review of the past 20 years indicates a substantial growth in the number of good research publications on service innovation. The UK, the USA, Sweden and Australia dominate this research area with the most articles published to date under the subject area of "Business management." The review highlighted that most of the studies on service innovation focused on products, companies and processes in the services industry. The most critical factors behind service innovation failure are improper management and lack of knowledge. The citation analysis revealed various research implications and directions for the future.Research limitations/implications This study focuses only on service innovation and excludes research on performance management and control. Thus, future studies may explore this area of research in future studies. Only research articles were analyzed; conference papers, reports, manuals and white papers from practice were excluded. Research implications indicate that future studies on service innovation would be essential for organizational excellence, not process excellence.Originality/value This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current status and essential trends of research on service innovation. This study identifies the research gaps and provides a clear research agenda for understanding the various elements of service innovation.

TI  - Glacier changes in the circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic, mid-1980s to late-2000s/2011
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
AB  - A new inventory record of satellite-derived area, length, elevation range and surface slope changes from the mid-1980s to late 2000s/2011 for 317 land-terminating glaciers and ice caps (GIC) is presented. The investigated GIC are located in 12 geographic regions throughout the circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic. This geographic subdivision allows us to examine regional variations in recent glacier changes. The method is based on a semi-automated classification approach which extracts GIC extent from satellite scenes. Most of the observed GIC show a reduction in area, length, elevation range and slope. On regional scale, the observed GIC changed in area between -4 +/- 3% (Nuuk, West Greenland; 1987-2003) and -40 +/- 4% (Talkeetna, southern Alaska; 1987-2011), equal to shrinking rates between -0.2% yr(-1) and -1.7% yr(-1). The regional change in length was between -36 +/- 13 m (southern British Columbia; 1985-2011) and -481 +/- 85 m (southern Ellesmere Island; 1988-2009), equal to -1 +/- 0.5 m yr(-1) and -23 +/- 4 m yr(-1). Regional GIC changes can be illustrated by power-law scaling relationships between GIC area and length, elevation range, and surface slope. Here, we find regional variability in scaling parameters in both time and space, which should be considered when estimating global assessments of GIC conditions and changes over time.

TI  - Explaining Spatial Variation in the Recording Effort of Citizen Science Data across Multiple Taxa
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - The collation of citizen science data in open-access biodiversity databases makes temporally and spatially extensive species' observation data available to a wide range of users. Such data are an invaluable resource but contain inherent limitations, such as sampling bias in favour of recorder distribution, lack of survey effort assessment, and lack of coverage of the distribution of all organisms. Any technical assessment, monitoring program or scientific research applying citizen science data should therefore include an evaluation of the uncertainty of its results. We use 'ignorance' scores, i.e. spatially explicit indices of sampling bias across a study region, to further understand spatial patterns of observation behaviour for 13 reference taxonomic groups. The data is based on voluntary observations made in Sweden between 2000 and 2014. We compared the effect of six geographical variables (elevation, steepness, population density, log population density, road density and footpath density) on the ignorance scores of each group. We found substantial variation among taxonomic groups in the relative importance of different geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores. In general, road access and logged population density were consistently important variables explaining bias in sampling effort, indicating that access at a landscape-scale facilitates voluntary reporting by citizen scientists. Also, small increases in population density can produce a substantial reduction in ignorance score. However the between-taxa variation in the importance of geographic variables for explaining ignorance scores demonstrated that different taxa suffer from different spatial biases. We suggest that conservationists and researchers should use ignorance scores to acknowledge uncertainty in their analyses and conclusions, because they may simultaneously include many correlated variables that are difficult to disentangle.

TI  - OBSTACLES TO PEACE IN THE MIDDLE-EAST
T2  - INTERNASJONAL POLITIKK
AB  - In September 1993, PLO and Israel signed a self-rule agreement widely hailed as a breakthrough for peace in the Middle East. However, the ultimate test for the success of the Israeli-PLO Accord - which was facilitated by Norwegian mediators (the 'Oslo channel') - is its actual implementation. In the present article it is argued that the way from agreement on principles to the specification and implementation of action strategies is indeed long and thorny. This is due to the Middle Eastern conflict structure which is characterized by (i) decentralised distribution of power/absence of a hegemon, (ii) overlapping of various conflict dimensions, and (iii) the widespread zero-sum attitude towards conflict. These structural features have made their imprint on the conflict dynamics in the region, providing actual conflicts with a high potential for escalation and low potential for resolution. Due to its capacity to control escalation processes and the experience that may function as a substitute for real peace (political accommodation), peacekeeping has been extensively applied in the Middle East as an instrument for conflict management. Recent developments - i.e. the virtual withdrawal of Russia from the Middle East and the Gulf War - indicate, however, that the post Second World War conflict structure in the Middle East is about to change, thus improving the conditions for conflict resolution (political accommodation). It would seem that the destiny of the 'Oslo process' - which can derail anywhere from agreement on principles to actual implementation - is a strategic test on changes in the structural conditions for conflict management in die Middle East.

TI  - Tuning ourselves into place: Enhancing multivocality with video
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - This article addresses the methodological aspects of a multi-voiced, collaborative ethnographic research process, in particular how video can enhance and amplify this research endeavour. The authors illustrate and discuss how experimental filmic methodologies can help to capture processes of becoming in a collaborative research endeavour, both enabling the development and production of diverse empirical materials and enhancing the multivocality of research practices. Using explorations of the National Tourist Route towards Havoysund in northern Norway as our empirical context, we reflect on diverse engagements along the process, such as becoming aware how the camcorder becomes a member in the research team. The filmed material forms an entanglement where our explorations along the route, our cultural practices related to the northern landscape and diverse disciplinary practices come together. We address three main ways video contributed to our research process and the creation of research materials. First, we highlight how video enables the creation of empirical traces that can be used as research materials. Second, we explore how video can work for mobilisation of multivocal dialogues. Finally, we point out that video opens the way for integration of the sensual into the research process.

TI  - Rural development and embeddedness: The importance of human relations for industrial restructuring in rural areas
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
AB  - This article offers a critical reading of theories on embeddedness emphasised in discussions on restructuring and other changes in rural areas. Despite expanding globalisation, embeddedness is considered a local or regional phenomenon that generally promotes the socioeconomic development of rural areas. We argue that the ways in which different forms of embeddedness affect industrial restructuring in a rural place, and how strongly they do so are not given a priori. In addition, embeddedness may differ in geographical scale. This makes us introduce a social field approach that we argue can handle the challenge of mapping multi-scale and multicultural forms of embeddedness and its significance for economic performance and local economic development. The empirical part of the article starts by analysing changes in the geographical embeddedness of the industrial environment in the municipality of Stryn, Norway. This is followed by a discussion of the cultural embeddedness of the environment, focusing on untraded assets in the present social field system of the industry. The case study demonstrates that industrial environments in peripheral areas should balance social fields of different untraded assets and scope to promote viable communities.

Experimental warming with open-top chambers (OTCs) was applied for 18 years to a mesic meadow and a dry heath alpine plant community. Species abundance was measured in 1995, 1999, 2001 and 2013. Species composition changed significantly from original communities in the heath, but remained similar in mesic meadow. Experimental warming increased beta diversity in the heath. Bryophyte cover and species richness both declined with long-term warming, while Simpson diversity showed no significant responses. Over the 18-year period, bryophyte cover in warmed plots decreased from 43 % to 11 % in heath and from 68 % to 35 % in meadow (75 % and 48 % decline, respectively, in original cover), while richness declined by 39 % and 26 %, respectively. Importantly, the decline in cover and richness first emerged after 7 years. Warming caused significant increase in litter in both plant communities. Deciduous shrub and litter cover had negative impact on bryophyte cover. We show that bryophyte species do not respond similarly to climate change. Total bryophyte cover declined in both heath and mesic meadow under experimental long-term warming (by 1.5-3 degrees C), driven by general declines in many species. Principal response curve, cover and richness results suggested that bryophytes in alpine heath are more susceptible to warming than in meadow, supporting the suggestion that bryophytes may be less resistant in drier environments than in wetter habitats. Species loss was slower than the decline in bryophyte abundance, and diversity remained similar in both communities. Increased deciduous shrub and litter cover led to decline in bryophyte cover. The non-linear response to warming over time underlines the importance of long-term experiments and monitoring.

TI  - Investigating the Link between Transport Sustainability and the Representation of Women in Swedish Local Committees
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - There are large discrepancies in the transport sector along gender lines in travel patterns and means of transportation used, but also in attitudes and norms among citizens, planners and decision-makers, with women generally more positive towards measures involving the lowering CO2 emissions. At the same time, the number of women involved in transport-related decisions is low. This is a problem for gender equality but possibly also for sustainability. A careful review of previous studies indicated a lack of analyses on the subject based on quantitative data at the local level. We investigated a possible link between women's presence in local policymaking and more sustainable transport policies, and whether it is possible to capture such an effect. The main contribution of this paper is a methodological approach in which, besides generating unique data on representation in municipalities (confirming men's dominance, specifically in transport policymaking), possibilities for quantitatively measuring gender and the level of sustainability in transport planning are discussed and tested. Challenges in collecting relevant data and analyzing possible covariances in the data set are discussed and presented as well as suggestions for further investigations into the possible link between gender and sustainable transport performance.

TI  - Reduced tillage stimulated symbiotic fungi and microbial saprotrophs, but did not lead to a shift in the saprotrophic microorganism community structure
T2  - APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY
AB  - The need for sustainable agricultural systems, which for example enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) content, has increased the interest for management with reduced tillage. In this study we used a Swedish long-term (20 yrs.) systems experiment, including reduced tillage (harrowing 10 cm) and plowing (moldboard plow 0-20 cm) combined with three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. With this setup we tested if (1) the arbuscular my-corrhizal fungi (AMF) concentration and (2) the fungi to bacteria (F:B) ratio would be higher under reduced tillage than under conventional tillage, and if this would be associated with higher SOC concentrations. We also tested if (3) the microbial biomass C close to the surface would be higher under reduced tillage than conventional tillage. Furthermore, since disturbance can reduce respiration and microbial growth we tested if (4) this occurred in our reduced tillage system. In addition, we tested if (5) fertilization increased the growth rate of fungi and decreased that of bacteria. We collected soil samples in July and October and found that the microbial biomass C, measured in October only, was higher close to the surface in the reduced tillage treatment and so was the microbial respiration. The fungal and bacterial growth rate, on the other hand, were not affected by tillage treatment. Fertilization did not affect the bacterial growth rate but did have a positive effect on fungal growth rate. In accordance with our expectations reduced tillage had a stimulating effect on AMF and saprotrophic fungi, and contrary to our expectation, also bacteria were positively affected by reduced tillage. In line with the unchanged F: B ratio, we found no indication that even 20 years of reduced tillage increased SOC concentrations in the long term.

TI  - Trophic cascades in a temperate seagrass community
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - We assessed the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down processes in structuring an eelgrass community in Sweden, a system impacted both by eutrophication and overfishing. Using artificial seagrass as substrate, we manipulated nutrient levels and predator abundance in a full-factorial cage-experiment.
   The results revealed a seagrass community dominated by strong top-down processes controlling the aggregate biomass of mesograzers and macroalgae. In the absence of predators the large amphipod Gammarus locusta became very abundant resulting in a leaf community with low biomass of algae and smaller mobile fauna. One enclosed gobid fish predator reduced the abundance of adult G. locusta by > 90%, causing a three to six times increase in the biomass of algae, smaller mesograzers and meiofauna. Numerous small predators in uncaged habitats reduced the biomass of G. locusta and other mesograzers by > 95% in comparison to the fish treatment, further increasing the biomass of epiphytic algae and meiofauna. Although water column nutrient enrichment caused a temporal bloom of the filamentous macroalgae Ulva spp., no significant nutrient-effects were found on the algal community at the end of the experiment. The only lasting nutrient-effect was a significant increase in the biomass of G. locusta, but only in the absence of ambient predators.
   These results demonstrate that mesograzers can respond to enhanced food supply, increase their biomass and control the algal growth when predation rates are low. However, in the assessed system, high predation rates appear to make mesograzers functionally extinct, causing a community-wide trophic cascade that promotes the growth of ephemeral algae. This top-down effect could penetrate down, despite a complex food-web because the interaction strength in the community was strongly skewed towards two functionally dominant algal and grazer species that were vulnerable to consumption. These results indicate that overexploitation of gadoid fish may be linked to increased macroalgal blooms and loss of eelgrass in the area through a trophic cascade affecting the abundance of mesograzers.

TI  - Framework for environmental performance measurement in a Swedish public sector organization
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Environmental performance measurements are an important component in strategies for achieving ecologically sustainable development. However, models and frameworks for performance measurement are primarily developed for business and may not be directly applicable to public organizations. This study aimed to contribute to the development of environmental performance measurement tools for public sector organizations by developing an appropriate framework. The study is based on a case study of the Swedish Rail Administration. The main method for data collection was focus group interviews. The proposed framework presents important features of an environmental performance measurement for the public sector and is illustrated by results from the case organization. The framework was constructed using the causal-chain framework pressure-state-response (PSR) and the management system management-by-objectives (MBO), respectively measuring and managing performance towards both strategic and operational objectives. An environmental management system serves as a toolbox, encompassing and coordinating the environmental objectives and the tools for performance measurement. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
CP  - COMLAND Conference on Land Degradation and Mitigation
AB  - This paper describes the extent to which the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in combination with image regression used on satellite data can indicate vegetation cover decreases caused by increased exploitation of Swedish mountains. The methods outlined in this study give a basis for detection of less sustainable mountain ecosystems by using as an indicator bare patches of humus or soil where none existed previously. Landsat 5 TM (R) data from 1984 and 1994 and Landsat 7 ETM+(R) data from the year 2000 were used in the study. The results show that the NDVI significantly separates areas with vegetation cover decrease from areas with no vegetation cover decrease in sensitive, high-latitude mountain ecosystems, such as mountainous dry heath communities.

TI  - Evaluation of limnological responses to recent environmental change and caribou activity in the Riviere George Region, northern Quebec, Canada
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB  - The influence of natural terrestrial disturbances on the limnology of northern lakes is little known, yet important for understanding the ecology of these remote ecosystems. The Riviere George Caribou Herd (RGCH) in northern Quebec has undergone a large population increase since the 1950s, which has been accompanied by pronounced impacts (i.e., degradation of vegetation cover, soil erosion) on terrestrial environments of the Riviere George region. The goal of our study was to evaluate if the increased caribou activity and resulting terrestrial impacts have been accompanied by impacts on adjacent aquatic ecosystems. We studied the recent diatom assemblages (i.e., about the last two centuries) preserved in six sediment cores taken from lakes located in the most heavily impacted region, and in one core from a lake showing little evidence of recent caribou activity in the catchment basin. Core chronologies based on Pb-210 dating techniques indicated that average mass sedimentation rates in this subarctic region were very low (0.0039 to 0.012 g cm(-2) yr(-1)). Perhaps surprisingly, diatom assemblages from all seven cores showed very little change, indicating remarkably stable limnological conditions throughout the past similar to200 yr. The lack of a signal from caribou activity is most likely due to (1) short-term impacts being too transitory to be registered in the sediment record, and (2) long-term impacts not representing a significant perturbation outside the natural variability of these aquatic ecosystems. In contrast to other arctic regions, the limnological stability of our study sites suggests that recent climatic change impacts have been negligible in this region of northern Quebec, which seems to confirm climate model predictions that northern Quebec and Labrador will remain climatically stable under global warming scenarios.

TI  - Shifted dynamics of plankton communities in a restored lake: exploring the effects of climate change on phenology through four decades
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB  - Lake surface temperatures have increased globally in recent decades. Climate change can affect lake biota directly via enhanced water temperatures, shorter ice cover duration and prolonged stratification, and indirectly via changes in species interactions. Changes in the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and zooplankton can further affect whole lake ecosystems. However, separating the effects of climate change from the more direct and dominating effects of nutrients is a challenge. Our aim was to explore the ecological effects of climate change while accounting for the effects of re-oligotrophication in Lake Mjosa, the largest lake in Norway. While restoration measures since the 1970s have resulted in strongly reduced nutrient levels, the surface water temperature has increased by almost 0.4 degrees C decade(-1) during the same period. We analysed long-term trends and abrupt changes in environmental and biological time series as well as changes in the seasonal dynamics of individual plankton taxa. The general long-term trends in phenology were diverging for phytoplankton (later peaks) vs. zooplankton (earlier peaks). However, individual taxa of both phytoplankton and zooplankton displayed earlier peaks. Earlier peaks of the phytoplankton group Cryptophyceae can be explained by increased spring temperature or other climate-related changes. Earlier onset of population growth of certain zooplankton species (Limnocalanus macrurus and Holopedium gibberum) can also be explained by climatic change, either directly (earlier temperature increase) or more indirectly (earlier availability of Cryptophyceae as a food source). In the long run, climate-related changes in both phytoplankton and zooplankton phenology may have implications for the fish communities of this lake.

TI  - Impact analysis of gold-silver refining processes through life-cycle assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Gold and silver are extracted through the gold-silver couple production process or the gold-silver-lead zinc-copper combined production process. This paper aims to analyse and compare the life-cycle assessment (LCA) of the gold and silver refining processes. Two production routes are considered in this study: gold and silver refining through the gold-silver couple production process and gold and silver refining which are produced from the gold-silver-lead-zinc-copper combined production process. SimaPro software version 8.5 is used for the life-cycle assessment using the International Life Cycle Reference Data (ILCD) method and the cumulative energy demand method (CED). The geographic region considered in the original dataset is based on Papua New Guinea and Sweden. The major impact categories from the ILCD methods are climate change, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer effects), ecotoxicity, ionising radiation (human health and ecotoxicity), eutrophication (freshwater, marine, and terrestrial), land use, water use, and mineral resources depletion. The impact categories where the results are analysed and presented here from the CED method are renewables, fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas), biomass, nuclear, and embodied energy. The analysis results indicate that between gold-silver couple production and gold silver combined metal production process, refining through the gold-silver couple production process have greater environmental impacts. Furthermore, gold refining effects are larger as compared to the silver refining process. Among the significant impact categories, the most crucial is human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer). Results from the cumulative energy demand method shows that fossil-fuel consumption is larger than all other sources of energy demand in the precious-metal refining process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - Monopis jussii Kaila, Mutanen, Huemer, Karsholt & Autto, sp. nov. (Lepidoptera, Tineidae) is described as a new species. It is closely related to the widespread and common M. laevigella ([Denis & Schiffermul-ler], 1775), but differs in its distinct COI DNA barcode sequences, four examined nuclear loci as well as details in forewing coloration and pattern. Most reared specimens of M. jussii have emerged from the nest remnants of the Boreal owl (Aegolius funereus (Linnaeus, 1758)), but also nests of the Ural owl (Strix uralensis Pallas, 1771) and the Great tit (Parus major Linnaeus, 1758) have been observed as suitable habitats. Based on the present knowledge, the new species has a boreo-montane distribution as it is recorded only from northern Europe and the Alps. Several extensive rearing experiments from Strix spp. nest remnants from southern Finland did not produce any M. jussii, but thousands of M. laevigella, suggesting that the species is lacking in the area or, more unlikely, that the nest of these owl species do not serve as good habitat for the new species. This unexpected species discovery highlights, once again, the usefulness of DNA barcoding in revealing the cryptic layers of biodiversity. To serve stability we select a neotype for Tinea laevigella [Denis & Schiffermuller], 1775, and discuss the complicated synonymy and nomenclature of this species.

TI  - Harvest Time Can Affect the Optimal Yield and Quality of Sea Lettuce (<i>Ulva fenestrata</i>) in a Sustainable Sea-Based Cultivation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Seaweed biomass is a renewable resource with multiple applications. Sea-based cultivation of seaweeds can provide high biomass yields, low construction, operation, and maintenance costs and could offer an environmentally and economically sustainable alternative to land-based cultivations. The biochemical profile of sea-grown biomass depends on seasonal variation in environmental factors, and the optimization of harvest time is important for the quality of the produced biomass. To identify optimal harvest times of Swedish sea-based cultivated sea lettuce (Ulva fenestrata), this study monitored biomass yield, morphology, chemical composition, fertility, and biofouling at five different harvesting times in April - June 2020. The highest biomass yields (approximately 1.2 kg fw [m rope](-1)) were observed in late spring (May). The number and size of holes in the thalli and the amount of fertile and fouled tissue increased with prolonged growth season, which together led to a significant decline in both biomass yield and quality during summer (June). Early spring (April) conditions were optimal for obtaining high fatty acid, protein, biochar, phenolic, and pigment contents in the biomass, whereas carbohydrate and ash content, as well as essential and non-essential elements, increased later in the growth season. Our study results show that the optimal harvest time of sea-based cultivated U. fenestrata depends on the downstream application of the biomass and must be carefully selected to balance yield, quality, and desired biochemical contents to maximize the output of future sea-based algal cultivations in the European Northern Hemisphere.

TI  - Changes of isopod assemblages along an urban-suburban-rural gradient in Hungary
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL BIOLOGY
AB  - Responses of isopod assemblages to urbanisation were studied along an urban-suburban-rural gradient representing a decrease in the intensity of human disturbance. Pitfall trapping collected six species (Armadillidium vulgare, Porcellio scaber, Porcellium collicola, Trachelipus ratzeburgii, Cylisticus convexus, and Trachelipus rathkii). A. vulgare occurred abundantly in all sites reflecting the broad tolerance and invasive nature of this species. Indicator species analysis demonstrated that P. scaber and T. rathkii were significant quantitative character species for the urban site, while T. ratzeburgii was characteristic for the natural habitats (suburban and rural sites). CANOCO revealed that ground and air temperature show positive correlation with the distribution of P. scaber and T. rathkii, and negative correlation with T. ratzeburgii. Nested ANOVA on trap level showed that there were no significant differences between the number of isopod species and individuals, and the diversity of isopod assemblages in the three studied areas. Significant differences were observed at site level. The results did not support the hypothesis that diversity should decrease in response to habitat disturbance. They also contradicted the intermediate disturbance hypothesis; species richness was not the highest in the moderately disturbed suburban area. Multivariate methods detected that the isopod assemblages of the rural and suburban areas were relatively similar, while that of the urban area was relatively separated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Drivers for and barriers to electric freight vehicle adoption in Stockholm
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Freight transport in urban areas needs to become more sustainable. There is much potential to reduce emissions by transitioning to electric freight vehicles (EFVs). The context of this study is Sweden, a country with ambitious goals for transitioning to fossil-free road transport that in-centivizes the adoption of EFVs through regulations, subsidies and environmental zones. How -ever, it seems that few companies are adopting EFVs. This paper aims to explore why that is by investigating drivers for and barriers to the adoption of EFVs. An embedded case study of five firms in Stockholm that are exploring the possibilities of using EFVs is conducted. The findings reveal a number of drivers and barriers, which are then categorized as internal, external or governmental. The results show uncertainties at the micro, meso and macro levels. Uncertainties relate to political and legal uncertainties, technological and infrastructure-related uncertainties, customer expectations and willingness to pay, and operational uncertainties.

T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
CP  - Joint IEA Bioenergy Workshop Sustainable Bioenergy Production Systems - Environmental, Operational and Social Implications
AB  - In 1982-1983, a 70 ha energy forest project was established in an arable landscape in southern Sweden. Many aspects of the energy forest system were investigated. This paper reports mainly on the aesthetic impacts of the project at a landscape level. One effect is an increasing variation in the views and the aesthetic values of the arable land. The Salix crops introduce new colours into the arable landscape. The green colour of the Salix fields lasts longer in the autumn. Also, from year to year a spatial Variation appears. The increasing wildlife shelter seems to make the fauna richer. Viewed as an energy crop only, the commercial competitiveness of energy forests is often low. However. if the benefits of energy crops as elements of the landscape are added, the socio-economic value could be substantial. Such landscape benefits include increasing biodiversity in the arable landscape, wind-shelter against soil erosion and snow. shelter for wildlife, the reduction of nitrogen leaching, views of the landscape and aesthetic considerations. and recovery of the organic soil component of arable land. An interesting question is whether or not energy forests grown on arable land are profitable from a socio-economic point of view when considering a more holistic evaluation of all the largely beneficial impacts of energy forests.

TI  - Assessment of Wound Recovery and Radial Growth 10 Years after Forest Operations in Hardwood Stands
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Damage to the residual stand caused by forest operations can have detrimental impacts on the biological processes of stand growth. This study shows the details from monitoring damages related to manual motor ground-based timber operations in a mountain mixed hardwood forest. The harvesting system was cut-to-length, and logs were extracted by wheeled cable-skidders. Data were collected from the remaining trees immediately after logging and 10 years after the logging session. The parameters assessed included stem injury, radial growth increment and wound healing rate for five hardwood species of commercial interest. The number of injured trees represented 15% of the residual stand, 23% of the wounds were related to the felling operation and 76% to extraction. Wound height, wound size and damage to bark, due to felling, were larger than those in extraction, while wound width and damages to cambium and wood caused by extraction were larger than those triggered by felling. Ten years after harvesting, average longitudinal and radial growth increments were reduced by 38% and 24%, respectively. Wound healing rates ranged from 12.90 mm yr(-1) for extraction wounds to 19.70 mm yr(-1) for felling ones within 10 years. On average 73% of all wounds were still unrecovered and 17% of these were decayed, while only 10% were fully healed within a 10-year recovery period. The analysis showed that the best recovering performance among damaged trees was mostly achieved in shade-intolerant species with a diameter less than 40 cm, located in the dominant canopy layer with a wound size smaller than 100 cm(2). In addition to the significant effect on log quality, the ecological longevity of residual trees has major implications for pre-planning harvesting operations that can preserve the quality and value of residual trees. Understanding the damage inflicted upon residual trees is essential to reduce economic losses, improve planning of harvest operations and, ultimately, ensure a sustainable harvest of mixed hardwood stands in mountain regions.

TI  - Survival, growth, and growth allocation of planted Scots pine trees after different levels of biomass removal in clear-felling
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - A great concern in forestry today is whether whole-tree harvesting influences site productivity and whether it is consistent with the principle of sustainable use of forest resources. To evaluate this a randomised field experiment established 24 years ago in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in southern Sweden was used. Treatments were conventional stem harvest (CH), whole-tree harvest (WTH), and branch and stem harvest (BSH). Seedling survival was unaffected by treatments. The total basal area over bark at breast height (1.3 m, m(2) ha(-1)) was significantly reduced following WTH from the 15th year after planting. Sample trees on CH plots produced 20% more wood biomass than WTH and BSH plots, while biomass produced within the crown was unaffected by treatment. Height growth was greater for sample trees on CH plots during the last year of measurement, while basal area and volume under bark were larger from the 12th year onwards when compared with the WTH treatment. BSH showed a decreased basal area growth under bark during the two 4-year-periods, 13-16 and 17-20 years after planting, and a decreased volume growth under bark from year 9 onwards in comparison with CH.
   Radial growth was increased for CH up to 3 m of the stems during the 9-12-year period and at 3 m during the 13-16-year period in comparison with the other two treatments. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of long-term site productivity and overall silvicultural outcome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An insect (<i>Argyresthia retinella</i>, Lep., Yponomeutidae) outbreak in northern birch forests, released by climatic changes?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. In the early 1990s, birch Betula pubescens L. forests in north-western Norway were damaged by the bud- and shoot-mining larvae of Argyresthia retinella not previously known for outbreaks. In 1993-96, the outbreak was mapped and changes in attack intensity and foliage structure were quantified by sampling birch twigs along transects from coast to inland. Results were considered in relation to a variable climate.
   2. The outbreak extended 400 km along the coast, mainly within the lowest 100-150 m a.s.l. It started in the late 1980s and the attack intensity culminated in 1993-94. Repeatedly, 30-50% of the leaf-carrying shoots were damaged or killed. Trees compensated by sprouting clusters of shoots from undamaged shoots and, hence, increased foliage clumping. Eventually, twigs and branches died.
   3, The overwintering post-diapause egg, the larva and the adult stages were considered the most sensitive to changes in temperature climate. The air temperature, averaged for a combination of these stages, was calculated for each year, as well as deviations from the long-term (1868-1996) average.
   4, The 5-year running average of deviations approached or exceeded +1 degrees C three times: in the 1930s, around 1960 and around 1990. The third peak coincided with the outbreak of the 1990s. There are no reports of an A. retinella outbreak in either the 1930s or 1960s. However, in one photographic documentation from 1940, clumped foliage structure of birch suggests an outbreak in the 1930s.
   5. Severe A. retinella attacks appear to be a fairly new phenomenon, possibly connected to recent high temperature deviations. If so, with the present air temperature climate, outbreaks may occur at intervals of approximate to 20-25 years. With a trend of decreasing air temperature, outbreaks may be less frequent. At higher temperatures, natural or from anthropogenic global warming, the outcome is more uncertain although more frequent outbreaks may occur initially.
   6. It is recommended that foresters learn to identify damage made by A. retinella and include observations on this insect in their reporting. Monitoring A. retinella damage in the North and elsewhere, should contribute to the understanding of the outbreak ecology of this insect.

TI  - Future goods transport in Sweden 2050: Using a Delphi-based scenario analysis
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Transport is an important part of society, and its future is influenced by a number of developments, such as of technology, environmental regulations and societal behaviour. This paper presents a scenario analysis from a Delphi survey focusing on future goods transport in Sweden in 2050 using experts from industry, academia and government. Our results show divergent views of the future of goods transport, with experts having widely different opinions on subjects such as consumer behaviour, which technologies will be dominant, how goods will be transported on main roads and in urban areas, and the role of policy and public investments. The experts, however, share views on the high desirability of improvements connected to sustainability. The study points to great uncertainties of future developments in goods transport, which have implications for the need for interaction and dialogue between actors in industry, academia and government and opens up for further research.

TI  - Innovation in the long run: Perspectives on technological transitions in Sweden 1908-2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL TRANSITIONS
AB  - There are fundamental unresolved questions about the nature of the long-run interplay between innovation and economic development processes. This study examines technological transitions in Sweden, 1908-2016, using a new literature-based innovation output indicator for the engineering industry, allowing a mixed-methods approach. The results suggest that waves of innovation have taken place during periods of investment downturns and structural crises during the 1930s, 1970s, and 2010s. Closer examination indicates that landscape pressure alone cannot explain the pattern. Rather, the pattern can be explained by multi-regime interactions: infrastructure and industry rationalization, acting as a fertile ground for breakthrough innovations when the crisis breaks out. The results support a historical interpretation of long-run transitions in terms of development blocks and three industrial revolutions, with implications for the assessment of current sustainable transitions. This suggests a crucial role for infrastructures and interactions between socio-technical systems, not least between digital and renewable energy technology.

TI  - Regional developmental requirements and the role of Caspian development
T2  - CASPIAN SEA: A QUEST FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY
CP  - NATO Advanced Research Workshop on the Caspian Sea: A Quest for Environmental Security
AB  - The article questions how the countries in the Caspian region can make the best use of their riches and how prepared they are to absorb the potential benefits of natural resources under their possession, taking into consideration the whole complex of closely intertwined international and regional economic, political and geostrategic interests tied together in this region. The author argues that with the recent downward revision of the region's oil reserves estimates and export volume countries in the region will be forced to look for other ways to draw investments. Although there are grounds for optimism that fossil fuels will, in the long run, pla), a major role in the three countries' economic development many problems, like lack of democratization, corruption and over-involvement of government officials in Economic activities must be resolved first. Otherwise, there is a possibility for decline into Nigeria-style chaos rather than a rise to Norway-like stability and affluence. In terms of the influence of the oil factor over the regional conflicts resolution, the most destabilizing factor in the region is not the Caspian oil itself; but the disputes and rivalry over the pipeline routes and division of the Caspian Sea shelf No country in the region will benefit from the oil until the phase of struggle for a share of Caspian oil a,ld the transportation route and the exploitation of the oil factor as an instrument of pressure is over.

TI  - Influence of Anthropogenic Activities on Metals in Arctic Permafrost: A Characterization of Benchmark Soils on the Yamal and Gydan Peninsulas in Russia
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
AB  - Permafrost-affected region in Russian Arctic is an important study area for investigating fate of trace metals in soils by geological processes and human-induced trace metals through atmospheric deposition. Two plots of soils in Yamal region were selected: Northern Trans-Urals area (PU1, PU2, PU3) adjacent to urban areas and Gydan Peninsula representing reference groups as natural landscapes (Yavai, Gyda, Enysei). The levels of most metals in Urals area were more than those in Gydan Peninsula. In soil profile, Histic horizon revealed the accumulation of most metals. Cd and Pb were classified as metals, which were transported by atmosphere from urban areas and accumulated in surficial organic layers. Gleying processes and cryogenic mass exchanges transported metals from bottom to top layers in mineral horizons. Moreover, gleying horizon functioned as a geochemical barrier for metal transporting below permafrost table. The levels of As, Mn, and Fe were obliviously higher than threshold limit values of Russian Siberia. However, these values cannot represent the natural hydromorphic soils in Arctic tundra. The Geoaccumulation Index (I-geo) were determined for assessing surface soil samples regarding to metals' pollution. The results suggested local geology pollution for Gydan Peninsula and atmospheric transport pollution for Urals area. More investigations with respect to trace metals behavior in permafrost-affected soil profile needed to be studied for understanding levels of trace metals with changes of active layer depth due to climate changing.

TI  - Electric Vehicles Optimism versus the Energy Market Reality
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The promotion of new electric and hybrid vehicles is a worldwide strategy to reduce carbon emissions for a clean future environment in many countries. In Europe, development of the electric vehicle (EV) industry is a strategic direction of multiple car-producing companies, institutes, and governments, but how sustainable it is to shift fully to electric has yet to be seen. By making use of the statistic reports from the European Union, scientific literature, and mathematical calculation, the author wants to examine if what politicians see will be a matter of reality in the near future. It will be proved that, if all private transport become electric, energy consumption will increase to such a level that is impossible to be satisfied by the actual energy producing companies. While the EV industry is seen as an important step towards achieving environmental goals, and despite some positive assumptions made by few European Governments (e.g., Norway) according to which electrical cars will replace the fossil fuel ones in private transportation, the actual energy market trends are not able to support the demand for the next several decades. The author will focus on one European country, Romania, to provide it as a case study (Romania is a self-sustainable country with regard to energy production, producing roughly 124% of its needs.).

TI  - Work-Related Attitudes in Asia and Europe: Institutional Approach
T2  - INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
AB  - Research was supported by ETF grant 7537.
   The differences in attitudes and values in countries with similar cultural roots but different institutional backgrounds were found in a study conducted in three European countries (Alas and Edwards 2007). The differences in work-related attitudes in the three Finno-Ugrian countries, Estonia, Finland and Hungary, are influenced by the respective countries' historical legacy, in particular differences in levels of institutional development (ibid). In order to test this result and to advise companies doing business on different continents, the authors enlarged the sample by adding countries from Europe and Asia. Countries on both continents have been divided into two groups according to their institutional backgrounds. Europe has been divided into two parts according to recent history and developmental level: East European and West European countries. The former group has undergone a transition from planned command economy over the last 20 years, the latter has a long tradition of capitalism and the market economy. Similarly, in Asia Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong have well established market systems, while China has been developing a socialist market economy since the late 1970s (Warner et al., 2005). Managers in Eastern Europe and China have had similar challenges: to focus on organisational efficiency and to change competitive strategies (Alas et al 2009b; Wang, 2007).
   The main research question is: are there differences in work-related attitudes between employees from countries with different institutional background on two continents and, if so, what are the reasons for these differences?
   The paper begins with hypotheses development. This is followed by description of the empirical study and finally data collected from empirical studies in four regions (China; Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong ['Asia']; formerly socialist Eastern Europe; and Western Europe) are analysed and the results discussed. An institutional model of differences in attitudes toward society, organisations and work has been developed.
   The findings indicate both similarities and differences between work-related attitudes in Asia and Europe. Even between East and West European respondents who share a similar culture, there were in certain instances substantial differences in attitudes. The same is true in Asia: attitudes of Chinese respondents differ from attitudes of the three other Asian countries in the survey. At the same time the findings indicate that the institutional framework influences work-related attitudes, as evidenced by the similarities in some of the responses from Chinese and East European respondents.
   The main conclusion from this study is that the differences in attitudes held toward society, organisations and work by people in Asia and Europe are influenced both by institutional context and cultural background. Both factors, and combinations of both factors, should be considered by owners and managers of multinational corporations. These results may help managers of multinational companies to achieve better work-related attitudes among employees working in plants on different continents.

TI  - Mites (Acari, Mesostigmata) in boreal Scots pine forest floors: effect of distance to stumps
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY
AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a basic component of forest ecosystems and it plays a crucial role in species-poor boreal forests. Generally, previous studies have focused on differences between the forest floor and decaying logs of various tree species. The impact of distance to CWD has been investigated mainly for forest-floor snails and some groups of macrofauna, but not yet for mesostigmatid mites communities. We hypothesized that the effect of CWD decreases with increasing distance from CWD. To test this hypothesis we conducted a study in relatively species-poor Finnish boreal forest (at ca. 100 km northwest of Helsinki). In total, 81 samples were collected in 2007 from nine Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stumps, three microhabitats (CWD, soil/litter at 0.5 m from a stump and soil/litter at 1.5 m from a stump) and in three main directions (9 stumps x 3 microhabitats x 3 directions). Overall, 1965 mesostigmatid mites were collected representing 24 species. The mean number of mite species collected was significantly different between decaying stumps and forest litter; however, there was no significant difference between the litter samples at 0.5 and 1.5 m distance. The evenness index was significantly lower for samples collected from stumps than for litter in close (0.5 m) or far (1.5 m) distance. The most frequently encountered mite species were Veigaia nemorensis, Parazercon radiatus and Zercon zelawaiensis.

TI  - Climate change and forest management - accordances and differences between the German states regarding assessments for needs and strategies towards forest adaptation
T2  - LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
AB  - A federal working group of German forest research that was mandated by the Federal Forest Task Force (FCK) reports on the accordances and differences between the German states (Bundeslaender) regarding assessments of forest adaptation to climate change.
   Regarding the threats of climate change and the possibility of adaptation to it, responses were mostly quite similar within the group. The highly significant nature of climate change and the scope of its regional impacts were evaluated by the respondents in a similar manner. The important role of biotic threats was likewise acknowledged by all parties. We found also only slight differences in the assessment of forest tree species' adaptive potential to climate change: Norway spruce is expected to have low adaptive potential whereas the introduced species Douglas fir and red oak will presumably be more highly adaptive. Several native species are still considered to be quite tolerant against climate change effects as well, However, differences are obvious regarding adaptation strategies. Some states prefer active adaptation (e.g. forest transformation aiming at replacing sensitive tree species), while others prefer a combination of active adaptation and risk minimization strategies (e.g. by establishing tree species mixtures). Passive adaptation is predominantly a less preferred option.
   All respondents agreed on the need for more intensive interdisciplinary research and for coordinated trials concerning forest adaptation and forest management in the face of climate change.

TI  - A Crude Awakening: Effects of Crude Oil on Lipid Metabolism in Calanoid Copepods Terminating Diapause
T2  - BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN
AB  - Calanus finmarchicus and Calanus glacialis are keystone zooplankton species in North Atlantic and Arctic marine ecosystems because they form a link in the trophic transfer of nutritious lipids from phytoplankton to predators on higher trophic levels. These calanoid copepods spend several months of the year in deep waters in a dormant state called diapause, after which they emerge in surface waters to feed and reproduce during the spring phytoplankton bloom. Disruption of diapause timing could have dramatic consequences for marine ecosystems. In the present study, Calanus C5 copepodites were collected in a Norwegian fjord during diapause and were subsequently experimentally exposed to the water-soluble fraction of a naphthenic North Sea crude oil during diapause termination. The copepods were sampled repeatedly while progressing toward adulthood and were analyzed for utilization of lipid stores and for differential expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. Our results indicate that water-soluble fraction exposure led to a temporary pause in lipid catabolism, suggested by (i) slower utilization of lipid stores in water-soluble fraction-exposed C5 copepodites and (ii) more genes in the beta-oxidation pathway being downregulated in water-soluble fraction-exposed C5 copepodites than in the control C5 copepodites. Because lipid content and/or composition may be an important trigger for termination of diapause, our results imply that the timing of diapause termination and subsequent migration to the surface may be delayed if copepods are exposed to oil pollution during diapause or diapause termination. This delay could have detrimental effects on ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - <i>Hematodinium</i> spp. infections in wild and cultured populations of marine crustaceans along the coast of China
T2  - DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS
AB  - The parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium spp. infects a broad range of marine crustaceans. Its epidemics have impacted wild populations of various commercial fishery species around the world and the sustainability of mariculture in China. To study the epidemiology of Hematodinium spp. in marine crustaceans along the coast of China, we conducted a broad survey of wild and cultured stocks of major crustacean species in 2013 to 2015. Hematodinium sp. infections were identified in wild stocks of Portunus trituberculatus from Huludao, Laizhou, Qingdao, Yangtze River Estuary and Zhoushan, and Scylla paramamosain from Shantou; and cultured stocks of Portunus trituberculatus and Penaeus monodon from a polyculture pond in Qingdao. In the polyculture pond, Hematodinium sp. infections were observed in Portunus trituberculatus from June until October, with peak prevalence (up to 90%) observed in late July to early August. Furthermore, Hematodinium sp. infection was identified for the first time in the giant tiger prawn Penaeus monodon in the polyculture system during the disease outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Hematodinium isolate infecting Penaeus monodon was identical to the isolate infecting the co-cultured Portunus trituberculatus, and it was grouped into H. perezi genotype II together with the other isolates reported in China. The Hematodinium sp. isolated from Portunus trituberculatus appeared to have similar life stages as the H. perezi genotype III isolated from the American blue crab Callinectes sapidus. Our study indicates that outbreaks of Hematodinium disease can be a significant threat to the widely used polyculture system for decapods in China that may be particularly vulnerable to such generalist pathogens.

TI  - What is left? Macrophyte meadows and Atlantic herring (<i>Clupea harengus</i>) spawning sites in the Greifswalder Bodden, Baltic Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - Coastal zones are productive areas of marine ecosystems which are also hotspots of anthropogenic activities causing habitat degradation. In the southwest Baltic Sea, eutrophication is thought to have caused the massive reduction in submerged macrophytes observed in recent decades. Here, we surveyed the submarine vegetation and examined locations of spawning of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Greifs-walder Bodden, one of the most important reproductive habitats of the Western Baltic Spring Spawner herring stock (WBSS). This stock deposits eggs onto submerged vegetation and changes in macrophyte coverage are expected to influence the availability of reproductive habitat. Aerial, underwater video tows and SCUBA surveys conducted in spring 2009 revealed that only similar to 7% of the lagoon was vegetated. Herring eggs were observed on 12 of 32 SCUBA transects, at depths between 0.2 and 5 m and were attached to a variety of spermatophyte and algae species but not to stones or mussels. A classification tree model indicated that spawning sites were strongly associated with the vegetation cover within a 100- and 500-m radius, implying that herring schools preferentially spawn on dense and large underwater meadows. Only similar to 5% of the lagoon now falls into this vegetation category. Despite 20 years of efforts to reduce eutrophication, no increase in macroalgae and spermatophyte vegetation towards the historical level of 90% coverage in the area is apparent.

TI  - Sediment properties, biota, and local habitat structure explain variation in the erodibility of coastal sediments
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Sediment resuspension is a frequent phenomenon in coastal areas and a key driver for many ecosystem functions. Sediment resuspension is often linked to biological and anthropogenic activities, which in combination with hydrodynamic forcing initiate sediment erosion and resuspension, if the erosion threshold (tau(c)) is exceeded. Despite its importance to ecosystem functions very few studies have provided measurements on natural assemblages for subtidal sediments. The aim of this study was to determinate key environmental variables regulating sediment resuspension potential across a sedimentary gradient in a subtidal coastal environment. In order to explore this, we sampled 16 sites encompassing a wide variety in environmental variables (e.g., grain size distribution, macrofaunal communities, vegetation) in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. A core-based erosion device (EROMES) was used to determine sediment resuspension potential measures of erosion threshold, erosion rate (ER), and erosion constant (m(e)). Based on abiotic and biotic properties sampled, sediments diverged into two distinct groups; cohesive (muddy) and noncohesive (sandy) sediments. Results showed that abiotic sediment properties explained 38-53% and 15-36% of the total variation in resuspension potential measures in muddy and sandy sediments, respectively. In cumulative models, biota accounted for 12-26% and 6-24% to the total variation in muddy and sandy sediments, respectively. Sediment erodibility and resuspension potential of natural sediments is highly variable from local habitats to a larger seascape scale. Our results underline the importance of biota to resuspension potential measures in spatially variable environments.

TI  - Global Estimates of the Burden of Injury and Illness at Work in 2012
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE
AB  - This article reviews the present indicators, trends, and recent solutions and strategies to tackle major global and country problems in safety and health at work. The article is based on the Yant Award Lecture of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) at its 2013 Congress. We reviewed employment figures, mortality rates, occupational burden of disease and injuries, reported accidents, surveys on self-reported occupational illnesses and injuries, attributable fractions, national economic cost estimates of work-related injuries and ill health, and the most recent information on the problems from published papers, documents, and electronic data sources of international and regional organizations, in particular the International Labor Organization (ILO), World Health Organization (WHO), and European Union (EU), institutions, agencies, and public websites. We identified and analyzed successful solutions, programs, and strategies to reduce the work-related negative outcomes at various levels. Work-related illnesses that have a long latency period and are linked to ageing are clearly on the increase, while the number of occupational injuries has gone down in industrialized countries thanks to both better prevention and structural changes. We have estimated that globally there are 2.3 million deaths annually for reasons attributed to work. The biggest component is linked to work-related diseases, 2.0 million, and 0.3 million linked to occupational injuries. However, the division of these two factors varies depending on the level of development. In industrialized countries the share of deaths caused by occupational injuries and work-related communicable diseases is very low while non-communicable diseases are the overwhelming causes in those countries. Economic costs of work-related injury and illness vary between 1.8 and 6.0% of GDP in country estimates, the average being 4% according to the ILO. Singapore's economic costs were estimated to be equivalent to 3.2% of GDP based on a preliminary study. If economic losses would take into account involuntary early retirement then costs may be considerably higher, for example, in Finland up to 15% of GDP, while this estimate covers various disorders where work and working conditions may be just one factor of many or where work may aggravate the disease, injury, or disorders, such as traffic injuries, mental disorders, alcoholism, and genetically induced problems. Workplace health promotion, services, and safety and health management, however, may have a major preventive impact on those as well. Leadership and management at all levels, and engagement of workers are key issues in changing the workplace culture. Vision Zero is a useful concept and philosophy in gradually eliminating any harm at work. Legal and enforcement measures that themselves support companies and organizations need to be supplemented with economic justification and convincing arguments to reduce corner-cutting in risk management, and to avoid short- and long-term disabilities, premature retirement, and corporate closures due to mismanagement and poor and unsustainable work life. We consider that a new paradigm is needed where good work is not just considered a daily activity. We need to foster stable conditions and circumstances and sustainable work life where the objective is to maintain your health and work ability beyond the legal retirement age. We need safe and healthy work, for life.

TI  - Habitat variability and faunal zonation at the AEgir Ridge, a canyon-like structure in the deep Norwegian Sea
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - The AEgir Ridge System (ARS) is an ancient extinct spreading axis in the Nordic seas extending from the upper slope east of Iceland (similar to 550 m depth), as part of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), to a depth of similar to 3,800 m in the Norwegian basin. Geomorphologically a rift valley, the ARS has a canyon-like structure that may promote increased diversity and faunal density. The main objective of this study was to characterize benthic habitats and related macro- and megabenthic communities along the ARS, and the influence of water mass variables and depth on them. During the IceAGE3 expedition (Icelandic marine Animals: Genetics and Ecology) on RV Sonne in June 2020, benthic communities of the ARS were surveyed by means of a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) and epibenthic sledge (EBS). For this purpose, two working areas were selected, including abyssal stations in the northeast and bathyal stations in the southwest of the ARS. Video and still images of the seabed were usedtoqualitatively describebenthic habitats based on the presence of habitat-forming taxa and the physical environment. Patterns of diversity and community composition of the soft-sediment macrofauna, retrieved from the EBS, were analyzed in a semiquantitative manner. These biological data were complemented by producing high-resolution bathymetric maps using the vessel's multi-beam echosounder system. As suspected, we were able to identify differences in species composition and number of macro- and megafaunal communities associated with a depth gradient. A biological canyon effect became evident in dense aggregates of megafaunal filter feeders and elevated macrofaunal densities. Analysis of videos and still images from the ROV transects also led to the discovery of a number of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) dominated by sponges and soft corals characteristic of the Arctic region. Directions for future research encompass a more detailed, quantitative study of the megafauna and more coherent sampling over the entire depth range in order to fully capture the diversity of the habitats and biota of the region. The presence of sensitive biogenic habitats, alongside seemingly high biodiversity and naturalness are supportive of ongoing considerations of designating part of the ARS as an "Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area" (EBSA).

TI  - Stratigraphical studies of the Holocene deposits in Algpussen, a small bog in eastern Sweden
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTEENTH INTERNATIONAL DIATOM SYMPOSIUM
CP  - 13th International Diatom Symposium
AB  - The bog Algpussen is situated approximately 30 km southwest of Stockholm. The bog occupies a depression in the landscape, probably a kettle hole. The surroundings consist of hilly glaciofluvial deposits. The isolation threshold of the depression, when it was separated from the Baltic Sea, cuts through silt and has been levelled to +24.5 m a.s.l. A 400 cm long core from the central part of the bog has been analysed for organic carbon and mineral magnetic parameters and the siliceous microfossils and pollen stratigraphy has been determined. In addition, six tandem accelerator datings were carried out.
   The results show that the stratigraphical sequence covers the last c. 8000 years. The Baltic stages of the Ancylus Lake, the Mastogloia Sea and the Litorina Sea are represented. The Litorina 4 transgression is reflected as a peak in Melosira westii f. parva Brander dated to around 3500 BP. The basin was isolated c. 2900 BP. After that, as indicated by the presence of Gomphonema parvulum (Kutzing) Grunow, a polluted lake prevailed for almost 1000 years. The pollution was most likely caused by human activities, such as waste deposition and/or cattle breeding. The lake was filled in and a Carer fen, and later on a Sphagnum bog, developed. Three periods of intense anthropogenic activities have been identified: 2800-1800 BP, 1400-1300 BP and 800-500 BP.
   The taxonomy of a Melosira species, found in the uppermost Carer pear and tentatively determined as M. nygaardii Camburn, is discussed.

TI  - The Uplands after neoliberalism? - The role of the small farm in rural sustainability
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - The modernist project foresaw no role for small farms, but this can no longer be regarded as axiomatic as neoliberalism enters what Peck et al. call its "zombie phase". This paper asks what contribution small farms in the uplands can make to societies' goals, what role they might play in the sustainability of rural communities in such regions, and how this contribution might be supported by state policies. In Scotland and in Norway these questions have recently been the subject of policy debates which appear to offer exceptions or alternatives to neoliberal universalism, and these are considered specifically in this paper. In each case support for small farms is seen as necessary to maintain 'lights in the windows' of remoter rural areas. Moreover, each highlights the vital role of the state in offering not only financial support but also in regulating land transfers and occupancy. It is argued that the dismantling of such regulatory powers depletes the state's ability to manage the tensions between continuity and change which are at the heart of sustainable rural development. The paper concludes that small farms can persist and can contribute to rural sustainability in ways that have been infrequently recognised under neoliberalism. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Niche Partitioning of Microbial Communities at an Ancient Vitrified Hillfort: Implications for Vitrified Radioactive Waste Disposal
T2  - GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Because microbes cannot be eliminated from radioactive waste disposal facilities, the consequences of bio-colonization must be understood. At a pre-Viking era vitrified hillfort, Broborg, Sweden, anthropogenic glass has been subjected to bio-colonization for over 1,500 years. Broborg is used as a habitat analogue for disposed radioactive waste glass to inform how microbial processes might influence long-term glass durability. Electron microscopy and DNA sequencing of surficial material from the Broborg vitrified wall, adjacent soil, and general topsoil show that the ancient glass supports a niche microbial community of bacteria, fungi, and protists potentially involved in glass alteration. Communities associated with the vitrified wall are distinct and less diverse than soil communities. The vitrified niche of the wall and adjacent soil are dominated by lichens, lichen-associated microbes, and other epilithic, endolithic, and epigeic organisms. These organisms exhibit potential bio-corrosive properties, including silicate dissolution, extraction of essential elements, and secretion of geochemically reactive organic acids, that could be detrimental to glass durability. However, long-term biofilms can also possess a homeostatic function that could limit glass alteration. This study documents potential impacts that microbial colonization and niche partitioning can have on glass alteration, and subsequent release of radionuclides from a disposal facility for vitrified radioactive waste.

TI  - Isoprene suppression of new particle formation in a mixed deciduous forest
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB  - Production of new particles over forests is an important source of cloud condensation nuclei that can affect climate. While such particle formation events have been widely observed, their formation mechanisms over forests are poorly understood. Our observations made in a mixed deciduous forest with large isoprene emissions during the summer displayed a surprisingly rare occurrence of new particle formation (NPF). Typically, NPF events occur around noon but no NPF events were observed during the 5 weeks of measurements. The exceptions were two evening ultrafine particle events. During the day, sulfuric acid concentrations were in the 10(6) cm(-3) range with very low preexisting aerosol particles, a favorable condition for NPF to occur even during the summer. The ratio of emitted isoprene carbon to monoterpene carbon at this site was similar to that in Amazon rainforests (ratio > 10), where NPF events are also very rare, compared with a ratio <0.5 in Finland boreal forests, where NPF events are frequent. Our results suggest that large isoprene emissions can suppress NPF formation in forests although the underlying mechanism for the suppression is unclear. The two evening ultrafine particle events were associated with the transported anthropogenic sulfur plumes and ultrafine particles were likely formed via ion-induced nucleation. Changes in landcover and environmental conditions could modify the isoprene suppression of NPF in some forest regions resulting in a radiative forcing that could have influence on the climate.

TI  - The physical niche of the bathyal <i>Lophelia pertusa</i> in a non-bathyal setting:: environmental controls and palaeoecological implications
T2  - COLD-WATER CORALS AND ECOSYSTEMS
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Deep-Sea Corals
AB  - The habitat-forming scleractinian coral Lophelia pertusa supports an ecosystem that is widely known to occur in the bathyal marine ecologic realm along deep shelves, oceanic banks, seamounts and continental margins. Therefore, L. pertusa is generally considered a 'deep-water' or 'deep-sea' coral. In contrast, this study analyses the environmental controls of this bathyal ecosystem where it is thriving well in the non-bathyal shallow-water setting of the Swedish Kosterfjord area (NE Skagerrak). This is one of several shallow-water L. pertusa occurrences in Scandinavian waters where saline and temperature stable oceanic waters intrude as topographically-guided underflows onto the inner shelf and adjacent fjords, driven by an estuarine circulation.
   The L. pertusa occurrence of the Sacken site in the northern Kosterfjord exists at 80-90 m water depth and only a few tens of metres beneath a permanently brackish surface water layer. At the depth of the coral patches, however, the hydrographic data reveal fully marine conditions, which are ensured by a deeper inflow of Atlantic water through the Norwegian Trench into the Skagerrak. SEM analyses of resin casts taken from dead L. pertusa skeletons yield an endolith assemblage dominated by boring sponges such as Cliona spp. (trace: Entobia ispp.), the boring bryozoan Spathipora, the fungus Dodgella priscus (trace Saccontorpha clava) and an unknown fungus (trace: Orthogonum lineare). Such a composition exclusively of heterotroph organisms resembles the Saccomorpha clava/Orthogonum lineare ichnocoenosis which is regarded as indicative for fossil and Recent, open marine, aphotic environments. This interpretation is supported by direct light measurements at the Sacken site, which indicate aphotic conditions for at least most of the year.
   The finding of bathyal communities in comparatively shallow waters is linked to factors that force deeper oceanic water masses to surface. Such situations are likely to be expected where an estuarine circulation prevails, or in deep-sea basins bordered by narrow shelves and with local upwelling cells driven by the wind regime, facilitating the intrusion of eutrophic deeper waters to shallow depths including the benthic communities.

TI  - Selective Exposure and New Political Cleavages: Media Use and Ideological Reinforcement Over Time
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
AB  - New political cleavages are reshaping the political landscape in established democracies. The classic left-right ideological dimension that has structured politics for decades is increasingly challenged by a sociocultural value dimension. At the same time, growing opportunities for media choice open for new forms of selective news exposure along political lines. We argue that previous research has too narrowly focused on traditional ideological cleavages, neglecting the increasingly important sociocultural value dimension of politics. Using four waves of panel survey data collected in Sweden during 2020 and 2021, this study analyses ideological selective exposure, audience composition, and reinforcing spirals across a range of mainstream and alternative news outlets. Findings show (1) that the sociocultural value dimension is more important than the socioeconomic dimension for explaining news choices, (2) that it structures news audiences in uniquely distinct ways, and (3) that these relationships are highly stable over time-reflecting patterns of de facto selective exposure and ideological maintenance, rather than reinforcement. These findings bring new insights to research on selective news exposure, political polarization, and changing ideological cleavages in Western democracies.

TI  - Growth of <i>Lumbricus terrestris</i> and <i>Aporrectodea caliginosa</i> in an acid forest soil, and their effects on enchytraeid populations and soil properties
T2  - PEDOBIOLOGIA
AB  - A laboratory experiment was carried out to test the hypothesis that the earthworms Lumbricus terrestris and Aporrectodea caliginosa are able to maintain their populations and reproduce in the acid forest soil of a deciduous forest where no lumbricids were found in the field. The experiment was conducted in 45-l containers in which layers of mineral subsoil, humus and organic topsoil collected from the site were established. Both species survived and at least L. terrestris reproduced during the 60 weeks' incubation. Burrows and middens of L. terrestris were recorded and quantities of titter were consumed. The presence of lumbricids increased the organic matter content of humus, reduced the acidity of the topsoil and humus layers, and suppressed the population of the enchytraeid Cognettia sphagnetorum. A dense population of Enchytraeus albidus was found in L. terrestris middens. It is concluded that edaphic factors do not explain the absence of earthworms, but isolation from cultural landscapes and lack of opportunity to colonize the site from the surroundings is the decisive factor.

TI  - Biogas in the transport sector-actor and policy analysis focusing on the demand side in the Stockholm region
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - Sweden has ambitions to phase out fossil fuels and significantly increase the share of biofuels it uses. This article focuses on Stockholm County and biogas, with the aim to increase the knowledge about regional preconditions. Biogas-related actors have been interviewed, focusing on the demand side. Biogas solutions play an essential role, especially regarding bus transports and taxis. Long-term development has created well-functioning socio-technical systems involving collaboration. However, uncertainties about demand and policy cause hesitation and signs of stagnating development.
   Public organizations are key actors regarding renewables. For example, Stockholm Public Transport procures biogas matching the production at municipal wastewater treatment plants, the state-owned company Swedavia steers via a queuing system for taxis, and the municipalities have shifted to "environmental cars".
   There is a large interest in electric vehicles, which is expected to increase significantly, partially due to suggested national policy support. The future role of biogas will be affected by how such an expansion comes about. There might be a risk of electricity replacing biogas, making it more challenging to reach a fossil-free vehicle fleet. Policy issues strongly influence the development. The environmental car definition is of importance, but its limited focus fails to account for several different types of relevant effects. The dynamic policy landscape with uncertainties about decision makers' views on biogas seems to be one important reason behind the decreased pace of development. A national, long-term strategy is missing. Both the European Union and Sweden have high ambitions regarding a bio-based and circular economy, which should favor biogas solutions.

TI  - The metazoan meiofauna associated with a cold-water coral degradation zone in the Porcupine Seabight (NE Atlantic)
T2  - Cold-Water Corals and Ecosystems
CP  - 2nd International Symposium on Deep-Sea Corals
AB  - The metazoan meiofauna associated with Lophelia pertusa reef degradation zones in the Belgica Mound province (Porcupine Seabight, North-East Atlantic) was studied in the framework of the Atlantic Coral Ecosystem Study (ACES; EC Fifth Framework Research Program). Attention was focused on the influence of and differences between different microhabitat types: dead coral fragments, glass sponge skeletons and the underlying sediment. This study demonstrates the importance of dead Lophelia pertusa framework and associated substrates for meiofauna along the European continental margins. The presence of these large biogenic structures on the seafloor of the continental margin (1) enables more taxa to be present and (2) particularly favours harpacticoid copepods, naupliar larvae and polychaetes. The meio-epifaunal community on these substrates significantly differs from the meio-infaunal community in the underlying sediment. This is mainly due to a much lower dominance of nematodes and a higher relative abundance of most other taxa, especially harpacticoids, naupliar larvae and polychaetes, in the latter habitat. This situation is comparable to that of epiphytic assemblages. Dominance of nematodes is low. The meio-infaunal assemblage in the underlying sediment is characterized by low densities. There are clear indications that cold-water coral degradation zones are biologically very diverse, in terms of species richness as well as equitability. Of all microhabitat types, coral fragments support the most diverse communities, whereas the underlying sediment is the least diverse.

TI  - Turning to practice in academic theology and religious studies <i>Research circles as an example</i>
T2  - STUDIA THEOLOGICA-NORDIC JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY
AB  - This article takes as its starting point the changing cultural, social and academic landscape in Sweden which has created a need for new ways of teaching and doing research in theology and religious studies. Against this backdrop, the article explores concrete work with a research circle, at Uppsala University, with upper secondary religious education teachers, as a way of working closer to practice and thereby including non-academic actors in knowledge production. The research circle, as a form of action research, where a group of teachers formulate a problem or research questions built on actual research and challenges they have met in their practice, is described and preliminary results are elaborated. Furthermore, the article expands on the possibility of transferring the method of research circles into other areas within theology and religious studies. Finally, the feasibility of the method for transforming an academic discipline and renegotiating the understanding and role of theory and practice is explored. The article concludes that research circles offer an interesting and fruitful method, among others, that blurs the borders, not only between theory and practice, but also between research and education, and calls for a suitable practice theory.

TI  - Holocene land uplift and its influence on fire history and ecosystem development in boreal Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - Lake Uddjaur in northern Sweden was formed as a consequence of non-uniform glacio-isostatic uplift in which a forested valley was gradually flooded and high elevation areas became islands. We hypothesized that small islands in Lake Uddjaur burnt through lightning strike more frequently when they were part of a large forested area compared to when they became true islands, and that this reduction in fire impact has enhanced the domination of late successional species and humus accumulation. Fire history and vegetation dynamics were studied by analysis of macroscopic charcoal (> 0.5 mm) and pollen in humus profiles from two islands. According to a model of isostatic uplift, the islands became gradually isolated from the mainland between ca. 2000 to 1000 BP, i.e. during the same time that fire impact declined. Prior to that, both islands were part of a Pinus-Betula forest landscape affected by fires from ca. 5800 to ca. 1500 BP. Thereafter fire influence ceased and the islands became more strongly characterized by late successional species, e.g. Picea. This change was associated with substantial humus accumulation. The decreased fire influence on these islands contrasts with the regional increase in fire influence during the last 1000 yr. Long-term influence of wildfire is important in vegetation dynamics and humus accumulation and, thus, post-glacial isostatic land uplift can indirectly have a substantial influence on ecosystem development. Consequently, this effect should be further considered in long-time ecosystem studies of areas with large, non-uniform land uplift such as those found in northern Fennoscandia and eastern Canada.

T2  - INTED2015: 9TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 9th International Technology, Education and Development Conference (INTED)
AB  - The HERD Energy project QIMSEE (Quality Improvements of Master Programs in Sustainable Energy and Environment) is founded by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This project aims to contribute to educating a national work force at WB countries that has adequate innovative qualifications in the energy sector by building sustainable capacity of higher education institutions. The overall goal is to develop and establish new internationally recognized MSc study programs in accordance with Bologna Process for the field of "Sustainable Energy and Environment", at each of collaborating universities in the WB countries. More specific goals are amongst others to establish close cooperation between WB participants for mutual support in achieving better quality of master studies. Increase institutional quality and capacity of the WB Universities in the field of teaching staff improvement, laboratory organization and logistics, networking and supplementing expertise's to match closer to the Norwegian partners. Furthermore, to enhance connection and communication between the WB Universities and the industry/public sector in the WB region (Fig 1).
   In order to fulfill these tasks, and to conduct the activities specified in the project, it is crucial to design and implement a good physical/virtual learning environment. A technical backbone combined with new pedagogical methods, designed to incorporate a wide range of education technologies and to obtain enhanced collaboration and communication.
   The strategy is to divide the learning environment in modules or building block, which may be combined in different ways and adapted to the various activities/stages of the QIMSEE project. During the project period, a refinement process will extract the best ways of combining these building blocks, to create sustainable scenarios for learning and collaboration for the future.
   The challenge for many universities is to make a long term strategy regarding investment in education technology. There is a vast selection of equipment with different types of functionality. New solutions in educational technology are popping up every day, and it is hard to predict what will be the next established standard. In addition this technology should be implemented in cooperation with the IT-department, and the teachers need to get training and be inspired to adapt their content and pedagogical methods to the new educational technology. There is also a shift from the "one way communication" where the teacher talks and the students take notes, to a more varied learning environment. This environment might include interaction and collaboration, Student response systems, Peer instruction, MOOC, Flipped classroom, PBL and personalized learning techniques. In addition the students may use their own mobile devices in the learning process. (BOYD). All these factors have to be taken into consideration, when choosing the education technology for the future classroom.

AB  - Training of human resources in port facilities is of particular importance, especially if one considers that cargo crime could be facilitated by negligence or support of personnel. Recommendations regarding training and education are available in the SOLAS Chapter XI-2 and ISPS code. However, experts claim that too much freedom of interpretation is given to these frameworks in the process to define security training and education. As a consequence, harmonization of security may be hindered, leaving weak points and compromising commitment, security culture and awareness. In this paper, we aim to understand the present status of port security training and education courses that today are offered in Sweden. In particular, we look at the market for these services and the current level of harmonization. Results show that level of commitment, size of ports, cultural and working conditions may affect the outcome of security courses. From a harmonization viewpoint, we found that more work need to be done to ensure the development of common requirements on EU level, quality assurance systems, and distance learning courses. This paper concludes with a roadmap to harmonization for governments.

TI  - The barriers encountered by teachers implementing education for sustainable development: discipline bound differences and teaching traditions
T2  - RESEARCH IN SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: According to the Swedish curriculum teachers in all subjects have a responsibility to integrate a holistic perspective of sustainable development (SD) and teach according to an education for sustainable development (ESD) approach. However previous research has shown that teachers from different subjects perceive SD differently.
   Purpose: The study aimed at investigating if and how teachers' subject area influences their ability to implement a holistic perspective of ESD; we investigated both the impact of teaching traditions and the barriers that teachers experienced.
   Sample: A stratified sample of 224 Swedish upper secondary schools participated. An online questionnaire was sent and answered by a total of 3229 teachers at these schools. In total, there were 669 science teachers, 373 social science teachers, 483 language teachers, 713 vocational and esthetical-practical teachers, and 739 teachers from other disciplines who participated in the survey.
   Design and methods: The questionnaire consisted of questions requiring Likert-scale responses and multiple-choice questions. The data from the questionnaire were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square test and one-way ANOVA. The significance level accepted was p < 0.05.
   Results: Teachers were influenced by their own subject traditions. Science teachers in our study were grounded in the fact-based tradition and lectures were the most common teaching method used. The teaching tradition of the social science teachers seemed to be most in line to an ESD approach. Many language teachers (41%) stated they did not include SD issues in their teaching at all. Among the barriers identified, the most common obstacles were that the teachers lacked inspiring examples of how to include SD in their teaching and that they lacked the necessary expertise about SD.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the need for the management within schools to create opportunities for teachers to work collaboratively when teaching ESD. It is also important to provide further training that is adjusted to the needs of different disciplines.

TI  - CHALLENGES AND PRECONDITIONS TO BUILD CAPABILITIES FOR SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT DESIGN
T2  - DS87-1 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENGINEERING DESIGN (ICED 17), VOL 1: RESOURCE SENSITIVE DESIGN, DESIGN RESEARCH APPLICATIONS AND CASE STUDIES
CP  - 21st International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)
AB  - Sustainable product innovation has previously been found to be positively correlated to competitiveness. However, in order to build capabilities for sustainability integration one must first understand companies' current state. The overall aim is therefore to identify common preconditions and challenges for sustainability integration in product innovation. A questionnaire study, targeting employees with roles in product development, was conducted at four medium-sized to large product development and manufacturing companies in Sweden. Results show that capabilities for sustainability integration are perceived as decisive for future company success, but are not considered to be correspondingly high prioritized today. Decision making is focused on material selection and energy efficiency, so no full socio-ecological sustainability perspective is covered. Formal decision support tools are only used by half of respondents and are a main area for improvement. Identified challenges include short-term economic thinking, lack of sustainability criteria and vague management commitment. Based on these findings, seven recommendations for companies are presented and validated.

TI  - Genotyping Strategies Using ddRAD Sequencing in Farmed Arctic Charr (<i>Salvelinus alpinus</i>)
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary
   Animal breeding in recent years has benefited greatly from the availability of large-scale genetic information. The most widely applied genomic tools in selective breeding are specialized arrays that use DNA hybridization. However, the high financial investments accompanying this practice impair the profitability of emerging aquaculture species, including Arctic charr. The aim of the current study was to assess and compare the potential of two cost-efficient genotyping strategies applicable in a variety of breeding-related tasks, such as pedigree verification, genetic diversity screening and detection of genomic regions that are associated with phenotypes of economic importance. Both strategies are based on reduced representation sequencing but differ in sequencing coverage (low and high). The low coverage strategy offers a higher density of DNA markers, but also presents a greater proportion of missing data in the marker set and is characterized by more uncertainty in determining heterozygosity compared to high coverage. Our results show that while high coverage genotyping performs better in genetic diversity and kinship analyses, a low coverage strategy is more successful in identifying genomic regions associated with phenotypic traits, leading to the conclusion that both strategies could be of value into selection schemes.
   Incorporation of genomic technologies into fish breeding programs is a modern reality, promising substantial advances regarding the accuracy of selection, monitoring the genetic diversity and pedigree record verification. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are the most commonly used genomic tool, but the investments required make them unsustainable for emerging species, such as Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), where production volume is low. The requirement to genotype a large number of animals for breeding practices necessitates cost effective genotyping approaches. In the current study, we used double digest restriction site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing of either high or low coverage to genotype Arctic charr from the Swedish national breeding program and performed analytical procedures to assess their utility in a range of tasks. SNPs were identified and used for deciphering the genetic structure of the studied population, estimating genomic relationships and implementing an association study for growth-related traits. Missing information and underestimation of heterozygosity in the low coverage set were limiting factors in genetic diversity and genomic relationship analyses, where high coverage performed notably better. On the other hand, the high coverage dataset proved to be valuable when it comes to identifying loci that are associated with phenotypic traits of interest. In general, both genotyping strategies offer sustainable alternatives to hybridization-based genotyping platforms and show potential for applications in aquaculture selective breeding.

TI  - Prospecting the sustainability implications of an emerging industrial symbiosis network
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - In order to enable industrial symbiosis (IS) as an approach for regional sustainable development, it is important that stakeholders involved in facilitating symbiotic exchanges can measure and comprehend the potential benefits and impacts. However, previous assessments have been sporadic and limited to only a few indicators, primarily focused only on existing IS examples or networks and very few have examined potential developments. This study expands the assessment of IS networks by reviewing the environmental and socio-economic implications of an emerging network on the west coast of Sweden using life cycle assessment and socio-economic assessments to illustrate the implications for the firms of the network and regional sustainability. The results suggest that the IS network has the potential to make a positive contribution to the environmental performance of the industries and the socio-economic status of the region. Of key importance is the potential to cascade the use of nutrients and avoid large eutrophication impacts to the neighboring sea in addition to the large greenhouse gas emissions reductions by avoiding and replacing conventional processes and products. The socioeconomic assessment illustrated that the IS network could make a substantial contribution to the region for job creation, revenues, local skills base, research and innovation and regional identity. The results provide insights on the potential of industrial symbiosis for regional sustainable development, which may be important for decision makers, firms involved in the network and municipalities, nationally and internationally to advance local efforts with facilitating industrial symbiosis and to understand how these networks can be assessed.

TI  - Tree species composition influences differences in water use efficiency of upland forested microwatersheds
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) was compared in three upland South Moravian forested microwatersheds in the light of effects of global climate change on forest ecosystems (GCC). The experimental catchments were characterized as upland headwater forested microwatersheds of similar size and morphology and silvicultural system, but each with different dominant tree species in the stands (over 50% of forest stand composition in living stock): Norway spruce, European beech and mixed forest. WUE was evaluated according to mean daily streamflow reduction, measured at the discharge points of the recipients of the individual catchments in precipitation-free periods lasting more than 5 days. During these times, streamflow dynamics are mainly influenced by evapotranspiration processes occurring in the forest stands. Four precipitation-free periods were observed, two in the middle of the growing season and two at its end. Two of these periods were long (15 days or more), and two were shorter (6 days). The results indicated that WUE of upland forested catchments can be very different, depending upon the dominant tree species and the seasonal phase. Highest WUE at the catchment scale (never decreasing below 80%) was exhibited by beech predominating site. WUE of mixed forest was high as well, never decreasing below 69%. The lowest WUE was exhibited by spruce predominating site, especially during a long precipitation-free period in the summer where it decreased down to 39%. In the context of the landscape, upland microwatersheds with pure spruce stands could cause its accelerated dry out in the summer and pose a significant threat to sustainable water and forest management of these areas. In comparison, mixed forests stands where spruce is not the dominant species or beech stands should still be a viable option even under the effects of GCC.

TI  - Species accumulation curves analysed by a class of null models discovered by Arrhenius
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - Arrhenius is mainly given credit for his discovery of the log-log relationship between number of species and area, but in 1921 he invented the technique of analysing the data with a null model. This achievement, which Arrhenius explicitly stated was more important than the empirical species-area relationship, has been overlooked in the scientific literature. We suggest here that analysis of large communities should be done by a successive addition of predefined subsets of samples. Plotting the resulting accumulation curves in a common diagram usually will reveal heterogeneity between subsamples. We believe that this is a general feature of a counting process, (over space or time), that keeps record of new objects being generated by an unobservable process. We show this by two nonbiological time series: examination scores at the University of Oslo and stock prices on the Oslo stock market. We then apply these ideas to the analysis of the nested accumulation plots obtained from two unusually large community samples, the benthos of the Norwegian continental shelf and of marine areas of Hong Kong. Discontinuities in the accumulation curves can be explained by changes in habitat heterogeneity. These changes may be interpreted as variations in the parameter values in the class of null models discovered by Arrhenius. By selecting appropriate parameter values, the observed accumulation curves (calculated by an analytical expression giving exact values) can be approximated by null curves. This procedure makes it possible to identifying the major factors responsible for the shape of the curves in the accumulation plots.

TI  - Climate change facilitated range expansion of the non-native angular crab <i>Goneplax rhomboides</i> into the North Sea
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - The angular crab Goneplax rhomboides is native to the north-eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. It has rarely been reported from the North Sea, with no evidence of sustainable populations. Compiled survey data, however, revealed an increasing abundance of this species in the North Sea since 2000. The data were used to (1) describe the range expansion of the angular crab into the North Sea; and (2) to apply species distribution modeling (maximum entropy approach-MAXENT) to predict the potential habitats of this species. Habitats of species with a similar ecology were modeled to analyse habitat overlap and potential competition. The spatial and temporal patterns of records revealed that the expansion of the angular crab into the North Sea is due to natural larval dispersal rather than anthropogenic vectors. Modeled habitats of the angular crab showed a core distribution area along the Scottish coastline and in the southern North Sea. Sea bottom temperatures in February had the highest influence on the model results. We concluded that the angular crab has extended its distribution range from the north-eastern Atlantic to the North Sea, which was facilitated by an increase in water temperature and the prevailing hydrodynamics over the last decade. This was the first time that a benthic range expansion was observed in quasi real time for the North Sea. Habitats of the angular crab overlapped those of possible competitors to a large extent. However, co-existence of the species is expected rather than any negative effects resulting from the range expansion of the angular crab.

TI  - EFFECTS OF THE DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGISLATION RELATING TO SEWAGE SLUDGE DISPOSAL IN THE EU
T2  - DETRITUS
AB  - The European Directive 86/278/EEC implemented in 1986 was a means adopted by the European Union to improve use of the valuables in sewage sludge by applying treated sludge on agricultural soils. To prevent an accumulation of pollutants, the Directive provided suggestions limiting concentrations of toxic elements in sewage sludge and agricultural soil. The Directive was implemented diversely throughout EU member states, with current national legislations only partly reflecting the initial intentions of the EU Directive from 30 years ago. This study demonstrates how the European Directive was implemented in three countries currently at different stages of replacing the agricultural application of sewage sludge with incineration (Netherlands, Germany and Sweden). Additionally, recent changes in the legislation with regards to the re-use and final disposal of sewage sludge in the three chosen member states are analysed. The aim was to investigate how each member state has solved the conflict between improvement of nutrient recovery from sludge and limitation of pollutants in agricultural soil. Based on this review, limit values are not necessarily reflected in application rates of sewage sludge in agriculture. Following changes in current legislation, phosphorus recovery will become a priority task. The recovery of other valuables from sewage sludge is currently not regulated in the legislation of the three member states investigated.

TI  - Study of an Altered Magnetic Circuit of a Permanent Magnet Linear Generator for Wave Power
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The wave energy converter (WEC) studied and developed at Uppsala University in Sweden is a point absorbing buoy connected to a linear generator (LG) on the seabed. Previous studies have improved the sustainability of the generator, changing its magnets from Nd2Fe14B-magnets to ferrites. In this paper, the magnetic circuit of the linear generator is further studied. Ferrite magnets of two different types (Y30 and Y40) are studied along with different shapes of pole shoes for the system. The finite element method (FEM) simulations in a program called Ace are performed. The results show that a linear generator including both Y30 and Y40 magnets and shortened T-shaped pole shoes can generate a similar magnetic energy in the airgap as a linear generator only containing Y40 magnets and rectangular pole shoes. This shows that the magnetic circuit can be altered, opening up sizes and strengths of magnets for different retailers, and thereby possibly lowering magnet cost and transportation. This work was previously presented as a conference at the European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference (EWTEC) 2017 in Cork, Ireland; this manuscript has been carefully revised and some discussions, on magnet costs for example, have been added to this paper.

TI  - Identification of drought-tolerant tree species through climate sensitivity analysis of radial growth in Central European mixed broadleaf forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate warming and a rise in evaporative demand expose forests to increasing stress, challenging silvicultural planning in many temperate forest regions. As some major timber species are drought susceptible, the choice of native broadleaf minor timbers with assumed higher drought tolerance is a promising alternative option. However, their growth performance and vitality in a warmer and drier climate are not well known. We studied tree-ring chronologies of the Central European minor timbers Acer platanoides L., Fraxinus excelsior L., and Tilia cordata Mill. in comparison to the widely planted Quercus petraea Matt. Liebl in different mixed stands along a precipitation gradient in Central Germany and analyzed the sensitivity of radial growth to climatic drivers and severe drought events with the aim to compare the species' drought tolerance. While growth responded in all four species positively to summer (or spring) precipitation and negatively to higher summer temperature and climatic aridity, climate sensitivity of growth decreased in the period 1967-2016, proving non-stationarity. Superposed epoch analysis revealed larger growth reduction during severe drought in the diffuse-porous species (A. platanoides, T. cordata) than the ring-porous species (Q. petraea, F. excelsior), but resilience was high in all species. Moreover, none of the species showed negative growth trends with recent climate warming, and drought sensitivity was not higher at drier sites, suggesting a considerable acclimation and adaptation potential to increasing drought stress. As all four species proved to be fairly drought tolerant, they deserve broader consideration in silvicultural concepts targeted at adapting production forests to climate warming.

T2  - 7TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT 2015: TOWARDS THE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE, INNOVATIONS AND SOCIAL PROGRESS
CP  - 7th International Scientific Conference on Rural Development - Towards the Transfer of Knowledge, Innovations and Social Progress
AB  - The aim of the paper is to evaluate the change in the energy efficiency of crop production in the EU during the period 2002-2012. The energy efficiency is an important indicator of sustainability of agricultural processes. The energy-saving agriculture is a priority of the new Rural Development Programme in 2014-2020. Even though the analysis counts with main direct energy inputs into the crop production (fertilizers, fuels and pesticides), the methodology of the energy efficiency for commodities and farms uses all indirect non-renewable energy inputs spent on production of buildings and machinery. The analysis covered 24 EU countries. The change in the energy efficiency in time was calculated through the Malmquist index. Clustering using medoids revealed groups of countries with similar energy efficiency. The Malmquist index identified the United Kingdom, Portugal and Sweden as countries with the most dynamic positive change in energy efficiency of the crop production in time. On the contrary, Baltic States and Poland experienced the most dynamic decline of energy efficiency. However, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland significantly increased the Malmquist index in recent years, partly as a consequence of effective investments from the Rural Development Programme (RDP). The energy efficiency indicator that includes direct and indirect energy inputs is supposed as suitable indicator for RDP's ex-post evaluation.

TI  - Community analysis of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria in the maize mycorrhizosphere in a long-term fertilization trial
T2  - FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY
AB  - In this study, we investigated the impact of organic and mineral fertilizers on the community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and bacteria in the mycorrhizosphere of maize in a field experiment established in 1956, in south-east Sweden. Roots and root-associated soil aggregates were sampled four times during the growing season in 2005, in control plots and in plots amended with calcium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, green manure, farmyard manure or sewage sludge. Fungi in roots were identified by cloning and sequencing, and bacteria in soil aggregates were analysed by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism, cloning and sequencing. The community composition of AM fungi and bacteria was significantly influenced by the different fertilizers. Changes in microbial community composition were mainly correlated with changes in pH induced by the fertilization regime. However, other factors, including phosphate and soil carbon content, also contributed significantly to these changes. Changes in bacterial community composition and a reduction in bacterial taxon richness throughout the growing season were also manifest. The results of this study highlight the importance and significant effects of the long-term application of different fertilizers on edaphic factors and specific groups of fungi and bacteria playing a key role in arable soils.

TI  - Nitrogen use efficiency and energy harvest in wheat, maize and grassland ley used for biofuel - implications for sustainability
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE - ADAPTING CROPS TO INCREASED UNCERTAINTY (AGRI 2015)
CP  - 4th International Conference on Agriculture and Horticulture (AGRI)
AB  - One of the most important resources within agriculture is nitrogen (N), and depletion of N resources is an important element in the evaluation of sustainability in agriculture. Therefore, identifying crops with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is important for the sustainability of the system. In an energy crop context, sustainability in crop production could aim at enhanced energy output with maintained or reduced depletion of N resources. Crops with different photosynthetic pathways (C-3 vs. C-4) and life histories (perennials vs. annuals) are expected to differ in NUE and also energy harvest per unit N lost from the system.
   The aim is to characterize the growth, NUE and energy output per unit N lost for three common crops frequently used for energy; maize, winter wheat and perennial grassland (ley). These crops differ in photosynthetic and life history strategies.
   Above ground biomass of wheat, grassland ley and maize was sampled within a long-term experiment in Central Sweden. The experiment has a split-plot design with four replicates. Four aboveground harvests were conducted during the growth period and plant N contents were determined. Biomass growth, yield (above ground biomass in ley and maize, grain biomass in wheat) and some functional traits were assessed, and the NUE components N uptake efficiency, yield-specific N efficiency and yield N concentration were calculated according to Weih, et al. (2011). Energy output per N lost with the harvested product was calculated assuming crop-specific higher heating values for biofuel use.
   The N uptake efficiency and yield-specific N efficiency were higher in maize than wheat and ley. The yield N concentration was higher in the perennial ley than the annual crops, and lowest in maize. Energy output per N lost in the harvested product was greater in maize compared to wheat and ley. The results are discussed in a agricultural sustainability perspective. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license

TI  - ORCHESTRATING MEANING-PUPILS' USE OF DIFFERENT MODES IN AN ADVANCED DIGITAL PRIMARY SCHOOL CONTEXT
T2  - EDULEARN12: 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES
CP  - 4th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - Today the number of computers has generally increased in Swedish schools. More than half of the Swedish municipalities have invested in digital technology projects and teachers are more and more using computers and other digital technologies in daily teaching even in primary schools. Digital technologies open up for a multiplicity of modes and affordances, which impact on education in the contemporary classroom. New forms of representation and communication are made potentially available and make other forms of communication visible.
   They also opens up for a broader view of literacy as multimodal design, taking into account that language in a globalised society is more than reading and writing skills. Multimodal perspectives on literacy have the basic assumption that meanings are made through many representational and communicational resources, which language is one. From a multimodal perspective, image, sound, text, speech, gestures are referred to as modes, which are organized sets of semiotic resources for meaning making (Jewitt, 2012; Kress 2010).
   This paper will aim to contribute and enrich the understanding of teaching and learning in a multimodal environment by presenting research findings from an advanced digital classroom context where computers and multimodal software are integrated tools for learning in the classroom activities. The instance analyzed here is from a socio-cultural approach of learning where the focus is on the interactive, institutional and the context features of the practice. The analysis of the empirical data take a stand from a social semiotic multimodal approach with focus on the process and how pupils orchestrate meaning through their selection and configuration of different modes in a primary school context.
   The findings show significant features of how pupils collaborate and explore communication and representations in a multimodal landscape. The results points out examples of how different modes such as; images, texts, sound, speech and special effects are used in order to fulfil a digital multimodal classroom task. In what way pupils make meaning of these multimodal affordances, which comes along with emerging technologies in education, are further on discussed in the light of learning and curriculum knowledge.

AB  - Adopting a systems-approach to an urban water and wastewater system, while applying a triple bottom line strategy to management, entails a careful analysis of all the sub-systems and components thereof with a view to improving service levels, optimising expenditure, augmenting investments, and also reducing the life-cycle environmental impacts associated with setting up, maintaining and operating the system. The scope for optimising expenses is system-wide, though it varies from one sub-system to another, depending on inherent lock-ins and external factors beyond the direct control of the water and wastewater utility. Optimising the consumption of energy and chemicals and improving the cost-efficiency thereof, is always on the agenda of water treatment plants (WTPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). This paper analyses the consumption of and the expenditure on chemicals and energy at Oslo's WTPs and WWTPs over time. Energy and chemicals for water and wastewater treatment, on an average account for 10.8% of the total operational expenses in the water supply sub-system and 13.7% for the wastewater handling sub-system. There is a perceptible increase in this share from 5.2% in 2004 to 14.9% in 2009 for water and 12.3% to 14.2% for wastewater. Chemicals cost more than energy for the WWTPs, while it was the other way round for the WTPs. The total real cost of energy and chemicals per cubic metre, in year-2007 currency, was between 4 and 5.2 Euro cents for the WTPs, and between 1 and 4.5 Euro cents for the WTPs. The total (WTP vertical bar WWTP) per-capita real costs of energy and chemicals, expressed in year-2007 currency, rose from around 10 Euros in year 2000 to about 12.2 Euros in year 2007.

TI  - Protein efficiency per unit energy and per unit greenhouse gas emissions: Potential contribution of diet choices to climate change mitigation
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - The production, transport and processing of food products have significant environmental impacts, some of them related to climate change. This study examined the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production and transport to a port in Sweden (wholesale point) of 84 common food items of animal and vegetable origin. Energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for food items produced in different countries and using various means of production were compared. The results confirmed that animal-based foods are associated with higher energy use and GHG emissions than plant-based foods, with the exception of vegetables produced in heated greenhouses. Analyses of the nutritional value of the foods to assess the amount of protein delivered to the wholesale point per unit energy used or GHG emitted (protein delivery efficiency) showed that the efficiency was much higher for plant-based foods than for animal-based. Remarkably, the efficiency of delivering plant-based protein increased as the amount of protein in the food increased, while the efficiency of delivering animal-based protein decreased. These results have implications for policies encouraging diets with lower environmental impacts for a growing world population. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - ENHANCING CAREER MANAGEMENT SKILLS (CMS): FIRST RESULTS OF THE ACUMEN PROJECT TRAININGS ON CMS ONLINE RESOURCES
T2  - EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES
CP  - 10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - In the current labour market, Career Management Skills (CMS) are becoming a relevant tool in the view of lifelong career guidance, where individuals can develop resources and competencies to manage their learning and occupational path, thus becoming main characters of their life project (Sultana, 2012).
   CMS play a central role also in the development of lifelong guidance programmes at the EU level. Through the constitution of the Lifelong Guidance Expert Group (2002-2007) and the European Lifelong Guidance Policy Network (ELGPN), established in 2008, the European Union endorsed the integration of lifelong guidance into lifelong learning strategies and committed herself in the promotion of Career Management Skills in both the education and the employment sectors across the member states (Council of the European Union 2004, 2008). In the 2008 Resolution, EU countries were invited to 1) strengthen the lifelong acquisition of career management skills; 2) facilitate the access by all citizens to guidance services; 3) ensure quality in guidance provision; 4) encourage the coordination and the cooperation among the different stakeholders at local, national and European level.
   Following the above-mentioned goals, the ACUMEN project (Career Management Skills - A New 'Literacy' for Sustainable Employment, project ref. 2016-1-UK01-KA204-024334), funded under the Erasmus+ programme, is focused on the promotion of CMS in education and in labour market settings in order to foster employment and self-employment in eight European countries.
   The consortium is composed of nine partners: European Learning Network (ELN) (UK, project leader), Meath Partnership (Ireland), Synthesis center for research and education ltd (Cyprus), LUMSA (Italy), BEST Institut GmbH (Austria), Future in perspective limited (FIPL, Ireland), Team training GmbH (TTG, Germany), Innoventum OY (Finland), Reintegra (Czech Republic).
   The aim of the Acumen project is the development and implementation of 24 online career management resources that support adults within the workforce or those seeking employment to develop and/or strengthen competencies suitable in the current labour market and to identify appropriate career progression pathway. The suite of online resources has been created following the four thematic areas included in the Career Management Skills Framework for Scotland (2012): self; strengths; horizons; networks.
   After having conducted a summary research report defining the level and scope of learning to be achieved and the tools to assess learning attainment, the Career Management Curriculum Resources, available in all partners' languages, have been created and uploaded online on a dedicated platform. In addition to this, an in-service training programme have been implemented, in order to support adult educators, workforce development experts, employment services providers and human resource managers in the delivering of the new career management curriculum.
   This contribution presents the Acumen suite of Career Management Skills and the development and implementation of the in-service training programme in Italy by LUMSA research group. In detail, through the training activities and the participants' feedback, it will highlight strengths and weaknesses of the resources developed for the project, stressing the challenges that are related to lifelong career guidance and to the fostering of citizens' leading roles in their learning and working lives.

TI  - Vascular plants as a surrogate species group in complementary site selection for bryophytes, macrolichens, spiders, carabids, staphylinids, snails, and wood living polypore fungi in a northern forest
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Vascular plants were investigated as a potential surrogate group in complementary small scale site selection, such as woodland key habitats in Scandinavia. We compared the response of vascular plants to environmental gradients to that of seven other plant, fungal and animal groups within a forest reserve in western Norway using data from 59 plots of 0.25 ha. We also examined whether the spatial changes in species (beta-2 index) of vascular plants matched that of the other groups. All seven groups responded to the same gradients in nutrient richness and humidity as the vascular plants. Furthermore, changes in species composition of vascular plants were reflected in comparable degrees of change among the "target" groups. The lower the degree of change in species composition between plots in the "target" groups relative to that of vascular plants, the higher the percentage "target" species encompassed in a complementary selection of sites based on vascular plants. We conclude that in practical site selection of small scale sites of conservation value, such as woodland key habitats, vascular plants may be used in combination with an inventory of important habitats for rare and/or redlisted forest species, such as dead wood, old trees, deciduous trees, and Cliffs.

TI  - Strategies to facilitate implementation and sustainability of large system transformations: a case study of a national program for improving quality of care for elderly people
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Large-scale change initiatives stimulating change in several organizational systems in the health and social care sector are challenging both to lead and evaluate. There is a lack of systematic research that can enrich our understanding of strategies to facilitate large system transformations in this sector. The purpose of this study was to examine the characteristics of core activities and strategies to facilitate implementation and change of a national program aimed at improving life for the most ill elderly people in Sweden. The program outcomes were also addressed to assess the impact of these strategies.
   Methods: A longitudinal case study design with multiple data collection methods was applied. Archival data (n = 795), interviews with key stakeholders (n = 11) and non-participant observations (n = 23) were analysed using content analysis. Outcome data was obtained from national quality registries.
   Results: This study presents an approach for implementing a large national change program that is characterized by initial flexibility and dynamism regarding content and facilitation strategies and a growing complexity over time requiring more structure and coordination. The description of activities and strategies show that the program management team engaged a variety of stakeholders and actor groups and accordingly used a palate of different strategies. The main strategies used to influence change in the target organisations were to use regional improvement coaches, regional strategic management teams, national quality registries, financial incentives and annually revised agreements. Interactive learning sessions, intense communication, monitor and measurements, and active involvement of different experts and stakeholders, including elderly people, complemented these strategies. Program outcomes showed steady progress in most of the five target areas, less so for the target of achieving coordinated care.
   Conclusions: There is no blue-print on how to approach the challenging task of leading large scale change programs in complex contexts, but our conclusion is that more attention has to be given to the multidimensional strategies that program management need to consider. This multidimensionality comprises different strategies depending on types of actors, system levels, contextual factors, program progress over time, program content, types of learning and change processes, and the conditions for sustainability.

TI  - Science for peace: Monitoring water quality and quantity in the Kura-Araks Basin of the South Caucasus
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY WATER RESOURCES: A FOUNDATION FOR REGIONAL STABILITY IN CENTRAL ASIA
CP  - NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Facilitating Regional Security in Central Asia through Improved Management of Transboundary Water Basin Resources
AB  - The Kura-Araks River Basin is an international catchment with five countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and Turkey comprising its watershed. About 65% of the basin area (total area = about 188,200 km 2) falls within the South Caucasus countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Both rivers head in Turkey, join in Azerbaijan, and discharge to the Caspian Sea. The length of the Kura is about 1,515 km and that of the Araks is approximately 1,070 km. Soviet monitoring projects from the 1950s through the 1980s collected water quality and quantity data, but these projects do not exist anymore and many of the data appear to be unavailable. In addition, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, not only did information exchange collapse but the Kura-Arkas also became an international river basin with respect to the three South Caucasus countries. Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia jointly utilize the Kura and Araks rivers and share common problems related to water quantity, water quality, and water allocation. But there are currently no treaties among the three riparians governing water quality, quantity, rights. Monitoring and management of transboundary water are complex problems in any region of the world. In the case of the Kura-Araks River System, the situation is complicated by ongoing regional conflict. Further conflict could be exacerbated by water rights, quantity, and quality issues in the basin, so it is imperative that a culture of cooperation and collaboration be fostered. In November 2002 the South Caucasus River Monitoring Project was funded by NATO's (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) Science for Peace Programme and OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe). This project is not a top-down project managed by NATO and OSCE but was conceived, developed, and is managed jointly by individuals from the three countries. Assistance is provided by experts from Belgium, Norway, and the USA. The project's overall objective is to establish the social and technical infrastructure for international, cooperative, transboundary river water quality and quantity monitoring, data sharing, and watershed management among the Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Its specific objectives are to: increase technical capabilities (analytical chemistry and its application to water resources sampling and monitoring, database management, and communications) among the partner countries; cooperatively establish standardized common sampling, analytical, and data management techniques for all partner countries and implement standards for good laboratory practice (GLP), quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC); establish database management, GIS, and model-sharing systems accessible to all partners via the WWW; establish a social framework (i.e., annual international meetings) for integrated water resources management; and involve stakeholders. Monthly monitoring is conducted for water quantity (discharge) and water quality parameters at 10 locations in each country. Water quality monitoring consists of the usual basic parameters plus heavy, metals, radionuclides, and POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). These data will be used to construct a simple dynamic simulation model of the watershed, which will form the basis for a more sophisticated management model. The NATO-OSCE project formally ends in October 2007, although all involved are anxious to continue the work beyond that date. The project has been a model of collaboration and cooperation in a region where such traits have at times been in short supply.
   Notonly have valuable data been collected, but collegial professional relationships also have been established among the participants. In the long run, this latter aspect will likely prove to be the most important product.

TI  - Ethical challenges and lack of ethical language in nurse leadership
T2  - NURSING ETHICS
AB  - Background: In accordance with ethical guidelines for nurses, leaders for nurse services in general are responsible for facilitating professional development and ethical reflection and to use ethical guidelines as a management tool. Research describes a gap between employees' and nurse leaders' perceptions of priorities. Objective: The purpose of this article is to gain deeper insight into how nurses as leaders in somatic hospitals describe ethical challenges. Design and method: We conducted individual, quality interview with 10 nurse leaders, nine females and one male nurse aged 34-64 years. We used a hermeneutical approach to analyse the data. Ethical considerations: The participants received oral and written information about the study. Participation in the study was voluntary, and the participants were given the opportunity to withdraw. All of them gave written consent. The Norwegian Centre for Research Data approved the research project. In addition, the head of the hospitals gave permission to conduct our study. Findings: Four main areas were identified: deficient ethical language, conflicting demands on nurse leaders regarding staff management, concerns regarding young nurses' ethical consciousness and restricting factors on the creation of a climate of ethics. The nurse leaders experienced considerable pressure. An unexpected finding was the lack of - and even disregard for - an ethical language. Discussion and conclusion: It is crucial to recognise ethics in all types of nursing approaches and to make it explicit. Ethical language must be implemented in nursing education. It must be recognised and used in clinical practice. Recommendations: We recommend further research be conducted into how nurses understand the concept of ethics and how to incorporate ethical principles into clinical nursing and nurse leadership.

TI  - Modelling fuel terminals for supplying a combined heat and power (CHP) plant with forest biomass in Finland
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - A model to decentralise the procurement of forest fuels using terminals is considered for sustainable energy production. Problems include the scheduling of a number of procurement chains to an energy plant during different periods. In Finland roadside terminals are commonly used for forest fuel inventories in the procurement chains of energy plants. However, due to the complex nature of the decentralised procurement problems, the use of roadside terminals has recently been considered as an inefficient supply chain. Therefore, a terminal model was developed and tested using district and plant terminal technologies changing forest fuel buffer decisions to better describe the combinatorial complexity of energy flows. The examples achieved global optimality as a result of adding the terminal technologies to the model. The resulting objective function value (total operating costs of the procurement schedule) decreased by 18.3% from 7.1 to 5.8 million (sic). The properties of the model are discussed and five examples are presented of how the model works based on real-world data. Examples analyse the sensitivity of the model to buffer constraints based on different district and plant terminal technology rates (100, 300, 500 and 1000%). (C) 2012 IAgrE.

TI  - When Do Drivers Yield to Cyclists at Unsignalized Roundabouts? Empirical Evidence and Behavioral Analysis
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - Cycling has grown in popularity during the past decades in many cities in Europe and in the United States because of its environmental and health benefits. However, cyclists are frequently involved in traffic accidents, especially when they interact with vehicles at unsignalized intersections. There is still a lack of evidence and of analysis of what happens in such interactions. This paper explores empirical evidence of vehicle bicycle interactions on a typical Swedish roundabout and provides insights into factors that influence car drivers' yielding decisions when they interact with cyclists. Vehicle bicycle interactions were divided into groups (nonconflict, conflict, yield, and nonyield), and their speed differences were analyzed by group. Furthermore, a discrete choice model was developed to estimate behavioral aspects of such interactions. The observed data showed a higher and significant speed variation among vehicles compared with bicycles, which exhibited smaller variation across groups. The modeling results revealed that the probability of yielding decreased when the speed of the vehicle was higher. But a bicycle's speed had little effect on a driver's decision to yield. More important, the probability of yielding was increased significantly by the proximity of the cyclist to the conflict zone. The yielding rate of drivers can be improved by keeping vehicles' speed to less than 20 km/h, as drivers then have the capacity to detect and yield to cyclists.

TI  - Sustainable harvest strategies for age-structured Eurasian lynx populations: The use of reproductive value
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Eurasian lynx in Scandinavia are subject to regular harvest and lethal control to reduce depredation on domestic livestock and semi-domestic reindeer. Here we introduce the use of total reproductive value to model the effects of current harvest on population dynamics and to propose sustainable harvest strategies for lynx. Demographic stochasticity strongly influences lynx population dynamics. Analyses of the number of lynx shot in relation to the number of family groups registered in annual censuses showed proportional harvest in large parts of Norway because the quotas were higher at larger population sizes. In other areas of Norway the number of lynx shot was independent of population size. The analyses of the model showed that a pure proportional harvest strategy may lead to rapid extinction of lynx populations. In contrast, applying a threshold or proportional threshold harvest strategy in which no harvest occurs below a given threshold can result in the maintenance of viable populations. Thus, this study shows that harvest without any lower threshold for stopping harvest will result in rapid extinction of lynx populations. Accordingly, lynx harvest is not likely to be sustainable if the illegal killing of animals is not controlled because poaching can result in a de facto proportional harvest even at very small population sizes. Under the influence of the large demographic stochasticity in lynx populations this harvest would result in short expected times to extinction. This gives an empirical demonstration that a correct choice of harvest strategy is essential for maintenance of viable populations of harvested species. Our analyses illustrate that parameters determining the viability of small populations can be estimated from individual-based demographic data from a sample of individuals without using time series of fluctuations in population size, which facilitates quantitative analyses of how harvest or removal of individuals, e.g. for captive breeding or translocations, affect the expected lifetime of populations.

TI  - Modeling, simulating and visualizing the evolution of physical landscapes
T2  - 18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES
CP  - IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation
AB  - The paper considers contemporary physical landscape visualization and simulation models that are used for impact analysis and decision making for geographical location studies. It presents a novel generic framework for this purpose that could provide various professionals with a useful tool to facilitate their decision making processes. It argues that the main reasons for constructing a generic framework are firstly, to provide a rigorous approach to the task of studying the evolution of physical landscapes. Current methods are inadequate for obtaining a sufficient level of detail to gain an in depth understanding of the effects of any physical landscape change. This is the case for even simple environmental impact. For example, changes within a specific community, such as filter feeder changes in a coastal habitat that are due to increased sedimentation. The second main reason for constructing a generic framework is to provide sufficient appropriate data that can be used for forecasting and scenario projections using computational simulations that reflect future changes.
   Furthermore, a common framework could be of significant boost to landscape planners, such as engineers, architects, and to a greater extent to policy makers, who are in urgent need of simulation models for visualizing the potential evolution scenarios of a landscape based on their current decisions made on the land use / development of a physical area. Typical contemporary examples can be drawn from what are famously referred to as "Cross-cutting issues" Swedish Environmental Agency, www.naturvardsverket.se/en/In-English/Menu/Swedens-environmentalobjectives-for-a-sustainable society/Swedens-environmental-objectives/Cross-cutting-issues/, 2008). These models could be used to determine the future scenarios, changes to the landscape of an area of interest under a given number of proposed developmental activities especially, in performing trade-off analysis studies on the options available to decision-making professionals, their potential benefits and disadvantages.
   The conceptual framework presented here is based on an in-depth analysis and assessment of an example landscape tracked over time from past to present. It is developed from continuous monitoring of past and present scenarios, to portray changes that may occur on the landscape of interest in the future. On satisfactory completion of a landscape model construction process, the set of models developed are then used for the construction of visualization images to represent the entire evolutionary process of the landscape. The use of both scenario construction methods and visualization techniques for generating the images to depict the evolution of a physical landscape has many benefits; not only because they create a whole picture of the evolutionary cycle but also because they allow the models and the visualization images to provide a variety of viewpoints suitable for use by a wide range of users who need to understand the evolutionary cycle and stages relating to it. For this, the framework includes a function through which users can generate visualization models either with traditional two-dimensional maps and/or fully interactive and immersive three dimensional images generated by photographic sampling of the actual area and computer generated visualization images of GIS-based Software. Inevitably, the success of this approach depends on user input factors that may trigger changes over the subject area.
   Finally, an example of visualizing the impact of climatic change on grape vineyard is presented using the generic framework to show how it could be applied to visualizing other real world scenarios.

TI  - Hieracium monstrosum Hyl. als ingeburgerde graszaadneofyt in enkele Gelderse landgoed- en kasteelparken
T2  - GORTERIA
AB  - - In 1926, Zahn described Hieracium murorum subsp. henrardii in van Soest's (1926) revision of the genus in the Netherlands on the basis of one single collection made by J. Th. Henrard near Ampsen (Province of Gelderland) in the autumn of 1908. Since the plants seem to be very a-typically developed, like often in late flowering specimens of Hieracium sect. Hieracium, it appeared very unlikely that the identity of the plants would ever be revealed. Several attempts to search for plants of this section in the direct vicinity of Ampsen were unsuccessful and it was believed that Henrard's hawkweed had disappeared. However, between 2007 and 2012 we collected several plants in a somewhat wider region around Ampsen (i.e. Castle Hackfort in 2007 and the estate Kieftskamp near Linde in 2012) which, after a thorough study of the material, have been identified with certainty to belong to the same taxon. Two specimens in Van Soest's herbarium in L that were collected near Castle De Wildenborg and the estate Kieftskamp in 1937 proved to belong to this taxon as well. All plants have the typical long petioles found in Hieracium murorum subsp. henrardii and have similar (rather peculiar) teeth at the leaf margins. After an additional and thorough search in L, we located two more herbarium specimens that belong to this taxon. They were collected by D. Douwes near Huize Zelle (Province of Gelderland) in 1981 and Linde in 1982. It should be noted that P. Heukels identified Douwes' plant from Huize Zelle already in 1981 as H. murorum subsp. henrardii. Several unidentified specimens of Hieracium sect. Hieracium were send on loan to Torbjorn Tyler (Lund, Sweden), amongst which one plant collected in the park of Palace Het Loo near Apeldoorn. Tyler identified this plant as Hieracium monstrosum, a species described by Hylander based on material from the park of the Malsaker estate near Ytterselo in 1943 and only known from the type locality and the park of Castle Tynnelso near overselo, both in the Province of Sodermanland, Sweden. After examination, we can only conclude that the specimen from Het Loo belongs to the same taxon as those from Ampsen, the Kieftskamp, De Wildenborgh, Huize Zelle, and Linde. Consequently, H. monstrosum and H. murorum subsp. henrardii are conspecific. Just like in Sweden, H. monstrosum in Gelderland is found in castle and estate parks and it probably was introduced between 1750 and 1935 as a contamination of grass seeds ('wood lawn neophyte'). An extensive description and photos of H. monstrosum are given to facilitate its future recognition.

TI  - Inter-specific competition in mixed forests of Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) and common beech (<i>Fagus sylvatica</i>) under climate change - a model-based analysis
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Mixed forests feature competitive interactions of the contributing species which influence their response to environmental change. We analyzed climate change effects on the inter-specific competition in a managed Douglas-fir/beech mixed forest.
   Therefore, we initialised the process-based forest model 4C with published fine root biomass distributions of Douglas-fir/beech stands and a stand composition originating from yield tables to simulate forest growth under regional climate change scenarios for a Dutch and a German site.
   The number of days when the tree water demand exceeded the soil water supply was higher for Douglas-fir than for beech. After 45 simulation years the proportion of basal area covered by beech increased from one to seven percent. Beech's competitive strength is mainly explained by the fine root biomass distributions and is highest under the historic climate and the driest climate change scenarios. Higher net primary production (NPP) under warmer/wetter climate but decreased NPP under warmer/drier conditions confirms Douglas-fir's high sensitivity to limited water supply.
   Simulated climate change does not substantially alter the interaction of the two species but the drought-stressed trees are more susceptible to insects or pathogens. The concept of complementary water use highlights the importance of mixed forest for climate change adaptation.

TI  - As if I was a spacecraft returning to Earth's atmosphere. Expanding insights into illness narratives and childhood cancer through evocative autoethnography
T2  - HEALTH
AB  - Today, a majority of children diagnosed with cancer are expected to grow up and live-hopefully until old age. Still, knowledge of the lived experience of childhood cancer survivors is sparse. In pursuit of knowledge expansion, by combining my intersecting roles as an academic, educational counselor, and childhood cancer survivor, I approach my personal illness narrative. By means of evocative autoethnography, I write intentionally vulnerably about my experiences and make them available for consideration. I explore my narrative through archives, artifacts, memories of the past, and conversations evoked in the present. I re-visit the cultural landscape of a southern Norwegian girl growing up in the 00s with cancer. Through this, my illness narrative presents as positioned, tangled, and interwoven with a developmental trajectory. Specific educational experiences seem to linger, and many are related to being absent from or re-entering school after the onset of illness. To grasp the intersecting and conflicting experiences of being very ill while also young, I suggest Erik Erikson's moratorium as a key concept. To complement Arthur Frank's illness narratives of restitution, chaos, and quest, I establish the moratorium narrative. As a fresh resource, the moratorium narrative underlines the need to make sensitive our academic community's gaze on illness trajectories unfolding in formative phases and illness narratives defined by growing up. By providing a point of recognition that prompts elaboration, this could also provide the young and very ill with a much-needed narrative space of opportunity, of which more narratives are invited and insisted upon.

TI  - A comparative study of chemical treatment by MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Zn<sub>S</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, and KOH on physicochemical properties and acetaminophen adsorption performance of biobased porous materials from tree bark residues
T2  - COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS
AB  - Preparing sustainable and highly efficient biomass-based carbon materials (BBPM) as adsorbents remains a challenge for organic pollutant management. In this work, novel biobased carbon material has been synthesized via facile, sustainable, and different single-step pyrolysis chemical methods (KOH, ZnCl2, ZnSO4, and MgCl2) using a Norway spruce bark as suitable and efficient carbon precursor. The effects of each chemical activator on the physicochemical structure of synthesized were thoroughly investigated as well as its performance on the acetaminophen adsorption. The results showed that the use of different chemical activation provoked remarkable differences in the BBPM physicochemical characteristics. The KOH activation generated material with the highest specific surface area (2209 m(2) g(-1)), followed by ZnCl2 (1019 m(2) g(-1)), ZnSO4 (446 m(2) g(-1)), and MgCl2 (98 mm(2) g(-1)). The chemical characterization of the carbon materials indicated that the activation of MgCl2 yielded a material around three times more hydrophobic when compared with the other activation methods. The acetaminophen removal showed to be ultrafast, not only due to the BBPM's microstructure but also to the abundant active sites provided by the different chemical activation methods. The adsorption equilibrium times were reached at 1 min for BBPM-KOH and BBPM-MgCl2 and 15 min for BBPM-ZnSO4 and BBPM-ZnCl2. The adsorption process suggests that the pore-filling mechanism mainly dominates the acetaminophen removal but also some physical-chemical interactions such as hydrogen bonding between the amide group of acetaminophen and oxygenated or nitrogenated groups of biochar, 7C-7C interactions between the aromatic ring of the pharmaceutical and the aromatics of biochar, n-7C interaction, van der Waals interactions. The BBPM regeneration studies showed very good cyclability; in the 3rd cycle, the removal was approximately 70% for all four samples. The samples were also used to treat two synthetic effluents, which attained a removal percentage up to 91.9%.

TI  - Nuclear power in the United States of America and in Europe -: a market survey from a vendor's point of view
T2  - ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
AB  - A world population continuing to grow must be provided with sufficient energy supplies at acceptable prices and so as to affect the environment and the climate as little as possible. A growing energy requirement can be met sustainably by a diversified energy mix. Globally, there is a reassessment of nuclear power. Under aspects of the economy, protection of the environment and the climate, geological availability, and geopolitics, nuclear power will make valuable contributions to a solution.
   In the United States, the use of nuclear power has become attractive again in the course of deregulation and as a result of massive increases in plant availability. The nuclear power plants currently in operation offer a promising outlook for the future, also because of the current price increases for natural gas.
   As a consequence of the Green Paper by the EU Commission on the continuity of supply, nuclear power is being reassessed also in Europe. As a result of deregulation of the electricity market, efforts have been made to increase the competitiveness of existing generating capacities. In accordance with changed market conditions, producers have adapted to the requirements of the market by establishing strategic partnerships.
   The envisaged construction of a nuclear power plant in Finland shows that also new nuclear power plants can be attractive in deregulated European markets and that, e.g., also the problems of spent fuel and waste management can be solved if the political will exists to do so.
   In Germany, on the other hand, the political framework conditions for nuclear power continue to be difficult. Unless Germany is willing to fall behind internationally in power generation, all available types of power generation will have to be advanced and combined into a mix serving future needs also in this country. There must be no disruption of technological know-how. Nuclear power must be an important option kept open under reasonable political boundary conditions.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE MICRO AND NANO TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERSONALIZED HEALTH (PHEALTH 2015)
CP  - 12th International Conference on Wearable Micro and Nano Technologies for Personalized Health (pHealth)
AB  - Wearable sensor technologies used to track daily activities have become successful in the consumer market. In order for wearable sensor technology to offer added value in the more challenging areas of stress-rehab care and occupational health stress-related biofeedback parameters need to be monitored and more elaborate business models are needed. To identify probable success factors for a wearable biofeedback system (Affective Health) in the two mentioned market segments in a Swedish setting, we conducted literature studies and interviews with relevant representatives. Data were collected and used first to describe the two market segments and then to define likely feasible business model designs, according to the Business Model Canvas framework. Needs of stakeholders were identified as inputs to business model design. Value propositions, a key building block of a business model, were defined for each segment. The value proposition for occupational health was defined as "A tool that can both identify employees at risk of stress-related disorders and reinforce healthy sustainable behavior" and for healthcare as: "Providing therapists with objective data about the patient's emotional state and motivating patients to better engage in the treatment process".

TI  - Nuclear energy in future sustainable, competitive energy mixes
T2  - ATW-INTERNATIONALE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KERNENERGIE
AB  - The current energy policy. especially in the OECD countries, is characterized by the deregulation of the energy markets and the growing inclusion of aspects of sustainability in the evaluation of energy supply options. These factors are influencing decision-making right now, and will increasingly determine the public view. In the light of these aspects, the decision by Finland to build its fifth nuclear power plant also underlines the positive assessment of nuclear power.
   In the OECD countries, nuclear power plants are making a reliable and cost-effective contribution to the supply of energy, The technical reliability of nuclear power plants worldwide is reflected by high plant availabilities of, on the average, 83%, as well as in the low-cost generation of electricity associated with it. Safety at a high level is guaranteed as a result of the efforts made by industry and by the regulatory authorities.
   A decisive criterion for building new nuclear power plants can he the cost structure of these plants in electricity generation. Capital costs, though high. can be calculated reliably on a long-term basis. This can make electricity from nuclear power a robust factor in deregulated markets suffering from considerable price fluctuations of other sources of energy. Once their capital outlay has been written off, nuclear power plants are among the most favorable plants costwise.
   Another aspect to be considered are the low external costs of nuclear power - an important yardstick for evaluating energy supply systems, Advanced research and development work on nuclear systems of the kind carried out, for instance, by the International Generation IV Forum reveals additional perspectives for the future of nuclear power. Advanced safety systems, intensified use of fuel resources, possible uses of reactors beyond the generation of electricity, and new technologies of managing radioactive waste indicate the development potential inherent in nuclear power and to be tapped by research and development.

TI  - Rock comminution as a source of hydrogen for subglacial ecosystems
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
AB  - Substantial parts of the beds of glaciers, ice sheets and ice caps are at the pressure melting point(1). The resulting water harbours diverse subglacial microbial ecosystems(2,3) capable of affecting global biogeochemical cycles(4,5). Such subglacial habitats may have acted as refugia during Neoproterozoic glaciations(6). However, it is unclear how life in subglacial environments could be supported during glaciations lasting millions of years because energy from overridden organic carbon would become increasingly depleted(7,8). Here we investigate the potential for abiogenic H-2 produced during rock comminution to provide a continual source of energy to support subglacial life. We collected a range of silicate rocks representative of subglacial environments in Greenland, Canada, Norway and Antarctica and crushed them with a sledgehammer and ball mill to varying surface areas. Under an inert atmosphere in the laboratory, we added water, and measured H-2 production with time. H-2 was produced at 0 degrees C in all silicate-water experiments, probably through the reaction of water with mineral surface silica radicals formed during rock comminution. H-2 production increased with increasing temperature or decreasing silicate rock grain size. Sufficient H-2 was produced to support previously measured rates of methanogenesis under a Greenland glacier. We conclude that abiogenic H-2 generation from glacial bedrock comminution could have supported life and biodiversity in subglacial refugia during past extended global glaciations.

AB  - The modern art of metal production engages a broad range of disciplines and knowledge: metallurgy and technology, environment, health and safety, economics and jurisprudence, personnel and politicians, in short, a good example of modern industrial management. A historical perspective will be used to outline the author's vision. Boliden operates two smelters in Sweden as part of its integrated mining, smelting, refining and recycling business. Boliden's history includes births, learning, first love, tough decisions, and a recent marriage! The learning curve for the Ronnskar smelter just passed its 75th birthday. It well illustrates the everlasting efforts of our industries to stay on-line with the global industrial learning curve. As part of the society we live and operate in, we fulfil the task of a supplier of metals that man needs. As corporate citizens we also dare to express our concerns if things go wrong, be it in politics or in environmental matters. As the employer of choice we have to create a living organization attracting young operators and engineers as well. As a producer we have to act for the responsible use and recycling of our products. As wisdom comes of age but is about the future, challenges to be turned into opportunities will be forwarded - and hopefully discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Individual habitat transitions of Atlantic herring <i>Clupea harengus</i> in a human-modified coastal system
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Pelagic marine fish often display highly dynamic migration patterns. However, such movement behaviour is usually studied at the population or school level, while less is known about individual movement characteristics and habitat transitions. During March 2012 to June 2013, we used acoustic tags and moored receivers to monitor the behaviour of Atlantic herring Clupea harengus L. (N = 47) throughout a range of habitats on the Skagerrak coast in southern Norway. Five of the tagged herring entered a former lake transformed into an artificial estuary by a human-made canal linking the former lake to the open ocean. Herring resided in this system for up to 36 d. All tagged herring left the fjord where they were tagged by early August 2012. This habitat transition was detected by the receivers as 3 main pulses of tagged individuals, which were as sumed to be formed by putative populations mixing in the area. Most transitions occurred during nighttime regardless of tidal cycle, and it is suggested that spawning is the primary driver for entering the fjord and artificial estuary. Later detections at a separate receiver system 17 km to the northeast suggest that some herring may overwinter in coastal areas. In the spring of 2013, 3 of the tagged herring returned to their original fjord tagging location. Our study reveals new aspects of herring migration dynamics linked to anthropogenic modifications of connectivity, and suggests that capacity for individual behaviours in schooling fish may be underestimated.

TI  - Eco-labelling of courses and programs at University of Gothenburg
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - For several years, the University of Gothenburg has been classifying and eco-labelling its courses and programs according to the wide definition of sustainable development found in the Swedish Higher Education Act (Chapter 1, Section 5). The objective of this labelling, which corresponds to the ISO 14024:2009 standard, is primarily to guide students in their selection of courses and programs. Two different eco-labels are used. Courses and programs that primarily or partly include issues related to ecological, economic or social sustainable development have different labels. The result shows that the proportion of courses and programs that are eco-labelled is increasing over the years and currently approximately 30% of the courses and programs are eco-labelled.
   Studies have shown that the eco-labelling of university courses and programs is still new and many university lecturers are uncomfortable with defining sustainable development within their subject area. University of Gothenburg has started a course to train university lecturers on how to use good examples, find relevant literature and through dialogue, get help on how sustainable development can be integrated into various subject areas.

AB  - The aim is to investigate determinants of intentions to use a new railway line under construction in the northern Sweden. To this end a test was made of a two-part hierarchical model of train-use intentions positing influences from general values and beliefs as well as specific beliefs about the new railway line. A questionnaire was sent to a randomly selected sample of 1238 citizens residing in seven municipalities along the new railway line. In order to also investigate potential generation differences participants were sampled in four age groups, young adults, young middle-aged, middle-aged, and pensioners. The results supported the proposed hierarchical model showing that general values and beliefs influence intentions primarily through the specific beliefs about the railway line. In addition, the results showed that the youngest age group is more open to change and has stronger intentions to use the new railway. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sensory Biology and Behaviour of <i>Nephrops norvegicus</i>
T2  - ECOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF NEPHROPS NORVEGICUS
AB  - The Norway lobster is one of the most important commercial crustaceans in Europe. A detailed knowledge of the behaviour of this species is crucial in order to optimize fishery yields, improve sustainability of fisheries, and identify man-made environmental threats. Due to the cryptic life-style in burrows, the great depth and low-light condition of their habitat, studies of the behaviour of this species in its natural environment are challenging. Here, we first provide an overview of the sensory modalities (vision, chemoreception, and mechanoreception) of Nephrops norvegicus. We focus particularly on the role of the chemical and mechanical senses in eliciting and steering spatial orientation behaviours. We then concentrate on recent research in social behaviour and biological rhythms of Nephrops. A combination of laboratory approaches and newly developed tracking technologies has led to a better understanding of aggressive interactions, reproductive behaviours, activity cycles, and burrow-related behaviours. Gaps in our knowledge are identified and suggestions for future research are provided.

TI  - Riverine and near coastal migration performance of hatchery brown trout <i>Salmo trutta</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY
AB  - To study migration performance and return rates of hatchery brown trout Salmo trutta smolts the first 5 months after release, 50 fish in each year (fork length, L-F, 158-288 mm) were in two subsequent years tagged with acoustic transmitters and recorded by automatic listening stations in the River Nidelva (central Norway), its estuary and in the marine environment. More than half of the smolts became anadromous migrants (52% in 2011 and 70% in 2012). The fish spent longer time in the estuary than in the marine environment and the results suggest that migratory behaviour of S. trutta smolts is not only restricted to be resident or anadrome-lacustrine, but that there is also an intermediary strategy of estuarine feeding. There were no differences in L-F or mass between groups of smolts with different migration patterns. Return rates from the sea within the first 5 months after release were in both years 16%. Median progression rate in the river was 0.090 L-F s(-1) but decreased significantly as the smolts entered the estuary (0.015 L-F s(-1)). The long residential time in the estuary may increase the risk of negative effects of anthropogenic activities in estuaries, such as harbours and industrial development, and special attention should be given to evaluate effects of such activities.

TI  - Human-Water Dynamics and their Role for Seasonal Water Scarcity - a Case Study
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
AB  - Ensuring sustainable management and an adequate supply of freshwater resources is a growing challenge around the world. Even in historically water abundant regions climate change together with population growth and economic development are processes that are expected to contribute to an increase in permanent and seasonal water scarcity in the coming decades. Previous studies have shown how policies to address water scarcity often fail to deliver lasting improvements because they do not account for how these processes influence, and are influenced by, human-water interactions shaping water supply and demand. Despite significant progress in recent years, place-specific understanding of the mechanisms behind human-water feedbacks remain limited, particularly in historically water abundant regions. To this end, we here present a Swedish case study where we, by use of a qualitative system dynamics approach, explore how human-water interactions have contributed to seasonal water scarcity at the local-to-regional scale. Our results suggest that the current approach to address water scarcity by inter-basin water transports contributes to increasing demand by creating a gap between the perceived and actual state of water resources among consumers. This has resulted in escalating water use and put the region in a state of systemic lock-in where demand-regulating policies are mitigated by increases in water use enabled by water transports. We discuss a combination of information and economic policy instruments to combat water scarcity, and we propose the use of quantitative simulation methods to further assess these strategies in future studies.

TI  - PREDICTIONS ABOUT SESSILE OAK FOREST ECOSYSTEMS FROM BANAT MOUNTAINS IN THE NEXT 80 YEARS
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PAPERS-SERIES E-LAND RECLAMATION EARTH OBSERVATION & SURVEYING ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING
AB  - The climate impact on sessile oak ecosystems may be measured by means of the HYPE climatic software. The climatic modelling software is employed to predict future temperatures and precipitations across the studied teritory. After interpreting the data provided by the software, we can predict how forest ecosystems will be influenced by climate change in the future. Different plots across the Banat Mountain range have been studied in order to determine the future existence of oak forest ecosystems. Consequently, two simulations have been designed, leading to two different future climatic scenarios. To begin with, the first scenario there is a moderate increase in green house gases (rcp-4.5) whilst in the second scenario there is an accentuated increase (rcp-8.5). The analysis which resulted from the data processing from within all three sessile oak stands reveals the fact that the Moldova-Noua and Paltinis stands will be the most vulnerable ones and the Bocsa-Romana stand the less vulnerable one. The importance of these results is closely related to how local forest administrators can use such findings in order to apply the best management measures.

TI  - The effect of discards and survival rate on the Maximum Sustainable Yield estimation based on landings or catches maximisation: Application to the <i>nephrops</i> fishery in the Bay of Biscay
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - MSY objectives are being adopted as major fisheries management targets worldwide. However, in fisheries where discards account for an important share of the catches, the yield, effort, and biomass at MSY can be significantly different when accounting or not for discards and thus when, basing the yield estimations on landings or catches. Also whether accounting for a certain survival rate, of discards can lead to different MSY targets estimates. Hence, both decisions have important, implications on catch and effort reduction recommendations, and consequently on the quota, calculations for fisheries managed by quotas. Results from the Bay of Biscay nephrops fishery confirm, that the optimal exploitation level can vary significantly when optimising for catches or landings, and, by assuming a certain survival rate of the discards. By doing this, the present study also allows to, explore the basis to clarify the definition of MSY in fisheries where discarding takes place. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Safety and accessibility for persons with disabilities in the Swedish transport system - prioritization and conceptual boundaries
T2  - DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB  - The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Sustainable Development Goals stipulate that persons with disabilities have equal rights to access and safely use transport systems. The aim of the current study is to explore stakeholders' perspectives of the relationship and prioritization between safety and accessibility in the Swedish discussion of disability and transport. The data consist of interviews with 15 informants from the National Council for Disability and Transport and other key stakeholders. Reflexive thematic analysis led to identification of four themes: basis for priorities is a matter of governing; challenges to measuring and evaluating different values; importance of knowledge and building forums; and a universal system of accessibility and safety is a challenge. The results indicate the road ahead for a possible holistic and sustainable governance in the transport systems. However, how this will be put into practise is not yet defined.
   Points of interestAccording to several regulations, persons with disabilities have equal rights to safety and accessibility in the transport system. However, there are challenges to combining different concepts and perspectives.Lack of mandates for institutions to address both safety and accessibility leads to goal conflicts and a risk that focuses become entrenched with clearly defined boundaries.There are challenges in evaluating different values and perspectives in relation to accessibility.A facilitating aspect for sustainability regarding safety and accessibility is to create opportunities and systems to allow for the exchange of knowledge.Integration of safety and accessibility may be encouraged by the use of existing sets of holistic approaches (i.e. Vision Zero and Universal Design).

TI  - Scoring method of eco-efficiency using the DEA approach: evidence from European waste sectors
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The increase in human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere is one of the biggest concerns around the globe. The waste sector contributes significantly to this verified increase in emissions, not only because of the quantity of waste generated, but also because of waste treatment, a highly polluting process. To deal with these issues, several directives are being implemented at a European level. In order to confirm if these policies to reduce GHG emissions associated with waste disposal are efficient, this paper aims to assess the environmental efficiencies that result from waste generation. The data used in this study encompass a set of 15 European countries for the period between 2001 and 2015. Eco-efficiency is measured by using the ratio of GDP per capita and GHG emissions per capita derived from the waste sector, and is assessed by the application of the data envelopment analysis approach. Additionally, we also evaluate the state of decoupling between the waste sector emissions (GHG emissions) and economic growth. This analysis intends to understand which economic drivers produce decoupling effects, and to assess to what extent additional factors are influencing this core relationship. Globally, the results show that Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden present better economic and environmental performance when compared to the other countries. Luxembourg is beyond doubt the most efficient country, presenting the highest scores in most of the years between 2001 and 2015. On the other hand, countries like France, Portugal and Austria report the worst performance, presenting eco-efficiency scores below 20%, for the whole period under analysis. In addition, the results of the decoupling elasticity analysis suggest that the optimal decoupling state occurs when there is a drastic and significant reduction in the mean variations of the GHG emissions in the waste sector and a low variation in the average economic growth rate. Our results reinforce the existence of a discrepancy in waste management within the different member states. The countries, which include in their waste management a wider variety of waste treatments, are more efficient than the ones that are still using landfilling as the principal form of waste disposal. Recycling rates play a crucial role for the countries to move up in the "Waste hierarchy", as well as the implementation of the EU directives relating to waste management. Taking all this in consideration, policy makers must reinforce these directives not only at a national, but also at regional level.

TI  - Green e-commerce distribution alternatives - a mission impossible for retailers?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeWhilst green distribution alternatives for consumers have the potential to decrease environmental impact from logistics, retailers struggle to provide such alternatives. The purpose of this paper is to increase the understanding of the factors that hinder retailers from offering green distribution alternatives to consumers.Design/methodology/approachThe paper relies on a multiple case-study of three cases, with one retailer constituting each case. Semi-structured interviews with seven respondents and visits to the retailers' checkouts were used for data collection.FindingsThe offering of green distribution alternatives is a complex task for retailers, with barriers related to six categories (organisational, financial, retailer-logistic service provider (LSP) market, retailer-consumer market, governmental and technological barriers) obstructing the way forward. A process towards offering green distribution services, including barriers and potential mitigation strategies, is suggested.Research limitations/implicationsThe study is limited to a Swedish context, and further research could consider how barriers would manifest themselves in countries with other characteristics.Practical implicationsA framework with barriers and mitigation strategies offers guidance for managers within e-commerce.Social implicationsThe greening of logistics is an important quest towards world-wide sustainability goals, and this paper contributes with an increased understanding of how to decrease environmental impact from e-commerce distribution.Originality/valueThe paper is one of few that takes the consumer side of the greening of logistics into account, thus contributing with valuable perspectives to this scarce body of literature.

TI  - Ethics of Climate Change Adaptation-The Case of Torrential Rains in Norway
T2  - BUILDINGS
AB  - This article analyses adaptation to climate induced challenges in form of torrential rains hitting urban landscapes in Norway with increased frequency. Specifically, it investigates the influence of the industry structure on ethical challenges when the climate changes. A meta-analysis of the scientific output from a major multi-disciplinary research program is carried out. In addition, the methods include use of expert opinions, literature review and document studies. Climate change adaptation challenges disciplines within civil engineering and natural sciences. Following this, established practices need alteration as specialists face new ethical challenges. Practical climate change adaptation requires the ability to overcome silo mentality among the involved disciplines. Challenges involve acknowledging responsibility, transparency, and information quality. Engineering takes place in an environment of incomplete knowledge. In addition, there is a high degree of decentralised decision-making and directives, and laws and regulations are often lagging after the experienced challenges. Consequently, individual experts experience increased ethical challenges. Systemic circumstances apprehension is necessary for reducing societal risks within climate change adaptation. Both education of engineers and cooperation between specialists from different disciplines is needed to master the altered framework conditions.

TI  - Effect of habitat biogeochemicals on survival of lobsters (<i>Homarus americanus</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH
AB  - Lobsters from eastern Long Island Sound (LIS) were exposed to laboratory conditions designed to simulate the habitat in western LIS during the 1999 mass mortality. Elsewhere (Robohm et al. 2005) we have shown that hypoxia and concomitant biogeochemical conditions increase the susceptibility of lobsters to a common pathogen at normal summer temperatures. Here we report that in otherwise favorable conditions, high temperature (24 degrees C) alone had no lethal effect on disease-free eastern LIS lobsters for weeks. However, at this temperature, moderate hypoxia (< 2.5 mg/L dissolved oxygen) was lethal to half of a group (n = 20) of lobsters in about 5 days. Addition of sulfide and ammonium to levels reported for LIS (5.5 mu M sulfide and 17 mu M ammonium) decreased the LT50 to 3.3 days. Higher sulfide concentrations decreased the LT50 significantly. We conclude that lobster survival times are greatly diminished by hypoxia, sulfide and ammonium at high temperature. Because seasonal hypoxia with the production of sulfide and ammonium is an annual occurrence due to cultural eutrophication in western LIS, the results imply that habitat conditions could have been sufficient to account for the observed mortalities in the warm summer of 1999.

TI  - Long-term effects of stump harvesting and landscape composition on beetle assemblages in the hemiboreal forest of Sweden
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Studies on the effects of stump harvesting on forest biodiversity are scarce and studies on long-term effects are until now non-existent. We evaluated such long-term effects by sampling beetles at 14 clear-cuts with and 14 clear-cuts without stump harvesting; harvesting had been done 21-28 years before this study. By using window traps, we collected 6429 individuals belonging to 432 species in 55 taxonomic families. To control for potentially confounding effects of among-site variations in landscape setting we also assessed forest age and volume of deciduous trees within the forest surrounding each site. The long-term effects from harvesting on beetle abundance, species richness and species composition was generally small in comparison to the influence of the characteristics of the surrounding forests. The species richness of the beetle family Latridiidae and the functional group fungivores appeared, however, to be negatively affected by the previous stump harvesting, while several other groups showed strong associations to the characteristics of the surrounding forest. We found little support for considerable long-term effects of stump harvesting on beetles flying in the stands. Long-term effects of stump harvesting at the landscape scale accumulated from harvest of many localities may still be severe, and should be the subject of future studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
CP  - Session on Strategic Gardening - Mobilizing Cultural Aspects of Gardening in Sustainable Development at the Conference on Cultures(s) in Sustainable Futures - Theories, Policies, Practices
AB  - The Hexa-Hives illustrate how an outdoor live installation (landscaped garden installation) can serve as incentive for inter-species encounters and at the same time challenge the paradigm of conventional beekeeping. The Hexa-Hive is an experimental hive, designed to both host honeybees and serve as outdoor furniture for humans. Since 2012, the Hexa-Hive has been a semi-permanent installation in Kaisaniemi Botanic Garden of Helsinki.
   A further development, the Hexa-Hive Village was first installed at the campus of Aalto University, in Otaniemi, Finland in 2013. Launched as artistic intervention, the Hexa-Hive village became a landscaped area hosting honeybees and inviting people to hang out.
   In 2014, a further development - the installation "Hexa-Hive Village with Airstrip for Bees" - was exhibited as part of the art exhibition "Semi-Wild Gardens" at Kouvola city art museum and in 2016, the installation was placed in Tarja Halonen Park, a public area in the centre of Helsinki.
   The article explores the effects of the installation assessed via a questionnaire. The findings include the emergence of a "garden quality" around the "Hexa-Hive", the increase of local faunal and floral diversity and the notion of wilderness in the city. The concept of urban acupuncture and the mental and psychological value of public gardens for humans are described as features of the installation.
   The Hexa-Hive is part of Melliferopolis and was launched in Helsinki in 2012. The activities comprise exhibitions, workshops, installations and lectures. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth and physiology of Picea abies populations from elevational transects: common garden evidence for altitudinal ecotypes and cold adaptation
T2  - FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature.
   2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates.
   3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.

TI  - GLOBALWORKIT - CONNECTING LEADING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY (ICT) SECTORS
T2  - INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)
AB  - GlobalWorkIT prepares European and Korean students for employment in the international information and communications technology (ICT) industry by enhancing understanding of global issues in the ICT sector and of the languages and cultures of the participant countries. It connects three European and three Korean Higher Education Institutions located in world-leading ICT sectors (Korea, Ireland, Germany and Finland) and leverages their relationships with ICT companies that are innovation-focused and internationally-oriented. In this paper, we present GlobalWorkIT and discuss how it will build an EU-Korea network of ICT professionals to underpin trade between the two regions, secure industry sponsorship for future mobilities and enhance co-operation between the education partners and ICT companies.
   The paper introduces the primary activities involved in GlobalWorkIT, which are:
   (1) An integrated EU-Korea student mobility programme with industry experience. This includes: (i) industry experience with an innovation-oriented and internationally focused ICT multinational or small and medium enterprise (SME) company, or research institute (ii) accredited modules in specialist computer science topics (iii) Cultural and linguistic training in the Korean and English language and (vi) Cultural studies training. The student mobility target is four months' duration in any semester each year.
   (2) An online module - 'The Global Classroom'. A unique feature of GlobalWorkIT is the semester-long Global Classroom module, which is delivered online across time zones, countries and cultures and is unique and innovative. Delivered by the School of Computing at the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) in its Bachelor in Computer Science (International) programme, it aims to mimic the experience of workers in the international ICT industry. The student's international experiences are captured by using work practices in the global ICT industry (e.g. teleconferencing, time differences, project management in geographically distributed context, etc.,). The module is fully accredited and formally assessed and students of multiple nationalities take the module. It will be available to all students participating in the mobilities between the European Union (EU) and Korean participant institutions. This will extend the reach of the Global Classroom to allow for an 'internationalisation at home experience' for students who cannot travel abroad for personal, financial, health or other reasons.
   (3) An internationalised curriculum in Computer Science. Over the course of the cooperation between the EU and Korean partners, a new internationalised curriculum leading to a joint double degree will be developed. Experiences captured, for example innovative curricula, new teaching methods, real world case studies, etc., will inform the development of this double degree.
   (4) A faculty mobility programme. The faculty mobility programme will support the student mobility programme, the delivery of the Global Classroom module and the development of internationalised computer science curriculum.

TI  - Fossil pollen as a record of past biodiversity
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
CP  - Annual Conference of the Royal-Geographical-Society/Institute-of-British-Geographers
AB  - Quaternary pollen records may contribute uniquely to the understanding of present plant diversity. Pollen assemblages can reflect diversity at community and landscape scales but the time resolution of most studies does not match that of modern ecological studies. Because of the complicating effects of differential pollen productivity and dispersal, pollen records do not directly reflect equitability aspects of vegetation diversity. Vegetation diversity indices other than S (the total number of taxa) are therefore not appropriate for pollen assemblages. As a measure of the species richness palynological richness is biased by the lack of taxonomic precision, by a possible interference on pollen dispersal from vegetation structure and by pollen representation. The nonlinear relationship between species richness and pollen-taxa richness may be used in attempts to estimate past floristic richness from fossil pollen assemblages. Using a hypothetical example the strong effect of cover shifts in the vegetation affecting taxa with different representation (R-rel) values on observed palynological richness is demonstrated. It is suggested that estimates of relative pollen productivity should be used to guide the pollen sum on which pollen-type richness is estimated by rarefaction techniques and this approach is illustrated using a paired site study of late Holocene diversity dynamics. The need for a modern training set relating pollen-type richness to species richness, pollen productivity and vegetation structure is emphasized.

TI  - Comprehensive geriatric assessment in Swedish acute geriatric settings
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE QUALITY ASSURANCE
AB  - Purpose Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a widely used approach in geriatric care and involves multidisciplinary assessments focused on determining a frail elderly person's medical, psychological and functional capability to develop an integrated plan for treatment. The purpose of this paper is to describe and scrutinize the CGA implementation process at six acute geriatric departments in three county councils and to study the outcome by the documentation in the patient medical records, and the staff perceptions using CGA.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper describes the implementation process stages. Outcome measures were based on patient medical records reviews at baseline and follow-ups at year 1 and year 2. Staff perceptions of using CGA were gathered by a questionnaire at the second follow-up.
   Findings The implementation had not yet reached sustainability so the implementation process must continue. Results show that documentation on the different areas increased in year 1, as well as the use of standardized assessment tools. However, results from the reviews for year 2 showed some decrease. Staff considered CGA to have high value for the geriatric patient but pointed out the need for continuing education.
   Originality/value Successful strategies for this implementation were strong support from the managers, small seminars, CGA rounds, good introduction routines for new staff and the use of reminders such as pocket-sized focus cards. A high staff turnover occurred during the study, which probably had a significant negative impact on the results.

TI  - Beneath Thy Protection: Portrait of the Holy Virgin as a semantic operator
T2  - SIGN SYSTEMS STUDIES
AB  - Starting from the third century, many songs, prayers, and icons testify to the way the Virgin Mary - Mother of God - has been attributed the role of protecting the community. Examples include the Akhathist hymn traditionally dated to the siege of Constantinople (626), the Polish anthem "Bogurodzica", associated with the battle of Grunwald (1410), the icon of Czestochowa that protected Poland from the Swedish invasion (1655), and numerous others. The role of menace is embodied by different enemies: infidels, heretics, or atheists. The Virgin watches over the frontier between two cultural spaces: the inside and the outside of the semiosphere. A case study will provide insight into the function played by the Madonna at the border: the Madonna of the Rocciamelone, the highest sanctuary in Europe, founded by the crusader knight Rotharius (1358). A bronze statue of the Virgin was placed in the sanctuary in 1899. A small corpus of pastoral letters written by blessed Edoardo Rosaz, bishop of Susa (Piedmont), expresses the hope that the Virgin will protect Catholics from liberal heresy. Plastic oppositions such as top/bottom, resulting from the relationship between the Virgin and the landscape, are used to manifest abstract oppositions such as reason/passion, order/disorder, and Church/revolution. This homologation helps us understand how the Virgin, placed in upper space, embodies knowledge and cognition: she becomes a lookout, allowing a transfer of values from the semantic field of war to the religious one. The Virgin guards the border of the semiosphere, the border dividing the self from the other. Her function is the semiotization of incoming materials, transforming external non-communication into information and meaning. This article thus considers the Virgin as a semantic operator inverting the values of liberal discourse into information stored in Catholic cultural space. A mathematical model of the function played by the Virgin will be presented in the terms of quantum computing.

TI  - Analysis of vehicle-bicycle interactions at unsignalized crossings: A probabilistic approach and application
T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB  - In the last decades, bicycle usage has been increasing in many countries due to the potential environmental and health benefits. Therefore, there is a need to better understand cyclists' interactions with vehicles, and to build models and tools for evaluating multimodal transportation infrastructure with respect to cycling safety, accessibility, and other planning aspects. This paper presents a modeling framework to describe driver-cyclist interactions when they are approaching a conflicting zone. In particular, the car driver yielding behavior is modeled as a function of a number of explanatory variables. A two-level hierarchical, probabilistic framework (based on discrete choice theory) is proposed to capture the driver's yielding decision process when interacting with a cyclist. The first level models the probability of the car driver perceiving a situation with a bicycle as a potential conflict whereas the second models the probability of yielding given that a conflict has been perceived by the driver. The framework also incor porates the randomness of the location of the drivers' decision point. The methodology is applied in a case study using observations at a typical Swedish roundabout. The results show that the conflict probability is affected differently depending on the user (cyclist or driver) who arrives at the interaction zone first. The yielding probability depends on the speed of the vehicle and the proximity of the cyclist. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Novel approach of Principal Component Analysis method to assess the national energy performance via Energy Trilemma Index
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
AB  - The World Energy Council releases the Energy Trilemma Index (ETI) report annually primarily to assess the energy performance of countries worldwide. Nevertheless, the varying preferences of the dimensions in the ETI between the countries are debatable. The objective of this study is weight allocation therefore this study presents two-fold contribution to comprehensively formulate all possible preferences under the interval assessment outcomes by employing the interval decision matrix followed by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the national energy performance of top ten countries for the year 2015. Unlike the conventional methods, the significant advantage of PCA for index construction is that it does not allocate ad-hoc and subjective weights to different indicators. The obtained results were demonstrated by measurement of top ten countries energy performance based on ETI of 2015. Through the development of Energy Development Index, Norway was determined as the highest performing country among the top ten countries. This does not coincide with 2015's ETI which regarded Switzerland as the best performing country. Hence, the ranks are arguable. Further results reveals that there are considerable differences in the values of indicators among all countries. The obtained outcome is expected to aid the policy makers to understand the contribution of different indicators. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Use of biochar-based column filtration systems for greywater treatment: A systematic literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING
AB  - Biochar-based column filtration systems (BCFS) for greywater treatment have gained attention in the last decade. However, a review of the state-of-the-art on this subject has not been conducted, leaving the analysis and limitations of the available research still unexplored. This paper reviews the current literature to give insights into the technology and identify new areas of investigation. This study used a systematic review approach to evaluate the documentation relating to the technology's worldwide status, configuration, removal mechanisms, removal efficiency, and water reuse applications. In total, 28 studies were reported in 16 countries including India and Sweden as leading ones. Three filter column configurations were identified: single biochar filter, multilayer filter, and polishing step in the treatment chain. The pollutant removal efficiency of BCFS ranged between 50 and 99%. Treated greywater is reused mainly for non-potable purposes such as toilet flushing, cloth washing, and crop irrigation. Overall, this technology can be a feasible and sustainable alternative for greywater treatment and application in water-scarce regions. However, further research is needed on social perception toward potable water reuse, new feedstocks for biochar production, the scaling-up and long-term assessment, evaluation of additional water microbial indicators, and the modification of biochar to target specific water reuse purposes.

TI  - MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF WELL-BEING IN THE EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES
T2  - ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB  - Well-being is of crucial importance for both individual and society as a whole. It is therefore important to quantify, performance and progress made by certain states, regions, communities, social groups, and individuals in improving their well-being. The aim of study was to offer a new framework for multi-criteria assessment as well as international comparison of objective well-being. Well-being is a multi-dimensional phenomenon: hence the appropriate indicator system should be capable to identify the most important underlying processes influencing well-being. For our research we have established the indicator system of twelve indicators identifying various dimensions of well-being. Therefore we propose MULTIMOORA, a model which can be used for approaching the objective of societal well-being. It is applied for international comparison of the well-being in the EU Member States. Consequently, it was revealed that Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, France, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, and Belgium have achieved the highest level of well-being as of 2009. At the other end of spectrum, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, and Romania can be considered as those peculiar with relatively lowest well-being.

TI  - The role of demand-side incentives and charging infrastructure on plug-in electric vehicle adoption: analysis of US States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - In the US, over 400 state and local incentives have been issued to increase the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) since 2008. This article quantifies the influence of key incentives and enabling factors like charging infrastructure and receptive demographics on PEV adoption. The study focuses on three central questions. First, do consumers respond to certain types of state level vehicle purchase incentives? Second, does the density of public charging infrastructure increase PEV purchases? Finally, does the impact of various factors differ for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV) and vehicle attributes within each category? Based on a regression of vehicle purchase data from 2008-2016, we found that tax incentives and charging infrastructure significantly influence per capita PEV purchases. Within tax incentives, rebates are generally more effective than tax credits. BEV purchases are more affected by tax incentives than PHEVs. The correlation of public charging and vehicle purchases increases with the battery-only driving range of a PHEV, while decreasing with increasing driving range of BEVs. Results indicate that early investments in charging infrastructure, particularly along highways; tax incentives targeting affordable BEVs and PHEVs with higher battery only range, and better reflection of the environmental cost of owning gasoline vehicles are likely to increase PEV adoption in the US.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in foraging of breeding red-throated divers
T2  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Differing environmental conditions can have profound effects on many behaviours in animals, especially where species have large geographic ranges. Seasonal changes or progression through life history stages impose differential constraints, leading to changes in behaviours. Furthermore, species which show flexibility in behaviours, may have a higher capacity to adapt to anthropogenic-induced changes to their environment. The red-throated diver (RTD) is an aquatic bird, that is able to forage in both freshwater and marine environments, though little else is known about its behaviours and its capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions. Here, we use time-depth recorders and saltwater immersion loggers to examine the foraging behaviour of RTDs from three regions across northwest Europe. We found that in the breeding season, birds from two regions (Iceland and Scotland) foraged in the marine environment, while birds from Finland, foraged predominantly in freshwater. Most of the differences in diving characteristics were at least partly explained by differences in foraging habitat. Additionally, while time spent foraging did not change through the breeding season, dives generally became more pelagic and less benthic over the season, suggesting RTDs either switched prey or followed vertical prey movements, rather than increasing foraging effort. There was a preference for foraging in daylight over crepuscular hours, with a stronger effect at two of the three sites. Overall, we provide the first investigation of RTD foraging and diving behaviour from multiple geographic regions and demonstrate variation in foraging strategies in this generalist aquatic predator, most likely due to differences in their local environment.

TI  - Protecting prey by deceiving predators: A field experiment testing chemical camouflage and conditioned food aversion
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Complicated conservation problems may arise if predator numbers increase beyond their natural boundaries due to anthropogenic influence. For example, dramatic declines in ground-nesting birds are linked to increased nest predation by alien or human-subsidized mammals. While predator control can be temporarily effective, it is often laborious and carries ethical issues. Thus, we need alternative, non-lethal methods for reducing predator impact on their prey. We performed a landscape-scale experiment to study whether two non-lethal methods could protect ground-nesting waterfowl from nests predation. We spread either non-rewarding waterfowl odour (chemical camouflage) or eggs containing an aversive agent (conditioned food aversion) in the surroundings of study wetlands located in southern Finland. Predation of artificial waterfowl nests by red foxes decreased in sites with chemical camouflage, while there was no effect on predation by invasive raccoon dogs. Food aversion created less obvious effects than the chemical camouflage, but both methods indicated potential for reducing nest predation. Based on wildlife-camera data mesopredator observations did not, however, decrease near treatment wetlands. This suggests that treatments did not reduce predator activity, but affected foraging behaviour of predators and reduced their ability to find the nests. We conclude that managers considering non-lethal methods should carefully consider the effectiveness of different methods and potential species-specific responses. Nevertheless, our study support calls for wider use of non-lethal methods in reducing predator impacts on prey. These methods offer ethical and potentially effective approaches which keep native predator fauna intact, but create protection for vulnerable prey.

TI  - Assessment of Current Blue Energy Technologies and Their Potential Applications on Romanian Water Resources
T2  - WATER
AB  - This study offers a comprehensive analysis of unconventional renewable and sustainable energy production options by tapping into the energy associated with the natural tendency to cancel salinity gradients that occur when salt water and fresh water come into contact. Furthermore, this paper assesses the potential for generating blue energy in Romania by examining historical data on flow rates from relevant fresh water sources, such as the Danube River, and the salt loading of potential receiving water bodies, including salt lakes, and the Black Sea. In addition, this study briefly references pilot-level technologies for blue energy production in other countries, including Norway, Japan, and the European Union. Based on literature data, this paper highlights the most important technological methods with applicative potential for harnessing energy from salinity gradients. The performances and limitations of these methods have been presented, acknowledging that despite recent years of advancements in materials and technologies, large-scale implementation and commercialization efforts are still limited. The analyzed data reveals that Romania possesses substantial potential blue energy resources for both large capacity installations, such as the Danube River-Black Sea with a potential achievable capacity of about 50 MW, as well as smaller capacity devices situated around saline lakes and salt deposits. This study concludes that Romania has a unique opportunity to capitalize on its vast blue energy potential and drive sustainable energy development.

TI  - Cumulative social effect assessment framework to evaluate the accumulation of social sustainability benefits of regional bioenergy value chains
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB  - The article presents a cumulative social effects assessment framework-based methodology. The devised methodology applies a hierarchy of social sustainability indicators and core social components. The core social components are individual, community and societal impacts and, within these, nine key social sustainability indicators are assessed. This methodology was tested on a case study covering a regional energy value chain in the Lahti region in Finland. The evaluation of the nine key indicators, and the quantification of their impacts along the regional energy production value chain was demonstrated for the region. The results indicate that locally sourced energy production is a socially sustainable solution that ensures reliable and affordable energy to local communities. It was noted that the social benefits of local value chains have great potential for accumulation. The results also indicate that use of the cumulative social effects assessment framework provides a deeper understanding of a region's social sustainability matters and identifies best practices available. It was suggested that the framework can be used by regional stakeholders as a screening tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Innovative products and services for sustainable societal development: Current reality, future potential and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This special volume originates from the International Conference on Innovation and Management held at University of Vaasa in Finland in 2014. Talks with the key note speaker and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Cleaner Production led to an idea to develop a special volume about innovative products and services according to the themes of the conference. Thus, the purpose of this special volume is to explore different viewpoints of how innovative products and services may support sustainable societal development. There are five thematic areas with papers that describe new advancements in different industries and organizations. The included papers cover relevant theoretical background and present case studies and practical results. This special volume shows that great progresses are being made in different thematic areas but also that there are so much more waiting to be done for sustainable societal development. This volume indicates that cross-disciplinary approach is truly needed to achieve societal sustainable development. This requires people to change their mindsets and genuinely co-operate towards better future. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Associational Interactions Between Urban Trees: Are Native Neighbors Better Than Non-Natives?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - This project investigated associational interactions (associational resistance or susceptibility) between native and non-native trees commonly found in urban landscapes in the southeastern United States. Non-native plants offer limited ecological services because few native herbivore species are capable of feeding on them. In a 2-yr field study, abundance and species richness of caterpillars, plant damage, and herbivore natural enemies were evaluated in plots where a native red maple (Acer rubrum L. [Sapindales: Aceraceae]) was planted singly (no neighbors) or interplanted with either non-native non-congeneric crepe myrtles (Lagerstroemia indica L. [Myrtales: Lythraceae]), non-native congeneric Norway maples (Acer platanoides L. [Sapindales: Aceraceae]), or other red maples. Dryocampa rubicunda Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) accounted for most of the damage and caterpillar abundance.There were few significant differences between treatment groups in the establishment year of 2014, but in 2015 there was greater tree defoliation, caterpillar abundance, and caterpillar species richness when red maples were surrounded by crepe myrtles. We describe this as a biological fence effect in which the presence of crepe myrtle causes caterpillars to accumulate on the focal red maples over multiple generations. Red maples interplanted with Norway maple neighbors hosted an intermediate abundance and species richness of caterpillars compared to red maples interplanted with crepe myrtles and those with other red maples, indicating a spillover of herbivores to the related maple. No significant trends in insect natural enemy abundance or diversity between treatment groups were detected. These results highlight the necessity of considering plant associational interactions in context of species origin to alleviate pest outbreaks and develop sustainable landscape designs.

TI  - SITUATION AND PERSPECTIVES FOR SOLAR ENERGY IN EUROPE AND A COMPARISON WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY, AFTER FUKUSHIMA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB  - Availability of secure, sustainable and competitive sources of energy is essential to economic growth, prosperity and quality of life in Europe. In view of the expected growth in demand for energy, of the increasing evidence of the climate change and the aim to ensure the security of energy supply in Europe, further reflections on nuclear and solar energy as best potential energy sources in the Europe energy mix is needed. A renewed interest in Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) is rapidly growing worldwide. Indeed, new commercial applications for electricity production are starting right now, 20 years after the deployment of the first 354 MW e of the so called "SEGS" plants in the Mojave desert, still operating since the early '80s. Indeed a large amount of energy and water desalination needs in the so called EU-MENA region.(Europe-Middle East-North Africa) therefore comprising large areas around the Mediterranean coasts - could be actually satisfied using CSP technologies. Nuclear energy, supplying over 31 per cent of electricity demand, plays a key role in the EU's generation structure. It has the potential to meet the ever-increasing demand for electricity, as well as contribute to the Community's energy independence and security of supplies. Despite many grown countries like France, Bulgaria, and Finland, there are some countries without nuclear power like Denmark, Portugal, Poland, Ireland, Austria, Greece, Italy or phased-out countries like Germany, which is set to change the power generation mix towards more renewable energy sources. Consequences of the Fukushima disaster are to be felt in the future. The market growth of solar thermal systems and photovoltaics in Europe depends on the policy of the governments towards the use of solar energy systems, on the sensitivity of the people concerning environment and on the improvement of the technology combined with price reduction of solar systems. Considering the targets of EU for renewable in the 20-20-20 programme, solar energy systems can play a significant role in many countries.

TI  - Multi-scale feedbacks between tree regeneration traits and herbivore behavior explain the structure of pasture-woodland mosaics
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
AB  - The pasture-woodlands of Central Europe are low-intensity grazing systems in which the structural richness of dynamic forest-grassland mosaics is causal for their high biodiversity. Distinct mosaic patterns in Picea abies- and Fagus sylvatica-dominated pasture-woodlands in the Swiss Jura Mountains suggest a strong influence of tree species regeneration ecology on landscape structural properties. At the landscape scale, however, cause-effect relationships are complicated by habitat selectivity of livestock.
   We asked which tree species regeneration traits and what kind of feedbacks among local-scale vegetation dynamics and landscape-scale herbivore behavior are causal for the contrasted landscape structural characteristics of Picea- and Fagus-dominated pasture-woodlands.
   We performed simulation experiments of mosaic pattern formation in both pasture-woodland types. The regeneration traits, namely dispersal distance, resistance to browsing and tolerance to shade, and the rules for habitat selection of cattle were modified and the corresponding shifts in landscape structure were analyzed.
   Dispersal distance showed a significant, but only local, effect promoting forest fringe formation. Saplings' resistance to browsing mainly determined overall tree cover, but did not influence landscape structure. At the landscape scale, both shade tolerance of saplings and selective habitat use by cattle were responsible for forest-grassland segregation: high shade tolerance triggered segregation, whereas non-selective habitat use hindered it.
   Existing local-scale theory on pasture-woodland dynamics is complemented by an herbivore-vegetation feedback among spatial scales. In low-intensity pastures, where large herbivores are preferentially "grazers" and trees form dense canopies, an intrinsic trend towards forest-grassland segregation at the expense of forest-grassland ecotones is predicted.

TI  - Experimental characterisation of the hydrocarbon sealing efficiency of cap rocks
T2  - MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY
AB  - Jurassic shares and mudrocks from the Haltenbanken area offshore Norway and red claystones from Carboniferous and Permian intervals of Northern Germany were used in a study of the hydrocarbon sealing efficiency of elastic sediments. The investigations comprised geochemical and mineralogical analysis of the pelitic rocks, petrophysical characterisation by mercury porosimetry and specific surface area measurements, and laboratory experiments to assess the transport properties with respect to both molecular transport (diffusion) and volume flow (Darcy flow). Effective diffusion coefficients of methane in the water-saturated rock samples at 150 degrees C lay between 1.4 x 10(-11) and 4.5 x 10-(10)m(2)/s and showed a distinct correlation with TOC content. Permeability coefficients, measured by means of a steady-state method, ranged from <1 nDarcy (<10(-21)m(2)) for Permian (Rotliegend) and Carboniferous red claystones up to 4.3 mu Darcy (4.3 x 10(-18) m(2)) for a bioturbated Jurassic siltstone.
   The experimental data were used to calculate maximum sustainable gas and petroleum column heights, hydrocarbon leakage rates by pressure-driven volume flow (Darcy flow), and diffusive gas losses for simple, hypothetical scenarios. Computed maximum gas column heights range from 20 m up to >2000 m. Hydrocarbon column heights calculated on the basis of a rich condensate lay between 3 and 340 m. Depending on temperature, pressure, reservoir geometry and seal thickness, diffusive losses can be expected to require tens of millions of years to significantly affect the contents of commercial size natural gas reservoirs.

TI  - Social Feedback Loop in the Organic Food Purchase Decision-Making Process
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - To ensure the food industry continues to grow, it is vital to properly understand the factors that impact the purchasing of organic food. Research offers ambiguous findings about what drives consumers to decide to purchase food labeled as organic. This study advances the current theories on organic food-purchasing behavior, which overlook the importance of the two-way interaction of social norms and individual behavior, suggesting that the role of social norms may have been simplified. We suggest the causal processes associated with organic food decision-making involve the social feedback loop, a powerful force that takes the current state into the phase of transition. Positive feedback is key to maintaining and developing the sustainable behavior of the society, where an initial change in consumer behavior to purchase organic food is magnified when that change resounds through social norms. This is especially pronounced in Norway and Slovenia, where marketers can make more cost- and time-efficient use of persuasive messages and requests. In addition, we provide a comprehensive delineation of organic food purchase decision-making of close to 14,000 individuals from 15 countries that includes key psychosocial antecedents, along with Schwartz's values, attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. Using a mixed-methods approach (i.e., statistical matching, spatial econometrics, structural equation modeling), the present paper thus intends to add to the understanding of environmentally friendly purchase behavior beyond unidirectional and single-theory relationships.

TI  - Mortality in the Eurasian lynx population in Croatia over the course of 40 years
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - The combination of intensive persecution, habitat loss and prey deficiency led to the extinction of Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in the Dinaric Mountains at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1973, the population was re-established by reintroducing animals from the Slovakian Carpathian Mountains into Slovenia, from where the animals spread into Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the end of the 20th century the reintroduced population has been decreasing, leading us to investigate the principal causes of mortality. Understanding the causes of the declining lynx population in Croatia and elsewhere is important not only in its own right but also because few studies have examined how large carnivore populations have fared under different management regimes. After reintroduction, the first dead lynx was recorded in Croatia in 1978, and from that year until 2013 a total of 232 deaths were recorded. Annual mortality during this period averaged 6.4 deaths per year, ranging from 0 to 17. The number of dead lynxes found every year in the period before the legal protection (1978-1998) was significantly higher than the number of dead animals found in the period after the legal protection (1998-2013). The vast majority of deaths were human-related (92.7%), with only 2.1% not human-related; while the cause of the remaining 5.2% of deaths was undetermined. Shooting was the most dominant cause of death (73.7%), with significantly more males being killed by shooting than females, and significantly more animals shot before the legal protection. Between 1978 and 1998, the year when the lynx became legally protected in Croatia, 10 deaths due to poaching were recorded, accounting for 5% of all deaths in that period and an average of 0.48 poaching cases per year. During 1999-2013, 18 poaching deaths occurred, accounting for 60% of all deaths in that period and an average of 1.2 poaching cases per year. Our findings suggest that the synergy of human-induced mortality, concomitant reduction in genetic variation and possibly prey deficiency may be the principal factors behind the decline in the reintroduced lynx population in Croatia since the end of the 20th century.

TI  - Multiplexing efficiency of environmental taxes in ensuring environmental, energy, and economic security
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - This paper assesses the multiplexing efficiency of environmental taxes in ensuring environmental, energy, and economic security which is an integral part of sustainability in six European countries that are leaders in the Environmental Performance Index. This study aims to confirm the hypothesis that environmental taxes and payments could simultaneously affect changes in important environmental, energy, and economic security as well as sustainability parameters. Not all the previously selected taxes, which affect the parameters of all three areas of environmental, energy, and economic sustainability and security can ensure their simultaneous growth. Calculations made for the period 1994-2019 showed that in the system of environmental taxation of Denmark, five environmental taxes and fees provide an increase in the integrated level of environmental, economic, and energy security and sustainability; in Belgium, two environmental taxes are characterized by multiplex efficiency; in France, seven environmental taxes and payments; in Austria, four; in Finland, one; and in the UK, four. The paper's findings could create the basis for improving environmental taxation systems in the countries to increase comprehensive national security growth and ensure sustainable development path of the countries.

TI  - Circular economy practices as a tool for sustainable development in the context of renewable energy: What are the opportunities for the EU?
T2  - OECONOMIA COPERNICANA
AB  - Research background: In order to tackle climate change and ensure Paris agreements are met, countries are forced to look for alternative ways of producing, consuming, and wasting and adopt a circular economy. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions becomes one of the key elements. The demand for electricity is increasing, and most greenhouse gas emissions derive from the energy sector. Because of that, it is crucial to ensure the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Renewable energy, as a part of the circular economy, also contributes to sustainable development. Only the efficient implementation of circular economy and renewable energy practices can ensure that sustainable development goals are achieved. Copyright (c) Instytut Badan Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland) Purpose of the article: The study aims at determining the efficiency of European Union coun-tries implementing circular economy practices through renewable energy to attain SDGs. The study focuses on the significance of renewable energy as a tool for the circular economy to achieve sustainable development and highlights the progress achieved in SDG through re-newable energy in the EU. Methods: For efficiency assessment of the circular economy represented by the renewable energy indicators, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was performed. Findings & value added: This study presents a relation analysis of the circular economy and renewable energy and the importance of efficiency in achieving SDGs through a circular economy. The study helps to understand the circular economy represented by renewable energy and how it transforms into sustainable development and contributes to necessary actions needed for countries to improve. Based on the results, Sweden, Luxembourg, Ireland, Latvia, Estonia, Malta, the Netherlands and Bulgaria are considered the most efficient coun-tries, while Austria is the least efficient. Unused solar and wind power potential can slow down sustainable development; however, EU programs and renewable energy strategies help countries move towards clean energy and ensure efficient implementation of sustainable development goals.

TI  - Trends, composition, and sources of carbonaceous aerosol at the Birkenes Observatory, northern Europe, 2001-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB  - We present 18 years (2001-2018) of aerosol measurements, including organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), organic tracers (levoglucosan, arabitol, mannitol, tre-halose, glucose, and 2-methyltetrols), trace elements, and ions, at the Birkenes Observatory (southern Norway) - a site representative of the northern European region. The OC/EC (2001-2018) and the levoglucosan (2008-2018) time series are the longest in Europe, with OC/EC available for the PM10, PM2.5 (fine), and PM10-2.5 (coarse) size fractions, providing the opportunity for a nearly 2-decade-long assessment. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), we identify seven carbonaceous aerosol sources at Birkenes: mineral-dust-dominated aerosol (MIN), traffic/industry-like aerosol (TRA/IND), short-range-transported biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOAsRT), primary biological aerosol particles (PBAP), biomass burning aerosol (BB), ammonium-nitrate-dominated aerosol (NH4NO3), and (one low carbon fraction) sea salt aerosol (SS).
   We observed significant (p < 0.05), large decreases in EC in PM10 (-3.9 % yr(-1)) and PM2.5 (-4.2 % yr(-1)) and a smaller decline in levoglucosan (-2.8 % yr(-1)), suggesting that OC/EC from traffic and industry is decreasing, whereas the abatement of OC/EC from biomass burning has been slightly less successful. EC abatement with respect to anthropogenic sources is further supported by decreasing EC fractions in PM2.5 (-3.9 % yr( -1)) and PM10 (4.5 % yr(-1)). PMF apportioned 72 % of EC to fossil fuel sources; this was further supported by PMF applied to absorption photometer data, which yielded a two-factor solution with a low aerosol Angstrom exponent (AAE = 0.93) fraction, assumed to be equivalent black carbon from fossil fuel combustion (eBC(FF)), contributing 78 % to eBC mass. The higher AAE fraction (AAE = 2.04) is likely eBC from BB (eBC(BB)). Source-receptor model calculations (FLEXPART) showed that continental Europe and western Russia were the main source regions of both elevated eBCBB and eBCPF.
   Dominating biogenic sources explain why there was no downward trend for OC. A relative increase in the OC fraction in PM2.5 (+3.2 % yr(-1)) and PM10 (+2.4 % yr(-1)) underscores the importance of biogenic sources at Birkenes BSOA and PBAP), which were higher in the vegetative season and dominated both fine (53 %) and coarse (78 %) OC. Furthermore, 77 %-91 % of OC in PM2.5, PM10-2.5, and PM10 was attributed to biogenic sources in summer vs. 22 %-37 % in winter. The coarse fraction had the highest share of biogenic sources regardless of season and was dominated by PBAP, except in winter.
   Our results show a shift in the aerosol composition at Birkenes and, thus, also in the relative source contributions. The need for diverse offline and online carbonaceous aerosol speciation to understand carbonaceous aerosol sources, including their seasonal, annual, and long-term variability, has been demonstrated.

TI  - Pay-offs and penalties of competing migratory schedules
T2  - OIKOS
CP  - Symposium on Ecology of Long-Distance Movements
AB  - We relate variation in the timing of arrival by migrating birds breeding at northerly latitudes to individual differences in the prior accumulation of energy stores. Balancing starvation risks early in the season against the almost universal declining trend in reproductive prospects with advancing date is seen as an individual decision with fitness consequences. We review three studies implicating events at the staging sites or in winter in setting the individual migratory schedule. Climate change influences the timetable of a pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) population breeding in The Netherlands and wintering in West Africa, followed since 1960. Mean air temperature in the period mid April-mid May (arrival and laying) increased and laying date advanced by 10 days. Still, in recent years most birds did not lay early enough to maximise fitness (determined by recruitment and parental survival) whereas many parents achieved this goal in 1980-1985. As the flycatchers have not started to arrive earlier, some ecological constraint further upstream is postulated (possibly the hurdle of the crossing of Sahara and Mediterranean). The ability to follow individual migrants provides a second avenue to assess the fitness implications of migratory schedules. Thus, brightly coloured male bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) captured in the Dutch Wadden Sea (the intermediate staging site linking a West African wintering area with breeding sites in arctic Russia) and traced with miniature radio-transmitters did not depart early. The 'best' males (with bright breeding plumage) were picked up by the listening stations in Sweden 650 km further along the migratory route ten days later than the paler individuals. If early arrival confers the competitive advantage of prior occupancy but increases mortality, the 'best' males may be able to afford arriving later and thus avoid some of the survival costs. Return rate of the 'bright' males to the staging site in later seasons was indeed higher than for the 'pale', early males. Intensive observation of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) fitted with coded neck-collars substantiate the tight relationship between energy stores (fat) accumulated up to final departure from the final staging site (Vesteralen, N. Norway) en route to the nesting grounds (Spitsbergen) and subsequent success. The breeding outcome of individual parents (accompanied by juveniles or not) could be related to observations of body condition before departure (visual 'abdominal profile index'). Recently, perceived conflicts with agriculture have resulted in widespread harassment by humans. The geese have: drastically shortened their stay on the Vesteralen, fail to achieve the body condition usual a decade ago and reproductive output has fallen. Although the geese are currently pioneering new staging sites, an adequate alternative has not materialised, underlining the critical role of the final take-off site.

TI  - Dispersal patterns in a harvested willow ptarmigan population
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Harvest management requires knowledge of whether the harvest is sustainable as a result of compensatory mechanisms, such as dispersal. The effect of recreational harvesting on dispersal patterns in willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus was assessed over four hunting seasons in central Norway.
   2. A two-parameter Weibull model was fitted to the observed absolute dispersal distance data using maximum likelihood methods. Estimates of the scale and shape parameters for the dispersal probability distribution were calculated, describing the distribution of observed willow ptarmigan dispersal distances. From the parameter estimates of the dispersal model we estimated the standard deviation of the dispersal displacement relevant for population genetic and spatial population dynamic models.
   3. The effect of harvesting on dispersal patterns was examined by testing for differences in the scale and shape parameters of dispersal distance distributions in areas with and without harvest. No effect of harvesting was found, either in adults or juveniles.
   4. Breeding dispersal of adult birds was estimated as a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 402 m and shape parameter b = 2.01, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation of sigma = 284 m. The dispersal probability distribution of adults was not significantly different from a bivariate normal distribution.
   5. Natal dispersal had a dispersal probability distribution with scale parameter a = 4206 m and shape parameter b = 1.16, corresponding to a dispersal standard deviation sigma = 3728 m. The dispersal probability distribution of juveniles was not significantly different from an exponential distribution.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Reduction of the population density of willow ptarmigan through harvesting at moderate densities does not seem to affect the dispersal distances. Thus, if there is little or no difference in the dispersal probability distribution in harvested and non-harvested areas there will be only weak or no compensation for the harvest, given that natural mortality and reproduction is the same in both areas. Thus, erroneously assuming compensation of harvest by immigration into a local population can lead to overharvest.

TI  - Understanding long-term thinking as a management strategy to support sustainable quality development: perspectives from education
T2  - TQM JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore the concept of long-term thinking in a non-business context to gain deeper insights into bridging the gap between the theory of long-term thinking and its application as a management strategy.
   Design/methodology/approach - To explore the concept of long-thinking further in a non-business setting, a grounded theory study was conducted with preschool leaders in a municipality in Sweden to examine how the leaders describe, define and apply the concept of long-term thinking in their schools. Interviews with school leaders, both written and oral, were used for data collection.
   Findings - This study illustrates that the concept of long-term thinking can be twofold. First, the description can be as an anchor that reflects a mission. Second, the description can be a steering mechanism that guides decision-making. The findings also reinforce the importance of organisations developing an organisational culture that connect their vision and goals with the values and needs of their customers.
   Research limitations/implications - This study was carried out in a single organisation and shows a snapshot of the organisation's status at the time the data were collected. Therefore, the findings are not generalisable to all organisational settings; rather the findings may be transferable to other settings.
   Practical implications - The results can be used to help identify areas where preschools in a municipal context can engage with sustainable quality development in order to build systems that support work with quality in a more structured way.
   Originality/value - Long-term thinking is seen, within both theory and organisations, as necessary to achieve success in terms of sustainable development and quality, and this study contributes with knowledge about the current gap between theories of long-term thinking and practice in organisations.

TI  - Direct climate change impacts on growth and drought risk in blue gum (<i>Eucalyptus globulus</i>) plantations in Australia
T2  - AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY
AB  - Australia's climate is changing and Australia's forests have been identified as vulnerable to climate change impacts. The process-based model CABALA, an ensemble of global circulation models, and a range of scenarios on plant response to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and site conditions, were used to predict the direct effects of climate change on the productivity and mortality risks for Australia's blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) plantation estate. The modelling showed considerable uncertainty about future outcomes across large parts of the estate, with best-case and worst-case scenarios varying from decreased to increased production. In some areas we can be confident of future outcomes. Nevertheless, it is clear that, across the whole estate, appropriate management can reduce risk and ensure that we are able to capitalise on potential beneficial aspects of climate change. Under most future scenarios, without adaptation, the drier parts of the plantation estate are at risk. However, in all but the eastern areas of Western Australia, and at the driest margins of the estate in South Australia and Victoria, adaptation options can reduce risk and ensure productivity. Other areas currently at the cold margins of the estate, notably the highlands of Victoria and across Tasmania, appear to increase in productivity under most future scenarios. Even in those areas where productivity may potentially increase, experience suggests that pests and diseases may pose a risk. If we are to benefit from any aspect of climate change, then pursuit of best-practice sustainable forest management is critical. The greatest source of uncertainty in forecasts is associated with how photosynthesis in field-grown trees will respond to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (eCO(2)). Regional differences in global circulation model forecasts are important, particularly in Western Australia, where the extent of future rainfall decline significantly impacts predictions. Local site factors, exemplified in this study by soil depth, will play an important role in modulating climate change impacts, particularly through their role in constraining responses to eCO(2).

TI  - Surface pollen spectra from Shennongjia Mountains, central China: An interpretation aid to Quaternary pollen deposits
T2  - REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB  - As an initial step to aid Quaternary pollen interpretation, we investigated modern pollen deposits from both moss polsters within the forests and surface sediments from an open swamp (Dajiuhu swamp) in the Shennongjia Mountains, central China. Pollen spectra from the moss polsters show similar patterns to local vegetation zones following an elevation gradient Such pollen spectra reflect more local vegetation landscape than regional one. However, the pollen spectra from the Dajiuhu swamp (especially in the center area) reflect regional vegetation with more deciduous than evergreen broadleaf trees. The pollen ratio of DIE (deciduous/evergreen tree pollen) is developed and its variations in different forest zones show a rising trend with increasing elevation, which gives an alternative to interpret palaeoelevation and/or temperature changes based on Quaternary pollen in monsoon climate controlled areas. The quantitative distribution of key pollen taxa and their source areas are also discussed in this paper. Our study contributes robust bases for palaeoecological interpretation in reconstructing past vegetation and climate changes using Quaternary pollen data in Shennongjia Mountains, central China.

TI  - Turning deteriorated paved roads back into gravel roads -: Sheer lunacy or sustainable maintenance policy?
T2  - EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOW-VOLUME ROADS 2003, VOLS 1 AND 2: PLANNING AND ADMINISTRATION; ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT; DESIGN; MATERIALS, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE; OPERATIONS AND SAFETY
CP  - 8th International Conference on Low-Volume Roads
AB  - In the late 1980s, many Finnish low-volume gravel roads were paved. This option was reasonable at that time because the price of bitumen was exceptionally low. No heavy structural rehabilitation was carried out on these roads before paving. It was assumed that these cheap and light pavements would last some 5 years. Now many of those roads have reached 10 to 15 years in age, still without any proper reconstruction, and are becoming increasingly deteriorated. For almost a decade now, the Finnish government has been reducing its spending on public roads. Maintenance and repair efforts have been concentrated on the main road network, and the minor network has deteriorated more and more. Calculations show that from the road agency's point of view, upkeep of gravel roads is economically feasible compared with maintaining paved roads that are in poor condition. Therefore, road authorities have converted some of these paved low-volume roads back to gravel roads. In 2001, the Mime, Turku, and Uusimaa road districts agreed on common principles for these actions. Furthermore, they described minimum requirements for each case in which a paved road in poor condition was turned into a gravel road. Public opposition and political resistance were quite strong before these actions, since the gravel roads are seen as a decline of service level.. People living along the road, however, generally admit that new gravel roads are more comfortable to drive on throughout the year than old deteriorated pavements. The road agency still has to focus on problems such as dust.

TI  - The <i>Halomonhystera disjuncta</i> population is homogeneous across the Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barents Sea) but is genetically differentiated from its shallow-water relatives
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGICAL SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTIONARY RESEARCH
AB  - The deep sea has a high biodiversity and a characteristic bathyal fauna. Earlier evidence suggested that at least some shallow-water species invaded the ecosystem followed by radiation leading to endemic deep-sea lineages with a genetic and/or morphological similarity to their shallow-water counterparts. The nematode Halomonhystera disjuncta has been reported from shallow-water habitats and the deep sea [Hakon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV)], but the morphological features and the phylogenetic relationships between deep-sea and shallow-water representatives remain largely unknown. Furthermore, nothing is known about the genetic structure of the H. disjuncta population within the HMMV. This study is the first integrative approach in which the morphological and phylogenetic relationships between a deep-sea and shallow-water free-living nematode species are investigated. To elucidate the phylogenetic relationships, we analysed the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI) and three nuclear ribosomal genes (Internal Transcribed Spacer region, 18S and the D2D3 region of 28S). Our results show that deep-sea nematodes comprise an endemic lineage compared to the shallow-water representatives with different morphometric features. COI genetic divergence between the deep-sea and shallow-water specimens ranges between 19.1% and 25.2%. Taking these findings into account, we conclude that the deep-sea form is a new species. AMOVA revealed no genetic structure across the HMMV, suggesting that nematodes are able to disperse efficiently in the mud volcano.

TI  - Technological and legislative status point of stationary energy storages in the EU
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - European renewable generation has been supported through several policy instruments in the last decades, and this has caused a significant growth of the renewable energy sector, spurred by the ambitious climate and energy policy targets.
   Despite this impetuous growth, the electricity infrastructure is not yet ready to accept increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources (RES) generation, and this is causing grid balance challenges, due to the inherently variable nature of the PV and wind energy. In order to overcome this issue, allowing higher shares of renewable generation in the energy sector, energy storage (ES) systems are becoming increasingly competitive in the global energy landscape, thanks to the positive momentum in research and innovation, making European energy supply more secure, sustainable and affordable. Despite the unarguable benefits, storage technologies still see significant needs for more education among stakeholders, since they are not familiar with technology's benefits and management solutions. In order to fill this gap, this study provides an overview of storage technologies for stationary applications in the EU (plus Bosnia-Erzegovina, Norway and Switzerland), addressing the main trends in European policy legislation, also identifying advantages and barriers for their implementation. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the US Department of Energy (DOE) storage database, the main trends in ES installations within the EU markets are identified, with reference to storage technologies. The analysis carried out in this work could help stakeholders to assess the European storage market evolution in the stationary sector, identifying the main drivers and barriers for each storage technology.

TI  - Natural gas and climate finance
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Should energy projects to extend the use of natural gas be considered for funding under public climate finance commitments? This article provides an overview of evidence for and against climate finance for natural gas projects. The argument focuses on a case study, the UK's International Climate Fund (ICF). This synthesis concludes that gas-related projects will rarely be eligible for funding under public climate finance, save a few exceptions in which they provide energy access to households directly. Although gas power plants have generally lower emissions than those which use other fossil fuels such as coal, their impact will depend on the material constraints to calculate emissions reductions, the context of implementation, and the political economy of the target country. Three case studies demonstrate that energy access projects need to be understood as providing a whole range of sustainable benefits, from improving local health to reducing emissions. Overall, gas-related projects are complex interventions that require context-specific knowledge of both the effects of technology and the possible business models that can work in context.
   POLICY RELEVANCE
   This article investigates whether projects related to natural gas constitute an appropriate use of public climate finance, with a particular focus on the UK's International Climate Fund. Policy makers in developed countries will decide in the coming years how to use public climate finance; that is, the fraction of overseas development assistance (ODA) for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In the UK, for example, the ICF is the most important instrument to provide climate finance for developing countries. In 2013, the UK set out a clear position 'to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances.' This ban has fostered debate about whether similar positions should follow for other fossil fuels such as natural gas, specifically in the context of ICF funding. Similar debates are taking place in other countries such as Germany and Norway, and are informing the implementation of international facilities such as the Green Climate Fund.

TI  - BARK-PEELING, FOOD STRESS AND TREE SPIRITS - THE USE OF PINE INNER BARK FOR FOOD IN SCANDINAVIA AND NORTH AMERICA
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY
AB  - The Sami people of northern Scandinavia and many indigenous peoples of North America have used pine (Pinus spp.) inner bark for food, medicine and other purposes. This study compares bark-peeling and subsequent uses of pine inner bark in Scandinavia and western North America, focusing on traditional practices. Pine inner bark contains substances - mainly carbohydrates, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and minerals - that were important complements to the protein-rich food of the indigenous peoples living in northern regions of both continents. The climate in these regions was (and is) sharply seasonal, and the stored carbohydrates in pine inner bark were particularly important during late winter. On both continents, a strip of live cambium was commonly left to show respect to the tree and the tree spirits and to ensure the tree's survival. The uses of pine inner bark and associated traditions have long time depths, and trees with old, or even ancient, bark-peeling scars are still common in old-growth pine forests on both continents. We conclude that forests with such trees should be regarded as relicts of traditional landscapes and protected for their cultural historical value.

TI  - A phase-based perspective on urban demand responsive transport: A case study of Viavan pilot in Helsinki Capital Region
T2  - CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY
AB  - Despite decade-long efforts, real-time demand-responsive transport (DRT) services are still struggling to be a part of sustainable urban mobility systems. Among various approaches to understand the changing nature of DRT service, a longitudinal perspective has been found very effective. This study presents the case of an urban DRT pilot operated by Viavan in the Helsinki Capital Region, Finland. Research develops and implements a framework for longitudinal analysis, while drawing from the multi-level perspective (MLP) on sustainability transitions. DRT trip data is used to understand the service trajectory longitudinally over specific phases, delineated through key changes in service design. In addition, the framework uses three-level analysis of service parameters, to provide in-depth analysis in studying inter-phase and intra-phase changes. Case study approach also provides a comprehensive service area background and service implementation context to support the analysis. Results shows the complementary role of the urban DRT to fixed public transport services and points out certain challenges for efficient coordination. In addition, the analysis points towards a set of regime factors that should be considered for further understanding of the service trajectory. In practice, special emphasis should be paid on developing the mobility ecosystem and managerial practices. Future DRT case studies should develop additional frameworks, indicators and methods by drawing from sustainability transitions theory, to further understand service trajectories over time.

TI  - A critical review on geochemical and geological aspects of fluoride belts, fluorosis and natural materials and other sources for alternatives to fluoride exposure
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Fluorosis is an endemic disease that is now a global challenge. In this review paper we have classified and described the global fluoride belts (GFB) geologically and geographically connecting different countries. A proper map of the global fluoride belts showing the inland connections between each belt is presented. Several natural factors like the rock type, soil, tectonics, hydrogeology and climate of a terrain which are majorly responsible for engrafting higher fluoride in drinking water are described. A detailed uniform description of each belts with respect to geology, geochemistry are discussed. The minor factors like altitude, phosphate mining etc. on fluorosis are also discussed including countries like Canada, Norway etc. which are potentially affected by fluorosis. The correlation of different ions like Cl-, Ca2+, etc; pH, electrical conductivity, TDS etc are compared and reviewed in detailed with respect to different GFB. The genesis and sources of fluoride contamination are also supported by different isotopic evidences. In this article, the in situ methods involving natural minerals and materials which can adsorb fluoride effectively and are being used globally are exhaustively assessed. The methods which are highly sustainable with minimum waste generation and cost effective are also evaluated.

TI  - Carbon and nutrients of Scots pine stands on sandy soils in Lithuania in relation to bioenergy sustainability
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB  - Sustainable forestry is based on the principle that harvesting practices should avoid negative influence on soil fertility, wood production and long-term soil carbon (C) stocks. We examined C and nutrient concentrations and stocks of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands on Arenosols in south-western Lithuania. The stands were 10, 20, 40, 50 and 65 years of age. C concentrations were relatively constant, while the concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S often varied between compartments and stand ages.
   The total aboveground stocks of nitrogen (N) were estimated to be in the range of 185-260 kg ha(-1), and 78-189 kg ha(-1) for calcium (Ca), 75-104 kg ha(-1) for potassium (K), 22-33 kg ha(-1) for phosphorus (P), 21-41 kg ha(-1) for magnesium (Mg) and 16-28 kg ha(-1) for sulphur (S). Corresponding stocks of the crown alone were 139-207 kg ha(-1) of N, 54-88 kg ha(-1) of Ca, 44-79 kg ha(-1) of K, 15-26 kg ha(-1) of P, 15-23 kg ha(-1) of Mg, and 11-15 kg ha(-1) of S. Biomass, C and nutrient stocks in the crown did not change with age, whereas the stemwood stocks increased with stand age. The total removals of C and N over a whole 100-year rotation were simulated to be 129 Mg ha(-1) and 449 kg ha(-1), respectively. An example scenario was created to compare the magnitude of potential nutrient removals with the atmospheric influx, soil stocks, and the internal litterfall flux. We suggest that intensified utilisation of these stands for bioenergy may be sustainable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Knowledge Economy Indicators and Their Impact on the Sustainable Competitiveness of the EU Countries
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In today's turbulent world influenced by globalization, knowledge is becoming a key factor in the market. Every economy, if it wants to be successful and competitive, must pay more attention to knowledge and its creation, transfer, and preservation. In this respect, it is a key element in ensuring a country's sustainable position in a competitive environment. Based on this, we set out the main idea of the article as follows: increased emphasis on the factors of a knowledge-based economy affects the growth of the country's competitiveness, which contributes to its better sustainability. To verify the idea, we used a multi-criteria evaluation of countries by the TOPSIS method and a subsequent regression model. We examined developments in the EU countries over a period of 11 years in selected indicators typical for the knowledge economies, in the area of competitiveness. Finally, we examined the sustainability of EU countries. Based on the findings of these methods, we identified the leading country-Sweden-in the field of knowledge economy, competitiveness, and sustainability.

TI  - Birds in the diet of the Eurasian badger <i>Meles meles</i>:: a review and meta-analysis
T2  - MAMMAL REVIEW
AB  - 1. We reviewed 110 published studies of badger diet or badger predation of birds. The studies covered most of the Eurasian badger's range, from Ireland east to Japan and from Sweden south to southern Spain.
   2. Bird remains were recorded in 2038 cases out of a total 36699 samples of badger faeces and stomachs. The overall percentage frequency of occurrence of bird remains in badger faeces and stomachs was 5.55% for all studies combined, and 7.97% for UK studies. The remains of 45 bird species from 11 orders were recorded.
   3. The percentage frequency of occurrence of birds in badger diet increased significantly with latitude. There was no significant relationship between the occurrence of birds in badger diet and season.
   4. While the prevalence of birds in the diet of badgers is generally low, the studies reviewed here provide insufficient evidence to assess whether badger predation has an impact on bird populations at a national scale, and experimental approaches to this problem are required.

TI  - Otolith elemental characteristics of whitefish (<i>Coregonus lavaretus</i>) from brackish waters of the Gulf of Bothnia, Baltic Sea
T2  - ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH
AB  - To investigate whether European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) groups in the brackish (<= 7%) Gulf of Bothnia (Baltic Sea) express specific otolith elemental characteristics, concentrations of elements (Ca, Ba, Sr, Zn, Mn, Fe) in whole otoliths were studied by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Whitefish (N = 67) were sampled from six different latitudinal sites; four in the sea and two in rivers along the west coast of Finland, and from a fresh water lake for comparison. The concentration of several elements showed significant differences among sampling sites. Otolith Ba concentrations were higher at the northern sampling sites compared to the southern ones, thereby showing negative association to capture-habitat salinity. In contrast, otolith Sr and Zn concentrations were lower at the northern sampling sites, thereby associating positively to capture-habitat salinity. Otolith Mn concentrations did not associate with latitude or salinity but markedly varied between sampling sites. Elevated Fe concentrations occurred in fish otoliths from the two northernmost sites. Ca concentrations were at the same levels in otoliths from all whitefish samples. Otoliths of whitefish from the lake had very high Ba and low Sr concentrations compared to concentrations in otoliths from whitefish in the sea and rivers. Our results show that otolith elemental characteristics of whitefish vary considerably at various geographic scales showing high potential for population identification using elemental fingerprints. Analysis of otolith elemental characteristics may therefore provide an efficient tool for the identification of main areas of residence, spawning locations, and migration routes, thus contributing towards the sustainable management of whitefish stocks.

TI  - Assessment of the Strengthening of an RC Railway Bridge with CFRP Utilizing a Full-Scale Failure Test and Finite-Element Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING
AB  - A finite element (FE) model was calibrated using the data obtained from a full-scale test to failure of a 50 year old reinforced concrete (RC) railway bridge. The model was then used to assess the effectiveness of various strengthening schemes to increase the load-carrying capacity of the bridge. The bridge was a two-span continuous single-track trough bridge with a total length of 30 m, situated in Ornskoldsvik in northern Sweden. It was tested in situ as the bridge had been closed following the construction of a new section of the railway line. The test was planned to evaluate and calibrate models to predict the load-carrying capacity of the bridge and assess the strengthening schemes originally developed by the European research project called Sustainable bridges. The objective of the test was to investigate shear failure, rather than bending failure for which good calibrated models are already available. To that end, the bridge was strengthened in flexure before the test using near-surface mounted square section carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars. The ultimate failure mechanism turned into an interesting combination of bending, shear, torsion, and bond failures at an applied load of 11.7 MN (2,630 kips). A computer model was developed using specialized software to represent the response of the bridge during the test. It was calibrated using data from the test and was then used to calculate the actual capacity of the bridge in terms of train loading using the current Swedish load model which specifies a 330 kN (74 kips) axle weight. These calculations show that the unstrengthened bridge could sustain a load 4.7 times greater than the current load requirements (which is over six times the original design loading), whilst the strengthened bridge could sustain a load 6.5 times greater than currently required. Comparisons are also made with calculations using codes from Canada, Europe, and the United States.

TI  - Competitiveness and sustainability effects of cars and their business models in Swedish small town regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This article aims to develop and test a new approach for comparing sustainability effects (mainly approximated through CO2 emissions) and the total cost of ownership of various business models (Regular Purchasing, Car Pooling, Car Leasing, and.Taxiing) applied to private cars with different energy carriers (Biogas, Ethanol, Gasoline, Plug-in Hybrid, and Electric). The results indicate that, out of all of the vehicles, electric vehicles are the most competitive from both an ecological and economic perspective. Moreover, of all of the business models, Car Pooling is the most competitive when driving short to medium distances, reducing CO2 emissions by 20-40% compared with Regular Purchasing. Meanwhile, Car Leasing emits the same amount of CO2 emissions as Regular Purchasing if both are driven the same number of kilometers per year. The results also indicate that, from a cost effectiveness perspective, people who travel less than 2000 km per year should primarily consider using Taxis or similar services, while Car Pooling is most cost effective for those who travel from 2000 to 8500 km. For those who travel between 8500 and 13,500 km per year, Car Leasing is the most cost effective, and Regular Purchasing is the best option above 13,500 km per year. If most car owners were to accept and adapt to this identified need for a market move towards Car Pooling with Electric Vehicles, necessary transportation could be ensured while significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, whether from Regular Purchasing or Car Leasing, as well as those that run on fossil fuel. This, in turn, would result in less fossil fuel use, fewer emissions, and decreased negative effects on human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does thalli complexity and biomass affect the associated flora and fauna of two co-occurring <i>Fucus</i> species in the Baltic Sea?
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - On rocky shores, fucoids provide habitat, shelter and food for associated biota. In the northern parts of the Baltic, the Bothnian Sea, the new fucoid species Fucus radicans (Bergstrom et Kautsky) was recently described. This study compares the thallus complexity and size as well as quantified the abundance and biomass of epiphytic algae and invertebrate taxa of the two fucoid species F. radicans and Fucus vesiculosus L. from sympatric sites in the Bothnian Sea on the Swedish coast and around the Estonian island Saaremaa. We found that F. radicans was more complex than F. vesiculosus within the whole study range, but both species had a more complex thallus structure in the Bothnian Sea compared to Estonia. The complexity of host algae did not contribute to their associated flora and fauna taxon richness; instead, the size of thalli was a good proxy for associated communities. Specifically, on a biomass basis, F. vesiculosus displayed highest species richness and highest faunal abundance in the Bothnian Sea, whereas no such differences were found around Saaremaa, probably because both Focus species had similar height around Saaremaa whereas F. vesiculosus grew much taller and larger in the Bothnian Sea. There were some unique associated macroalgal and invertebrate species that were found only on either of the fucoids, indicating the importance of separating them as species in surveys and monitoring.

TI  - The potential influence of Atlantic salmon <i>Salmo salar</i> and brown trout <i>Salmo trutta</i> on density and breeding of the white-throated dipper <i>Cinclus cinclus</i>
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Interactions between birds and fish are often overlooked in aquatic ecosystems. We studied the influence of Atlantic salmon and brown trout on the breeding population size and reproductive output of the white-throated dipper in a Norwegian river. Acidic precipitation led to the extinction of salmon, but salmon recolonized after liming was initiated in 1991. We compared the dipper population size and reproductive output before (1978-1992) and after (1993-2014) salmon recolonization. Despite a rapid and substantial increase in juvenile salmon, the breeding dipper population size and reproductive output were not influenced by juvenile salmon, trout, or total salmonid density. This might be due to different feeding strategies in salmonids and dippers, where salmonids are mainly feeding on drift, while the dipper is a benthic feeder. The correlation between the size of the dipper population upstream and downstream of a salmonid migratory barrier was similar before and after recolonization, indicating that the downstream territories were not less attractive after the recolonization of salmon. Upstream dipper breeding success rates declined before the recolonization event and increased after, indicating improved water quality due to liming, and increasing invertebrate prey abundances and biodiversity. Surprisingly, upstream the migratory barrier, juvenile trout had a weak positive effect on the dipper population size, indicating that dippers may prey upon small trout. It is possible that wider downstream reaches might have higher abundances of alternative food, rending juvenile trout unimportant as prey. Abiotic factors such as winter temperatures and acidic precipitation with subsequent liming, potentially mediated by prey abundance, seem to play the most important role in the life history of the dipper.

T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - The paper displays results of the initial stage of research on the creation of a thesaurus of key geocultural concepts, images and symbols of the Russian North and the Russian Arctic as a cultural code and symbolic resource of spatial development of the Northern macroregion. The research methodology is based on semiotic analysis and hermeneutics of texts of the traditional culture of the region' peoples, as well as works included in the Northern supertext of Russian literature. The "Island-archipelago" prasymbol and associated image-symbolical ensemble of the sacred hydrosphere ("world river") are identified as a basic geocultural constant reflecting the structure of physical and metaphysical space (cosmos) of the North and the Arctic. The river network of the North, reproducing the tree-like topology of the "world tree", acted as a system of spatial, social, and sacred orientations underlying the identity of ethnic and local communities of the region. Sacred hydrography determined the ways and directions of the Slavic-Russian (Novgorod) colonization of the Chud' north ("Finnish Rus"), colonization models, types and forms of colonists' settlements. In addition to the "island" and "river" symbols, the study provides a semantic analysis of related concepts and images, relevant for building a thesaurus of geocultural symbols of the Russian North and the Russian Arctic ("holiness", "zemstvo-world", "Northeast", "network", "House of St. Sophia").

TI  - Firefighter training in Sweden: from face-to-face learning in training grounds to distance learning - a challenge for exercise instructors?
T2  - TECHNOLOGY PEDAGOGY AND EDUCATION
AB  - When distance learning supported by digital technologies was introduced in firefighter training in Sweden some years ago, training exercise instructors accustomed to face-to-face teaching in the field had to adapt their professional roles to an electronic landscape with a number of new opportunities and constraints. Based on activity theory and comparisons between campus and distance mode, this study was aimed at increasing the understanding of how the training exercise instructor role is affected by the shift towards technology-enhanced distance learning. An analysis of interviews with instructors and students, and observations of response exercises, show that contradictions are emerging in the distance mode between instructors' motives, their technology tools and the object of the training they provide, and also between the two types of training, that is, the campus and the distance modes. Structural tensions and personal motives contribute to changes in the division of labour with instructors tending to adopt a much more passive role in the distance mode compared to their more active role in the campus mode.

TI  - Marine mammal hotspots across the circumpolar Arctic
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim Identify hotspots and areas of high species richness for Arctic marine mammals. Location Circumpolar Arctic. Methods A total of 2115 biologging devices were deployed on marine mammals from 13 species in the Arctic from 2005 to 2019. Getis-Ord G(i)* hotspots were calculated based on the number of individuals in grid cells for each species and for phylogenetic groups (nine pinnipeds, three cetaceans, all species) and areas with high species richness were identified for summer (Jun-Nov), winter (Dec-May) and the entire year. Seasonal habitat differences among species' hotspots were investigated using Principal Component Analysis. Results Hotspots and areas with high species richness occurred within the Arctic continental-shelf seas and within the marginal ice zone, particularly in the "Arctic gateways" of the north Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Summer hotspots were generally found further north than winter hotspots, but there were exceptions to this pattern, including bowhead whales in the Greenland-Barents Seas and species with coastal distributions in Svalbard, Norway and East Greenland. Areas with high species richness generally overlapped high-density hotspots. Large regional and seasonal differences in habitat features of hotspots were found among species but also within species from different regions. Gap analysis (discrepancy between hotspots and IUCN ranges) identified species and regions where more research is required. Main conclusions This study identified important areas (and habitat types) for Arctic marine mammals using available biotelemetry data. The results herein serve as a benchmark to measure future distributional shifts. Expanded monitoring and telemetry studies are needed on Arctic species to understand the impacts of climate change and concomitant ecosystem changes (synergistic effects of multiple stressors). While efforts should be made to fill knowledge gaps, including regional gaps and more complete sex and age coverage, hotspots identified herein can inform management efforts to mitigate the impacts of human activities and ecological changes, including creation of protected areas.

TI  - Metapopulation dynamics of a beetle species confined to burned forest sites in a managed forest region
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - Despite increasing awareness of the theoretical importance of habitat dynamics on metapopulations, only a few empirical studies have been conducted. We aimed to increase our understanding of how patch size, dynamics and connectivity affect colonization-extinction dynamics and the occurrence patterns of a beetle (Stephanopachys linearis), which breeds only in burned trees, existing as dynamic habitat patches that have become rare in managed forest landscapes. We assessed species' presence/absence twice in all known habitat patches (i.e. > 1 ha sites where forest fires had occurred during the previous 2-15 yr) in a 200 x 150 km region of central Sweden, dominated by managed boreal forest. Evaluated over six years, the colonization rate was 47% and the local extinction risk was 65%. Probability of colonization increased with patch size (number of suitable trees in a site) and connectivity to occupied patches within 30 km, and decreased with increasing time since fire. Local extinction risk decreased with habitat patch size but increased, unexpectedly, with connectivity. Occurrence increased with patch size and decreased with increasing time since fire. At a regional scale, S. linearis tracks the fire dynamics by colonising sites with burned trees and by becoming extinct at rates which make the species rare at sites where burnt trees are more than eight years old. In managed boreal forest landscapes, a large proportion of sites may be created by prescribed burning (in our study area: 82%), and consequently human decisions strongly affect the future amount of habitat for fire-dependent species and its spatial distribution. Stephanopachys linearis uses burned sites more often if more trees are retained and, to some extent, if sites are concentrated in those parts of a region that already support high population densities of the species.

TI  - Systematizing Knowledge of User Influence - A Study of User Advisory Boards in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
T2  - SOCIAL POLICY & ADMINISTRATION
AB  - While there is a great deal of interest in, and literature describing user influence in mental health and substance abuse services at the individual level, there are fewer studies of collective user influence at the organizational level. This article presents the findings of a study of the development of user advisory councils in regional organizations providing substance abuse services, which were part of a national implementation project in Sweden. A survey of both users and professionals involved in the local projects, in addition to interviews with key actors at the national level, were completed and analyzed with reference to the results of a literature review. The overall aim of the study was to identify obstacles and success factors related to the development of collective user influence at the programme and system levels. The results indicated that there was an overwhelmingly positive attitude towards experience-based knowledge and the potential for developing formal, collective user influence in these organizations. Users and professionals had common viewpoints regarding the obstacles and success factors, which included: addressing power relations, establishing legitimacy, assigning resources, investing in sustainability and planning for real participation. They were also substantially in agreement as to the strategies that would be needed in the future in order to move from ideology to action. These factors form the basis for a model that might be used to support the systematic implementation of this type of organized user influence.

TI  - VMO/ISBRA study on state and trait markers of alcohol use and dependence: Analysis of demographic, behavioral, physiologic, and drinking variables that contribute to dependence and seeking treatment
T2  - ALCOHOL-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Discussions between the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society on Biomedical Research on Alcoholism (ISBRA) identified the need for a multiple-center international study on state and trait markers of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. The reasoning behind the generation of such a project included the need to understand the alcohol use characteristics of diverse populations and the performance of biological markers of alcohol use in a variety of settings throughout the world. A second major reason for initiating this study was to collect DNA for well-structured and stratified association studies between genetic markers and/or "candidate" genes and behavioral/physiological phenotypes of importance to predisposition to alcohol dependence.
   Methods: An extensive interview instrument was developed with leadership from the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). The instrument was translated from English to Finnish, French, German, Japanese, and Portuguese (Brazilian). One thousand eight hundred sixty-three subjects were recruited at five clinical centers (Montreal, Canada; Helsinki, Finland; Sapporo, Japan; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Sydney, Australia). The subjects responded to the structured interview and provided blood and urine samples for biochemical analysis. This article focuses on the demographic characteristics of the study subjects, their drinking habits, alcohol-dependence characteristics, comorbid psychiatric and other drug variables, and predictors for seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. Multiple logistic regression models were constructed and used to explore variables that contribute to various levels of alcohol consumption, to a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and to seeking treatment for alcohol dependence. ANOVA with post hoc comparisons, chi(2), and Pearson moment calculations were used as necessary to assess additional relationships between variables.
   Results: A number of factors previously noted in disparate studies were confirmed in our analysis. Men consumed more alcohol than women, Asians consumed less alcohol than whites or Blacks, alcohol-dependent subjects consumed more alcohol than nondependent subjects, alcohol consumption increased with age, and an increased level of education (university or postgraduate education) reduced the percentage of such individuals in the category designated as heavy drinkers (>210 g alcohol/week) and in the group who were currently in treatment for dependence.
   However, our analysis allowed for much more detailed comparisons; for example, although men drank more than women on a g/day basis, the differences were less pronounced on g/kg/day basis, and alcohol-dependent women drank equal amounts of alcohol as alcohol-dependent men on a g/kg/day basis. Antisocial personality characteristics or reports of trouble sleeping when an individual stops drinking were associated with higher alcohol intake. The most important of the tested factors that contributed to a DSM-IV diagnosis of dependence, however, was the report of anxiety if an individual stopped drinking. In terms of the various criteria within the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, no one criterion seemed to be prominent for individuals who sought alcohol dependence treatment, but the higher the number of criteria met by the individual, the higher was the probability that he or she would be in treatment.
   Conclusions: This initial report is the beginning of the "data mining" of this rich data set. The cross-national/cross-cultural aspects of this study allowed for multiple comparisons of variables across several ethnic/racial groups and allowed for assessment of biochemical markers for alcohol intake and predisposition to alcohol dependence in diverse settings.

TI  - Resource recovery from source separated domestic waste(water) streams; full scale results
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - A major fraction of nutrients emitted from households are originally present in only 1% of total wastewater volume. New sanitation concepts enable the recovery and reuse of these nutrients from feces and urine. Two possible sanitation concepts are presented, with varying degree of source separation leading to various recovery products. Separate vacuum collection and transport followed by anaerobic treatment of concentrated black water (BW) demonstrated on a scale of 32 houses preserve 7.6 g/N/p/d and 0.63 gP/p/d amounting to respectively 69 and 48% of the theoretically produced N and P in the household, and 95% of the retained P was shown to be recoverable via struvite precipitation. Reuse of the anaerobic sludge in agriculture can substantially increase the P recovery. Energy recovery in the form of biogas from anaerobic digestion of concentrated BW, fits well in new concepts of sustainable, zero energy buildings. Nutrient recovery from separately collected urine lowers the percentage of nutrient recovery in comparison with BW but can, on the other hand, often be implemented in existing sanitation concepts. Theoretically 11gN/p/d and 1.0 g P/p/d are produced with urine, of which 38-63 and 34-61% were recovered in practice on a scale of 8-160 inhabitants in Sweden. New sanitation concepts with resource recovery and reuse are being demonstrated worldwide and more and more experience is being gained.

TI  - Examining the asymmetric link between clean energy intensity and carbon dioxide emissions: The significance of quantile-on-quantile method
T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This study corroborates the asymmetric and heterogeneous associations between clean energy intensity (CEI) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions among the world's top ten renewable energy consumer countries using quarterly data from 1970Q1 to 2018Q4. We quantify the complete dependence structure between CEI and CO2 at quantile distributions using a novel quantile-on-quantile (QQ) method proposed by Sim and Zhou (2015). Compared to classic approaches such as quantile regression and ordinary least squares, the QQ technique can provide more information on the overall relationship between CEI and CO2. Furthermore, we also seek to determine causal relationships between CEI and CO2 using a quantile Granger causality approach suggested by Troster. According to our empirical evidence, the link between the two variables is predominantly negative. Moreover, there are significant disparities across countries in the quantile ranges of CEI and CO2. In particular, there is a weak positive link between CEI and CO2 in the case of Sweden, Italy, Japan, and Australia, which may be because CEI has a minimal direct influence on CO2 in these countries. The empirical findings clarify that policymakers should fund renewable energy industries to minimize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

TI  - Genetics of water use physiology in locally adapted <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
T2  - PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Identifying the genetic basis of adaptation to climate has long been a goal in evolutionary biology and has applications in agriculture. Adaptation to drought represents one important aspect of local adaptation, and drought is the major factor limiting agricultural yield. We examined local adaptation between Sweden and Italy Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes, which show contrasting levels of water availability in their local environments. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling water use physiology traits and adaptive trait QTL (genomic regions where trait QTL and fitness QTL colocalize), we performed QTL mapping on 374 F-9 recombinant inbred lines in well-watered and terminal drought conditions. We found 72 QTL (32 in well-watered, 31 in drought, 9 for plasticity) across five water use physiology traits: delta C-13, rosette area, dry rosette weight, leaf water content and percent leaf nitrogen. Some of these genomic regions colocalize with fitness QTL and with other physiology QTL in defined hotspots. In addition, we found evidence of both constitutive and inducible water use physiology QTL. Finally, we identified highly divergent candidate genes, in silico. Our results suggest that many genes with minor effects may influence adaptation through water use physiology and that pleiotropic water use physiology QTL have fitness consequences.

TI  - Production of diaspores at the landscape level regulates local colonization: an experiment with a spore-dispersed moss
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - Effective dispersal is crucial to species inhabiting transient substrates in order for them to be able to persist in a landscape. Bryophytes, pteridophytes, lichens and fungi all have wind-dispersed small diaspores and can be efficiently dispersed if their diaspores reach air masses above canopy height. However, empirical data on dispersal over landscape scales are scarce. We investigated how the colonization of an acrocarpous clay-inhabiting pioneer moss, Discelium nudum, varied between sites that differed in connectivity to potential dispersal sources at spatial scales from 1 to 20 km in a region in northern Sweden. We recorded the colonization on similar to 25 introduced clay heaps at each of 14 experimental sites some months after the dispersal period. The colonization rate ranged from 0-82% and had a statistically significant relationship with a proxy for potential habitats (amount of clay-dominated soil) in a buff er of 20 km radius surrounding the experimental sites (and also weakly with the amount of substrate in a 10 km buff er). There were no significant relationships between colonization rate and connectivity at smaller scales (1 and 5 km). We made a rough estimate of the number of spores available for dispersal in a landscape, given the amount of clay-dominated soil, by recording the number of Discelium nudum colonies in two 25 x 25 km landscapes. The estimated available spore numbers in the different 20 km buffers were of the same order of magnitude as the deposition densities at the experimental sites calculated from the colonization rates. The results suggest that the spores of species with scattered occurrences and small diaspores (25 mu m) in open landscapes can be deposited over extensive areas, at rates high enough to drive colonization patterns. This also implies that regional connectivity may be more important than local connectivity for these kinds of species.

TI  - Acoustic classification of seabed habitats using the QTC VIEW™ system
T2  - ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - The QTC VIEW(TM) acoustic seabed classification system was used in Fraenfjorden, western Norway (62degreesN, 7degreesE), to map the spatial scales and variability of benthic habitats, and to evaluate its performance. Position and water depth were logged continuously along with the acoustic data. Water depth in the survey area ranged from 5 to 72 m over a spatial scale of ca. 1.5 x 8 km and there was considerable variation in sediment characteristics at 20 ground-truth sites. Six acoustically-distinct seabed types were identified and the QTC system defined their spatial scales and variability. Generally, the acoustic classifications were consistent at track crossings. The classification was generally in accordance with the sediment grain size and was most likely influenced by the softness of the substrate. However, these sediment characteristics could not alone explain the diversity of acoustic classes and the classes were probably also related to other physical or biotic seabed characteristics. The QTC system provides new insights but the usefulness of the acoustic classification depends upon the amount and quality of ground-truth data, which is the key aspect when relating acoustic class to seabed type. The acoustic system collects continuous data from large areas relatively quickly, and defines seabeds that would be missed by traditional core or grab point samples and will therefore be highly relevant to both geological- and benthic-diversity studies.

TI  - Moderating effects on the market orientation and strategic performance relationship in public housing
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how external factors moderate public housing companies' (PHCs) market orientation (MO) and strategic performance (SP) relationship. Design/methodology/approach The quantitative method is applied to data from a survey sent to 289 PHCs in Sweden. Findings The results reveal moderating factors. The companies take several initiatives to inform themselves about customers' needs and distribute the information within the company, but economic conditions, market and technological turbulence in the municipalities moderate the relationship between MO and SP. Economic conditions make it difficult for PHCs to strategically act based on market needs when making decisions and planning construction strategies (SP). Research limitations/implications - This study is limited by focusing on PHCs, a sector that differs radically from the open market. The study highlights the effects of moderating factors that are important for companies' SP and long-term construction strategies. From this limited focus, researchers might use the results to compare both similar and different market situations. Practical implications - The results of the study are useful for companies facing a similar market situation of external moderating constraints. The result might be used in future research related to the area in focus. Originality/value This research adds new knowledge to market research by including the impact of economic conditions, which provides insight into how to develop and use market knowledge in real estate and public housing markets.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> storage in the high Arctic: efficient modelling of pre-stack depth-migrated seismic sections for survey planning
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING
AB  - The sequestration of CO2 in subsurface reservoirs constitutes an immediate counter-measure to reduce anthropogenic emissions of CO2, now recognized by international scientific panels to be the single most critical factor driving the observed global climatic warming. To ensure and verify the safe geological containment of CO2 underground, monitoring of the CO2 site is critical. In the high Arctic, environmental considerations are paramount and human impact through, for instance, active seismic surveys, has to be minimized. Efficient seismic modelling is a powerful tool to test the detectability and imaging capability prior to acquisition and thus improve the characterization of CO2 storage sites, taking both geological setting and seismic acquisition set-up into account. The unique method presented here avoids the costly generation of large synthetic data sets by employing point spread functions to directly generate pre-stack depth-migrated seismic images. We test both a local-target approach using an analytical filter assuming an average velocity and a full-field approach accounting for the spatial variability of point spread functions. We assume a hypothetical CO2 plume emplaced in a sloping aquifer inspired by the conditions found at the University of Svalbard CO2 lab close to Longyearbyen, Svalbard, Norway, constituting an unconventional reservoir-cap rock system. Using the local-target approach, we find that even the low-to-moderate values of porosity (5%-18%) measured in the reservoir should be sufficient to induce significant change in seismic response when CO2 is injected. The sensitivity of the seismic response to changes in CO2 saturation, however, is limited once a relatively low saturation threshold of 5% is exceeded. Depending on the illumination angle provided by the seismic survey, the quality of the images of five hypothetical CO2 plumes of varying volume differs depending on the steepness of their flanks. When comparing the resolution of two orthogonal 2D surveys to a 3D survey, we discover that the images of the 2D surveys contain significant artefacts, the CO2-brine contact is misplaced and an additional reflector is introduced due to the projection of the point spread function of the unresolvable plane onto the imaging plane. All of these could easily lead to a misinterpretation of the behaviour of the injected CO2. Our workflow allows for testing the influence of geological heterogeneities in the target aquifer (igneous intrusions, faults, pervasive fracture networks) by utilizing increasingly complex and more realistic geological models as input as more information on the subsurface becomes available.

TI  - Alpine vegetation along multiple environmental gradients and possible consequences of climate change
T2  - ALPINE BOTANY
AB  - Alpine plant communities are being subject to climate change, resulting in the need for plants to adapt to new conditions. In this study, we investigated changes in vascular plant diversity along a coast-inland gradient in central Norway. At four different mountains, species were registered in 100 m(2) plots, laid out from the forest line to the summit. In addition, plots were grouped into snow cover duration (short, medium, and long) and aspect (North, South, East, and West). We documented richness and spatial turnover of species and functional groups (trees and tall shrubs, dwarf shrubs, herbs, graminoids, and seedless plants) along the different gradients using glm and RDA. Thereafter, we included variables from climate scenario models in the derived glm's to estimate how species richness and the distribution of these groups could be impacted by future climate change. Our results show that there are significant changes in species and functional groups along the regional gradient. Further, also local variation due to altitude and snow cover duration influenced species distribution and composition. Predictions of future vegetation showed an increase in species richness compared to present, with most changes occurring in areas of long and medium snow cover duration. We predicted the main changes to occur at lower altitudes. Here, dwarf shrubs and graminoids were expected to increase the most in number of species, whereas species of trees and tall shrubs were expected to increase the most in proportion.

TI  - Construction of laboratories for solar energy research in developing countries
T2  - 2013 ISES SOLAR WORLD CONGRESS
CP  - ISES Solar World Congress (SWC)
AB  - A large number of photovoltaic systems have been installed in developing countries around the world during numerous projects. The goal is often to improve the quality of life in rural areas often lacking electricity. Many of these installations provide important services such as lighting and charging of various devices. However, when the projects are finished, there is a large risk that maintenance is not carried out properly and that malfunctions are never repaired. This situation can leave an otherwise well-functioning system unusable. A key problem is that there are not enough trained technicians that can maintain and repair the system locally. One reason for this is the lack of practical education in many developing countries. Furthermore, the availability of spare parts is essential for long term effectiveness. During 2011 a group of researchers from Lund University in Sweden built a small scale laboratory in Maputo, Mozambique, with local researchers. The project was successful and today the laboratory functions both as a teaching facility and as a measurement station for solar energy research for licentiates, masters and Ph.D. students.
   The main goal now is to widen the project in order to incorporate more universities in developing countries. We are now looking for new interested partners in developing countries who believe that such a laboratory could strengthen their ability to teach practical work and to perform research at a local university. Partners for planning and executing the project are also needed. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Sociotechnical Factors Supporting Mobile Phone Use by Bus Drivers
T2  - IISE TRANSACTIONS ON OCCUPATIONAL ERGONOMICS & HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Sociotechnical measures could supplement traditional risk management measures and further reduce risks of collisions involving heavy vehicles. Such measures can be identified using methods rooted in sociotechnical systems theory, which considers that people work in systems comprising multiple social and technical elements that interact to create emergent properties and conditions that influence valued system outcomes. Purpose: To investigate the potential of sociotechnical measures in helping to reduce road risks, we identified how social and technical factors combine to influence mobile phone use by bus drivers working at a company in Norway. Method: A survey of similar to 600 drivers was completed, followed by focus group interviews with managers and drivers and one-on-one or group interviews with drivers. The interviews were structured using a sociotechnical analysis framework. Results: Twenty percent of drivers reported using their phone while operating a bus, even though such use was against company guidelines. Almost all drivers took their phone with them when they drove, and 40% of those who said they never used their phone while driving could still hear incoming calls and messages. Analysis from nine interviews with 26 drivers suggested that phone use by drivers operating buses is supported by interacting sociotechnical factors due to an increased societal dependence on technology, developments in bus driver culture, a need for bus drivers to resolve conflicting goals at work, and a lack of consequences for drivers using mobile phone use while driving. Conclusions: Limited consideration of the sociotechnical ecosystems surrounding bus drivers can contribute to their mobile phone use and thereby to potential problems of attention and awareness while driving. Sociotechnical approaches should be developed using participative design to reduce phone use while driving, especially to promote openness and information sharing and support bus drivers in the field as they strive to resolve conflicting goals.
   OCCUPATIONAL APPLICATIONS Results of a survey of drivers working for two bus companies in Norway suggest that 20% of drivers sometimes use a mobile phone while driving, even though it is not permitted. Sociotechnical analysis of the system surrounding drivers at one of the companies elicited ways in which social and technical factors combined to support mobile phone use by bus drivers. These factors were arranged under four themes: increased societal dependence on technology; developments in bus driver culture; the need for bus drivers to resolve conflicting goals; and a lack of belief in adverse consequences of using mobile phone while driving. Our findings (i) support claims that driver-centered analyses of mobile phone use or other traffic safety challenges are an insufficient basis for the development of measures and should be supplemented by sociotechnical analyses; and (ii) can inspire the design of more comprehensive measures to help reduce mobile phone use and road safety risks.

TI  - Metagenomics: A viable tool for reconstructing herbivore diet
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES
AB  - Metagenomics can generate data on the diet of herbivores, without the need for primer selection and PCR enrichment steps as is necessary in metabarcoding. Metagenomic approaches to diet analysis have remained relatively unexplored, requiring validation of bioinformatic steps. Currently, no metagenomic herbivore diet studies have utilized both chloroplast and nuclear markers as reference sequences for plant identification, which would increase the number of reads that could be taxonomically informative. Here, we explore how in silico simulation of metagenomic data sets resembling sequences obtained from faecal samples can be used to validate taxonomic assignment. Using a known list of sequences to create simulated data sets, we derived reliable identification parameters for taxonomic assignments of sequences. We applied these parameters to characterize the diet of western capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus) located in Norway, and compared the results with metabarcoding trnL P6 loop data generated from the same samples. Both methods performed similarly in the number of plant taxa identified (metagenomics 42 taxa, metabarcoding 43 taxa), with no significant difference in species resolution (metagenomics 24%, metabarcoding 23%). We further observed that while metagenomics was strongly affected by the age of faecal samples, with fresh samples outperforming old samples, metabarcoding was not affected by sample age. On the other hand, metagenomics allowed us to simultaneously obtain the mitochondrial genome of the western capercaillies, thereby providing additional ecological information. Our study demonstrates the potential of utilizing metagenomics for diet reconstruction but also highlights key considerations as compared to metabarcoding for future utilization of this technique.

TI  - Water diplomacy paths - An approach to recognise water diplomacy actions in shared waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
AB  - Water diplomacy is gaining increasing attention among both researchers and policy-makers. The interest is understandable, given that the concept brings together themes such as shifting geopolitics, new types of diplomacy and increasing water scarcity. Yet, there is no common definition for water diplomacy and actual water diplomacy actions typically vary across multiple tracks and scales.
   In this article, we seek to contribute to the practice of water diplomacy by introducing a step-wise Water Diplomacy Paths approach for analysing different water diplomacy contexts and related water diplomacy actions. To facilitate this, we recognise five key aspects for water diplomacy (Political; Preventive; Integrative; Cooperative; Technical) and propose a general definition for water diplomacy. We also discuss the possible distinctions between the related concepts of water diplomacy and transboundary water cooperation. The use of the Water Diplomacy Paths approach is demonstrated with brief case studies focusing on Central Asia, the Mekong Region, and the Finnish-Russian water cooperation. The work builds on an extensive literature review and comparative analysis of water diplomacy approaches as well as on a series of workshops and interviews among selected water diplomacy actors, including career diplomats.
   The suggested Water Diplomacy Paths approach envisions possible ways forward through four main steps: 1) identification of key themes and related actors; 2) analysis of the current state, 3) recognition of (undesired) drivers and related scenarios; and 4) identification of possible water diplomacy actions. We see that the approach has potential to support water diplomacy processes with the help of the distinction it makes between water- and diplomacy-focused activities as well as its consideration of tensions and related actions. Such characteristics also emphasise the complementarity that water diplomacy actions have with more traditional transboundary water cooperation arrangements. We argue that water diplomacy as a concept and as a practical approach provides an example of the future of foreign policy and diplomacy, where the use of shared waters is likely to be of increasing importance.

TI  - Modeling female brown bear kill rates on moose calves using global positioning satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB  - The recent development in Global Positioning System (GPS) techniques has started a new era in predation studies. Estimates of kill rates based on animal movements and GPS relocation clusters have proven to be valid in several obligatory carnivores. The main focus has been to obtain accurate mean predation estimates for the management of wildlife populations. We present a model to estimate individual kill rates of moose calves by adult female brown bears in Sweden, based on spatiotemporal clustering of 30,889 bear GPS relocations and 71 moose calves verified killed during 714 field investigations in 20042006. In this virtually single-predator single large prey system, the omnivorous brown bear is an efficient predator on moose calves up to 4 weeks of age. The top model set only included models with cluster radii of 30?m or 50?m, indicating very high kill-site fidelity. The best model included a cluster radius of 30?m and number of periods of bear activity at the kill site as a single covariate. The mean estimated individual kill rate of 7.6?+/-?0.71 (n?=?18, ${\bar {x}}$?+/-?SE) moose calves per calving season is comparable to the estimate of 6.8 from a previous study of radio-tracked moose in our study area, though at a lower moose/bear ratio. The mean annual kill rates varied from 6.1 to 9.4 calves per bear. The estimated individual kill rates ranged from 2 to 15 calves per season, indicating a large individual variation in hunting skills and possibly effort. Predation and livestock depredation represent a core conflict between humans and carnivores in rural Scandinavia. Accurate predation estimates represent an important step in quantifying costs of carnivores and reducing humancarnivore conflicts. Our technique may be applied in the exploration of predation mechanisms and predatorprey interactions, and contribute to the old and global debate of problem individuals in livestock depredation.

TI  - Effect of network connectivity on behavior of synthetic Broborg hillfort glasses
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY
AB  - There is wide industrial interest in developing robust models of long-term (>100 years) glass durability. Archeological glass analogs, glasses of similar composition, and alteration conditions to those being tested for durability can be used to evaluate and inform such models. Two such analog glasses from a 1500-year-old vitrified hillfort near Uppsala, Sweden have previously been identified as potential analogs for low concentration Fe-bearing aluminosilicate nuclear waste glasses. However, open questions remain regarding the melting environment from which these historic glasses were formed and the effect of these conditions on their chemical durability. A key factor to answering the previous melting and durability questions is the redox state of Fe in the starting and final materials. Past work has shown that the melting conditions of a glass-forming melt may influence the redox ratio value (Fe+3/ n-ary sumation Fe), a measure of a glass's redox state, and both melting conditions and the redox ratio may influence the glass alteration behavior. Synthetic analogs of the hillfort glasses have been produced using either fully oxidized or reduced Fe precursors to address this question. In this study, the melting behavior, glass transition temperature, oxidation state, network structure, and chemical durability of these synthesized glass analogs is presented. Resulting data suggests that the degree of network connectivity as impacted by the oxidation state of iron impacted the behavior of the glass-forming melt but in this case does not affect the chemical durability of the final glass. Glasses with a lower degree of melt connectivity were found to have a lower viscosity, resulting in a lower glass transition temperature and softening temperature, as well as in a lower temperature of foam onset and temperature of foam maximum. This lower degree of network connectivity most likely played a more significant role in accelerating the conversion of batch chemicals into glass than the presence of water vapor in the furnace's atmosphere. Future work will focus on using the results from this work with outcomes from other aspects of this project to evaluate long-term glass alteration models.

TI  - How can the notion of optimal speed limits best be applied in urban areas?
T2  - TRANSPORT POLICY
AB  - This paper reviews estimates of optimal speed limits made in the past 30 years. A tendency is seen for optimal speed limits to become higher. In the most recent estimates made for Norway, the optimal speed limit was in no case lower than 60 km/h. Adopting a speed limit of 60 km/h on roads in urban areas now having speed limits of 30, 40 or 50 km/h would most likely lead to an increase in the number of accidents and killed or injured road users. It is a political objective in Norway to reduce the number of killed or injured road users and to encourage more walking and cycling. Raising speed limits would conflict with both these objectives. This paper discusses if a re-interpretation of the notion of optimal speed limits can applied to justify low speed limits in urban areas. Traditionally, analyses of optimal speed limits have included motorised travel only. It is shown by means of simple numerical examples, that by including the effects of motorised travel speed on walking and cycling, optimal speed limits tend to be lower than when only motorised travel is included.

TI  - Primary healthcare in transition - a qualitative study of how managers perceived a system change
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Primary healthcare in Sweden has undergone widespread reforms in recent years, including freedom of choice regarding provider, freedom of establishment and increased privatisation. The key aims of the reforms were to strengthen the role of the patient and improve performance in terms of access and responsiveness. The aim of this study was to explore how managers at publicly owned primary healthcare centres perceived the transition of the primary healthcare system and the impact it has had on their work.
   Methods: In this qualitative study, 24 managers of publicly owned primary healthcare centres in the metropolitan region of Gothenburg were recruited. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and data were analysed using content analysis inspired by Silverman.
   Results: The analysis revealed two core themes: The transition is perceived as a rapid change, enforced mainly through financial incentives and Prioritisation conflicts arise between patient groups with different needs, demands and levels of empowerment. The transition has produced powerful and rapid effects that were considered to be both positive and negative. While the new financial incentives were seen as a driving force and a tool for change, they also became a stress factor due to uncertainty, competition with other primary healthcare centres and negative feelings associated with staff cutbacks. The shift in power towards the patient improved access and service but also led to more patients with unreasonable demands. Managers found it difficult to prioritise correctly between patient groups with different needs, demands and levels of empowerment and they were concerned about potentially negative effects on less empowered patients, e. g. multi-morbid patients. Managers also experienced shortcomings in their change management skills.
   Conclusions: This qualitative study shows the complexity of the system change and describes the different effects and perceptions of the transition from a manager's perspective. This suggests a need for improved follow-up and control in order to monitor and govern system changes and ensure development towards a more effective and sustainable primary healthcare system.

TI  - Recruitment of benthic invertebrates in high Arctic fjords: Relation to temperature, depth, and season
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - In the high Arctic, recruitment of hard-bottom benthic organisms has been studied at single locations, but little is known about how it varies spatially or temporally, or how it is influenced by abiotic factors. In this study, settlement plates were simultaneously deployed at five locations in three Svalbard (Norway) fjords at depths ranging from 7 m to 215 m. Recruitment was significantly different among fjords and among locations within a fjord. Recruits at each site co-occurred randomly even though interspecific overgrowth was observed. This finding provides further evidence that there is not necessarily a relationship between non-random co-occurrence and interspecific competition, such as is traditionally assumed for other isolated, island-like habitats. We found significantly lower recruitment in an Arctic-influenced fjord than in more Atlantic-influenced fjords. The abundance and richness of recruits was significantly lower in fall-winter than in spring-summer, but the spirorbid Circeis armoricana recruited in high abundance in fall-winter. Both the abundance and taxonomic richness of recruits declined exponentially with depth, with the hydroid Stegopoma plicatile dominating at 215 m in an Atlantic-influenced fjord. The most abundant recruiting taxa (C. armoricana, Semibalanus balanoides, Harmeria scutulata, Celleporella hyalina) can be described as pioneer (early-succession) species. Crustose coralline algae, a slow-growing superior competitor, also recruited at one location. Recruitment in Svalbard is highly variable, both spatially and temporally, and our results show the influence of local factors such as adult species composition.

TI  - Modelling spatio-temporal near-surface temperature variation in high mountain landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - A surface energy balance model (SEB), describing the fluxes of latent and sensible heat as well as the ground heat flux at different surfaces, was developed to simulate substrate, surface and air temperature variations in high mountain landscapes at a high temporal resolution of one hour. Classical atmospheric forcing was imposed at a reference level. The SEB model was calibrated and tested using micro-meteorological measurements collected at different sites within four catchments of the low and middle alpine belt of western and eastern central Norway. These sites represent the most common alpine vegetation types. Agreement between the model predictions and measurements was good: in all cases at least 80% of the variance in the measurements was explained by the model. In the present stage, the model contains limitations concerning the effects of a snow pack and should be applied to the snow-free season, only. Nevertheless, comparably simple SEB models, like this one, can be employed to intensify knowledge about detailed-scaled micro-spatial temperature differentiation and its effects on high mountain ecosystem functioning. Due to its simplicity it is suitable for remote sensing utilization enabling the application along broad-scale altitudinal and oceanic-continental gradients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Drivers' Experiences and Informed Opinions of Presence Sensitive Lighting Point towards the Feasibility of Introducing Adaptive Lighting in Roadway Contexts
T2  - SMART CITIES
AB  - Applications of adaptive and intelligent lighting technologies such as presence sensitive lighting, potentially offer solutions for reducing the energy consumption of road lighting while maintaining user comfort and safety. However, little is known about road users' experiences of such lighting. To address this gap, we conducted a real-world case study of a presence sensitive roadway lighting on a collector road in a housing area in southern Finland. New, controllable LED lighting with PIR (passive infrared) presence sensors was implemented along the road, and test scenarios were designed, programmed, and tested. The lighting was adapted both to motor vehicles using the road and to the measured traffic density along it. Drivers' experiences and attitudes toward the lighting were collected in a three-phase evaluation with questionnaires from the community of about 1000 households using the road as part of their daily mobility. The results indicate that as an experience, presence sensitive lighting in a road environment was at least as positive as traditional, uncontrolled lighting. User experiences of presence sensitive lighting did not differ from the experiences of uncontrolled lighting regarding pleasantness, uniformity, glare, and road visibility. Most of the drivers (86%) did not notice any dynamic change in the lighting. When informed about the tested lighting strategies, most of the participants (72%) would prefer either one of the intelligent lighting modes to be the permanent lighting solution. The results of this exploratory, real-world study point towards the potential feasibility of this technology from a user experience perspective, as the experienced stability of the lighting was unaltered in the tested scenarios; importantly, it also highlights the need to study adaptive roadway lighting further, especially through confirmatory studies in controlled settings.

TI  - Can Bioenergy Ash Applications Emulate the Effects of Wildfire on Upland Forest Soil Chemical Properties?
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
CP  - 13th North American Forest Soils Conference on Soils-Forests Interactions in Changing Environments / International Symposium on Forest Soils
AB  - As efforts to combat climate change intensify in Canada and around the world, the use of forest biomass to produce energy is expanding rapidly. At the same time, there is an urgent need for environmentally sustainable methods of handling the ash generated during biomass combustion. Currently, bioenergy ash is often landfilled, placing significant pressure on Canada's waste disposal infrastructure. In some countries, however, the use of bioenergy ash as a nutrient-rich forest soil amendment is strongly encouraged. Given that forest management in Canada is often driven by the 'emulation of natural disturbance' paradigm, bioenergy ash could have potential as a management tool for improving wildfire emulation in harvested stands. We compared published values of wildfire ash chemistry with those for Canadian and European bioenergy ash and found that they are similar. We used meta-analysis to examine changes in soil carbon and nitrogen pools, extractable phosphorus, exchangeable calcium and soil pH following wildfires and applications of bioenergy ash on upland forested sites. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash can reduce forest floor C and N pools: wildfires by direct combustion of organic matter, and ash applications by an apparent increase in organic matter decay. Both wildfires and bioenergy ash applications increase extractable P, exchangeable Ca and pH in surface mineral soils. Although bioenergy ash applications can trigger larger increases in available P and pH in surface mineral soils than wildfires, controlling ash dosage rates or pre-treating the ash to slow the rate of nutrient release could attenuate some of these effects.

TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of <i>Duddingtonia flagrans</i> and <i>Monacrosporium thaumasium</i> in the biological control of gastrointestinal nematodes in female bovines bred in the semiarid region
T2  - VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Brazil has a herd of 212 million cattle and 171 million hectares of pastures that produce approximately 96 % of Brazilian beef. The Brazilian production system enables animal infection by endoparasites, which are considered one of the main obstacles for the development of this industry and are responsible for considerable economic losses. The control of parasitic diseases is performed via the administration of antiparasitic drugs, but they leave residues of the products in the treated animal, affect non-target organisms and select resistant strains of the parasites. The species D. flagrans and M. thaumasium are promising and sustainable alternatives for controlling gastrointestinal helminths of ruminants and other herbivores. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of isolates of these species, formulated in a sodium alginate matrix and administered twice a week, to reduce the number of environmental infective larvae of gastrointestinal nematodes that affect prepubescent zebu females. The treated animals presented fewer eggs and a lower number of infective larvae per gram of faeces (p<0.05). The pastures occupied by treated animals showed a statistically significant reduction (p<0.05) of the number of L-3 and, furthermore, the genera Cooperia sp., Haemonchus sp., and Oesophagostomum sp. were the most prevalent. The average weight of the animals did not differ statistically (p>0.05) among the treated and control groups. The use of sodium alginate pellets as vehicle for delivery of the fungus mycelia D. flagrans (isolate AC001) and M. thaumasium (isolate NF34A) proved effective in controlling trichostrongylids in prepubescent cows bred in the semi-arid region, with an effective reduction in the number of infective larvae in the pastures.

TI  - Determination of some factors leading to the infestation of <i>Ips sexdentatus</i> in crimean pine stands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Large infestations of bark beetles result in the death of many trees in large forest areas.
   Ecological-based modeling approaches that include the factors causing infestations are important for accurately predicting whether these infestations will occur, suggesting ways to avoid large infestations, and understanding sustainable forest management. In the present study, the effects of some stand characteristics and topographical and climatological factors on the of Ips sexdentatus infestation at pure and mixed Crimean pine stands were evaluated. Ten factors were considered as important for predicting the predisposition of a pine forest to infestation: stand structure, site index, crown closure, stand age, aspect, slope, elevation, maximum temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. Ten conditioning layers were overlayed separately with a beetle infestation map using geographic information system (GIS) to investigate how the beetle damage changed according to these factors and how much damage it caused. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine how combinations of the 10 factors affected beetle infestations and which of the factors were most damaging. It was found that the stand structure, crown closure, site index, stand age, slope, elevation, maximum temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation were definite factors in I. sexdentatus infestation; the aspect was not found to be a strong factor. The crown closure was the most significant factor affecting I. sexdentatus infestation followed by maximum temperature, elevation, slope, precipitation, solar radiation, stand age, site index, and stand structure. The crown closure, stand structure, maximum temperature, solar radiation, and forest stand area variables were significantly included in the logistic regression model.

TI  - Temporal PROMETHEE II-New multi-criteria approach to sustainable management of alternative fuels consumption
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Alternative fuels are the subject of growing interest among both researchers and practitioners. In this aspect, to properly handle the problem of proper evaluating alternative fuels, appropriate methods, and tools are undoubtedly needed. Since the evaluation of sustainable alternative fuels similarly, like most sustainability problems, has a multi-criteria character, multi-criteria methods have the potential to be employed here. Analysis of the alternative fuels domain indicates that classical multi-criteria methods are not exactly suitable for use in cases where, instead of a single matrix for evaluating alternatives, we have a set of them collected for particular periods. Therefore, developing a dedicated approach that considers the specifics of a given problem is necessary. For this purpose, the paper proposes a new Temporal Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations II (PROMETHEE II) method for multi-criteria temporal evaluation. Hence, the presented method solves the limitations occurring in previously developed multi-criteria methods. In addition to the classical aspect of evaluating the options under consideration, the proposed method makes it possible to accurately grasp the dynamics of the outcomes and put them into an easy-to-interpret result. A practical contribution of the paper is applying the developed method to a multi-criteria temporal evaluation of sustainable consumption of alternative fuels in road transport. For this purpose, an assessment model was built based on the data for 32 European countries acquired from the European Union's statistical office (Eurostat). Preference imprecision modeling and model sensitivity analysis demonstrated the analytical potential of the developed sustainability assessment model and, simultaneously, the Temporal PROMETHEE method's superiority. The comparative analysis of the Temporal PROMETHEE II method clearly shows that the results are robust and reliable, and the developed method is suitable for evaluating various temporal sustainability problems. The research demonstrated that a model alternative fuel mix and its shape as well as progression is maintained by Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Sweden.

TI  - Staying the Course? Challenges in Implementing Evidence-Based Programs in Community Mental Health Services
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - This paper focuses on the second phase of the deinstitutionalisation of mental health care in which the development of community-based interventions are supposed to be implemented in local community mental health care systems. The challenge to sustainable implementation is illustrated by the Swedish case where the government put forward a national training program that sought to introduce Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) for people with severe mental illness. This study is based on document analysis and qualitative interviews with actors at the national, regional, and local levels covering a total of five regions and 15 municipalities that participated in the program. The analysis of the national experiences is put in relation to both research on public administration and policy analysis as well as to current research on implementation of evidence-based programs. The results showed a "drift" of the original model, which had already begun at the policy formulation stage and ended up in a large number of different local arrangements where only a few of the original components of ACT remained. We conclude that issues with implementation can only be fully understood by considering factors at different analytical levels.

TI  - Woody biomass potential for energy feedstock in United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST ECONOMICS
AB  - The production reliability and relatively low costs of sustainably harvested woody biomass such as logging residue and low value roundwood could make it a significant component of the Renewable Fuel Standards portfolio. This research explored a set of woody biomass harvesting combinations of different sources and wood types using a cost minimizing linear programming model populated with disaggregated regional inventory, yield, and cost data, and projected future conventional wood demand of the United States. The model pre-satisfied conventional wood demand before harvesting roundwood as woody biomass. Findings suggest that collecting forest residue and non-merchantable (small sized) timber may provide the largest initial contribution in woody biomass supply. Regional estimations imply that not all regions have the capacity to develop bioenergy plants without using merchantable (medium sized) wood. Within a reasonable range of harvesting costs, demand for roundwood is expected to increase with higher energy production targets. Harvesting merchantable natural softwood as woody biomass has a relatively small impact on marginal supply costs. This will result in little or no disturbance to merchantable natural softwood timber management and operations if demand for woody biomass increased.

TI  - Challenges to evidence-informed decision-making in the context of pandemics: qualitative study of COVID-19 policy advisor perspectives
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction The exceptional production of research evidence during the COVID-19 pandemic required deployment of scientists to act in advisory roles to aid policy-makers in making evidence-informed decisions. The unprecedented breadth, scale and duration of the pandemic provides an opportunity to understand how science advisors experience and mitigate challenges associated with insufficient, evolving and/or conflicting evidence to inform public health decision-making. Objectives To explore critically the challenges for advising evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) in pandemic contexts, particularly around non-pharmaceutical control measures, from the perspective of experts advising policy-makers during COVID-19 globally. Methods We conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 27 scientific experts and advisors who are/were engaged in COVID-19 EIDM representing four WHO regions and 11 countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ghana, Hong Kong, Nigeria, Sweden, Uganda, UK, USA) from December 2020 to May 2021. Participants informed decision-making at various and multiple levels of governance, including local/city (n=3), state/provincial (n=8), federal or national (n=20), regional or international (n=3) and university-level advising (n=3). Following each interview, we conducted member checks with participants and thematically analysed interview data using NVivo for Mac software. Results Findings from this study indicate multiple overarching challenges to pandemic EIDM specific to interpretation and translation of evidence, including the speed and influx of new, evolving, and conflicting evidence; concerns about scientific integrity and misinterpretation of evidence; the limited capacity to assess and produce evidence, and adapting evidence from other contexts; multiple forms of evidence and perspectives needed for EIDM; the need to make decisions quickly and under conditions of uncertainty; and a lack of transparency in how decisions are made and applied. Conclusions Findings suggest the urgent need for global EIDM guidance that countries can adapt for in-country decisions as well as coordinated global response to future pandemics.

TI  - Seasonal distribution and timing of migration of cormorants Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis breeding in Denmark
T2  - BIRD STUDY
AB  - The recent expansion of the Cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo population in Europe has Zed to management conflict throughout Europe, increasing the relevance of describing the migration pattern of each country's breeding population. We use 2279 recoveries and 16 769 resightings of 4735 colour-ringed individuals to describe dispersal and timing of movements of Danish Cormorants. Most Cormorants dispersed from the colonies to coastal areas and freshwater lakes in Denmark, Sweden and northern Germany in July. Southward movements took place throughout July to December. Major departure from the post-breeding areas occurred from August to mid-October, with many birds staging at Dutch and Alpine lakes between September and October, and with arrival in the Mediterranean mainly from October to November. Spring migration was fast, occurring from mid-February to March. First-year birds migrated south faster and reached the wintering areas sooner than adults, but left these later and moved north more slowly than adults. Wintering occurred from Portugal in the west to Greece in the east, and from Denmark in the north to North Africa in the south. The majority of Cormorants spent the winter in Mediterranean France, Italy Yugoslavia, Albania, Algeria and in particular in Tunisia. Adult males stayed closer to the breeding areas in winter than females, and adults tended to winter further north than first-year birds. Sex differences in body size and advantages of arriving early at the breeding sites may explain why males wintered further north than females.

TI  - Modelling of a recording scheme for market-oriented smallholder pig producers in Northwest Vietnam
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
AB  - Village breeding programmes are being developed by an integrated long-term project for smallholders in Northwest Vietnam to improve pig production in different production systems. In total, 120 smallholders with 169 sows in 5 of the 9 project villages were approached in single person interviews, using a structured questionnaire. Frequency analysis of data on breeding management and ranking of smallholders' trait preferences and selection criteria used for pigs were performed with SAS 9.1, using the FREQ procedure. Survey results indicate that both improved local breeds and exotic genotypes should be incorporated in future village breeding programmes for market-oriented smallholder pig production, improving the reproductive and growth performance as well as the carcass quality. in a next step. a model reflecting the status quo at farms with market-oriented pig production was developed integrating data from farmers' survey and information from the project's current recording scheme. A deterministic approach was used to assess the profitability and genetic merit of the current recording scheme. Modelling results show that the current recording scheme is unprofitable (-33.90 (sic) sow(-1)). As continued success of village breeding programmes depends on the profitability of breeding measures, the long-term sustainability of the current recording scheme seems unlikely. Genetic gains are achieved in production and carcass quality traits, while a small reduction in reproduction traits can be observed. In a last step, possible effects of increased pig performances on the profitability and genetic merit of the current recording scheme were evaluated. Effects of increased pig performances on the genetic and economic success of the recording scheme are generally limited. Further model calculations are necessary for finding possibilities to improve smallholder pig breeding in a profitable way. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Nitrogen supply and physical disturbance shapes Arctic stream nitrogen uptake through effects on metabolic activity
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change in the Arctic is altering the delivery of nutrients from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. The impact of these changes on downstream lakes and rivers is influenced by the capacity of small streams to retain such inputs. Given the potential for nutrient limitation in oligotrophic Arctic streams, biotic demand should be high, unless harsh environmental conditions maintain low biomass standing stocks that limit nutrient uptake capacity.
   We assessed the drivers of nutrient uptake in two contrasting headwater environments in Arctic Sweden: one stream draining upland tundra and the other draining an alluvial valley with birch forest. At both sites, we measured nitrate (NO3-) uptake biweekly using short-term slug releases and estimated rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration from continuous dissolved oxygen measurements.
   Catchment characteristics were associated with distinct stream chemical and biological properties. For example, the tundra stream maintained relatively low NO3- concentrations (average: 46 mu g N/L) and rates of GPP (0.2 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1)). By comparison, the birch forest stream was more NO3- rich (88 mu g N/L) and productive (GPP: 1.7 g O-2 m(-2) day(-1)). These differences corresponded to greater areal NO3- uptake rate and increased NO3- use efficiency (as uptake velocity) in the birch forest stream (max 192 mu g N m(-2) min(-1) and 96 mm/hr) compared to its tundra counterpart (max 52 mu g N m(-2) min(-1) and 49 mm/hr) during 2017. Further, different sets of environmental drivers predicted temporal patterns of nutrient uptake at these sites: abiotic factors (e.g. NO3- concentration and discharge) were associated with changes in uptake in the tundra stream, while metabolic activity was more important in the birch forest stream.
   Between sites, variation in uptake metrics suggests that the ability to retain pulses of nutrients is linked to nutrient supply regimes controlled at larger spatial and temporal scales and habitat properties that promote biomass accrual and thus biotic demand.
   Overall, constraints on biotic potential imposed by the habitat template determined the capacity of these high latitude streams to respond to future changes in nutrient inputs arising from climate warming or human land use.

TI  - 3PG-MT-LSTM: A Hybrid Model under Biomass Compatibility Constraints for the Prediction of Long-Term Forest Growth to Support Sustainable Management
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Climate change is posing new challenges to forestry management practices. Thinning reduces competitive pressure in the forest by repeatedly reducing the tree density of forest stands, thereby increasing the productivity of plantations. Considering the impact of thinning on vegetation and physiological and ecological traits, for this study, we used Norway spruce (Picea abies) data from three sites in the PROFOUND dataset to parameterize the 3-PG model in stages. The calibrated 3-PG model was used to simulate the stand diameter at breast height and the stem, root, and leaf biomass data on a monthly scale. The 3PG-MT-LSTM model uses 3-PG simulation data as the input variable. The model uses a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) as a shared layer and introduces multi-task learning (MTL). Based on the compatibility rules, the interpretability of the model was further improved. The models were trained using single-site and multi-site data, respectively, and multiple indicators were used to evaluate the model accuracy and generalization ability. Our preliminary results show that, compared with the process model and LSTM algorithm without MTL and compatibility rules, the hybrid model has higher biomass simulation accuracy and shows a more realistic biomass response to environmental driving factors. To illustrate the potential applicability of the model, we applied light (10%), moderate (20%), and heavy thinning (30%) at intervals of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 years. Then, we used three climate scenarios-SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5-to simulate the growth of Norway spruce. The hybrid model can effectively capture the impact of climate change and artificial management on stand growth. In terms of climate, temperature and solar radiation are the most important factors affecting forest growth, and under warm conditions, the positive significance of forest management is more obvious. In terms of forest management practices, less frequent light-to-moderate thinning can contribute more to the increase in forest carbon sink potential; high-intensity thinning can support large-diameter timber production. In summary, moderate thinning should be carried out every 10 years in the young-aged forest stage. It is also advisable to perform light thinning procedures after the forest has progressed into a middle-aged forest stage. This allows for a better trade-off of the growth relationship between stand yield and diameter at breast height (DBH). The physical constraint-based hybrid modeling approach is a practical and effective tool. It can be used to measure long-term dynamic changes in forest production and then guide management activities such as thinning to achieve sustainable forest management.

TI  - FINANCING OF E-GOVERNMENT PROJECTS IN THE EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES AND UKRAINE
T2  - FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB  - The article identifies that an important area of sustainable development and public administration reform is an effective e-government process, which should be provided with appropriate funding. The purpose of the article is to determine further opportunities for financing e-government of Ukraine in the framework of projects and public administration reform, taking into account the experience of the European Union to achieve the goals of sustainable development and digitalization of the country. The methodological basis of the study is the analytical data of UNDP Ukraine, the National Agency for Civil Service Affairs of Ukraine, the European Commission, the study of the digital government of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The key factors of the state in the direction of digital society and sustainable democratic governance are identified (human rights, transparency and integrity, parliamentary reform, civil society and youth work, health care reform and public procurement support, digital transformation). Peculiarities of financing the Public Administration Reform Strategy of Ukraine are analyzed, the largest share of financing of which is the budget program "Support to the implementation of comprehensive public administration reform" and EU budget support. The peculiarities of e-government financing in the EU countries are determined. The necessity of external sources of financing of digital projects in Ukraine due to their insufficient financing is substantiated. The largest donor countries for financing e-government projects in Ukraine (Denmark, Estonia, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany and Poland) have been identified. Based on the study of European experience in financing models of e-government development projects, existing funding instruments for Ukraine (funds of the joint interstate development strategy, grants, charity, public-private partnership) and promising funding instruments have been identified, the use of which will increase openness, transparency and efficiency and ensure the development of open data.

TI  - Effect of environmental variables on health condition of <i>Acer platanoides</i> L. in urban parks and forests of the city of Poznan
T2  - SYLWAN
AB  - Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) is a common species in cities. It can also be found as an extra species among the tree stand of municipal forests, which are dominated by other species. It is often planted in urban parks, open landscape, buffer strips, because this tree is resistant to most pollutants of anthropogenic origin. However, it is potentially sensitive to salinity and the accumulated effect of SON, NO and dust containing heavy metals. It is necessary to note that maple is a significant species to the development of urban open space. The aim of the study was to investigate the condition of A. platanoides in the municipal forests and non-historic parks of Poznan. (western Poland) and to check which environmental variables have the influence on the health status of the trees. The research comprised the municipal forests (3) and non-historic parks (6) in the city and was conducted from 2010 to 2013. Field analyses concerned detailed inventory of trees and the determination of the state of health of each specimen. The data acquired in the study enabled the construction of CVA models. The maples in the municipal forests in Poznan were characterised by a higher health status than the specimens in urban parks. The research also revealed that such environmental variables as proximity to industrial centres and main thoroughfares had the greatest influence on the health status of the analysed trees. The investigated maples which grew in the parks located in the districts heated with fossil fuels proved to be of significantly worse health. As far as age is concerned, the specimens aged between 41 and 70 years were in the best condition.

TI  - Sense and sensibility. A narrative study of older women's car driving
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR
AB  - The present study uses a qualitative approach to examine the personal meanings older women attach to cars and driving. The data consist of 10 narrative interviews with Swedish women aged 69-87, carried out in 2002. In the analysis, a social constructionist perspective was combined with a narrative approach focusing on how the women described the important actors and their respective positions during different periods of their driving histories. In addition, a life-course perspective and feminist theorizing on marginalization influenced the analysis. The aim of the study was to better understand the social reality surrounding older women's driving and the mechanisms that marginalize women as road users throughout their life course. Two main themes emerged, reflecting the "sense and sensibility" of driving; i.e., personal meanings related to its practicality and to its experiential nature. These two themes were often constructed as polarities in the interviewees' talk, as if the lust and splendour of cars and driving only were legitimate for (older) women if practiced within a socially acceptable framework of practicality and care-taking duties. Overall the present findings illustrate how (older) women's experiences on the traditionally male arena of driving are not fully embedded into our cultural conceptions and norms, and how the marginalization of women drivers is further reproduced.

TI  - Challenges Addressed by Swedish Third-Party Logistics Providers Conducting Sustainable Logistics Business Cases
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The sustainable logistics business case (SLBC) provides underlying argumentation to convince decision makers to approve initiatives within sustainable logistics. Little knowledge exists on how companies conduct SLBCs or the challenges that need to be addressed. The purpose of this paper is to explore how companies conduct SLBCs, to increase the understanding of how perceived challenges can be addressed. Potential challenges were identified in literature on business cases models in general and sustainable logistics business cases. As third-party logistics providers (3PL) are big contributors to emissions and often are responsible for designing logistics setups, they were focused in the empirical study. How SLBC were conducted was investigated based on interviews with managers responsible for conducting SLBCs and the responses triangulated with information derived from actual business cases. Despite the careful selection of 3PLs well ahead within the area, few challenges were perceived by the studied companies. This does not imply that challenges do not exist but can rather be described as a consequence of their pragmatic and inward-looking perspective. Examples of how to address challenges are provided. The compiled list of SLBC challenges provides an overview that was missing in literature.

TI  - Sustainable fingerprint - Using textual analysis to detect how listed EU firms report about ESG topics
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Transparent reporting of corporate activities and their impact on ESG topics are becoming increasingly important for companies and stakeholders. Beginning from fiscal year 2017 onward, the European Union (EU) mandates large listed EU firms with the Directive 2014/95/EU (hereafter, NFRD) to prepare annual non-financial reports. By using a text mining approach and creating both ESG and time reference dictionaries, we investigate how precisely ESG topics are disclosed in sustainability reports. We examine the occurrence of ESG topics and the time reference in non-financial reports of the most relevant stock indices from France, Germany, Italy and Sweden from 2017 to 2021. Generally, our results show a tendency towards an expanding volume per report across all countries and over the years. Applying bag-of-words, a contextual as well as a temporal dimension are assigned to each section resulting in a 4 x 4 matrix. Based on the findings a unique Sustainable Fingerprint can be allocated to each report. We document a strong tendency towards future-oriented reporting. Simultaneously, the ESG aspects are relatively balanced. The analysis at cross-country and sector level reveals noticeable results. Depending on the country and sector, characteristic tendencies towards certain ESG-aspects can be observed. Both the country-and the sector-specific analysis indicate potential for improvement of ESG reporting.

TI  - <i>Prorocentrum minimum</i> (Pavillard) Schiller -: A review of a harmful algal bloom species of growing worldwide importance
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
CP  - Symposium on Ecology and Physiology of Prorocentrum Minimum
AB  - Prorocentrum minimum (Pavillard) Schiller, a common, neritic, bloom-forming dinoflagellate, is the cause of harmful blooms in many estuarine and coastal environments. Among harmful algal bloom species, R minimum is important for the following reasons: it is widely distributed geographically in temperate and subtropical waters; it is potentially harmful to humans via shellfish poisoning; it has detrimental effects at both the organismal and environmental levels; blooms appear to be undergoing a geographical expansion over the past several decades; and, a relationship appears to exist between blooms of this species and increasing coastal eutrophication. Although shellfish toxicity with associated human impacts has been attributed to P minimum blooms from a variety of coastal environments (Japan; France; Norway; Netherlands; New York, USA), only clones isolated from the Mediterranean coast of France, and shellfish exposed to P. minimum blooms in this area, have been shown to contain a water soluble neurotoxic component which killed mice. Detrimental ecosystem effects associated with blooms range from fish and zoobenthic mortalities to shellfish aquaculture mortalities, attributable to both indirect biomass effects (e.g., low dissolved oxygen) and toxic effects. P. minimum blooms generally occur under conditions of high temperatures and incident irradiances and low to moderate salinities in coastal and estuarine environments often characterized as eutrophic, although they have been found under widely varying salinities and temperatures if other factors are conducive for growth. The physiological flexibility of P minimum in response to changing environmental parameters (e.g., light, temperature, salinity) as well as its ability to utilize both inorganic and organic nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon nutrient sources, suggest that increasing blooms of this species are a response to increasing coastal eutrophication.

TI  - Cage size affects comfort, safety and the experienced security of working dogs in cars
T2  - APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE
AB  - Working dogs often spend a large amount of their time in cars. It has been hypothesized that a larger compartment in the car would be more comfortable for the dog, but that a smaller space could be safer, especially while driving. This presents a potential conflict. In this study, working dogs of the breeds German Shepherd (N = 8) and Springer Spaniel (N = 8) from the Swedish Police and Customs respectively, were each tested in four different car cage sizes; two cages were the minimum size allowed according to Swedish regulations (one of fixed size and one adapted to the size of the dog) and for comparison we tested one larger (fixed sized) and one smaller (adapted sized) cage. These were tested under two different driving phases; normal driving (including turns and changes in speed) and slow cruising (without turning forces and of an even speed). The study was conducted at a test track using an estate car, typical of that used by these organizations. Testing of each cage size involved 30 min in the car, excluding the habituation period. The dogs' behaviour and heart rate activity was recorded. Statistical analyses used a mixed model and pairwise comparisons. We found a large effect of our two driving phases, for example heart rate was higher and behavioural stress indicators more frequent during normal driving, implying that this was a more demanding situation for dogs compared to the slow cruising. Regarding cage size effects, there were fewer overall movements and body position changes by dogs in the three smaller cages compared to the largest cage size. That this could be a sign of decreased comfort is supported by the finding that dogs could not turn around in these cages without curving their back upwards or lowering their rump in these cages. This could have negative physical effects, especially in German Shepherds which are predisposed to musculoskeletal disease. Furthermore, German Shepherd dogs showed more bracing postures, i.e. more attempts to maintain their balance, in the small fixed cage size. For these dogs this cage size was shorter than their own body length. However, this bracing did not result in them losing their balance any less often, illustrating the importance of space allowance for maintaining balance during transportation and implying that a smaller cage is not necessarily safer.

TI  - MARKETING AND BRANDING STRATEGY FOR THE SOUTH BALTIC SEA REGION: REINFORCING REGIONAL INNOVATION IN SMES THROUGH CROSS-BORDER COLLABORATION MODELS IN THE AGE OF TRANSFORMATION
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES
AB  - South Baltic Sea Region (SBSR) is one of the EU cross-border regions that due to the patchy development patterns qualifies for EU financial support reinforcing innovation capacity and promoting collaborative and competitive mindset. Historically shaped by international collaboration patterns across the Baltic Sea, the SBSR turns into maritime or blue EU region. Being an integral part of the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) that has developed as role model for sustainable, green and smart region in the recent years, SBSR experiences increasing pace of change and the urge for sustainable transition. This creates a real conundrum for appropriate regional action. In this light, in the frame of the "InterMarE South Baltic" - a part-financed EU INTERREG project the researchers set out to contribute to situational improvement by developing tailor-made cooperative and region-wide Marketing and Banding Strategy for regional SMEs of all Blue Economy sectors. A joint macro-regional positioning strategy for the SBSR is highly missing and available strategic attempts can be traced back to joint marketing measures in the tourism sector only. Therefore, building on eclectic empirical data covering more than 130 surveyed SMEs from all participating countries - Denmark, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden, supported by expert interviews with representatives of Blue Economy sectors in the SBSR and BSR, direct observations and field research done in the frame of study visits outside the region, this treatise presents an innovative, integrative and topical cooperative model for joint cross-border marketing and branding of SMEs operating in the SBSR in all applicable Blue Economy sectors.

TI  - Effect of host species, host nest density and nest size on the occurrence of the shining guest ant <i>Formicoxenus nitidulus</i> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Understanding habitat requirements of species is important in conservation. As an obligate ant nest associate, the survival of the globally vulnerable shining guest ant, Formicoxenus nitidulus, is strictly tied to that of its hosts (mound building Formica ants). We investigated how host species, nest density, inter-nest distance and nest mound size relate to the occurrence of F. nitidulus. In total, 166 red wood ant nests were surveyed in SW Finland (120 Formica polyctena, 25 F. rufa, 14 F. aquilonia, 5 F. pratensis, and 2 F. lugubris). Overall, F. nitidulus was found in 60% of the nests. For the actual analysis, only F. polyctena and F. rufa nests were included due to the small number of other nests. F. nitidulus was more likely to be found among F. polyctena than F. rufa. Also, while inter-nest distance was not important, a high nest density, commonly found in polydomous (multi-nest) wood ant colonies, was beneficial for F. nitidulus. The guest ant was also more likely to be found in large host nests than small nests. Thus, our results show that the best habitat for the guest ant is a dense population of host nest mounds with a high proportion of large mounds. Conservation efforts should be directed at keeping the quality of the red wood ant habitats high to preserve their current populations and to increase colonization. This will not only benefit the guest ant, but also a plethora of other species, and help in maintaining the biodiversity of forests.

TI  - Bacterial diversity and predicted enzymatic function in a multipurpose surface water system - from wastewater effluent discharges to drinking water production
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME
AB  - Background Rivers and lakes are used for multiple purposes such as for drinking water (DW) production, recreation, and as recipients of wastewater from various sources. The deterioration of surface water quality with wastewater is well-known, but less is known about the bacterial community dynamics in the affected surface waters. Understanding the bacterial community characteristics -from the source of contamination, through the watershed to the DW production process-may help safeguard human health and the environment. Results The spatial and seasonal dynamics of bacterial communities, their predicted functions, and potential health-related bacterial (PHRB) reads within the Kokemaenjoki River watershed in southwest Finland were analyzed with the 16S rRNA-gene amplicon sequencing method. Water samples were collected from various sampling points of the watershed, from its major pollution sources (sewage influent and effluent, industrial effluent, mine runoff) and different stages of the DW treatment process (pre-treatment, groundwater observation well, DW production well) by using the river water as raw water with an artificial groundwater recharge (AGR). The beta-diversity analysis revealed that bacterial communities were highly varied among sample groups (R = 0.92, p < 0.001, ANOSIM). The species richness and evenness indices were highest in surface water (Chao1; 920 +/- 10) among sample groups and gradually decreased during the DW treatment process (DW production well; Chao1: 320 +/- 20). Although the phylum Proteobacteria was omnipresent, its relative abundance was higher in sewage and industrial effluents (66-80%) than in surface water (55%). Phyla Firmicutes and Fusobacteria were only detected in sewage samples. Actinobacteria was more abundant in the surface water (>= 13%) than in other groups (<= 3%). Acidobacteria was more abundant in the DW treatment process (>= 13%) than in others (<= 2%). In total, the share of PHRB reads was higher in sewage and surface water than in the DW treatment samples. The seasonal effect in bacterial communities was observed only on surface water samples, with the lowest diversity during summer. Conclusions The low bacterial diversity and absence of PHRB read in the DW samples indicate AGR can produce biologically stable and microbiologically safe drinking water. Furthermore, the significantly different bacterial communities at the pollution sources compared to surface water and DW samples highlight the importance of effective wastewater treatment for protecting the environment and human health.

AB  - Through the years, several papers have criticized climate policy decision-making for being naive with respect to how it views climate model outputs as objective facts and uses the outputs directly to program policies. From this and similar observations, many of the papers conclude that there is a need for shifting to a new approach on how climate policy makers may relate to climate change uncertainties. The article proposes such a shift by presenting a road map on how to address uncertainties in climate change adaptation. It consists of three major elements: first, to accept that in many cases we will not be able to reduce climate change uncertainties; second, to diversify the way in which we describe climate change uncertainties, moving from a one-dimensional technical perspective to a multidimensional perspective that applies uncertainties also to social and political processes and systems; and third, to change the way we address climate change uncertainties by moving from a predict-then-act to a reflect-then-act approach, implying that we must adapt to climate change even under high and varied forms of uncertainties. Embedded in this last point is to accept that, unlike for climate change mitigation, the precautionary principle will apply in many situations of climate change adaptation. In the last part of the article the usability of the proposed road map is demonstrated post ante on four Norwegian cases of climate-related natural hazard events.

TI  - An Overarching Model for Cross-Sector Strategic Transitions towards Sustainability in Municipalities and Regions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Municipal and regional governments can play a key role in global society's transition towards sustainability. However, municipal leaders often lack a sufficient overview of sustainability and thereby the capacity to coordinate efforts across sectors. Several municipal planning frameworks are available but vary greatly in terms of definitions, scope, and hands-on advice on processes. To complement and unify approaches, the framework for strategic sustainable development (FSSD) has been developed. It utilizes backcasting from operational boundary conditions for the full scope of social and ecological sustainability. This study aims to evaluate a recently developed model for long-term implementation of FSSD across sectors for more cohesive cooperation towards sustainability. This is done through participatory action research (PAR) in ten Swedish municipalities and regions. The evaluation is done to examine if the implementation model (i) lives up to its purpose to help sectors cooperate effectively by using the FSSD as a shared mental model, (ii) aid the handling of previously identified barriers to strategic sustainable development in municipalities and regions, (iii) may contain barriers of its own for appropriate use and (iv) has room for improvement. We used observations, dialogues, and surveys to capture the strengths, weaknesses, enablers, and barriers of the preliminary implementation model. While the compliance of the model varied, our findings show a general appreciation and identified the needs for the approach. From experiencing barriers for the application of the model, practitioners provided several ideas for additional support, such as assessment and alignment support of on-going work and further developed guiding material. In a second phase of the PAR project, application of the implementation model will continue, and such additional support will be developed and evaluated.

TI  - The plant available water as a controlling factor for the energy production from willow SRC Estimation of bio energy potentials in Germany
T2  - HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG
AB  - The EU and national policy goal to increase the share of renewable energy to 20 % of the total energy mix by 2020 is creating and will continue to create a growing demand for woody biomass. Woody biomass already provides 92 % of the renewable thermal energy in Germany. To secure the future sustainable supply of biomass, short rotation coppices (SRC) of fast-growing tree species such as willow and poplar are being established on arable land in Germany. This has led to a growing interest in finding out about the magnitude of the biomass potential using this form of cultivation. To evaluate amounts in Germany, GIS-based models were developed by MURACH et al. (2009) and AUST (2012) that calculate the biomass potential from water-management parameters, showing very different results. The approach chosen for the current study combines the methods of these studies and improves the calculation of evaporation, using the FAO-Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration and a crop coefficient of 1.2. Our modelling efforts suggest harvestable amounts of 117 million t/y of woody biomass from SRC on the maximum acreage of suitable sites all over Germany. However, the results of a more realistic (but still challenging) scenario of 300,000 ha of SRC, assuming an average biomass yield, project a capacity to supply 357,000 households with electricity and thermal energy or to provide 1.2 million households exclusively with electricity. Moreover, the findings also indicate that suitable sites are very heterogeneously distributed throughout Germany, which is largely related to groundwater availability. Therefore, the Northern German Plain is identified as a prime area for short rotation coppice systems. However, in regions with a negative climatic water balance, establishing SRC systems should be reconsidered or at least kept to a minimum due to the plants' high rate of water extraction, which could have negative effects on environmentally valuable wetlands and streams.

TI  - Effects of handling stress and moulting cycle on reproductive performance and digestive capacity of female giant freshwater prawn, <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i>
T2  - INTERNATIONAL AQUATIC RESEARCH
AB  - Energy metabolism is a critical component in assessing the fundamental aspect of organism fitness in prawn aquaculture farming. This is particularly important to maintain sustainable energy use to cope with stress and tolerance without affecting growth and reproduction functions. This study aims to determine and compare energy utilisation with a special focus on reproductive performance and digestive capacity concerning the handling-stress and moulting cycle of female Giant Freshwater Prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. There were two experimental groups, which are (i) grow-out pond-reared (G1): prawns were sampled randomly and concurrently for one day at an outdoor condition, and (ii) shortterm maintenance (G2): prawns were transported to an indoor hatchery, acclimated for two weeks, and sampled by staggered-method for two consecutive months. For the respective experimental conditions, haemolymph from five females was sampled at eight different moulting stages, whereby each stage was classified as reproductive and non-reproductive moulting cycles. Cultivated females at the grow-out pond had higher levels of haemolymph glucose (P < 0.05) at Sub-stages D1 (0.51 +/- 0.12 mg/mL), D3 (0.50 +/- 0.05 mg/mL), and A (0.71 +/- 0.09 mg/mL) during the reproductive moulting cycle compared to the short-term maintenance at similar moulting stages. Other findings showed that cultivated prawns at the grow-out pond had significantly (P < 0.05) higher glucose levels at Sub-stages D3 (0.57 +/- 0.09 mg/mL) and B (0.37 +/- 0.03 mg/mL) during the non-reproductive moulting cycle compared to the short-term maintenance indicating that energy was utilised to cope with the handling stress. We suggest that short-term maintenance may reduce the stressors factor and is applicable for hatchery operations to maintain the health of the prawn.

TI  - Pollinators on the polar edge of the Ecumene: taxonomy, phylogeography, and ecology of bumble bees from Novaya Zemlya
T2  - ZOOKEYS
AB  - The High Arctic bumble bee fauna is rather poorly known, while a growing body of recent molecular research indicates that several Arctic species may represent endemic lineages with restricted ranges. Such local endemics are in need of special conservation efforts because of the increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate changes. Here, we re-examine the taxonomic and biogeographic affinities of bumble bees from Novaya Zemlya using historical samples and recently collected materials (1895-1925 vs. 2015-2017). Three bumble bee species inhabit the Yuzhny (Southern) Island and the southern edge of Severny (Northern) Island of this archipelago: Bombus glacialis Friese, 1902, B. hyperboreus Schonherr, 1809, and B. pyrrhopygus Friese, 1902. Bombus glacialis shares three unique COI haplotypes that may indicate its long-term (pre-glacial) persistence on Novaya Zemlya. In contrast, Bombus hyperboreus and B. pyrrhopygus share a rather low molecular divergence from mainland populations, with the same or closely related haplotypes as those from Arctic Siberia and Norway. A brief re-description of Bombus pyrrhopygus based on the newly collected topotypes is presented. Habitats, foraging plants and life cycles of bumble bees on Novaya Zemlya are characterized, and possible causes of extremely low bumble bee abundance on the archipelago are discussed. The species-poor bumble bee fauna of Novaya Zemlya is compared with those in other areas throughout the Arctic. The mean bumble bee species richness on the Arctic Ocean islands is three times lower than that in the mainland Arctic areas (3.1 vs. 8.6 species per local fauna, respectively). General linear models (GLMs) indicate that this difference can be explained by specific environmental conditions of insular areas. Our findings highlight that the insularity is a significant factor sharply decreasing species richness in bumble bee assemblages on the Arctic Ocean archipelagoes through colder climate (lower summer temperatures), prevalence of harsh Arctic tundra landscapes with poor foraging resources, and in isolation from the mainland.

TI  - Conflict between heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility in haplodiploids (and sex chromosomes)
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - In many diploid species, the sex chromosomes play a special role in mediating reproductive isolation. In haplodiploids, where females are diploid and males haploid, the whole genome behaves similarly to the X/Zchromosomes of diploids. Therefore, haplodiploid systems can serve as a model for the role of sex chromosomes in speciation and hybridization. A previously described population of Finnish Formica wood ants displays genome-wide signs of ploidally and sexually antagonistic selection resulting from hybridization. Here, hybrid females have increased survivorship but hybrid males are inviable. To understand how the unusual hybrid population may be maintained, we developed a mathematical model with hybrid incompatibility, female heterozygote advantage, recombination and assortative mating. The rugged fitness landscape resulting from the co-occurrence of heterozygote advantage and hybrid incompatibility results in a sexual conflict in haplodiploids, which is caused by the ploidy difference. Thus, whereas heterozygote advantage always promotes long-term polymorphism in diploids, we find various outcomes in haplodiploids in which the population stabilizes either in favour of males, females or via maximizing the number of introgressed individuals. We discuss these outcomes with respect to the potential long-term fate of the Finnish wood ant population and provide approximations for the extension of the model to multiple incompatibilities. Moreover, we highlight the general implications of our results for speciation and hybridization in haplodiploids versus diploids and how the described fitness relationships could contribute to the outstanding role of sex chromosomes as hotspots of sexual antagonism and genes involved in speciation.

TI  - Spatial analysis of urban material stock with clustering algorithms: A Northern European case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY
AB  - A large share of construction material stock (MS) accumulates in urban built environments. To attain a more sustainable use of resources, knowledge about the spatial distribution of urban MS is needed. In this article, an innovative spatial analysis approach to urban MS is proposed. Within this scope, MS indicators are defined at neighborhood level and clustered with k-mean algorithms. The MS is estimated bottom-up with (a) material-intensity coefficients and (b) spatial data for three built environment components: buildings, road transportation, and pipes, using seven material categories. The city of Gothenburg, Sweden is used as a case study. Moreover, being the first case study in Northern Europe, the results are explored through various aspects (material composition, age distribution, material density), and, finally, contrasted on a per capita basis with other studies worldwide.
   The stock is estimated at circa 84 million metric tons. Buildings account for 73% of the stock, road transport 26%, and pipes 1%. Mineral-binding materials take the largest share of the stock, followed by aggregates, brick, asphalt, steel, and wood. Per capita, the MS is estimated at 153 metric tons; 62 metric tons are residential, which, in an international context, is a medium estimate. Denser neighborhoods with a mix of nonresidential and residential buildings have a lower proportion of MS in roads and pipes than low-density single-family residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, single-family residential neighborhoods cluster in mixed-age classes and show the largest content of wood. Multifamily buildings cluster in three distinct age classes, and each represent a specific material composition of brick, mineral binding, and steel. Future work should focus on megacities and contrasting multiple urban areas and, methodologically, should concentrate on algorithms, MS indicators, and spatial divisions of urban stock.

TI  - Land application of organic waste - Effects on the soil ecosystem
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - Growing populations and the increasing use of existing resources has led to growth in organic waste emissions. Therefore, a sustainable approach to managing this waste has become a major concern in densely populated areas. Biological treatment is an efficient method for reducing the amount of organic waste, and for producing energy. A large number of biogas plants and compost facilities that use organic waste as a substrate for electricity and fuel production are being built around the world. The biological treatment process in these plants produces large amounts of organic waste, and there is therefore a growing need to find a sustainable use for this material. Organic waste, such as biogas residues and compost can be a valuable fertilizer for agricultural soils. They can serve as a source of plant nutrients and can also improve soil structure and water holding capacity. However, as organic residues are known to contain both heavy metals and organic contaminants there is a need for long term field experiments to ensure that soil and plant quality is maintained. In order to investigate the potential risks and benefits of using organic waste in agriculture, an 8 year field experiment was established in central Sweden. Under realistic conditions, compost and biogas residues from source-separated household waste were compared with traditional mineral fertilizer. We examined crop yield and soil chemical and microbiological properties. The main conclusion from the field experiment was that biogas residues resulted in crop yields almost as high as the mineral fertilizer NPS. In addition, several important soil microbiological properties, such as substrate induced respiration, potential ammonium oxidation and nitrogen mineralization were improved after application of both biogas residues and compost. Moreover, no negative effects could be detected from using either of the organic wastes. In particular the genetic structure of the soil bacterial community appeared to resist changes caused by addition of organic waste. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Can intensively farmed arable land be favourable for birds during migration? The case of the Eurasian golden plover <i>Pluvialis apricaria</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY
AB  - Today's intensive farming practices are known to have affected farmland biodiversity negatively in many different ways. As far as birds are concerned, they are known to have suffered during both summer and winter. Relatively little is known about the effects on birds during migration. We studied the stopover ecology of the Eurasian golden plover Pluvialis apricaria, a species listed in EU Birds Directive, in intensively farmed arable land in southernmost Sweden in the autumns of 2003-2007. We used key ecological variables (length of stay, fat deposition and moult) as fitness proxies to evaluate how the birds manage in this habitat. Eurasian golden plovers were present in large numbers mainly on arable fields from early August to November and radio-tagged birds were found to stay in the area for up to three months. Adult birds carried out a substantial part of their flight feather moult during their stay. Body mass increased only somewhat during moult, but from the last stages of moult and onwards fuel loads corresponding to 24% above lean body mass (LBM) were accumulated at a rate of 0.5% of LBM per day, before the birds departed. Juveniles arrived later, from mid Sep., and had a similar pattern of fuel deposition. The fact that the birds choose to stay for long periods, moult in the area, and manage to store substantial fuel loads strongly suggests that Eurasian golden plovers do well in this intensively farmed arable land.

TI  - Temporal patterns in macrograzer effects on epilithic algae and meiofauna: a comparative approach to test for single species and whole grazer community effects
T2  - AQUATIC SCIENCES
AB  - Within the shallow littoral zones of lakes, periphyton is an essential component, representing an important source of primary production and a food resource for herbivores. Periphytic communities are abundantly inhabited by meiofaunal organisms, which are mostly dominated by nematodes. During the last 3 decades, consumer resource interactions between herbivore consumers and periphytic components (mainly algae) have been intensively studied. Although whole grazer community and single species effects on periphyton are known from field and laboratory experiments, the importance of single, dominant grazer taxa in direct comparison to whole community impacts is unknown. To investigate the continuity of grazing effects of a single, dominant macrograzer (Theodoxus fluviatilis, Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) on epilithic meiofauna and algae with respect to the whole grazer community, a temporally structured field experiment was carried out in Lake Erken (Sweden). Grazer impacts on periphytic algae and meiofauna were tested by controlling macrograzer access to littoral periphyton communities for 8 weeks in an exclosure/enclosure experimental design. Overall, the results showed macrograzer presence to have temporally constant, strongly negative effects on algal biomass as well as meiofaunal abundance and community composition. Moreover, T fluviatilis alone accounted for up to 80% of the grazing effects, indicative of their ability to regulate periphytic communities in lakes. The present study yields new insights into the effects of a single grazer species and stressed temporal patterns of consumer resource interactions in freshwater lakes.

TI  - Shelf Life and Safety of Vacuum Packed HPP-Treated Soaked Cod Fillets: Effects of Salt Content and Multilayer Plastic Film
T2  - FOODS
AB  - High microbiological quality standards, food safety, and environmental sustainability represent crucial topics in food production chains. For this reason, fish industries, which import salted and seasoned fish products from supplier countries, i.e., Norway, Denmark, USA (Alaska State), etc., have tried to reduce the salt content of each carton during transportation (reducing carbon emissions and the weight of major quantities of transported fish). In the present study, 360 differently processed fish fillet samples, belonging to the species Gadus macrocephalus caught in FAO zone 67, were microbiologically and chemically screened. This study aimed to provide original data concerning the applicability of sustainable solutions investigating the combined effects of salt content reduction combined with new recyclable multilayer plastic film packaging (vacuum skin packaging with two different oxygen transmission rate values). The microbiological results showed no substantial changes comparing the two differently salted products, highlighting their high hygienic characteristics which were also observed in their chemical analysis. The shelf life evolutions (comparing the two different studied plastic films) highlighted that, after 35 days from HPP treatments, bacterial loads gained high values, over 6 log cfu/g. This study highlights that, compared to the currently used plastic films, the results of the new and sustainable multilayer plastic films show that they can provide safe food matrices in combination with HPP technologies. Therefore, this preliminary investigation brings closer attention to alternative and environmentally sustainable production systems with their designs based on the multidisciplinary approach of food production systems.

TI  - Relation between modern pollen rain, vegetation and climate in northern China: Implications for quantitative vegetation reconstruction in a steppe environment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Vegetation reconstructions from palaeoecological records depend on adequate understanding of relationships between modern pollen, vegetation and climate. A key parameter for quantitative vegetation reconstructions is the Relative Pollen Productivity (RPP). Differences in both environmental and methodological factors are known to alter the RPP estimated significantly, making it difficult to determine whether the underlying pollen productivity does actually vary, and if so, why. In this paper, we present the results of a replication study for the Bashang steppe region, a typical steppe area in northern China, carried out in 2013 and 2014. In each year, 30 surface samples were collected for pollen analysis, with accompanying vegetation survey using the "Crackles Bequest Project" methodology. Sampling designs differed slightly between the two years: in 2013, sites were located completely randomly, whilst in 2014 sampling locations Were constrained to be Within a few km of roads. There is a strong inter-annual variability in both the pollen and the vegetation spectra therefore in RPPs, and annual precipitation may be a key influence on these variations. The pollen assemblages in both years are dominated by herbaceous taxa such as Artemisia, Amaranthaceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Cyperaceae, Fabaceae and Allium. Artemisia and Amaranthaceae pollen are significantly over-represented for their vegetation abundance. Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Fabaceae seem to have under-represented pollen for vegetation with correspondingly lower RPPs. Asteraceae seems to be well-represented, with moderate RPPs and less annual variation. Estimated Relevant Source Area of Pollen (RSAP) ranges from 2000 to 3000 m. Different sampling designs have an effect both on RSAP and RPPs and random sample selection may be the best strategy for obtaining robust estimates. Our results have implications for further pollen-vegetation relationship and quantitative vegetation reconstruction research in typical steppe areas and in other open habitats with strong inter-annual variation.

TI  - Institutional factors and strategic alliances in eastern and central Europe
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The study deals with institutional factors that have impact on the operation of east-west alliances. Applying Kostova and Roth's terminology of institutional and relational contexts, this paper aims to address how alliance relationship based on resources, learning and performance organizes and functions, and how institutional factors influence the alliance relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - To properly highlight the role of institutional factors, eastern and central Europe (ECE) is divided into four categories, namely fast adapters, high and low medium adapters and slow adapters. A total of 20 alliances operating in different country categories have been selected for the study. In all alliances, foreign partners are Swedish firms and engaged in the manufacturing industry, Semi-structured interviews containing both a fixed set of questions and a set of open-ended questions have been used for data collection.
   Findings - The impact of institutional factors on firms in slow-adapting countries was uniformly high, the initiatives taken were usually fruitless and ineffective. In the case of medium-adapters, the impact was largely mitigated over time as alliances passed through the different stages. The least impact was, as expected, observed among the alliances in fast-adapting countries. However, the result needs to be taken with some caution as the data include alliances where partners come from a single western country.
   Practical implications - For direct investment, managers need to take the institutional factors seriously as ECE countries undergo a transition period and the economical situations of these countries shows a wide variation. For example, if need of return is quick, the managers should invest in a fast-adapting country or in a medium-adapting country but not at all in a slow-adapting country.
   Originality/value - This paper makes a unique contribution by focusing institutional factors which affect strategic alliances in ECE. One future study can concern cultural impact on business environment and new business development in ECE. Another interesting area of research could deal with medium-adapting countries because the members of this group show different level of adaptation and performance.

TI  - Immunological approaches to biomass characterization and utilization
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB  - Plant biomass is the major renewable feedstock resource for sustainable generation of alternative transportation fuels to replace fossil carbon-derived fuels. Lignocellulosic cell walls are the principal component of plant biomass. Hence, a detailed understanding of plant cell wall structure and biosynthesis is an important aspect of bioenergy research. Cell walls are dynamic in their composition and structure, varying considerably among different organs, cells, and developmental stages of plants. Hence, tools are needed that are highly efficient and broadly applicable at various levels of plant biomass-based bioenergy research. The use of plant cell wall glycan-directed probes has seen increasing use over the past decade as an excellent approach for the detailed characterization of cell walls. Large collections of such probes directed against most major cell wall glycans are currently available worldwide. The largest and most diverse set of such probes consists of cell wall glycan-directed monoclonal antibodies (McAbs). These McAbs can be used as immunological probes to comprehensively monitor the overall presence, extractability, and distribution patterns among cell types of most major cell wall glycan epitopes using two mutually complementary immunological approaches, glycome profiling (an in vitro platform) and immunolocalization (an in situ platform). Significant progress has been made recently in the overall understanding of plant biomass structure, composition, and modifications with the application of these immunological approaches. This review focuses on such advances made in plant biomass analyses across diverse areas of bioenergy research.

TI  - Sustainability of nuclear energy with regard to decommissioning and waste management
T2  - ENERGY AND SUSTAINABILITY III
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Energy and Sustainability
AB  - The paper analyses the sustainability aspects of nuclear power with regard to environmental liabilities associated with decommissioning of nuclear facilities and with waste management.
   Sustainability is defined and literature on evaluation of sustainability in the nuclear and coal energy fields is reviewed. It is found that the results are incoherent and that methodologies for evaluations are needed as well as adequately structured knowledge bases. Examples of such tools and work are presented from the perspective of the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority.
   Different aspects of nuclear energy sustainability are reviewed and summarized, and it is found that appropriate management of the nuclear liability associated with protection of health and the environment - now and in the future - is a necessary prerequisite in order for nuclear power to qualify as sustainable.
   Analyses in a historical perspective show that sustainability awareness has been around for at least as long as agriculture, and that some shortcomings are actually modern inventions. The analyses also show that sustainability awareness may appear as trends and that comprehensive perspectives are essential.
   Planning for decommissioning and the estimation of associated costs have proven to be treacherous exercises. Moreover, the timing of the planning must be based on the need for appropriate finance so that adequate funds are available at the time when they are needed. It is the duty of our generation to assess what is adequate and to find responsible solutions. But we should also ask the next generation and carefully consider the perspective that they provide to us.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of species richness in a riparian landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim To test for control of vascular plant species richness in the riparian corridor by exploring three contrasting (although not mutually exclusive) hypotheses: (1) longitudinal patterns in riparian plant species richness are governed by local, river-related processes independent of the regional species richness, (2) riparian plant species richness is controlled by dispersal along the river (longitudinal control), and (3) the variation in riparian plant species richness mirrors variation in regional richness (lateral control).
   Location The riparian zones of the free-flowing Vindel River and its surrounding river valley, northern Sweden.
   Methods We used data from three surveys, undertaken at 10-year intervals, of riparian reaches (200-m stretches of riverbank) spanning the entire river. In addition, we surveyed species richness of vascular plants in the uplands adjacent to the river in 3.75-km(2) large plots along the same regional gradient. We explored the relationship between riparian and upland flora, and various environmental variables. We also evaluated temporal variation in downstream patterns of the riparian flora.
   Results Our results suggest that local species richness in boreal rivers is mainly a result of local, river-related processes and dispersal along the corridor. The strongest correlation between species richness and the environment was a negative one between species number and soil pH, but pH varied within a narrow range. We did not find evidence for a correlation between species richness on regional and local scales. We found that the local patterns of species richness for naturally occurring vascular plants were temporally variable, probably in response to large-scale disturbance caused by extreme floods. Most previous studies have found a unimodal pattern of species richness with peaks in the middle reaches of a river. In contrast, on two of three occasions corresponding to major flooding events, we found that the distribution of species richness of naturally occurring vascular plants resembled that of regional diversity: a monotonic decrease from headwater to coast. We also found high floristic similarity between the riparian corridor and the surrounding landscape.
   Main conclusions These results suggest that local processes control patterns of riparian species richness, but that species composition is also highly dependent on the regional species pool. We argue that inter-annual variation in flood disturbance is probably the most important factor producing temporal variability of longitudinal species richness patterns.

TI  - A Combined Simulation-Optimization Approach for Robust Timetabling on Main Railway Lines
T2  - TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE
AB  - Performance aspects such as travel time, punctuality, and robustness are conflicting goals of utmost importance for railway transports. To successfully plan railway traffic, it is therefore important to strike a balance between planned travel times and expected delays. In railway operations research, a lot of attention has been given to construct models and methods to generate robust timetables-that is, timetables with the potential to withstand design errors, incorrect data, and minor everyday disturbances. Despite this, the current state of practice in railway planning is to construct timetables manually, possibly with support of microsimulation for robustness evaluation. This paper aims to narrow the gap between the state-of-the-art optimization-based research approaches and the current state of practice to construct timetables by combining simulation and optimization. The paper proposes a combined simulation-optimization approach for double-track lines, which generalizes previous work to allow full flexibility in the order of trains by including a new and more generic model to predict delays. By utilizing delay data from simulation, the approach can make socioeconomically optimal modifications of a given timetable by minimizing predicted disutility-the weighted sum of scheduled travel time and total predicted delay. In a large simulation experiment on the heavily congested Swedish Western Main Line, it is demonstrated that compared with a real-life, manually constructed timetable, large reductions of delays as well as improvements in punctuality could be obtained for a small cost of marginally longer travel times. The cost of scheduled in-vehicle travel time and mean delay was reduced by 5% on average, representing a large improvement for a highly utilized railway line. Furthermore, a separate scaling experiment indicates that the approach can also be suitable for larger problems.

TI  - Urbanisation impacts plumage colouration in a songbird across Europe: Evidence from a correlational, experimental and meta-analytical approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - Urbanisation is accelerating across the globe, transforming landscapes, presenting organisms with novel challenges, shaping phenotypes and impacting fitness. Urban individuals are claimed to have duller carotenoid-based colouration, compared to their non-urban counterparts, the so-called 'urban dullness' phenomenon. However, at the intraspecific level, this generalisation is surprisingly inconsistent and often based on comparisons of single urban/non-urban populations or studies from a limited geographical area.Here, we combine correlational, experimental and meta-analytical data on a common songbird, the great tit Parus major, to investigate carotenoid-based plumage colouration in urban and forest populations across Europe.We find that, as predicted, urban individuals are paler than forest individuals, although there are large population-specific differences in the magnitude of the urban-forest contrast in colouration. Using one focal region (Malmo, Sweden), we reveal population-specific processes behind plumage colouration differences, which are unlikely to be the result of genetic or early-life conditions, but instead a consequence of environmental factors acting after fledging.Finally, our meta-analysis indicates that the urban dullness phenomenon is well established in the literature, for great tits, with consistent changes in carotenoid-based plumage traits, particularly carotenoid chroma, in response to anthropogenic disturbances.Overall, our results provide evidence for uniformity in the 'urban dullness' phenomenon but also highlight that the magnitude of the effect on colouration depends on local urban characteristics. Future long-term replicated studies, covering a wider range of species and feeding guilds, will be essential to further our understanding of the eco-evolutionary implications of this phenomenon.

TI  - Identifying Suitable Bioeconomic Cluster Sites-Combining GIS-MCDA and Operational Research Methods
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
AB  - A transition to a bioeconomy implies an increased focus on efficient and sustainable use of biological resources. A common, but often neglected feature of these resources is their location dependence. To optimize their use, for example in bioeconomic industrial clusters, this spatial aspect should be integrated in analyses. Optimal design and localization of a bioeconomic cluster with respect to the various biological and non-biological resources required for the cluster, the composition of industrial facilities in the cluster, as well as the demands of the outputs of the cluster, is crucial for profitability and sustainability. We suggest that optimal design and location of bioeconomic clusters can benefit from the use of a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in combination with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Operations Research modeling. The integration of MCDA and GIS determines a set of candidate locations based on various criteria, including resource availability, accessibility, and usability. A quantitative analysis of the flow of resources between and within the different industries is then conducted based on economic Input-Output analysis. Then, the cluster locations with the highest potential profit, and their composition of industrial facilities, are identified in an optimization model. A case study on forest-based bioeconomic clusters in the ostfold county of Norway is presented to exemplify this methodology, the expectation being that further implementation of the method at the national level could help decision makers in the planning of a smoother transition from a fossil-based economy to a bioeconomy.

TI  - So, What Am I Supposed to Do? A Multilevel Examination of Role Clarity
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB  - Although prior research generally holds that role clarity is affected by both individual characteristics and organizational contexts, current conceptual or empirical models do not reflect the multilevel nature of these antecedents. A more complete understanding of how role clarity emanates from different organizational levels is necessary to help prevent poor job performance and other harmful consequences of ambiguous role expectations. To address this, I begin this research by investigating the effects of internal work locus of control, general self-efficacy, and leader-member exchange on role clarity. With respect to the cross-level effects, I focus on the roles of a manager's control style and the organization's strategy-making pattern. Analyses of a multi-industry, multilevel dataset collected from 724 employees and 124 managers in 25 organizations in Finland suggest that all of the individual-level independent variables and a deliberate strategy-making pattern improve role clarity. However, a deliberate strategy-making pattern negatively moderates the relationship between general self-efficacy and role clarity. Finally, even though an outcome-based control system causes role ambiguity among employees in most functional areas, it may be an effective driver of role clarity among employees in sales jobs.

TI  - Support your future today: enhancing sustainable transitions by experimenting at academic conferences
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Major societal changes which challenge societal functions and actors' activities are needed to enhance sustainable development. Thus sustainable transitions research emphasizes co-evolutionary approaches involving a multitude of actors including the business sector, the government, and academia. Academic research can catalyse sustainable transitions by critically analyse current societal trends to develop and disseminate new knowledge. At research conferences, researchers and practitioners meet to network and discuss recent research findings providing arenas for testing and evaluating ideas to enhance sustainable transitions. This however requires some modifications of the standard design of a research conference.
   Here we report learning outcomes from experimenting at the 18th international Greening of Industry Network conference during 21-24 October 2012 in Linkoping, Sweden. The conference was a combination of a traditional conference structure with different interactive elements such as sustainability jam-sessions to discuss future challenges of six companies and clusters of companies at their site. The intention of doing so was to enhance learning outcomes both for visiting conference delegates and among actors in the host region. This was perceived by the participants as an innovative approach fostering both problem solving and creation of new ideas. Four out of the six companies continued dialogues about sustainable production fields or bio-refineries with Linkoping University.
   In addition we introduce and summarize research findings presented at the conference which were further developed into research articles. The essence of these articles covers sustainable industry management; cleaner production; industrial ecology; cooperation between industry, governments and academics; dissemination of concepts and technologies; methods and tools for modelling and measuring of industrial symbiosis, CO2 performance and eco-efficiency.

TI  - Morphodynamics of Boulder-Bed Semi-Alluvial Streams in Northern Fennoscandia: A Flume Experiment to Determine Sediment Self-Organization
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
AB  - In northern Fennoscandia, semi-alluvial boulder-bed channels with coarse glacial legacy sediment are abundant, and due to widespread anthropogenic manipulation during timber-floating, unimpacted reference reaches are rare. The landscape context of these semi-alluvial rapids-with numerous mainstem lakes that buffer high flows and sediment connectivity in addition to a regional low sediment yield-contribute to low amounts of fine sediment and incompetent flows to transport boulders. To determine the morphodynamics of semi-alluvial rapids and potential self-organization of sediment with multiple high flows, a flume experiment was designed and carried out to mimic conditions in semi-alluvial rapids in northern Fennoscandia. Two slope setups (2% and 5%) were used to model a range of flows (Q(1) (summer high flow), Q(2), Q(10), and Q(50)) in a 8 x 1.1 m flume with a sediment distribution analogous to field conditions; bed topography was measured using structure-from-motion photogrammetry after each flow to obtain DEMs. No classic steep coarse-bed channel bedforms (e.g., step-pools) developed. However, similarly to boulder-bed channels with low relative submergence, at Q(10) and Q(50) flows, sediment deposited upstream of boulders and scoured downstream. Because the Q(50) flow was not able to rework the channel by disrupting grain-interlocking from preceding lower flows, transporting boulders, or forming channel-spanning boulders, the channel-forming discharge is larger than the Q(50). These results have implications for restoration of gravel spawning beds in northern Fennoscandia and highlight the importance of large grains in understanding channel morphodynamics.

TI  - Consideration of high-efficient Waste-to-Energy with district energy for sustainable solid waste management in Korea
T2  - 15TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON DISTRICT HEATING AND COOLING (DHC15-2016)
CP  - 15th International Symposium on District Heating and Cooling (DHC)
AB  - The global hierarchy of sustainable solid waste management is ranked with source reduction, reuse, recycle, waste-to-energy, and landfill. After adoption of the Paris Agreement, the main issue in energy usage is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, universally. In this context, the necessity of renewable energies was increased. However unpredictable fall in oil prices brings about the price drop of recyclables and threatens the motive of recycling activities and the frame of solid waste management hierarchy as well. In order to react properly on in the energy and waste management sectors, the current situation of Waste-to-Energy(WtE) and District Heating and Cooling (DHC) in Korea were investigated compared with the EU and considered the suggestions for improvement of WtE plants and the synergy between WtE and DHC network.
   As the mixed residual waste to be treated may be increased, WtE is becoming weightier for the climate change and sustainable society. Since the late 1990s, there had established directives in terms of reducing final disposal and increasing the usage of sustainable energy gained from many sources, especially from WtE as a district energy. Including Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden which have introduced landfill bans and promoted the WtE and renewable energy usage. As a result, the WtE technology aiming at maximizing energy recovery is well developed and simultaneously the DHC system connected with WtE plant is promoted. Thus the enhancement for the current WtE system and for the synergies with district energy, the changes in policy and techniques are required. In technical view, treatment of raw Municipal Solid Waste MSW through bio-drying MBT(Mechanical Biological Treatment) will reduce the final disposal and further produce high calorific value of Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF) by removing moisture. Burning SRF will increase the power generation efficiencies rather introducing raw MSW. Additionally, high-efficient WtE technology which applied widely through Japan, Denmark and the Netherlands also enhance the total energy recovery for securing the district energy. Eventually, combined technology between bio-drying MBT with high-efficient WtE and DHC can reduce the GHG emission and achieve the sustainable development goals. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Impacts of extreme winter warming in the sub-Arctic: growing season responses of dwarf shrub heathland
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change scenarios predict an increased frequency of extreme climatic events. In Arctic regions, one of the most profound of these are extreme and sudden winter warming events in which temperatures increase rapidly to above freezing, often causing snow melt across whole landscapes and exposure of ecosystems to warm temperatures. Following warming, vegetation and soils no longer insulated below snow are then exposed to rapidly returning extreme cold. Using a new experimental facility established in sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland in northern Sweden, we simulated an extreme winter warming event in the field and report findings on growth, phenology and reproduction during the subsequent growing season. A 1-week long extreme winter warming event was simulated in early March using infrared heating lamps run with or without soil warming cables. Both single short events delayed bud development of Vaccinium myrtillus by up to 3 weeks in the following spring (June) and reduced flower production by more than 80%: this also led to a near-complete elimination of berry production in mid-summer. Empetrum hermaphroditum also showed delayed bud development. In contrast, Vaccinium vitis-idaea showed no delay in bud development, but instead appeared to produce a greater number of actively growing vegetative buds within plots warmed by heating lamps only. Again, there was evidence of reduced flowering and berry production in this species. While bud break was delayed, growing season measurements of growth and photosynthesis did not reveal a differential response in the warmed plants for any of the species. These results demonstrate that a single, short, extreme winter warming event can have considerable impact on bud production, phenology and reproductive effort of dominant plant species within sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland. Furthermore, large interspecific differences in sensitivity are seen. These findings are of considerable concern, because they suggest that repeated events may potentially impact on the biodiversity and productivity of these systems should these extreme events increase in frequency as a result of global change. Although climate change may lengthen the growing season by earlier spring snow melt, there is a profound danger for these high-latitude ecosystems if extreme, short-lived warming in winter exposes plants to initial warm temperatures, but then extreme cold for the rest of the winter. Work is ongoing to determine the longer term and wider impacts of these events.

T2  - SOCIAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF MODERN GLOBALISM (SCTCGM 2018)
CP  - Conference on Social and Cultural Transformations in the Context of Modern Globalism (SCTCGM)
AB  - Russia has resorted to retaliation because of the Western sanctions; on August 6, 2014 an embargo against the EU countries, USA, Canada, Australia and Norway in response to Western sanctions was introduced. Later five more countries have been added to the blacklist. At the moment the embargo was extended until the end of 2018.
   The embargo has been introduced into a number of groups of food products. Since 2014, Russia began to use the import substitution policy, which began to benefit recently. (Russian Government, 2014) The objectives of the state program include: development of import-substitution sub-sectors of agriculture including vegetables, fruits, dairy and meat cattle breeding, using the competitive advantages of the country, most notably the presence of large areas of agricultural land. There is an increase in revenues of producers of agricultural products. Sustainable development of rural areas is observed as a precondition for the conservation of labor force and the territorial integrity of the country. Exports of food and agricultural raw materials increase for saturation of domestic agricultural market.
   Despite the initial deterioration of the economic situation in the country after the introduction of Russian embargo expressed in the devaluation of the ruble, as a consequence of the increase of the inflation rate, excluding cheap imported goods from shelves, there is a sharp decrease in the purchasing power of the population. At the moment there is a gradual recovery of the Russian economy as a result of the food embargo. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

TI  - Apparent resistance to brodifacoum in <i>Rattus rattus</i> in a New Zealand site with no history of anticoagulant-based rodent control
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Context. Anticoagulants have been used in New Zealand for decades, but few data are available on the sustainability of these toxins for rodent control. It is important to regularly monitor for resistance in long-term brodifacoum-use areas and establish a database for future references. Aims. This study aimed to estimate the effective dose (ED50) of brodifacoum for ship rats from an area of New Zealand with no history of brodifacoum use, in order to establish a blood-clotting response test for assessing resistance in rodent populations from other areas. Methods. A ranging study was conducted whereby successive groups of ship rats were administered brodifacoum doses that were increased or decreased progressively, until an International Normalised Ratio (INR) of 3.6 was reached. Linear regression was used to model the relationship between dose and INR, and ED50 dose was estimated using the resulting model. Results. None of the rats appeared susceptible to brodifacoum at previously reported LD50 exposures for this species. The ED(50 )of brodifacoum was estimated to be 2.88 mg/kg for males and 3.81 mg/kg for females. These values are 6-8 times greater than the previously published lethal dose values for ship rats in New Zealand. Conclusions. Blood-clotting inhibition was detected in the rats only following high doses of brodifacoum, which may indicate resistance within the sampled population. Implications. Relatively low susceptibility, or resistance, to brodifacoum in New Zealand ship rats may be mediated by spatial connections between areas with different histories and patterns of anticoagulant rodenticide use.

TI  - Participatory multicriteria decision analysis with Web-HIPRE:: a case of lake regulation policy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
AB  - Environmental decision making typically concerns several stakeholders with conflicting views. Multicriteria decision analysis provides transparent ways to elicit and communicate individual preferences. When the stakeholders clearly understand each other's views, a consensus can be reached more easily. Computer software provides a substantial enhancement to support participatory decision making processes, for example, in the preference elicitation and in the analysis of the results. In this paper, we describe the first web-based multicriteria decision support software called Web-HIPRE, and the use of it in participatory environmental modelling. The world wide web provides new possibilities to support the process, for example, by allowing distributed decision support. The stakeholders can be located in different geographical areas, especially in environmental problems. We illustrate the use of Web-HIPRE in a case dealing with the evaluation of regulation policies for the Lake Paijanne in Finland. Decision analysis interviews were carried out and preference models of some typical stakeholders were collaboratively analyzed in order to increase the understanding of other stakeholders' views. This proved to be an applicable approach in trying to reach consensus between the stakeholders. Web-HIPRE also provided a flexible way to allow complementary support via the web.

TI  - Altitude is a better predictor of the habitat requirements of epixylic bryophytes and lichens than the presence of coarse woody debris in mountain forests: a study in Poland
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - Key message In order to preserve the continuity of epiphytic and epixylic cryptogamic flora, two things are essential: maintaining the near-natural character of a forest community in relation to the montane zonation and more sustainable forest management in relation to deadwood. Context Lichens and bryophytes are common species that inhabit dead wood. The relationship between their habitat requirements, which can be expressed by their Ellenberg indicator values and the characteristics of dead logs, are not yet known. Aims We formulated the hypothesis that altitude is positively correlated with the demands of species for higher light and lower temperature, while the decomposition stage of deadwood is positively correlated with species' requirements for nutrients and moisture. Moreover, we assumed that there would be differences in the habitat requirements among specific groups of species, i.e., lichens, liverworts, and mosses. Methods A total of 629 logs that were colonized by bryophytes and lichens were analyzed in terms of their mean Ellenberg indicator values in order to determine whether there is a link between the location, decomposition of logs and the species' environmental requirements. Results Altitude correlated with the moisture and nutrients in the habitats of liverworts and mosses and light and soil acidification only in mosses. Conclusions The obtained results demonstrate that the altitudinal distribution of epixylic species in a montane region is of greater importance than the deadwood properties like decomposition stage and moisture content.

Information on national methods and field data were collected from 11 countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Sweden, and UK). The sampling included 22 stream types situated in 11 different Ecoregions. Within each country samples were taken in spring and one additional season (summer or autumn) using both the national method and the STAR-AQEM method. A single anthropogenic stressor was also defined for each stream type sampled within the project, with the three main stressor types being organic pollution (including eutrophication), toxic pollution and habitat degradation. In addition, not impacted reference sites were sampled in each country. A common set of metrics was calculated and compared between the methods. The majority of national methods employed had many features in common. Most of the 12 metrics analysed using the values derived from the STAR-AQEM method and the various national methods correlated significantly, and positively to each other. There was no clear pattern with respect to the differences between metric results obtained using STAR-AQEM and national methods. For some metrics, number of EPT-taxa and families, the value obtained was higher when using the majority of national methods when compared to the STAR-AQEM method. Variability in metric results between methods could not be explained from differences in sampling effort. Sorting in the field and sub-sampling appeared to affect e.g., number of taxa found negatively. The results of the present study supports that inter-calibration in Europe can be undertaken using samples collected with the existing national methods.

TI  - Breeding for Climate Change Resilience: A Case Study of Loblolly Pine (<i>Pinus taeda</i> L.) in North America
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
AB  - Earth's atmosphere is warming and the effects of climate change are becoming evident. A key observation is that both the average levels and the variability of temperature and precipitation are changing. Information and data from new technologies are developing in parallel to provide multidisciplinary opportunities to address and overcome the consequences of these changes in forest ecosystems. Changes in temperature and water availability impose multidimensional environmental constraints that trigger changes from the molecular to the forest stand level. These can represent a threat for the normal development of the tree from early seedling recruitment to adulthood both through direct mortality, and by increasing susceptibility to pathogens, insect attack, and fire damage. This review summarizes the strengths and shortcomings of previous work in the areas of genetic variation related to cold and drought stress in forest species with particular emphasis on loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), the most-planted tree species in North America. We describe and discuss the implementation of management and breeding strategies to increase resilience and adaptation, and discuss how new technologies in the areas of engineering and genomics are shaping the future of phenotype-genotype studies. Lessons learned from the study of species important in intensively-managed forest ecosystems may also prove to be of value in helping less-intensively managed forest ecosystems adapt to climate change, thereby increasing the sustainability and resilience of forestlands for the future.

TI  - Underground parking lot at Turku market square - Zero energy parking hall and the biggest solar energy storage in the world
T2  - 12TH NORDIC SYMPOSIUM ON BUILDING PHYSICS (NSB 2020)
CP  - 12th Nordic Symposium on Building Physics (NSB)
AB  - This paper opens the case Turku market square underground parking lot from the energy perspective. Also constructional and historical aspects are presented. Heavily populated city center has faced several challenges, such as intense traffic. Uncomfortable local tailpipe emissions and lack of parking spaces have decreased living conditions for the citizens and visitors. Therefore, total renovation of main market square of Turku was started in autumn 2018. Together with that, municipality should respond not only to primary needs, but also to national and global environmental targets. One of the new strategy objectives for Turku is being carbon-neutral city by 2029. Hence, project was based on large-scale renewable resources utilization for urban underground spaces. Research and analysis of possible technical solutions was made. Modem time is characterized by climate change and strong measures that need to be taken to stop the global warming. The heat, cold and electricity should be produced in a carbon neutral manner This doesn't exclude heated multilevel car parking facilities either. As the parking capacity grows and finding a free place is easier, a positive environmental effect is expected to be reached. The described underground parking lot in Turku is first of its kind in many ways: 1) Never before underground parking lot has dug up and constructed into clay-based soils in Finland, 2) it is probably the first zero carbon energy parking hall in Europe and 3) it has the biggest solar thermal energy storage in the world.

TI  - Flexibility of habitat use in <i>Eptesicus nilssonii</i>:: does the species profit from anthropogenically altered habitats?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY
AB  - In an environment subjected to rapid anthropogenic alterations, the distribution and abundance of mammalian species often reflect their flexibility in habitat use. The northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) is patchily distributed in Germany, where it is classified as a critically endangered species, but is abundant in Scandinavia. To assess its flexibility in habitat use, we radiotracked 10 females and 3 males captured at a maternity roost in Lower Saxony, Germany, during the summers 2002-2003. These bats had access to a variety of habitats including pristine areas (unimproved grassland and forest) and anthropogenically altered habitats (pastures, euthrophic lakes, urban area). The widely overlapping home ranges had a median area of 524 ha. They extended asymmetrically around the maternity roost and reflected a preference for elevations around and below roost level, that is, 365 m elevation. Males traveled up to 70 km per night during exploring flights. E. nilssonii used forest habitats opportunistically before birth of the young and avoided them thereafter, whereas most bats preferred urban habitats and especially streetlamps after births. Intraspecific encounters were more frequent after births, particularly around streetlamps, suggesting an increased intraspecific competition at these sites. Interestingly, females spent 27% but males only 3% of their foraging time hunting with conspecifics. Thus, the species is a habitat generalist for which urban areas provide a supplementary seasonal habitat. However, because such habitats may not always remain profitable, natural habitats of forest and grassland will remain essential to the survival of this bat species in Germany.

TI  - Making plans or "just thinking about the trip"? Understanding people's travel planning in practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB  - ICT solutions have been proposed as a means for changing environmentally unfavourable traffic behaviour by providing better, real-time and more accessible travel information. However, prevailing models of travel choice and travel behaviour tend to overemphasise the impact and importance of information and the individualistic perspective. The issue of choice and travel planning in everyday life situations, and how information is used and acted on in these processes, was examined in a qualitative study in Stockholm, Sweden. Practice Theory was used as the theoretical framework for the study. Interviews were supplemented with an explorative diary and photo assignment to bring unreflected choices and actions of planning travel to the conscious level.
   The results showed that travel planning involves the immediate situation where planning and decisions are made, but also aspirations, cognitive/time/material limitations, social norms and social relations that extend widely in time and space. Definitions of travel planning and travel information based on the situated practices of planning are suggested. In the muddle of everyday life, travel planning takes place in the brief moments where circumstances at different levels - time, place, the social realm - interact and are considered or directly acted upon. In the development of new ICT-based travel information services, the role of technology in changing normal practices should be considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - LATVIAN RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY IN THE CONTEXT OF EU INITIATIVES
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Energy security and reduction of dependence on energy imports is a key issue on the EU's agenda in the context of today's global challenges. The resource potential of renewable energy expands the capabilities of EU member states to increase energy sustainability and attract additional investments to implement the green transformation of national economies. The EU has adopted a number of initiatives under Directive EU 2018/2001, REPowerEU, which are synchronized with "The European Green Deal". They are aimed at boosting the development of renewable energy. These EU initiatives and the need to increase energy security and sustainability make the development of renewable energy relevant for Latvia. The subject of the study is the content and features of Latvia's energy policy. The purpose of the scientific research is to study the key trends in the development of Latvia's renewable energy policy in the context of EU initiatives. Research methodology: systematic approach, methods of analysis and generalization. One of the key areas of the government's energy policy is the development of renewable energy. This is stated in the National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 and the Sustainable Development Strategy until 2030. Key tasks include synchronising the efforts of the state, business, the public and stakeholders in developing energy security by increasing the use of energy from renewable sources, attracting investment in the energy sector to promote a green economic transformation, energy efficiency and creating a culture of responsible resource consumption. Latvia has identified key areas for the development of renewable energy in line with the content of its energy policy and relevant EU initiatives. Considerable attention is being paid to optimising the regulatory framework. The Green Channel online platform has been created to coordinate the efforts of the government and stakeholders in developing key sectors of the national economy, including renewable energy. The resource of cross-border cooperation is actively used in the implementation of projects for the construction of wind farms for the production of electricity and the necessary infrastructure for its supply to domestic and foreign consumers. The research phases of the Latvian-Estonian offshore wind project ELWIND and the construction of the Kurzeme wind farm with the assistance of the Swedish company Eolus and the German company PNE have been launched. Domestic stakeholders are interested in building solar parks and related infrastructure. Considerable attention is being paid to the digitalisation of the energy sector in order to optimise the management of the energy market and consumer services. Results of the study: the priority direction of Latvia's energy policy is the development of renewable energy in the context of increasing the level of energy security of the state and correlation with relevant EU initiatives; the national government promotes the optimisation of the content of the regulatory framework in the field of renewable energy, expands opportunities for cross-border cooperation and involves stakeholders' initiative in project implementation; measures are taken to digitalise the energy sector and create a culture of responsible energy consumption.

TI  - Climate change impacts assessment on railway infrastructure in urban environments
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB  - Climate change impacts can escalate the deteriorating rate of infrastructures and impact the infrastructure's functionality, safety, operation and maintenance (O&M). This research explores climate change's influence on urban railway infrastructure. Given the geographical diversity of Sweden, the railway network is divided into different climate zones utilizing the K-means algorithm. Reliability analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazard Model is proposed to integrate meteorological parameters and operational factors to predict the degree of impacts of different climatic parameters on railway infrastructure assets. The proposed methodology is validated by selecting a number of switches and crossings (S&Cs), which are critical components in railways for changing the route, located in different urban railway stations across various climate zones in Sweden. The study explores various databases and proposes a climatic feature to identify climate-related risks of S&C assets. Furthermore, different meteorological covariates are analyzed to understand better the dependency between asset health and meteorological parameters. Infrastructure asset managers can tailor suitable climate adaptation measures based on geographical location, asset age, and other life cycle parameters by identifying vulnerable assets and determining significant covariates. Sensitivity analysis of significant covariates at one of the urban railway stations shows precipitation increment reveal considerable variation in the asset reliability.

TI  - Does the spatiotemporal distribution of livestock influence forage patch selection in Eurasian lynx <i>Lynx lynx</i>?
T2  - WILDLIFE BIOLOGY
AB  - Depredation on livestock is one of the main conflicts associated with Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx conservation in Norway. Our study investigates how Eurasian lynx utilise high-density patches of free-ranging and unguarded livestock (domestic sheep Ovis aries and semi-domestic reindeer Rangifer tarandus) as compared to patches associated with low-density wild ungulate prey, roe deer Capreolus capreolus. We monitored 10 radio-collared lynx in central Norway in two seasons that differed in ungulate distribution and density. According to the 'optimal foraging theory' an animal should preferentially utilise areas with more abundant food if not constrained by other factors; therefore we predicted that lynx should select patches containing livestock. Contrary to our prediction the results indicate no selection for livestock patches in any season. In contrast, a clear preference was shown for roe deer patches in both seasons. Our findings support the hypothesis that lynx depredation on livestock seems to be affected by chance encounter rates, rather than by active selection for livestock-dense patches. We conclude that habitat selection by lynx seemed to be governed by a number of other factors than food alone, and that lynx predation on livestock, especially on sheep, should not be regarded as being ecologically equivalent to predation on wild prey.

TI  - Increasing University Competitiveness through Assessment of Green Content in Curriculum and Eco-Labeling in Higher Education
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Growing environmental problems and increasing requirements of green jobs force universities around the world not only to transform their curricula but also to enrich existing ones with contents related to the promotion of sustainable development. This paper aims to show the importance of measuring and monitoring the share of green contents in all university activities, as only in that way it is possible to monitor trends and give realistic assessments of their effect and importance. The paper presents a comparative analysis of different types of methodologies for assessing sustainable activities at universities as well as research conducted at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia and its comparison with the University of Gothenburg (Sweden). This research aims to point out the importance of increasing competitiveness in higher education through assessment of green content in a curriculum and its promotion. In this way, through eco-labeling methodology, it would be easier to identify those contents that, in a certain share, contribute to the promotion of sustainable development. Furthermore, this methodology can easily be extended across the country and the region, which would bring positive effects to all stakeholders in higher education.

From two case studies (the Norwegian regions of Lista and Tananger), it is shown that it was possible to control the flow of goods up and down the coast at certain bottlenecks but that this also created an unstable society in which conflict between neighboring groups occurred often. More specifically the paper outlines an organizational strategy that may be applicable cross-culturally.

TI  - Nurses as agents for achieving environmentally sustainable health systems: A bibliometric analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT
AB  - Aim To analyse the current scientific knowledge and research lines focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including the role of nurses. Background There seem to be differences between creating interventions focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including nurses, and the scarcity of research on this topic, framed on the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods A bibliometric analysis was carried out, via three databases (Web of Science, Scopus and Pubmed), and the guideline recommendations were followed to select bibliometric data. Results The search resulted in 159 publications, significantly increasing the trends from 2017 to 2021 (p = .028). The most relevant countries in this area were the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden. Also, the top articles were from relevant journals, indexed in Journal Citation Report, and the first and the second quartiles linked to the nursing field and citations (p < .001). Conclusion Education is key to achieving environmentally sustainable health systems via institutions and policies. Implications for Nursing Management There is a lack of experimental data and policies on achieving or maintaining environmentally sustainable health care systems, indicating that nurses have an important role and should be consulted and included in decision-making policies regarding sustainability in the health care systems.

TI  - Teachers' personal epistemologies and professional development
T2  - JOURNAL OF FURTHER AND HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - This article deals with the personal epistemologies developed by teachers who undergo academic continuing education on an advanced level at a time when conflicting discourses form the basis of teaching in today's school, i.e. academisation on one hand and measurability and accountability in the name of New Public Management on the other. To give the interviewed teachers in this study an opportunity to clarify and become more aware of their epistemologies and to assist in getting started, we initially presented concepts developed in an academic discourse: Hofer's account of different, interrelated dimensions of 'personal epistemologies', clustered in two areas: the nature of knowledge, and the nature or process of knowing. As a result, we interpret the students' epistemological beliefs through a professional perspective, i.e. as justification of the profession's academisation. In their unhesitating confident trust in practitioners' knowledge, as mainly acquired from experience in the field, they express a vocational habitus. One may thus assume that practitioners possess proven experiences, i.e. experience-based knowledge that they have acquired and that should be recognised and added to the knowledge base of the field in an academic and vertical discourse.

TI  - Warming autumns at high latitudes of Europe: an opportunity to lose or gain in cereal production?
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
AB  - Climate change is projected to prolong Finland's short growing season at both ends though warming autumns are not expected to benefit arable crops such as cereals, in contrast to warming springs. To test the veracity of this, ex-post and ex-ante approaches were applied to assess the past and future roles of autumns on cereal growth. Long-term multi-location data were used to assess the response of spring cereal cultivars on late harvests in the past. Future changes in temperature and precipitation, derived from the simulations performed with 28 global climate models under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, compared with a baseline period, with mid-point year 1986, were averaged for three 30-year periods with mid-point years of 2025, 2055, and 2085. The phenological timing of growing seasons in a changing climate was simulated with the WOFOST. Warming autumns have insignificant potential for additional cereal yield gains. Even the latest maturing wheat cultivars would mature by the same time or earlier than currently when sown earlier. However, inter-annual variability in harvest times remains high, and hence many emerging risks may result from the elevated autumn precipitation in the future that will accompany delayed harvests. Means to benefit from warming autumns and mitigate their potential harmful impacts, like increasing nutrient leaching, erosion, and soil compaction, are needed. Post-harvest sowing of nutrient scavenging catch crops may provide the necessary soil cover, produce biomass, increase soil carbon, and protect soil from erosion and compaction. Hence, double cropping may be a viable alternative to safeguard sustainable high-latitude agriculture in a changing climate.

TI  - Analysis of the Nexus between Structural and Climate Changes in EU Pig Farming
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
AB  - The EU's ambition to establish economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050 requires challenging transformations in many economic activities. This paper aims to investigate the nexus of structural changes and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) in an important sector of the livestock system, namely pig farming, during the period of 2010-2020 and to discuss the main directions of GHGE reduction. The academic novelty of this contribution is characterised by a combination of the shift-share and cluster analysis that allows for the investigation of the evolution phenomenon, applying the sustainability prism in order to understand the nexus between pig farming and the livestock system, as well as combining the national and EU levels. Results suggest that the steep decline in the number of holdings and a moderate reduction in livestock units (LSUs) on farms do not bring tangible GHGE reduction results. The cluster analysis confirms that pig farming systems in pre-2004 member states, except for Finland and Greece, demonstrated positive developments or a lower decline in holdings with pigs and live swine LSUs compared to other countries, while in the dominant share of post-2003 member states, the GHGE reduction rate was higher. This research identifies a reduction in the pig population, improvement in feed production and the development of related supply chains, and changes in manure management and utilisation as the main directions of GHGE reduction; however, the identified clusters are related with different potentials of GHGE reduction when applying the aforementioned measures. Recommendations include the development and support of actions that focus on GHGE reduction from swine manure and contribute to the establishment of a circular economy in the EU.

TI  - Hidden viability risks in the use of farm-saved small-grain seed
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB  - Agriculture must provide sustainable food security and economic development to meet future challenges; new cultivars and the use of quality seed will be key components of this. The use of farm-saved seed may increase due to imbalances between income and expenditure associated with farming. The present study characterized the quality of commonly used, and thereby easily available, farm-saved seed in Finland. Farmers provided 657 seed lot samples of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that they intended to use for sowing. Germination, seed weight, seedling elongation and within-seed-lot variability were analysed. Information was available on region, number of seed generations and cultivar. The specific aims were to identify how many generations of farm-saved seed are generally used by farmers, whether there is any safe generation threshold and the variability of quality of the seed lots. It was found that 0.80-0.84 of barley seed lots exceeded the 0.85 minimum germination requirement for certified seed, but only 0.60 of wheat. The risk of poor establishment was higher in wheat if the seed was not tested: 0.13 of wheat seed lots had germination of <= 0.65 and 0.06 of <= 0.50, while for barley the proportions with inadequate germination were 0.03-0.05. At most, >0.30 abnormal seedlings were recorded for barley and >0.50 for wheat. Variation in seed size and seedling length within seed lots was important, and increase in the latter was associated with reduced germination. In combination with up to 0.14 lethal fungus-infected seed, this emphasizes the need for seed upgrading measures. No safe threshold for farm-saved seed generations was determined.

TI  - Status and rebuilding of European fisheries
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - Since January 2014, the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) of the European Union is legally binding for all Member States. It prescribes the end of overfishing and the rebuilding of all stocks above levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields (MSY). This study examines the current status, exploitation pattern, required time for rebuilding, future catch, and future profitability for 397 European stocks. Fishing pressure and biomass were estimated from 2000 to the last year with available data in 10 European ecoregions and 2 wide ranging regions. In the last year with available data, 69% of the 397 stocks were subject to ongoing overfishing and 51% of the stocks were outside of safe biological limits. Only 12% of the stocks fulfilled the prescriptions of the CFP. Fishing pressure has decreased since 2000 in some ecoregions but not in others. Barents Sea and Norwegian Sea have the highest percentage (> 60%) of sustainably exploited stocks that are capable of producing MSY. In contrast, in the Mediterranean Sea, fewer than 20% of the stocks are exploited sustainably. Overfishing is still widespread in European waters and current management, which aims at maximum sustainable exploitation, is unable to rebuild the depleted stocks and results in poor profitability. This study examines four future exploitation scenarios that are compatible with the CFP. It finds that exploitation levels of 50-80% of the maximum will rebuild stocks and lead to higher catches than currently obtained, with substantially higher profits for the fishers.

TI  - Estimating environmental and societal impacts from scaling up urine concentration technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - There is a growing trend for nutrient recovery from wastewater as part of the transition to a circular economy. Most nutrients in household wastewater originate from urine and one way to facilitate reuse of these nutrients is to concentrate the urine into fertiliser products. Urine concentration technologies are still in the development phase and not implemented at scale. The aim of this study was to provide guidance to technology developers and policymakers by assessing the environmental and societal impacts of urine concentration technologies. In particular, it includes practical aspects such as worker safety, space availability and local fertiliser needs that have not been included in previous studies. Future scenarios on implementing three different urine concentration technologies (alkaline dehydration, nitrification-distillation, ion-exchange with struvite precipitation) in a planned residential area in Malmo center dot, Sweden, were developed. The technologies were evaluated using multi -criteria assessment (MCA), with environment, technical, economic and health sustainability criteria derived from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was found that all urine concentration technologies per-formed well against many of the sustainability criteria examined and can contribute to achieving SDGs, espe-cially regarding nitrogen recovery. Specific areas for further development were identified for each technology. An impact assessment on scaling up demonstrated that nitrogen emissions to surface water were significantly reduced when more than 60% of urine in Malmo center dot city was subjected to urine concentration. Nitrogen and phosphorus recovered from recycling only 15-30% of urine in Malmo center dot could supply 50% of Malmo center dot municipality's fertiliser demand.

TI  - Strategies for deep renovation market of detached houses
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Deep renovation of the buildings is a key for sustainable development, however, the rate of deep renovation of residential buildings in the European Union (EU) is lower than what is required to meet the climate and energy goals. This paper analyses peculiarities and commonalities in market conditions and approaches to deep renovation of single-family (or detached) houses in Denmark and Sweden. The market analysis covers the Political, Economic, Social and Technical (PEST) dimensions and is based on systematic literature review and findings of market gap analysis. The PEST analysis is complemented with responses from 49 stakeholders/experts to examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT analysis) for deep renovation market. The synthesis of SWOT and PEST led to some strategies for deep renovation. Furthermore, policies and strategies adopted by some other countries have been discussed to place findings from this study in the regional and global context. Capacity building in designing and managing deep renovation with technological advancement and construction practices; and enforcement of quality assurance systems of artisans could avoid the perceived risk and inconveniences associated with renovation. Encouraging systematically planned stepwise deep renovation through One-Stop shop and linking such renovation with appropriate financing mechanism could attract more homeowners with financial limitations. Besides, clustering several houses in need of renovation and appropriate energy/carbon pricing mechanisms could make the renovation market more attractive for investors and construction companies. The findings of this paper are of interest for the construction companies, policymakers, investors, and analysts about deep renovation market.

TI  - Towards systemic and contextual priority setting for implementing the 2030 Agenda
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - How the sustainable development goals (SDGs) interact with each other has emerged as a key question in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, as it has potentially strong implications for prioritization of actions and their effectiveness. So far, analysis of interactions has been very basic, typically starting from one SDG, counting the number of interactions, and discussing synergies and trade-offs from the perspective of that issue area. This paper pushes the frontier of how interactions amongst SDG targets can be understood and taken into account in policy and planning. It presents an approach to assessing systemic and contextual interactions of SDG targets, using a typology for scoring interactions in a cross-impact matrix and using network analysis techniques to explore the data. By considering how a target interacts with another target and how that target in turn interacts with other targets, results provide a more robust basis for priority setting of SDG efforts. The analysis identifies which targets have the most and least positive influence on the network and thus guides, where efforts may be directed (and not); where strong positive and negative links sit, raising warning flags to areas requiring extra attention; and how targets that reinforce each others' progress cluster, suggesting where important cross-sectoral collaboration between actors is merited. How interactions play out is context specific and the approach is tested on the case of Sweden to illustrate how priority setting, with the objective to enhance progress across all 17 SDGs, might change if systemic impacts are taken into consideration.

TI  - THE POSSIBLE USE OF ANCIENT TOWER TOMBS AS WATCHTOWERS IN SYRO-MESOPOTAMIA
T2  - 25TH INTERNATIONAL CIPA SYMPOSIUM 2015
CP  - 25th International CIPA Symposium 2015
AB  - Traditionally polygonal tower tombs dating from the Greco-Roman era, especially found in the area of Syro-Mesopotamia, have only been treated as funerary structures without discussion of their other possible purposes. In this paper we wish to inquire whether they had other functions as well. The most famous examples of these types of tombs are situated in Palmyra in Syria. They are built of limestone, follow a square layout, and some exceed the height of 20 m. Similar structures are found in the Euphrates valley of Syria. The Finnish project SYGIS that worked in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates and Palmyra during the previous decade studied some of the structures in the region. As far as the tower tombs are concerned, our research suggests that new structural, topographical and spatial aspects can be raised, and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) can be applied for analysing their properties for visibility. The tendency to locate tower tombs along roads and the entrance areas of a city as well as at a mountain edge seems to indicate that the tombs may have had observational functions serving as watch towers. The aspects of the location in terrains are emphasized in the present study, and digital terrain models were utilized using SRTM DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data for carrying out viewshed analyses in order to survey the observational qualities of the towers in Palmyra, on Halabiya, on Jebel Bishri in Syria and Hatra in Iraq.

TI  - Availability, versatility, and viability of feedstocks for hydrogen production: Product space perspective
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Hydrogen is considered a potential game changer for world energy systems and a solution to climate change concerns, as it generates zero waste and it is suited for power generation and transportation. Despite its several advantages, there are significant technical challenges in deploying a stable hydrogen economy including improving its process efficiencies, lowering production costs, maintaining cost-effective transmission and distribution, and exploiting inexpensive and sustainable feedstocks. In this context, a detailed study was conducted to analyze the production sources, technologies, storage and transport systems, and global potential exportable feedstocks to produce hydrogen. A comprehensive analysis of current hydrogen production technologies with their energy efficiencies and hydrogen selling prices was reported in this study. Various hydrogen production technologies with their capital investments and CO2 emissions were also presented. Potential feedstocks for hydrogen production were identified and analyzed through a product space model, which characterizes a network of global exportable products based on their similarities and productive knowledge. It was established that the hydrogen production feedstocks and sources currently used are primarily available in six countries: the United States of America, France, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Spain. Broadly, the results revealed that the United States of America and Russia shared the highest hydrogen feedstock exports, indicating a higher probability of hydrogen production in these countries. Except for Russia, all the studied countries fell in the most desired quadrant, indicating that they can move in all product space directions to exploit unexplored hydrogen feedstocks for better sustainable economic growth.

TI  - Temporal variation of β-diversity and assembly mechanisms in a bacterial metacommunity
T2  - ISME JOURNAL
AB  - The turnover of community composition across space, beta-diversity, is influenced by different assembly mechanisms, which place varying weight on local habitat factors, such as environmental conditions and species interactions, and regional factors such as dispersal and history. Several assembly mechanisms may function simultaneously; however, little is known about how their importance changes over time and why. Here, we implemented a field survey where we sampled a bacterial metacommunity consisting of 17 rock pools located at the Swedish Baltic Sea coast at 11 occasions during 1 year. We determined to which extent communities were structured by different assembly mechanisms using variation partitioning and studied changes in beta-diversity across environmental gradients over time. beta-Diversity was highest at times of high overall productivity and environmental heterogeneity in the metacommunity, at least partly due to species sorting, that is, selection of taxa by the prevailing environmental conditions. In contrast, dispersal-driven assembly mechanisms were primarily detected at times when beta-diversity was relatively low. There were no indications for strong and persistent differences in community composition or beta-diversity between permanent and temporary pools, indicating that the physical disturbance regime is of relatively minor importance. In summary, our study clearly suggests that there are temporal differences in the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms related to abiotic factors and shows that the temporal variability of those factors is important for a more complete understanding of bacterial metacommunity dynamics.

TI  - Navigating uncertainties of introducing artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare: The role of a Norwegian network of professionals
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are expected to solve pressing challenges in healthcare services worldwide. However, the current state of introducing AI is characterised by several issues complicating and delaying their deployments. These issues concern topics such as ethics, regulations, data access, human trust, and limited evidence of AI technologies in real-world clinical settings. They further encompass uncertainties, for instance, whether AI technologies will ensure equal and safe patient treatment or whether the AI results will be accurate and transparent enough to establish user trust. Collective efforts by actors from different backgrounds and affiliations are required to navigate this complex landscape. This article explores the role of such collective efforts by investigating how an informally established network of professionals works to enable AI in the Norwegian public healthcare services. The study takes a qualitative longitudinal case study approach and is based on data from non-participant observations of digital meetings and interviews. The data are analysed by drawing on perspectives and concepts from Science and Technology Studies (STS) dealing with innovation and sociotechnical change, where collective efforts are conceptualised as actor mobilisation. The study finds that in the case of the ambiguous sociotechnical phenomenon of AI, some of the uncertainties related to the introduction of AI in healthcare may be reduced as more and more deployments occur, while others will prevail or emerge. Mobilising spokespersons representing actors not yet a part of the discussions, such as AI users or researchers studying AI technologies in use, can enable a 'stronger' hybrid knowledge production. This hybrid knowledge is essential to identify, mitigate and monitor existing and emerging uncertainties, thereby ensuring sustainable AI deployments.

TI  - Benefits and challenges of streamlined life-cycle assessment for SMEs - findings from case studies on climate change impacts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY
AB  - Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have a substantial role in the economy and job creation, but they are a remarkable source of environmental impacts. SMEs often lack skills and resources to compile environmental impact assessments; Streamlined Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) can provide efficient tools for this. An application of streamlined LCA relying heavily on database data, LCA clinic, was developed and tested on 23 SMEs in Finland. The climate change impacts were mainly caused by the production of raw materials, electricity and heating, whereas packaging and transportation were not influential. A significant amount of emissions were indirect, i.e. caused by production of raw materials. Thus, decreasing emissions from raw material production or selecting raw materials with a smaller environmental load could be a more efficient way to decrease emissions than reducing direct emissions such as those from electricity use. Lack of data in the LCA-databases was considered a challenge. An access to regionally customised datasets is important for the implementation of LCA clinics. Company feedback indicated that LCA clinics were useful in climate-friendly product design and increased environmental awareness, but did not lead to immediate actions to reduce emissions because of inadequate investment capabilities. Company managers had limited possibilities to use the results in marketing as comparative assessments would require a full LCA. Many company managers were willing to pay a fee sufficient to cover the costs of an LCA clinic, but some considered that the costs should be covered by external funding sources.

TI  - Perceived interest in learning sustainability competencies among higher education students
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to assess higher education students' interest in learning sustainability competencies and their pro-ecological worldviews at a large research-intensive university in Finland to provide a background information for developing a sustainability science course. Design/methodology/approachIn total, 797 students participated in the study. The data were collected through an online survey that measured students' interest in learning sustainability competencies and their pro-ecological worldviews. Participants were classified into five categories based on field of study. The data were analysed by using Pearson's correlation, independent samples t-tests, and analysis of variance. FindingsThe participating students perceived learning of critical thinking and values thinking most interesting. Interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview appeared to differ across fields of study. Participants studying humanities expressed lower interest in collaborative use of digital technology compared to the participating students in science and agriculture. Participating students in health and welfare scored lower on interest in learning values thinking than students in other study fields. Research limitations/implicationsThe response rate was low. It is likely that the participants felt strongly about sustainability challenges, therefore making them more interested in sustainability competencies. The limited number of sustainability competencies studied does not allow generalisation to all sustainability competencies. Practical implicationsThe differences in interest in learning sustainability competencies and pro-ecological worldview should be understood and considered when planning sustainability education. Originality/valueThese results provide new insights into the interlinkage of students' interest in learning sustainability competencies, their pro-ecological worldviews and their field of study.

TI  - Modelling multi-species interactions in the Barents Sea ecosystem with special emphasis on minke whales and their interactions with cod, herring and capelin
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - The Barents Sea ecosystem, one of the most productive and commercially important ecosystems in the world, has experienced major fluctuations in species abundance the past five decades. Likely causes are natural variability, climate change, overfishing and predator-prey interactions. In this study, we use an age-length structured multi-species model (Gadget, Globally applicable Area-Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox) to analyse the historic population dynamics of major fish and marine mammal species in the Barents Sea. The model was used to examine possible effects of a number of plausible biological and fisheries scenarios. The results suggest that changes in cod mortality from fishing or cod cannibalism levels have the largest effect on the ecosystem, while changes to the capelin fishery have had only minor effects. Alternate whale migration scenarios had only a moderate impact on the modelled ecosystem. Indirect effects are seen to be important, with cod fishing pressure, cod cannibalism and whale predation on cod having an indirect impact on capelin, emphasising the importance of multi-species modelling in understanding and managing ecosystems. Models such as the one presented here provide one step towards an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incident reporting or storytelling? Competing schemes in a safety-critical and hazardous work setting
T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
AB  - Incident-reporting schemes can prevent accidents through organizational learning from incidents. However, many occupational health and safety incidents go unreported. For these reasons I undertook ethnographic fieldwork to investigate the low level of reporting among railway maintenance technicians in Sweden and the role played by informal storytelling within their occupational communities. The study found that the incident-reporting scheme is not integrated in technicians' practices and cultural frame and does not seem to serve their interests. Storytelling, however, is an integral part of technicians' practices and their accident etiology and creates a way for them to address risks, at least from a narrow perspective. The occupational etiology is based upon technicians' local practice, which emphasizes vigilance, carefulness, skill, responsibility, and the like, and usually neglects root causes. This frame is rational and intelligible, given the technicians' limited power to influence their working conditions, as well as their limited training and the poor feedback they receive when incidents are reported. However, the occupationally-based perspective impedes the articulation of a systems perspective that could be used for organizational learning. To make an incident-reporting scheme work, employees must be given ownership, must know how and fly to use it, and need feedback oil root causes. These root causes must also be addressed.

(Kandalaksha Town), Lilium martagon L. (Rybachy Peninsula), Lychnis chalcedonica L. (Kandalaksha Town), Medicago x varia Martyn. (Apatity Town), Myosotis sylvatica Ehrh. ex Hoffm. (Kandalaksha Town, vicinity of Kovda Settlement, Rayakoski Settlement), Nepeta cataria L. (Apatity Town), Papaver croceum Ledeb. (vicinity of Kovda Settlement, Kandalaksha Town), Senecio subalpinus K. Koch (vicinity of Kirovsk Town), Verbascum nigrum L. (Kirovsk Town), Viola x wittrockiana Gams ex Nauenb. et Buttler (vicinity of Kovda Settlement). The information on the new locations and distribution of 32 rare alien species in the region is provided. According to our preliminary assessment, the alien flora of the region includes 502 species, which is quite a lot for such a northern territory. The high diversity is associated with different pathways and time of introduction due to various aspects of human activity. Over the last decades, the most active colonization by non-native species of Murmansk region is associated with modern household plots, urban gardening, plant introduction in the Polar-alpine botanical garden-institute, places of storage of solid household waste and the use of imported soils for siding road slopes. The most remarkable occurrences of non-native species are at the sites of the abandoned settlements of the Finns and Norwegians, as well as at the places of military operations during the Second World War.

TI  - Taking a trip to the shelf: Behavioral decisions are mediated by the proximity to foraging habitats in the black-legged kittiwake
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - For marine top predators like seabirds, the oceans represent a multitude of habitats regarding oceanographic conditions and food availability. Worldwide, these marine habitats are being altered by changes in climate and increased anthropogenic impact. This is causing a growing concern on how seabird populations might adapt to these changes. Understanding how seabird populations respond to fluctuating environmental conditions and to what extent behavioral flexibility can buffer variations in food availability can help predict how seabirds may cope with changes in the marine environment. Such knowledge is important to implement proper long-term conservation measures intended to protect marine predators. We explored behavioral flexibility in choice of foraging habitat of chick-rearing black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla during multiple years. By comparing foraging behavior of individuals from two colonies with large differences in oceanographic conditions and distances to predictable feeding areas at the Norwegian shelf break, we investigated how foraging decisions are related to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. We found that proximity to the shelf break determined which factors drove the decision to forage there. At the colony near the shelf break, time of departure from the colony and wind speed were most important in driving the choice of habitat. At the colony farther from the shelf break, the decision to forage there was driven by adult body condition. Birds furthermore adjusted foraging behavior metrics according to time of the day, weather conditions, body condition, and the age of the chicks. The study shows that kittiwakes have high degree of flexibility in their behavioral response to a variable marine environment, which might help them buffer changes in prey distribution around the colonies. The flexibility is, however, dependent on the availability of foraging habitats near the colony.

TI  - Modelling travel time in urban networks: comparable measures for private car and public transport
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
AB  - Analysing the accessibility disparity between different travel modes is recognised as an efficient way to assess the environmental and social sustainability of transport and land use arrangements. Travel times by different travel modes form an essential part of such an analysis. This paper aims to assess the comparability of different methods for calculating travel time by different travel modes. First, we briefly review the methods used in previous studies and identify different typical approaches, which we then compare. We use three computational models respectively for car and public transport (PT), implemented in our case study area, the capital region of Finland. In the car models, (1) the simple model ignores congestion and parking in travel time calculation; (2) the intermediate car model accounts for congestion but ignores parking; and (3) the more advanced car model takes into account all parts of the journey, including congestion and parking. For PT, (1) the simple model accounts for transit routes but ignores schedules; (2) the intermediate model incorporates schedule data in a simplistic way; and (3) the more advanced model adopts a door-to-door approach where true schedules (incl. congestion) and realistic route combinations are accounted for. Our results show that absolute differences in car and PT travel times are notable in the Greater Helsinki area, no matter which models are used for comparison. Modal travel time disparity appears smallest in the city centre area. We conclude that using conceptually corresponding models for car and PT travel time calculations is the key to achieving a reliable analysis of modal accessibility disparity. A door-to-door approach in travel time calculations (adopted in the most advanced models) also makes the results truly comparable in absolute terms. Finally, the more advanced the applied methods are, the more data hungry the analysis is. Here, recent developments in open data policies among urban transport data producers become very helpful.

TI  - Scientific evidence of sustainable plant disease protection strategies for oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) in Sweden: a systematic map
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE
AB  - Background: Oilseed rape (OSR; Brassica napus L.) is a highly valued crop for food, feed and industrial use. It is primarily grown in temperate climates, and over recent decades, its area of production and profitability have increased. Concurrently, several diseases negatively impact OSR production. Diseases caused by soil-borne pathogens, pose a risk of substantial yield loss since crop rotation schemes have become narrow as the time lapse between OSR crops in a field has been shortened. The aims of this paper were to provide an overview of plant protection measures available for OSR production and to identify knowledge gaps and areas where more research is needed.
   Methods: This systematic map builds on a previously published protocol and follows the ROSES reporting standard. The search strategy was developed in collaboration with stakeholders and designed to cover available scientific evidence for OSR disease management in climate zones relevant for Scandinavian crop production (Dfc, Dfb, Cfb and Cfa in the Koppen-Geiger climate classification). Five scientific databases were used to identify peer-reviewed literature, complemented by additional searches performed in grey literature. Articles were screened at three stages: the title, abstract and full text. The eligible publications included studies of OSR crops, and all measures to control crop disease in agricultural fields were considered eligible interventions. The comparator was intervention and no intervention, and the yield per unit area, disease suppression or an increase in crop quality were determined to be outcomes of interventions. A basic assessment of the experimental design of each study was performed to assess its eligibility. All articles were coded based on the following categories: the location and climate zone, disease, pathogen, intervention and management method, outcome and study design. Articles not reporting original data but judged to be relevant (i.e., review papers, books and notes of registration of cultivars) were saved in a separate category called "books, reviews and reports".
   Review findings: A total of 4633 articles were collected through systematic searches. After duplicates were removed, 3513 articles were included in the screening process. After screening at the title and abstract levels, 897 articles were evaluated at the full text level, and 118 articles comprised the studies that met the eligibility criteria of the systematic map. The country (Canada) and region (Europe) with the largest OSR crop production areas also contributed the highest number of articles. In total, 17 different diseases were reported, with black leg (syn. Phoma stem canker) being the most studied disease. Nineteen different intervention methods or management types were examined. Cultivar resistance and pesticide application were the most studied control measures.
   Conclusion: We report scientific studies on plant disease protection measures for OSR based on field trials where the results are intended to be directly implemented in crop production management. The map clearly provides an overview of research progress throughout the time period chosen, and it identifies knowledge gaps regarding important diseases where only a few studies have been published, for example, diseases caused by viruses.

TI  - Free-living nematode species (Nematoda) dwelling in hydrothermal sites of the North Mid-Atlantic Ridge
T2  - HELGOLAND MARINE RESEARCH
AB  - Morphological descriptions of seven free-living nematode species from hydrothermal sites of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are presented. Four of them are new for science: Paracanthonchus olgae sp. n. (Chromadorida, Cyatholaimidae), Prochromadora helenae sp. n. (Chromadorida, Chromadoridae), Prochaetosoma ventriverruca sp. n. (Desmodorida, Draconematidae) and Leptolaimus hydrothermalis sp. n. (Plectida, Leptolaimidae). Two species have been previously recorded in hydrothermal habitats, and one species is recorded for the first time in such an environment. Oncholaimus scanicus (Enoplida, Oncholaimidae) was formerly known from only the type locality in non-hydrothermal shallow milieu of the Norway Sea. O. scanicus is a very abundant species in Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike and Lost City hydrothermal sites, and population of the last locality differs from other two in some morphometric characteristics. Desmodora marci (Desmodorida, Desmodoridae) was previously known from other remote deep-sea hydrothermal localities in south-western and north-eastern Pacific. Halomonhystera vandoverae (Monhysterida, Monhysteridae) was described and repeatedly found in mass in Snake Pit hydrothermal site. The whole hydrothermal nematode assemblages are featured by low diversity in comparison with either shelf or deep-sea non-hydrothermal communities. The nematode species list of the Atlantic hydrothermal vents consists of representatives of common shallow-water genera; the new species are also related to some shelf species. On the average, the hydrothermal species differ from those of slope and abyssal plains of comparable depths by larger sizes, diversity of buccal structures, presence of food content in the gut and ripe eggs in uteri.

TI  - Potential priority pollutants in sewage sludge
T2  - DESALINATION
CP  - 10th IWA International Specialized Conference on Diffuse Pollution and Sustainable Basin Management
AB  - Sewage sludge has been used as fertilizer for agricultural land over a long time. This is part of a sustainable practice utilizing and recycling the macronutrients back to land. During the last decades, questions have been raised concerning the risks related to heavy metals and xenobiotic organic compounds (XOCs) present in the sludge. Application on land used for agriculture is, therefore, not socially acceptable in some countries, e.g., Sweden. In this study, literature reviews showed that 541 XOCs potentially could be present in sewage sludge due to their presence in e.g. construction materials, pharmaceuticals, personal care products etc. 192 compounds have been quantified in sewage sludge, which indicate that, although many XOCs have been measured in sludge, there are potentially a vast number of compounds present that have not been analyzed for yet. In a hazard identification of the quantified compounds using their inherent properties and environmental fate it was shown that 99 XOCs could be classified as being hazardous with regard to the solid phase and 23 were found to be priority pollutants in the subsequent hazard assessment. The final selected priority pollutants can act as indicators when assessing sludge quality. They were compared with European legislations and discussed in regard for pointing out the need for mitigation such as substitution. Furthermore, the potential need for implementation of sludge treatment trains in order to meet the society's needs was addressed.

TI  - The importance of forest type, tree species and wood posture to saproxylic wasp (Hymenoptera) communities in the southeastern United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - Although the forests of the southeastern United States are among the most productive and diverse in North America, information needed to develop conservation guidelines for the saproxylic (i.e., dependent on dead wood) fauna endemic to the region is lacking. Particularly little is known about the habitat associations and requirements of saproxylic parasitoids even though these organisms may be even more vulnerable than their hosts. We sampled parasitoids emerging from dead wood taken from two forest types (an upland pine-dominated forest and a lowland hardwood-dominated forest), three tree species (Liquidambar styraciflua L., Pinus taeda L., and Quercus nigra L.) and two wood postures (standing dead trees (i.e., snags) and fallen logs) in South Carolina. Parasitoid abundance did not differ between forest types or among tree species, but did differ between wood postures, being higher in snags than logs. This difference may have been due to the logs being in contact with the ground or surrounding vegetation and therefore less accessible to parasitoids. Parasitoid abundance and density decreased with height on both snags and logs. Species richness did not differ between forest types, among tree species or between wood postures. According to analysis of similarities, parasitoid communities did not differ between forest types, but did differ among tree species. The wasp communities associated with the different tree species and posture combinations were distinct. In addition, communities associated with the upper boles and crowns of snags were distinct from those occurring lower on snags. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining tree diversity in managed forests as well as retaining or creating entire snags at the time of harvest.

TI  - Use of machine-learning algorithms for the automated detection of cold-water coral habitats: a pilot study
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Cold-water coral reefs are recognised as important biodiversity hotspots on the continental margin. The location of terrain features likely to be associated with living reef has been made easier by recent developments in acoustic sensing technology. For accurate assessment and fine-scale mapping of these newly identified coral habitats, analysis of video data is still required. In the present study we explore the potential of manual and automatic abundance estimation of cold-water corals and sponges from still image frames extracted from video footage from Tisler Reef (Skagerrak, Norway). The results and processing times from 3 standard visual assessment methods (15-point quadrat, 100-point quadrat and frame mapping) are compared with those produced by a new computer vision system. This system uses machine-learning algorithms to detect species within frames automatically. Cold-water coral density estimates obtained from the automated method were similar to those gained by the other methods. The automated method slightly underestimated (by 10 to 20%) coral coverage in frames which lacked a uniform seabed illumination. However, it did much better in the detection of small live coral fragments than the 15-point method. For assessing sponge coverage, the automated system did not perform as satisfactorily. It mistook a percentage of the seabed for sponge (0.1 to 2% of most frames) and underestimated sponge coverage in frames that contained many sponges. Results indicate that the machine-learning approach is appropriate for estimating live cold-water coral density, but further work is required before the system can be applied to sponges within the reef environment.

TI  - Saproxylic insect fauna in stumps on wet and dry soil: Implications for stump harvest
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - An increasing demand for bioenergy has stimulated interest in harvesting of tree stumps after felling operations. To reduce the amount of soil disturbance, it is recommended to retain stumps in wet areas. We wanted to evaluate if that strategy is beneficial also for saproxylic (wood-living) insects, which will have less habitat to breed in at stump harvest, and therefore also need mitigation. We tested if stumps in wet positions on a clear-cut harbour fewer species and a different assemblage of saproxylic insects than do stumps in dry positions. Insects were reared out from wood pieces taken from 100 stumps (50 Norway spruce, Picea abies and 50 birch, Betula spp.) sampled in pairs: one stump from wet and one from dry soil in each pair. In the lab 2201 individuals representing 49 beetle and 6 moth species were encountered. Fewer species were found in spruce stumps on wet soil than on dry soil, both when measured per stump or as an accumulated value over all stumps within the categories. No difference was detected between the number of species found in wet and dry birch stumps. However, three beetle species that live mainly in birch were more common in dry stumps than in wet. No species showed an association with wet stumps. We conclude that stumps in wet positions form an inferior habitat to stumps in dry positions, and that this should be considered when making recommendations concerning the harvesting of stumps for bioenergy.

TI  - Prospective use of unmanned aerial vehicles for military medical evacuation in future conflicts
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ARMY MEDICAL CORPS
AB  - In order to continue to deliver outstanding medical care on the battlefield, the UK Defence Medical Services must continue to adapt, overcome and actively embrace change. One potential area is the rapid proliferation and sophistication of automated and remote systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are already used to deliver blood to remote military locations in Afghanistan and defibrillators to those that need them in the USA and Sweden. An area of future opportunity would be to facilitate rapid evacuation of wounded personnel from high intensity, high threat, remote and austere areas directly to specialist care. Such a capability would reduce threat to human life while allowing rapid extraction of casualties from high risk or inaccessible environments straight back to Role 3 care, all of which in these situations is either not possible or carries too much risk using conventional aerial assets. The article aims to highlight a potential future capability, stimulate debate and reflection, all of which is essential for innovation and future organisational development. The potential uses and benefits of UAVs are highlighted including both the challenges and rewards of utilising UAVs for casualty evacuation. Key benefits are reduced risk to human life, cost, ability to insert into areas conventional aircraft cannot and the rapidity of transfer. Challenges are likely to be airspace management, decisions on appropriate level of care to deliver during transit and ultimately user acceptability. The article also highlights that in order to maximise our ability to exploit new technologies, all arms and trades within the military must be involved in collective research and development. Furthermore, sensible corroboration with private companies will further enhance our ability to acquire products that best serve our needs.

TI  - Boreal forest soil carbon fluxes one year after a wildfire: Effects of burn severity and management
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - The extreme 2018 hot drought that affected central and northern Europe led to the worst wildfire season in Sweden in over a century. The Ljusdal fire complex, the largest area burnt that year (8995 ha), offered a rare opportunity to quantify the combined impacts of wildfire and post-fire management on Scandinavian boreal forests. We present chamber measurements of soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes, soil microclimate and nutrient content from five Pinus sylvestris sites for the first growing season after the fire. We analysed the effects of three factors on forest soils: burn severity, salvage-logging and stand age. None of these caused significant differences in soil CH4 uptake. Soil respiration, however, declined significantly after a high-severity fire (complete tree mortality) but not after a low-severity fire (no tree mortality), despite substantial losses of the organic layer. Tree root respiration is thus key in determining post-fire soil CO2 emissions and may benefit, along with heterotrophic respiration, from the nutrient pulse after a low-severity fire. Salvage-logging after a high-severity fire had no significant effects on soil carbon fluxes, microclimate or nutrient content compared with leaving the dead trees standing, although differences are expected to emerge in the long term. In contrast, the impact of stand age was substantial: a young burnt stand experienced more extreme microclimate, lower soil nutrient supply and significantly lower soil respiration than a mature burnt stand, due to a thinner organic layer and the decade-long effects of a previous clear-cut and soil scarification. Disturbance history and burn severity are, therefore, important factors for predicting changes in the boreal forest carbon sink after wildfires. The presented short-term effects and ongoing monitoring will provide essential information for sustainable management strategies in response to the increasing risk of wildfire.

TI  - Genus richness of microalgae and Cyanobacteria in biological soil crusts from Svalbard and Livingston Island: morphological versus molecular approaches
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are key components of polar ecosystems. These complex communities are important for terrestrial polar habitats as they include major primary producers that fix nitrogen, prevent soil erosion and can be regarded as indicators for climate change. To study the genus richness of microalgae and Cyanobacteria in BSCs, two different methodologies were employed and the outcomes were compared: morphological identification using light microscopy and the annotation of ribosomal sequences taken from metatranscriptomes. The analyzed samples were collected from Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Norway, and the Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base, Livingston Island, Antarctica. This study focused on the following taxonomic groups: Klebsormidiophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Xanthophyceae and Cyanobacteria. In total, combining both approaches, 143 and 103 genera were identified in the Arctic and Antarctic samples, respectively. Furthermore, both techniques concordantly determined 15 taxa in the Arctic and 7 taxa in the Antarctic BSC. In general, the molecular analysis indicated a higher microalgal and cyanobacterial genus richness (about 11 times higher) than the morphological approach. In terms of eukaryotic algae, the two sampling sites displayed comparable genus counts while the cyanobacterial genus richness was much higher in the BSC from Ny-Alesund. For the first time, the presence of the genera Chloroidium, Ankistrodesmus and Dunaliella in polar regions was determined by the metatranscriptomic analysis. Overall, these findings illustrate that only the combination of morphological and molecular techniques, in contrast to one single approach, reveals higher genus richness for complex communities such as polar BSCs.

TI  - Water browning mediates predatory decimation of the Arctic fairy shrimp <i>Branchinecta paludosa</i>
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - Increased concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in northern watersheds is a concern. Such browning affects aquatic food webs and biodiversity in multiple ways, not least through increased attenuation of short-wave UV radiation, which may facilitate establishment of new predators. We examined the effects of browning on occurrence of the predatory larvae of the phantom midge, Chaoborus nyblaei, and quantified their impact on the Arctic fairy shrimp Branchinecta paludosa in ponds in alpine southern Norway. The predator was present only above certain levels of DOC (here represented by total organic carbon, TOC). Comet assays revealed a 50-fold higher DNA damage in the population inhabiting a clearwater pond (3.9mg TOCL-1), compared to that from a brownwater site (10.5mg TOCL-1). Laboratory experiments corroborated the key role of browning in protection against UV-related DNA damage.Chaoborus nyblaei was a highly effective predator on B.paludosa, which suffered major population declines in ponds where the predator was present. Indeed, extinction of B.paludosa has been observed at lower altitudes of the surveyed area over the past decades, possibly in parallel with warming and increased vegetation cover, as inferred from analyses of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the surveyed area. These shifts could clearly have favoured establishment of C.nyblaei in the region. Our results point to climate-induced cascading effects in alpine ponds, whereby increased warming and terrestrial C-fixation cause increased catchment export of DOC, leading to increased browning of water and associated food-web changes.

TI  - Fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of invertebrates within cryoconite holes
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
AB  - Cryoconite holes (water-filled reservoirs) are considered ecologically simple ecosystems but represent biological hotspots of biodiversity on glaciers. In order to check for fine-scale spatial distribution of metazoans on the bottom of the holes, in this study, we analysed three groups of grazing invertebrates as a model: tardigrades, rotifers, and mites. We addressed differences within cryoconite holes comparing the distribution of invertebrates within and between separate holes and between glaciers at a worldwide scale. We divided each cryoconite hole into three sampling zones (established in relation to water flow on a glacier) and collected nine subsamples within cryoconite holes on glaciers in the Arctic (Longyearbreen), Norway (Blaisen), the Alps (Forni) and maritime Antarctic (Ecology Glacier). Generally, we found no consistent difference in sampling zones within cryoconite holes, which suggests homogeneity on the hole floors. However, we did find strong differences and high heterogeneity between subsamples, even within the same zone. Invertebrate densities ranged between 52 and 426 individuals per ml in subsamples collected from the same hole. We found from zero to four trdigrade species in the cryoconite hole on Longyearbreen. Our results show that benthic animals in cryoconite holes in various climatic zones have heterogeneous spatial distribution, even if no preference could be highlighted for upstream versus downstream areas with respect to water flow. The distribution of invertebrates may result from ecosystem disturbance by flushing water and animals' active movement. Cryoconite holes, usually considered to be simple ecosystems, seem to be complex habitats where hidden spatial heterogeneity may affect abundance and diversity of organisms.

TI  - Construction and demolition waste as a raw material for wood polymer composites - Assessment of environmental impacts
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - The European Commission's ambitious construction and demolition waste (CDW) material recovery target has placed pressure on Finland to increase its CDW material recovery rate. It has been identified that using CDW fractions, e.g. waste wood, plastic, mineral wool and plasterboard, as raw materials for wood polymer composites (WPCs) may help in reaching the CDW material recovery target. The objectives of this study were to assess the environmental impacts of WPC production using specific CDW fractions, namely wood, plastic, plasterboard and mineral wool, as raw materials, and to compare these impacts with the baseline situation where these CDW fractions are treated with conventional waste treatment methods such as landfilling and incineration. The study focused primarily on the depletion of fossil hydrocarbons and climate change. The results indicate that, when compared to the baseline situation, the environmental impacts of CDW management can be decreased when CDW fractions are used in WPC production. By substituting WPCs for plastic or aluminium, considerable environmental benefits can be achieved in terms of the aforementioned impact categories. Due to the differences in the physical and mechanical properties of WPCs compared to plastic and aluminium, WPCs cannot necessarily substitute them in a mass-based ratio of 1:1. This was acknowledged in the study by identifying minimum substitution rates for different materials. For instance, the produced WPCs should substitute at least 6% of plastic and 8% of aluminium in order to decrease the impact on climate change compared to the advanced waste management scenario. Therefore, in applications where WPCs can be used as a substitute for these materials, WPC product design and development should be prioritised. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Diversity of kelp holdfast-associated fauna in an Arctic fjord - inconsistent responses to glacial mineral sedimentation across different taxa
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
AB  - Kelp forests are complex underwater habitats that support diverse assemblages of animals ranging from sessile filter feeding invertebrates to fishes and marine mammals. In this study, the diversity of invertebrate fauna associated with kelp holdfasts was surveyed in a high Arctic glacial fjord (76 N, Hornsund, Svalbard). The effects of algal host identity (three kelp species: Laminaria digitata, Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta), depth (5 and 10 m) and glacier-derived disturbance (three sites with varying levels of mineral sedimentation) on faunal species richness and composition were studied based on 239 collected algal holdfasts. The species pool was mostly made up by three taxa: colonial Bryozoa and Hydrozoa, and Polychaeta. While the all-taxa species richness did not differ between depths, algal hosts and sites, the patterns varied when the two colonial sessile filter-feeding taxa were analysed alone (Hydrozoa and Bryozoa). The Hydrozoa sample species richness and average taxonomic distinctness were the highest at undisturbed sites, whereas Bryozoa species richness was higher in sediment impacted localities, indicating relative insensitivity of this phylum to the increased level of mineral suspension in the water column. The average taxonomic distinctness of Bryozoa did not vary between sites. The species composition of kelp-associated fauna varied between sites and depths for the whole community and the most dominant taxa (Bryozoa, Hydrozoa). The high load of inorganic suspension and sedimentation did not cause pauperization of kelp holdfast-associated fauna but instead triggered the changes in species composition and shifts between dominant taxonomic groups.

TI  - Towards the Development of Perennial Barley for Cold Temperate ClimatesEvaluation of Wild Barley Relatives as Genetic Resources
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Perennial cereal crops could limit the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment and climate change. In cold temperate climates, perennial plants must be adapted to seasonal changes and abiotic stresses, such as frost, to be able to regrow for several years. Wild crop relatives that are perennials and already adapted to cold temperate climates may provide genetic resources for breeding new perennial cereal grain crops. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important cereals in northern agricultural areas, and its related perennial species may be good candidates for the development of perennial cereals. We evaluated a diverse set of 17 wild perennial Hordeum species represented by 67 accessions in field conditions with a cold winter climate and long days during summer in Central Sweden (latitude 60 degrees N). Six species (H. brevisubulatum, H. bulbosum, H. fuegianum, H. jubatum, H. lechleri and H. secalinum) showed regrowth and formation of spikes for four seasons. The most distant perennial relative of barley, H. stenostachys, showed weak regrowth. H. bulbosum, the closest perennial barley relative, had a large number of accessions with wide geographic origins that showed good regrowth. Together with its storage bulbs and its cross-compatibility with barley, this makes H. bulbosum an important genetic resource for the development of perennial Hordeum grains using either the domestication or the wide-hybridization strategy.

TI  - Burrow emergence rhythms of deep-water Mediterranean Norway lobsters (<i>Nephrops norvegicus</i>) revealed by acoustic telemetry
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
AB  - N. norvegicus supports one of the most commercially-important fisheries in the Mediterranean, and there is considerable interest in developing non-invasive sampling stock assessment methods. Currently, stock assessments are conducted via trawling or by UnderWater TeleVision (UWTV) surveys with limited capacity to provide direct population data due to the burrowing behavior of the species. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to characterize the burrow emergence and movement patterns of N. norvegicus in relation to internal tides and inertial currents in deep-sea habitats of the northwestern Mediterranean. We deployed acoustic tags on 25 adults between May and June 2019, and collected up to 4 months of detection data from each tag. Tagged lobsters spent approximately 12% of their time in door-keeping (i.e., detections at burrow entrance with no displacements) but differences existed among the different behavioral rhythms identified. We observed that mixed day-night, tidal and inertial rhythms in field settings were similar to those observed in laboratory tests. The presence of mixed day-night and tidal periodicity poses the question of why N. norvegicus exhibits flexible responses to environmental cues other than photoperiod. It is possible that tidal regulation of locomotor activity could reduce energy expenditure in relation to hydrodynamic drag. Inertial periodicity occurs in animals with no clear burrowing-oriented activity (always present on the seabed). Possibly, inertial-related movements are the result of a disruption of the biological clock. Our results are discussed in the context of how burrow emergence rhythms may bias UWTV surveys and how novel in situ monitoring approaches address these biases.

TI  - Palaeodistribution modelling of European vegetation types at the Last Glacial Maximum using modern analogues from Siberia: Prospects and limitations
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - We modelled the European distribution of vegetation types at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) using present-day data from Siberia, a region hypothesized to be a modern analogue of European glacial climate. Distribution models were calibrated with current climate using 6274 vegetation-plot records surveyed in Siberia. Out of 22 initially used vegetation types, good or moderately good models in terms of statistical validation and expert-based evaluation were computed for 18 types, which were then projected to European climate at the LGM. The resulting distributions were generally consistent with reconstructions based on pollen records and dynamic vegetation models. Spatial predictions were most reliable for steppe, forest-steppe, taiga, tundra, fens and bogs in eastern and central Europe, which had LGM climate more similar to present-day Siberia. The models for western and southern Europe, regions with a lower degree of climatic analogy, were only reliable for mires and steppe vegetation, respectively. Modelling LGM vegetation types for the wetter and warmer regions of Europe would therefore require gathering calibration data from outside Siberia. Our approach adds value to the reconstruction of vegetation at the LGM, which is limited by scarcity of pollen and macrofossil data, suggesting where specific habitats could have occurred. Despite the uncertainties of climatic extrapolations and the difficulty of validating the projections for vegetation types, the integration of palaeodistribution modelling with other approaches has a great potential for improving our understanding of biodiversity patterns during the LGM.

TI  - Saproxylic beetles in managed and seminatural Scots pine forests:: quality of dead wood matters
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Habitats of saproxylic species (species that are dependent on decaying wood) have been greatly changed during the last few decades. Due to intensive forest management, volume of dead wood has decreased and its quality is less diverse in managed than in naturally disturbed forests. There is an urgent need to develop and apply guidelines for forest management so that they also facilitate the survival of saproxylic species and mimic the natural dynamics of forests. This requires detailed information about how the differences in forest structure between managed and natural forests affect the occurrence of species and what are the real habitat requirements of species. Thus, we explored the richness of saproxylic beetles, composition of species assemblages and relationship between saproxylic beetles and their substrate in managed and seminatural pine dominated forests. Richness of saproxylic species tended to be higher in seminatural than in managed forests but the difference was not statistically significant. However, species assemblages in managed forests had differentiated from those on seminatural sites. Our results suggest that for the survival of saproxylic beetles, increasing the total volume of dead wood is an important task but more important one is to improve the diversity and continuity of dead wood in managed forests. This requires that the continuous production of dead wood is allowed also in managed forests to improve the continuity of dead wood and availability of recently dead wood. In green tree retention the main stress should be laid on the trees of large diameter to maintain the potential for large decaying wood. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sustainable Public Safety and the Case of Two Epidemics: COVID-19 and Traffic Crashes. Can We Extrapolate from One to the Other?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - COVID-19 and motor vehicle crashes (MVC) are both considered epidemics by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), yet their progression, treatment and success in treatment have been very different. In this paper, we propose that the well-established sustainable safety approach to road safety can be applied to the management of COVID-19. We compare COVID-19 and MVC in terms of several defining characteristics, including evolvement and history, definitions and measures of evaluation, main attributes and characteristics, countermeasures, management and coping strategies, and key success factors. Despite stark differences, there are also some similarities between the two epidemics, and these enable insights into how the principles of sustainable road safety can be utilized to cope with and guide the treatment of COVID-19. Major guidelines that can be adopted include an aggressive policy set at the highest national level. The policy should be data- and science-based and would be most effective when relying on a systems approach (such as Sweden's Vision Zero, the Netherlands' Sustainable Safety, and the recommended EU Safe System). The policy should be enforceable and supplemented with positive public information and education campaigns (rather than scare tactics). Progression of mortality and morbidity should be tracked continuously to enable adjustments. Ethical issues (such as invasion of privacy) should be addressed to maximize public acceptance. Interestingly, the well-established domain of MVC can also benefit from the knowledge, experience, and strategies used in addressing COVID-19 by raising the urgency of detection and recognition of new risk factors (e.g., cell phone distractions), developing and implementing appropriate policy and countermeasures, and emphasizing the saliency of the impact of MVC on our daily lives.

TI  - Clinical supervision and support for nurses: an evaluation study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Aim. To assess the effects of clinical supervision and informal support on qualified nurses.
   Rationale. Earlier small-scale research studies have provided conflicting evidence about the impact of clinical supervision, hence the need for this larger-scale study.
   Design. Survey design drawing on an opportunity sample of 211 qualified nurses from 11 randomly selected hospital and community NHS Trusts in one region in England. Quantitative data collection used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Nursing in Context Questionnaire (NICQ), while qualitative data were based on written critical incidents. The analysis compared supervized with unsupervized nurses.
   Findings. The critical incident analysis revealed that supervized nurses continued to use informal support networks as well as their supervision sessions to discuss clinical issues. The MBI found no significant differences in levels of burnout between supervized and unsupervized nurses. However, the NCIQ detected some statistically significant differences, with supervized nurses reporting a more listening and supportive management, coping better at work and feeling that they had better access to support than unsupervized nurses. Closer analysis found that this positive finding was particularly strong among the more junior supervized nurses.
   Conclusion. Where resources are limited, it is better to concentrate on providing clinical supervision to more junior grades of nurses as a valued form of support during their early years as qualified practitioners.

TI  - Critical Operations Capabilities for Competitive Manufacturing in a High-Cost Environment: A Multiple Case Study
T2  - OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB  - There is increased interest in relocation to and from highcost environments, but there remains a lack of knowledge with regard to operations capabilities in this specific context. The purpose of this study is thus to investigate critical operations capabilities in a high-cost environment. The research process is based on the investigation of an existing framework of operations capabilities through a multiple case study including five Swedish manufacturing companies. The findings reveal that all the dimensions and capabilities included in the framework were considered critical, and additional operations capabilities could be identified: service quality, supplier dependability, supplier flexibility, supply chain innovation, supply chain sustainability. The investigation underlines the dynamic nature of operations capabilities, which need to be updated constantly according to the environment in which they are developed. This study contributes on a practical level to managers by creating an overview of operations capabilities in a high-cost environment. Through the investigation of critical operations capabilities, it is possible for managers to find new areas of competitiveness, as well as to understand their current areas of excellence. The study makes several contributions, such as the identification of operations capabilities, their investigation and validation in a specific environment.

TI  - STRUCTURE OF GEOPOLITICS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA ISTORIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF HISTORY
AB  - The purpose of this article is to analyze the structure of modern geopolitics, the description of the views of the classics, the founders of geopolitics and modern geopoliticians on the structure of this science.
   The structure of classical geopolitics is represented by the concepts of the German geographer Friedrich Ratzel, the Swedish state scholar Rudolf Chellen and the German geopolitician Erich Obst. Classics of geopolitics do not formulate the structure of their science in a complete form, but the idea of it can be derived by analyzing their works.
   In particular, Ratzel concluded that to study and understand society, it is necessary to take into account not only its "soil" but also its "blood", to involve data not only from geography, but also from history, anthropology, ethnography, and cultural studies. These scientific disciplines constitute, according to Ratzel, the structure of political geography created by him, or geopolitics. In addition, Ratzel science, as he himself admitted, can be structured according to the spheres of nature, that is, is divided into: the geosphere (land area); hydrosphere (aquatic environment); atmosphere (air).
   Rudolf Chellen continued Ratzel's geopolitical approach and applied it to the study of states. The Chellenge model of the state involves five different aspects of it: the territory, the economy, the people, society and government, and five scientific disciplines exploring these aspects: geopolitics (the science of the state as a geographical area); economy policy (science of economics, where the state acts as a national economy); demopolitics (the science of the country's population); sociopolitics (the science of a society governed by the state); powerpolitics (the science of power, in which the state acts as a system of domination and control). Chellen defines the structure of geopolitics more strictly than Ratzel. It consists of topopolitics, morphopolitics and physiopolitics.
   Erich Obst structured the world on the borders of the land surface occupied by the colonial powers and on the population living in this area. As a result, he has a picture that characterizes the distribution of the surface and population of the globe between the great powers. The structure of geopolitics as a science, according to Obst, can be represented as its differentiation into two components: the geopolitics of the territories of states and, in general, the earth's surface; geopolitics of the population of the state and, in general, the population of the Earth.
   Modern geopolitics continues the traditions established by the classics. It continues the Ratzel-Chellen line of differentiation of scientific directions of geopolitics, it adheres to Obst's line on the differentiation of the world according to zones of influence of the leading powers. The modem world is now divided between the great powers not only by spheres (political, military, economic, cultural), but also by sub-spheres. In the political sphere, the sub-spheres of domestic and foreign policy are clearly distinguished, in the economic sphere, the sub-spheres of finance, production, trade, energy, transport, tourism, etc., in the cultural sphere, the sub-spheres of art, sports, fashion, etc. Modem geopolitics includes, in addition to classical environments (geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere), the underwater environment, space and virtual environments of the Internet, radio, TV, printed materials. In the process of complicating international life, the emergence of other spheres and subsubspheres is possible. This manifests itself in the structure of the real world, as well as in the structure of geopolitics, as a scientific discipline.
   Thus, on the basis of the ideas of the classics in modem geopolitics, an environment-sphere structure has developed. Since its inception, modem geopolitics has significantly expanded the subject of its research, and today its structure includes such scientific subdisciplines as geohistory, geoeconomics, geoculturology, geoethnopolicy, geoconfessiology, geoconflictology, global studies, geofuturology, and others.

TI  - Improvement of an order-to-cash business process by deploying lean six sigma tools: a case study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis study is focused to support an ongoing development project of the case company's current state and the challenges of the order-to-cash (O2C) process. The O2C process is the most visible process to the customer, and therefore, its punctual and fluent order management is vital. It is observed that the high degree of manual work in the O2C process causes mistakes, delays and rework in the process. The purpose of this article is therefore to analyze the case company's current state of the O2C process as well as to identify the areas of development in this process by deploying the means of Lean Six Sigma tools such as value stream mapping (VSM).Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted as a mix of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Based on both the quantitative and qualitative data, a workshop on VSM was organized to analyze the current state of the O2C process of a case company, engaged in the energy and environment sector in Finland.Findings The results found that excessive manual work was highly connected to inadequate or incorrect data in pricing and invoicing activities, which resulted in canceled invoices. Canceled invoices are visible to the customer and have a negative impact on the customer experience. This study found that by improving the performance of the O2C process activities and improving communication among the internal and external stakeholders, the whole O2C process can perform more effectively and provide better customer value.Originality/value The O2C process is the most visible process to the customer and therefore its punctual and fluent order management is vital. To ensure that the O2C process is operating as desired, suitable process performance metrics need to be aligned and followed. The results gathered from the case company's data, questionnaire interviews, and the VSM workshop are all highlighted in this study. The main practical and managerial implications were to understand the real-time O2C process performance, which is necessary to ensure strong performance and enhance continuous improvement of the O2C process that leads to operational excellence and commercial competitiveness of the studied case company.

TI  - Public Perception Based Recommendation System for Cryptocurrency
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2019 16TH INTERNATIONAL BHURBAN CONFERENCE ON APPLIED SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY (IBCAST)
CP  - 16th International Bhurban Conference on Applied Sciences and Technology (IBCAST)
AB  - Cryptocurrency is one of the emerging online currency of the modern era. Big companies are investing in this technology. However, some established companies still hesitate to use it. According to them, it is a volatile trend which will fade up eventually. There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business. These subtopics can help business experts to evolve their businesses' and to make them more sustainable on the basis of public perception.

TI  - COMPETENCES ACQUIRED BY THE BACHELOR STUDENTS IN BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
T2  - 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2013)
CP  - 6th International Conference on Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - The evaluation of the competences acquired by the students in the context of a university education system is needed to enable professors to develop teaching-learning processes tailored to students' needs. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to analyse in depth the profile of the acquired competences of the bachelor students in several subjects related to the Business Administration area taught in the Faculty of Economics and Business of the University of Barcelona.
   This paper explains an experience in assessing bachelor student's competences by applying a digital platform called Evolute developed by Tampere University of Technology in Finland [1-4]. This is an ICT-based digital platform designed for the self-assessment of personal and social competences, and it uses different models of competences for a range of specific work role profiles. Each competence model is based on a specific ontology according to the target domain [5]. In particular, we apply an evaluation tool called Cycloid, which was specifically designed for self-evaluating the project managers' generic and specific competences.
   The authors of this research have previous experience in implementing Cycloid in different subjects in the area of Business Administration. Specifically, in previous editions of INTED 2012, INTED 2013 and EDULEARN 2013 conferences, the results of its implementation in the subjects of Business Administration, Operations Management and Strategic Management respectively were presented [68]. In this new edition, we now present the results obtained by comparing differences based in the course level and the respondents gender.
   Results show that there exist significant differences in the self-evaluation of competences depending on the respondent gender, for example in competences like self-confidence, innovativeness, conceptual thinking, language proficiency, optimism, understanding others, communications, relationship building or stress tolerance. Additionally, students of different courses level -first year students vs. third year students-consider to be different in competences such us maintaining order, innovativeness, responsibility, conceptual thinking, language proficiency, achievement orientation, understanding others, developing others, communications, conflict management, relationship building, etc.
   Tools as the Cycloid benefits the three parties involved: students, university managers and organizations, and should be applied along the Bachelor as a transversal project and adapt the programs to achieve graduate students with higher levels of social and personal competences, as demanded by the labour market.

TI  - High temperature heat pump integration into district heating network
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study illustrates the potential of high temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) integration into district heating network (DHN) through a twofold approach, using DHN as a heat sink and source. It is used as a heat sink of HTHP that uses waste heat from the supermarket's refrigeration system as a heat source whereas it is used as a heat source to HTHP that provides heat to industrial applications. When the DHN acts as the heat sink, the integrated system provides a coefficient of performance (COP) of the waste heat recovery (WHR) system between 3.2 and 5.4, reducing the operating costs between 50% and 100% with an average price ratio of 2.25 compared with the standard CO2 refrigeration system. If the DHN is the heat source, the integrated system provides a COP from 2.8 to 5.7 for a heat sink of 110 degrees C. The alternative low-GWP refrigerants assessment illustrates that HC-290, HFO-1234ze(E) and HFO-1234yf were considered the ideal candidates to replace the HFC-134a, whereas HCFO-1233zd(E) and HCFO-1224yd(Z) were the most promising low-GWP refrigerants to replace HFC-245fa. Finally, the environmental results showed that the utilisation of the DHN as the heat sink in the integrated system solution produces about 60% lower equivalent CO2 emissions than the DHN generation mix. Moreover, using DHN as the heat source, the equivalent CO2 emissions can be reduced up to 98% in Sweden compared to conventional natural gas boilers. Hence, the combination of HTHPs and the DHN represents a step forward in the mitigation of climate change through the utilisation of sustainable energy conversion technologies.

TI  - Sustainable biomass production: A comparison between Gross Energy Requirement and Emergy Synthesis methods
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - In this paper two methods for energy analysis and environmental accounting (Gross Energy Requirement and Emergy Synthesis) are critically discussed in order to explore their ability to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and environmental sustainability of human-dominated production processes. In order to allow a quantitative comparison, two cropping systems, namely 1 ha of corn production in Italy, and 1 ha of willow production in Sweden, are investigated by means of the parallel application of both methods. The case studies are carried out by performing a quantitative inventory of both natural and economic input flows to the investigated cropping systems. Such input flows are then converted into embodied energy (MJ) as well as emergy (seJ) units. Finally, performance indicators representative for each method are calculated. Results provided by the two methods and their respective theoretical features are compared and discussed in order to point out limits and potentialities of both approaches. The study shows that the two methods account for different - although complementary - categories of input flows, use different conversion factors, and answer to different questions and concerns. Gross Energy Requirement focuses on fossil fuel use and is capable to support the development of more efficient use of commercial energy. Emergy Synthesis uses broader spatial and time frames and accounts for both natural and economic resources. in so doing, it takes into consideration different forms of energy, materials, human labor and economic services on a common basis, offering larger potentiality to explore the sustainable interplay of environment and economy.

TI  - A review of Pinaceae resistance mechanisms against needle and shoot pathogens with a focus on the <i>Dothistroma</i>-<i>Pinus</i> interaction
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
AB  - Dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by Dothistroma septosporum and Dothistroma pini, is a highly damaging disease of pine. DNB was originally considered a problem on exotic Pinus radiata plantations in the Southern Hemisphere and on both exotic and native pines in parts of North America in the 1960s. Since the mid-1990s, however, DNB has increased in importance in various parts of the world, including Europe. On susceptible species, DNB causes premature needle drop, a loss of yield and, in some circumstances, mortality. In some areas, DNB is controlled by the application of copper-based fungicides and silvicultural techniques, such as thinning and pruning. In New Zealand, there has also been a long history of selection of more resistant P. radiata for use in breeding programmes. A richer understanding of the resistance mechanisms involved in the Dothistroma-Pinus interaction will play a critical role in helping the development of sustainable integrated DNB management strategies. This review therefore summarizes current knowledge of defence mechanisms involved in the defence of Pinaceae against needle and shoot pathogens and identifies research gaps. Collaborative research efforts from countries directly or indirectly affected by DNB are rapidly generating new knowledge to address these gaps.

TI  - Methane emissions on large scales
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Two separate studies have been undertaken to improve estimates of methane emissions on a landscape scale. The first study took place over a palsa mire in northern Finland in August 1995. A tethered balloon and a tunable diode laser were used to measure profiles of methane in the nocturnal boundary layer. Using a simple box method or the flux gradient technique fluxes ranging from 18.5 to 658 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) were calculated. The large fluxes may be caused by advection of methane pockets across the measurement site, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of methane source strengths in the surrounding area. Under suitable conditions, comparison with nearby ground-based eddy-correlation results suggested that the balloon techniques could successfully measure fluxes on field scales. The second study was carried out by the NERC Scientific Services Atmospheric Research Airborne Support Facility using the Hercules C130 operated by the United Kingdom Meteorological Research Flight. A flight path around the northern coastline of Britain under steady West-East wind conditions enabled the measurement of methane concentrations up- and down-wind of northern Britain. Using a simple one-dimensional, constant-source diffusion model, the difference between the upwind and downwind concentrations was accounted for by methane emission from the surface. The contribution to methane emissions from livestock was also modelled. Modelled non-agricultural methane emissions decreased with increasing latitude with fluxes in northern England being a factor of 4 greater than those in northern Scotland. Since the only major methane source in northern Scotland was peat bogs, these results indicated that emissions over northern England were dominated by anthropogenic sources. Emissions from livestock accounted for 12% of the total flux over northern England, decreasing to 4% in southern Scotland and becoming negligible in northern Scotland. The total methane flux over northern Scotland was consistent with previous results from the area, indicating that this method of data analysis provided good estimates of large scale methane emissions.

TI  - Issues related to forest sciences
T2  - Quo Vadis, Forestry?, Proceedings
CP  - International Conference on Quo Vadis, Forestry
AB  - In the article attention is focused on the following issues of forest sciences:
   1. Inference methods in forest sciences
   The empirical nature of forest research causes that inductionism has become the dominant method of building scientific theories in forestry. Its essence consists of making reference to reality, experience and experiment. The single observations obtained this way are generalized into hypotheses and laws explaining the functioning of the researched fragments of a forest and forest management. Even a large collection of observation data brings no certainty that all the forestry aspects interesting to us have been exhausted. Moreover, inductive inference means arriving at reason via consequence, i.e. the veracity of our reasoning depends on the authenticity of the consequence. Therefore, it is unreliable and, in general, limited to local Conditions. Because of the probabilistic nature of natural phenomena, the probabilistic Concept of inductive logic is becoming an important direction of reasoning development in empirical research.
   2. Interdisciplinary nature of forest research
   The development of forest knowledge entails growth in the number of branches of forest science. Their specialization, as well as atomization of research methods and tasks and practical activity are progressing. In this situation, the calls for inter- and trans-disciplinary forest research become particularly important; mainly to implement the concept of permanently sustainable and multifunctional forest management. It requires foresters' openness to innovative "external" disciplines, holistic approach to forest research and enhancement of the expert knowledge and role of foresters.
   3. Staff status in forest sciences
   The main forest research institutions in Poland are three forest departments of agricultural academies (in Cracow, Poznan and Warsaw), the IBL and the Institute of Dendrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. These organizations have for many years been employing a total number of over 400 scientific staff. Also non-forest scientific institutions deal with forest research in addition to other disciplines The insufficient number of scientific staff is largely compensated by the development of forest doctoral studies. In 2005, over 200 candidates for a doctor's degree pursued their doctoral dissertations in forest scientific institutions.
   4. The organizational system and financing of forest studies
   Low spending on research in general is the main problem. In 2004, it amounted to only 0.58 of Gross Domestic Product of which 62% came from the State Budget, 23% from business entities and 5% from foreign sources. The expenses on research and development per capita in Poland amount to as little as 14% of the EU per capita average. This is why the proportion of scientific staff in the total population in Poland is 4: 1000, while in Finland the figure is over 16.
   5. Planning tasks for forest research
   Forest research results are important for many scientific disciplines and economy sectors. Therefore, their developmental needs are important in preparing the future programs, subjects and tasks of forest sciences. The Committee of Forest Sciences of the Polish Academy Of Sciences and the relevant bodies of the Ministry of Science and High Education, as well as the Ministry of the Environment are involved in the planning process. The last document specifying the future directions of science development in Poland is "The national framework program. The principles, procedure and subject range" developed in 2005. It is to be the basis for financing research, including forest research.

TI  - The Use of Phytometers for Evaluating Restoration Effects on Riparian Soil Fertility
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
AB  - The ecological restoration of streams in Sweden has become increasingly important to counteract effects of past timber floating. In this study, we focused on the effect on riparian soil properties after returning coarse sediment (cobbles and boulders) to the channel and reconnecting riparian with instream habitats. Restoration increases habitat availability for riparian plants, but its effects on soil quality are unknown. We also analyzed whether the restoration effect differs with variation in climate and stream size. We used standardized plant species to measure the performance of a grass (Phleum pratense L.) and a forb (Centaurea cyanus L.) in soils sampled in the riparian zones of channelized and restored streams and rivers. Furthermore, we analyzed the mass fractions of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) along with the proportions of the stable isotopes C-13 and N-15 in the soil, as well as its grain size composition. We found a positive effect of restoration on biomass of phytometers grown in riparian soils from small streams, indicating that restoration enhanced the soil properties favoring plant performance. We suggest that changed flooding with more frequent but less severe floods and slower flows, enhancing retention, could explain the observed patterns. This positive effect suggests that it may be advantageous to initiate restoration efforts in small streams, which make up the highest proportion of the stream network in a catchment. Restoration responses in headwater streams may then be transmitted downstream to facilitate recovery of restored larger rivers. If the larger rivers were restored first, a slower reaction would be expected.

TI  - Developing a sustainable irregular structure: an evaluation of three inventories at 6-year intervals in an irregular mixed-species stand in Scotland
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - The development of a mixed-species irregular stand in the latter stages of transformation was examined. Transformation of the stand, located in Faskally Forest, Scotland, began over 60 years ago and it is now managed under the selection system. The aim was to determine whether a sustainable irregular state has been reached based on a stable diameter distribution, basal area and stand increment and on whether sufficient regeneration of the desired species and recruitment into the canopy is present to maintain the distribution. Complete inventories at 6-year intervals were carried out in a 1-ha permanent sample plot established in 1997. Results from the 2009 inventory suggest that the stand has not reached a sustainable irregular condition based on the above criteria. A reduction in canopy tree number in the last harvesting intervention has slightly flattened the diameter distribution (q = 1.4 cf. 1.5 and 1.6 in 2003 and 1997 inventories, respectively). The reduction in overhead cover has increased the number of regenerating seedlings in the understorey and suggests that the stand is moving towards a more balanced structure. Shade-tolerant western hemlock and beech dominate the understorey followed by semi-shade-tolerant Douglas-fir and Norway spruce. Recommendations for future management are discussed.

TI  - Engineering affective atmospheres on the moving geographies of the 1897 Andree expedition
T2  - CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES
CP  - Annual Meeting of the RGS-IBG
AB  - How might the dynamic materiality of atmosphere be addressed in ways that register simultaneously its meteorological and affective qualities? The present article considers this question via a discussion of the kinds of atmospheric spaces in which the emergence and experience of modern balloon (or aerostatic) flight is implicated. In doing so it argues that aerostatic flight. can be understood simultaneously as a technology for moving through atmosphere in a meteorological sense and as an event generative, at least potentially, of atmospheres in an affective sense. This argument is exemplified via a discussion of a particularly notable instance of balloon flight: die attempt, in 1897 by a Swedish engineer, Salomon August Andree, and two companions, to fly to the North Pole in a hydrogen-filled balloon. Drawing upon a range of contemporaneous accounts, the article makes three claims about the expedition: first, that it can be understood, following Spinoza, as an effort to engineer a mode of addressing the meteorological atmosphere, as a relational field of affect, second, that the passage of the expedition can be understood in terms of the registering of atmospheres (in both meteorological and affective terms) in moving, sensing bodies; and third, that the expedition was also generative of a distributed space of anticipation and expectancy. In concluding, the article speculates upon how conceiving of atmospheric space as simultaneously as meteorological and affective might contribute to recent attempts to rethink the materialities of Cultural geographies.

TI  - Analysis of the Legal Framework Governing Gas Flaring in Nigeria's Upstream Petroleum Sector and the Need for Overhauling
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Nigeria is rated the number one producer of crude oil in Africa. Still, oil exploration activities have resulted in a high rate of gas flaring due to weak enforcement of the anti-gas flaring laws by the regulatory authorities. Associated natural gas is generated from oil production, and it is burnt in large volumes, thereby leading to the emission of greenhouse gases and waste of natural resources which could have generated billions of dollars for the Federal Government of Nigeria. There are concerns that if nothing is done to curtail this menace, humans and the environment will be imperiled due to its negative consequences. There is therefore a need to decrease gas flaring by replicating the strategies applied in the selected case study countries to combat the menace. It is relevant to carry out this analysis to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the oil industry for the sustainability of the energy sector and to generate more revenues for the government. This study provides guidelines for legislatures on suitable approaches to adopt for formulating an anti-flaring legal framework. The study is a comparative analysis of national legal regimes on gas flaring in Nigeria, Canada, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Norway. The study adopts a doctrinal legal research method, a point-by-point comparative approach with a library-based legal research method. The study finds that weak enforcement of laws is a critical factor responsible for the menace. It recommends the use of more advanced technologies, a sophisticated mixture of regulations and non-regulatory incentives such as fiscal policies and gas market restructuring, and proffers further suggestions based on the lessons learnt from the selected case study countries.

TI  - Responses of riparian plants to habitat changes following restoration of channelized streams
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
AB  - The ecological effects of stream restoration were evaluated by comparing riparian vegetation, flooding, and habitat properties between channelized and two types of restored streams in northern Sweden. Channelized streams were straightened and cleared of in-stream boulders and wood >50 years ago to facilitate timber floating. Basic restoration (performed 8-10 years ago) returned cleared material back to the channels, and enhanced restoration (3 years ago) added large structural elements (boulders and downed trees) to previously basic-restored streams. Riparian inundation duration increased only after enhanced restoration. Similarly, enhanced-restored reaches had the highest amount of substrate available for plant establishment compared to channelized and basic-restored streams. In contrast, soil biochemical properties (pH and C:N ratio) did not improve following either restoration effort. Riparian plant cover was higher at both restored types than channelized reaches. Plant species richness was higher at plot-scale level (0.25 m(2)) at both restored types in the most species-rich elevation levels compared to channelized reaches, whereas at the reach-scale (>700 m(2) of riparian area), species richness did not differ among stream types. Similarly, species composition segregated between channelized and restored reaches only at the plot scale. We found no significant differences in riparian vegetation between the two restored types. The lack of positive responses of vegetation to enhanced restoration and to variables that changed immediately after restoration (inundation, habitat area) implies that responses were either slower than expected or the changes in hydrology and substrate availability were not as important for riparian flora as believed.

TI  - Physiological Adaptation and Plant Distribution along a Steep Hydrological Gradient
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
AB  - Plant species often separate strongly along steep environmental gradients. Our objective was to study how coupling between plant physiology and environmental conditions shapes vegetation characteristics along a distinct hydrological gradient. We therefore investigated species photosynthesis in air and under water within a limited area from dry-as-dust to complete submergence in a nutrient-poor limestone habitat on Oland's Alvar, Sweden. We found structural and physiological adaptations of species to endure water limitation at the dry end (e.g., moss cushions and CAM-metabolism) and diffusive carbon limitation (e.g., bicarbonate use) at the submerged end of the gradient. As anticipated, mean photosynthesis in air increased 18-fold from the species-poor assembly of cushion-mosses and Sedum CAM-species on mm-thin limestone pavements to the species-rich assembly of C-3 terrestrial plants in deeper and wetter soils. A GLM-model indicated that 90% of the variation in species richness could be explained by a positive effect of soil depth, a negative effect of the duration of water cover and their interaction. In water, mean photosynthesis was highest among aquatic species, low among Sedum species and cushion mosses, and negligible among C-3 terrestrial plants. While aquatic species dried out in air, drought-resistant small species were probably competitively excluded from the more suitable terrestrial habitats on deeper soils with moderate flooding by taller species of high photosynthetic capability. In conclusion, the clear distribution of species along the steep hydrological gradient reflects distinct structural and physiological adaptations, environmental filtering and interspecific competition.

TI  - Avian influenza overview December 2021-March 2022
T2  - EFSA JOURNAL
AB  - Between 9 December 2021 and 15 March 2022, 2,653 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 33 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (1,030), in wild (1,489) and in captive birds (133). The outbreaks in poultry were mainly reported by France (609), where two spatiotemporal clusters have been identified since October 2021, followed by Italy (131), Hungary (73) and Poland (53); those reporting countries accounted together for 12.8 of the 17.5 million birds that were culled in the HPAI affected poultry establishments in this reporting period. The majority of the detections in wild birds were reported by Germany (767), the Netherlands (293), the UK (118) and Denmark (74). HPAI A(H5) was detected in a wide range of host species in wild birds, indicating an increasing and changing risk for virus incursion into poultry farms. The observed persistence and continuous circulation of HPAI viruses in migratory and resident wild birds will continue to pose a risk for the poultry industry in Europe for the coming months. This requires the definition and the rapid implementation of suitable and sustainable HPAI mitigation strategies such as appropriate biosecurity measures, surveillance plans and early detection measures in the different poultry production systems. The results of the genetic analysis indicate that the viruses currently circulating in Europe belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. Some of these viruses were also detected in wild mammal species in the Netherlands, Slovenia, Finland and Ireland showing genetic markers of adaptation to replication in mammals. Since the last report, the UK reported one human infection with A(H5N1), China 17 human infections with A(H5N6), and China and Cambodia 15 infections with A(H9N2) virus. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as low, and for occupationally exposed people, low to medium.

TI  - Pushed Northward by Climate Change: Range Shifts With a Chance of Co-occurrence Reshuffling in the Forecast for Northern European Odonates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
AB  - Biodiversity is heavily influenced by ongoing climate change, which often results in species undergoing range shifts, either poleward or uphill. Range shifts can occur provided suitable habitats exist within reach. However, poleward latitudinal shifts might be limited by additional abiotic or biotic constraints, such as increased seasonality, photoperiod patterns, and species interactions. To gain insight into the dynamics of insect range shifts at high latitudes, we constructed ecological niche models (ENMs) for 57 Odonata species occurring in northern Europe. We used citizen science data from Sweden and present-day climatic variables covering a latitudinal range of 1,575 km. Then, to measure changes in range and interactions among Odonata species, we projected the ENMs up to the year 2080. We also estimated potential changes in species interactions using niche overlap and co-occurrence patterns. We found that most Odonata species are predicted to expand their range northward. The average latitudinal shift is expected to reach 1.83 and 3.25 km y(-1) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, by 2061-2080. While the most warm-dwelling species may increase their range, our results indicate that cold-dwelling species will experience range contractions. The present-day niche overlap patterns among species will remain largely the same in the future. However, our results predict changes in co-occurrence patterns, with many species pairs showing increased co-occurrence, while others will no longer co-occur because of the range contractions. In sum, our ENM results suggest that species assemblages of Odonata-and perhaps insects in general-in northern latitudes will experience great compositional changes.

TI  - Landscape scale effects of disturbance on riparian vegetation
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. Differing responses in riparian species richness and composition to disturbance have been reported as a possible explanation for the differences along and between rivers. This paper explores the role of physical disturbance in shaping landscape-scale patterns of species distribution in riparian vegetation along a free-flowing river in northern Sweden.
   2. To test whether sensitivity to disturbance varies across large landscapes, we experimentally disturbed riparian vegetation along an entire, free-flowing river by scouring the soil and the vegetation turf, cutting vegetation, applying waterborne plant litter, and after a period of recovery we measured vegetation responses. The experiment was repeated for two consecutive years.
   3. We found no significant effect of disturbance on species composition, but all three forms of disturbance significantly reduced species richness. There was no downstream variation in community responses to disturbance but morphological groups of species responded differently to different kinds of disturbance. Graminoids were most resistant, suppressed only by litter burial. All forms of disturbance except cutting reduced the density of herbaceous species, and species density of trees + shrubs and dwarf shrubs was negatively affected by both scouring and cutting. We also evaluated the effects of disturbance in relation to varying levels of species richness. In nearly all cases, responses were significantly negatively correlated with control plot species richness, and relative responses indicated that species-rich plots were less resistant to scouring and cutting.
   4. Our results suggest that although all disturbance treatments had an effect on species richness, variation in sensitivity to disturbance is not the most important factor shaping landscape-scale patterns of riparian plant species richness along rivers.

TI  - A factual analysis of sustainable opportunity recognition of immigrant entrepreneurship in Finnish Lapland: Theories and practice
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP MANAGEMENT AND INNOVATION
AB  - Immigrant entrepreneurs are in a disadvantaged position in the Arctic Lapland. According to previous studies (see Yeasmin, 2016), there are many factors that hinder the sustainability of immigrant business. Immigrant entrepreneurs lack socioeconomic and political knowledge along with many other hindrances. Broadening knowledge and combining strong and weak ties (Granovett er, 1985) are positive factors among many other mixed factors relating to operating a business successfully. Sustainable immigrant entrepreneurship practices require legitimacy between entrepreneurial actions and opportunity recognition. Research on sustainable immigrant entrepreneurship does not fit into a single literature body and it is difficult to make a single model for the growth potential of immigrant entrepreneurship in Lapland (Yeasmin, 2016). Therefore, the focus of this study is to create an integrated value for immigrant entrepreneurs by combining the CSR theory and mix embeddedness theory, and find an alternative concept of practice for understanding the drivers that can sustain the micro businesses of immigrants in Lapland and can give an explanation on opportunities recognition which can be embedded so as to get access to the necessary entrepreneurial capital (local, regional or national). This study argues that the degree of CSR embeddedness could be developed as a component of mixed embeddedness supports the discovery of institutional, social and economic opportunity strategy amongst immigrant entrepreneurs. Conceptually, this study explores adaptive factors that immigrant entrepreneurs are determined to embed (whether knowingly) as mixed practices that create entrepreneurial success.

TI  - CEO talk of sustainability in CEO letters: towards the inclusion of a sustainability embeddedness and value-creation perspective
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING MANAGEMENT AND POLICY JOURNAL
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to examine how CEO talk of sustainability in CEO letters evolves in a period of increased expectations from society for companies to increase their transition towards becoming more sustainable and to better account for progress and performance within the sustainability areas. Design/methodology/approachBy adopting an interpretive textual approach, the paper provides a careful analysis of how CEO talk of sustainability in CEO letters of large listed Swedish companies developed during 2008-2017. FindingsThe talk of sustainability is successively becoming more elaborated, proactive and multidimensional. CEOs frame their talk by adopting different perspectives: the distinct environmental, the performance and meso, the product-market-oriented and the sustainability embeddedness and value creation. The shift towards an embeddedness and value-creation perspective in the later letters implies that the alleged capitalistic and short-sighted focus on shareholder value maximisation might be changing towards a greater focus on sustainability embeddedness as an important goal for succeeding with the transition towards a sustainable business. Practical implicationsThe findings are relevant for policymakers and government bodies when developing policies and regulations aimed at improving the positive impact of companies on global sustainable development. Findings are also useful for management teams when structuring their sustainability talk as a response to external pressure. Social implicationsThe findings provide relevant input on how social norms, values and expectations are shaping the corporate discourse on sustainability. Originality/valueThe findings of this study contribute to an increased understanding of the rhetorical response in influential CEO letters to the surrounding sustainability context, including new national and international policies as well as sociopolitical events and discourses related to sustainability. This offers a unique frame of reference for further interpretational work on how CEOs frame, engage in and shape the sustainability discourse.

TI  - Measurement of Progress in the Environmental Area: Poland against the Countries of the European Union
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The initiatives taken by the European Union (EU) and the strategies it adopts aim to achieve sustainable development in a long-term perspective. This, however, requires continuous and consistent efforts to minimise the pressure on the natural environment. By obliging and encouraging Member States to take action in the environmental area, the EU wants to be a leader in conducting the green energy transformation. The main aim of the article is to assess the level of advancement of the EU countries (taking into account their division into two groups: EU-13 and EU-15) in making efforts to preserve the natural environment, with a particular emphasis on the position of Poland among the EU countries. An environmental index (EI) was used to make comparisons between EU countries. This index was designed on the basis of selected indicators during a statistical analysis. The Principal Component Analysis and the cluster analysis are employed in the article. This analysis puts forward a claim that it was mainly the countries of the EU-15 (Denmark and Sweden, in particular) that ranked highest in the environmental area in the period analysed and thus are the most advanced in terms of taking action for environmental protection-they took leaders' positions. Romania and Bulgaria took the lowest positions in these comparisons. Poland's score was low for the EI in the period analysed compared to the EU-28 countries. Establishing a more effective environmental policy in Member States with the lowest results is most crucial. The consistency of ordering countries according to the EI was noticeable in the period investigated. This proves the stability of the positions occupied by the EU-13 and the EU-15 group. Even though the European Union has made great progress with regard to the protection of the natural environment and green transformation, there is still much more to be done to increase the efficiency of resource use, waste recycling, energy efficiency or RES sharing in energy mixes.

TI  - Sustainability with a Cost Perspective - Driving the Industry to Embrace Sustainable Thinking
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Previous research has shown that sustainable improvements need incentives to carry them through. An assumption is that it may be easier to incorporate sustainable thinking in an organization if the organization understands which actions it is that are having a positive effect on sustainability and on tangible costs. This paper aims to highlight the synergy effects that occur in the intersection between production costs, performance and sustainable improvements and to present a possible way of modelling these effects. The study has used three methods of analysis: literature review, a web survey sent to representatives in the Swedish manufacturing industry, and economic simulations using a case study. The literature review and the survey are used to identify important costs and incentives for sustainable improvements. The study is limited to the production shop floor level, incorporating only aspects directly affecting, and affected by manufacturing operations.
   This paper takes a holistic approach to sustainability drivers, cost drivers in industry, and economic simulations, creating an overall insight. From the literature review and the survey, intersections between sustainability measures and cost drivers could be found in the areas of site-occupancy area/floor space, resource consumption, and efficiency. Apart from laws and regulations, economic aspects and management attention are perceived as the most important drivers, but also obstacles for sustainability improvements. The study aims to support industry to embrace sustainable thinking, presenting a quantitative method to visualize the synergy effects of sustainability and measurable improvements from production development, using performance measurements when estimating manufacturing costs. The possibility to connect manufacturing cost with environmental impact, through use of performance parameters is demonstrated in a case study; where the significant environmental and economic impact of rejections is analyzed for the machining of steel frames.

TI  - Tamm Review: On the nature of the nitrogen limitation to plant growth in Fennoscandian boreal forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The supply of nitrogen commonly limits plant production in boreal forests and also affects species composition and ecosystem functions other than plant growth. These interrelations vary across the landscapes, with the highest N availability, plant growth and plant species richness in ground-water discharge areas (GDAs), typically in toe-slope positions, which receive solutes leaching from the much larger groundwater recharge areas (GRAs) uphill. Plant N sources include not only inorganic N, but, as heightened more recently, also organic N species. In general, also the ratio inorganic N over organic N sources increase down hillslopes. Here, we review recent evidence about the nature of the N limitation and its variations in Fennoscandian boreal forests and discuss its implications for forest ecology and management.
   The rate of litter decomposition has traditionally been seen as the determinant of the rate of N supply. However, while N-rich litter decomposes faster than N-poor litter initially, N-rich litter then decomposes more slowly, which means that the relation between N % of litter and its decomposability is complex. Moreover, in the lower part of themor-layer, where the most superficial mycorrhizal roots first appear, and N availability matters for plants, the ratio of microbial N over total soil N is remarkably constant over the wide range in litter and soil C/N ratios of between 15 and 40 for N-rich and N-poor sites, respectively. Nitrogen-rich and-poor sites thus differ in the sizes of the total N pool and the microbial N pool, but not in the ratio between them. A more important difference is that the soil microbial N pool turns over faster in N -rich systems because the microbes are more limited by C, while microbes in N-poor systems are a stronger sink for available N.
   Furthermore, litter decomposition in the most superficial soil horizon (as studied by the so-called litter-bag method) is associated with a dominance of saprotrophic fungi, and absence of mycorrhizal fungi. The focal zone in the context of plant N supply in N-limited forests is further down the soil profile, whereectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots become abundant. Molecular evidence and stable isotope data indicate that in the typical N-poor boreal forests, nitrogen is retained in saprotrophic fungi, likely until they run out of energy (available C-compounds). Then, as heightened by recent research, ECM fungi, which are supplied by photosynthate from the trees, become the superior competitors for N.
   In N-poor boreal soils strong N retention by microorganisms keeps levels of available N very low. This is exacerbated by an increase in tree C allocation to mycorrhizal fungi (TCAM) relative to net primary production (NPP) with decreasing soil N supply, which causes ECM fungi to retain much of the available soil N for their own growth and transfer little to their tree hosts. The transfer of N through the ECM fungi, and not the rate of litter decomposition, is likely limiting the rate of tree N supply under such conditions. All but a few stress-tolerant less N-demanding plant species, like the ECM trees themselves and ericaceous dwarf shrubs, are excluded.
   With increasing N supply, a weakening of ECM symbiosis caused by the relative decline in TCAM contributes to shifts in soil microbial community composition from fungal dominance to bacterial dominance. Thus, bacteria, which are less C-demanding, but more likely to release N than fungi, take over. This, and the relatively high pH in GDA, allow autotrophic nitrifying bacteria to compete successfully for the NH4+ released by C-limited organisms and causes the N cycle to open up with leaching of nitrate (NO) and gaseous N losses through denitrification. These N-rich conditions allow species-rich communities of N-demanding plant species. Meanwhile, ECM fungi have a smaller biomass, are supplied with N in excess of their demand and will export more N to their host trees. Hence, the gradient from low to high N supply is characterized by profound variations in plant and soil microbial physiologies, especially their relations to the C-to-N supply ratio. We propose how interactions among functional groups can be understood and modelled (the plant-microbe carbon-nitrogen model).
   With regard to forest management these perspectives explain why the creation of larger tree-free gaps favors the regeneration of tree seedlings under N-limited conditions through reduced belowground competition for N, and why such gaps are less important under high N supply (but when light might be limiting). We also discuss perspectives on the relations between N supply, biodiversity, and eutrophication of boreal forests from N deposition or forest fertilization. (C) 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Sustainable Project Management: Reducing the Risk of Cost Inaccuracy Using a PLS-SEM Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Determining the factors leading to cost inaccuracy in infrastructure projects relates to sustainability by improving the cost performance of the projects (economic sustainability) and reducing the waste of available resources (environmental sustainability). This study investigates the effects of various factors affecting the cost performance of large-scale road projects in Norway in both the planning and construction phases. To this aim, a quantitative approach using a questionnaire survey was employed to understand the attitude of practitioners towards various factors causing cost increases. An advanced multivariate statistical approach of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Relative Importance Index (RII) was utilized to analyze the questionnaire responses. The results of the RII analysis show that local wishes, defective estimations, and long processing times had the most impact on the cost increase during the planning phase. At the same time, scope changes, market conditions, and unforeseen ground conditions were the most influential parameters in the construction phase. Moreover, the results obtained from PLS-SEM reveal that external related factors had the most influence among the other grouped factors (i.e., pre-construction, project management and contractual relationship, contractor's site management, and external) on cost overrun during the construction phase. Increasing the knowledge of these factors will allow for developing relevant project management approaches targeted at improving economic and environmental sustainability within both the planning and construction phases.

TI  - Wildfire-induced short-term changes in a small mammal community increase prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen?
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
AB  - Natural disturbances like droughts and fires are important determinants of wildlife community structure and are suggested to have important implications for prevalence of wildlife-borne pathogens. After a major wildfire affecting >1,600 ha of boreal forest in Sweden in 2006, we took the rare opportunity to study the short-term response (2007-2010 and 2015) of small mammal community structure, population dynamics, and prevalence of the Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) hosted by bank voles (Myodes glareolus). We performed snap-trapping in permanent trapping plots in clear-cuts (n = 3), unburnt reference forests (n = 7), and the fire area (n = 7) and surveyed vegetation and habitat structure. Small mammal species richness was low in all habitats (at maximum three species per trapping session), and the bank vole was the only small mammal species encountered in the fire area after the first postfire year. In autumns of years of peak rodent densities, the trapping index of bank voles was lowest in the fire area, and in two of three peak-density years, it was highest in clear-cuts. Age structure of bank voles varied among forest types with dominance of overwintered breeders in the fire area in the first postfire spring. PUUV infection probability in bank voles was positively related to vole age. Infection probability was highest in the fire area due to low habitat complexity in burnt forests, which possibly increased encounter rate among bank voles. Our results suggest that forest fires induce cascading effects, including fast recovery/recolonization of fire areas by generalists like bank voles, impoverished species richness of small mammals, and altered prevalence of a rodent-borne zoonotic pathogen. Our pilot study suggests high human infection risk upon encountering a bank vole in the fire area, however, with even higher overall risk in unburnt forests due to their higher vole numbers.

TI  - Design of an online health-promoting community: negotiating user community needs with public health goals and service capabilities
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: An online health-promoting community (OHPC) has the potential to promote health and advance new means of dialogue between public health representatives and the general public. The aim of this study was to examine what aspects of an OHPC that are critical for satisfying the needs of the user community and public health goals and service capabilities.
   Methods: Community-based participatory research methods were used for data collection and analysis, and participatory design principles to develop a case study OHPC for adolescents. Qualitative data from adolescents on health appraisals and perspectives on health information were collected in a Swedish health service region and classified into categories of user health information exchange needs. A composite design rationale for the OHPC was completed by linking the identified user needs, user-derived requirements, and technical and organizational systems solutions. Conflicts between end-user requirements and organizational goals and resources were identified.
   Results: The most prominent health information needs were associated to food, exercise, and well-being. The assessment of the design rationale document and prototype in light of the regional public health goals and service capabilities showed that compromises were needed to resolve conflicts involving the management of organizational resources and responsibilities. The users wanted to discuss health issues with health experts having little time to set aside to the OHPC and it was unclear who should set the norms for the online discussions.
   Conclusions: OHPCs can be designed to satisfy both the needs of user communities and public health goals and service capabilities. Compromises are needed to resolve conflicts between users' needs to discuss health issues with domain experts and the management of resources and responsibilities in public health organizations.

TI  - Predicting population responses to restoration of breeding habitat in Atlantic salmon
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Habitat degradation is seriously threatening stream biodiversity and productivity world-wide. For salmonid fish, restoration projects in disturbed systems commonly aim at increasing the availability of suitable breeding habitats, but expectations of effects on population abundance based on explicit models are lacking.
   2. We used a spatial population model to predict how breeder dispersion may influence population dynamics of salmonids. Simulations involved changing the relative abundance of habitat suitable for two juvenile size classes (small fry and larger parr), the type of density-dependent regulation (effects on survival only vs. effects on survival and growth) and intercohort competitive mechanisms.
   3. Increased breeding dispersion could alter patterns of density-dependent mortality and increase equilibrium adult abundance and maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, there was a strong interaction between stage-specific habitat abundance and breeding dispersion. The most pronounced effects of breeding dispersion were observed under intermediate levels of fry habitat abundance.
   4. When fry habitat was abundant, density-dependent mortality was most intense during the parr stage, and increased breeding dispersion did not increase adult abundance or MSY. In fact, when populations were regulated in the parr stage, increased breeding dispersion could cause decreased adult abundance because of the effects of intercohort competition. This negative effect only occurred, however, when competition among juveniles was symmetric (no age or size advantage).
   5. Synthesis and applications. The population effects of restoring breeding habitat can differ among environments, and we have demonstrated how these differences can be understood in the light of stage-specific density dependence. Increasing spatial dispersion of breeders may often be an efficient measure for conserving threatened populations and increasing yields in fished populations. However, if direct evidence or habitat considerations suggest that fish populations experience density-dependent mortality during the parr stage, attempts to increase abundance through increased breeding distribution or artificial stocking should be avoided, as these are likely to be ineffective or even detrimental. The difference between fishing rates providing maximum sustainable yield and extinction is particularly small for such populations, suggesting that fish managers should adopt a conservative and flexible regulation regime.

TI  - Live Crown Ratio as an Indicator for Tree Vigor and Stability of Turkey Oak (<i>Quercus cerris</i> L.): A Case Study
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Stability of forests represents a significant objective for climate change mitigation. As stand stability is influenced by the stability of individual trees, promoting stable trees is vital for a sustainable forest management. However, inside stands, trees experience intense competition. As a result, the crown recedes and diameter growth is affected, the trees becoming slender and more susceptible to biotic and abiotic disturbances. Finding effective indicators for tree vigor and stability is therefore important. This study aimed to assess the performance of the live crown ratio as an indicator in deciding the timing of tending operations for obtaining and maintaining vigorous Turkey oak trees. Live crown ratio (LCR) and height to diameter ratio (HDR) were determined for 80 sampled Turkey oak trees. A threshold of 100 for HDR was chosen to classify trees as slender or not slender. Next, conditional inference tree and logistic regression were used to determine the LCR threshold value where trees become slender. As the sample included small trees, using breast height to measure diameter may have affected the results. Therefore, small and large trees were also analyzed separately. For the entire dataset, the methods reached quite different results (LCR threshold of 0.371 for conditional inference tree and of 0.434 for the logistic regression), and relatively high values compared to the literature. For tall trees (height > 12.5 m), the methods reached similar results: 0.386 for the conditional inference tree and 0.382 for the logistic regression. For small trees (height < 12.5 m), the conditional inference tree method could not calculate any LCR threshold estimate, while the one from the logistic regression was unrealistically large (0.628). This confirms that using DBH for small trees to compute slenderness brings systematic errors. The live crown ratio was a good indicator of growth vigor for Turkey oak trees. Therefore, for stable trees (HDR < 100), a LCR of 0.36-0.39 must be maintained and could be used to decide the timing for thinning in Turkey oak stands.

TI  - A Development of the Warehouse Management System Selection Framework as Academic-Industrial Collaboration Work with Sustainability Considerations
T2  - 13TH INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH CONFERENCE (13TH EURECA 2019)
CP  - 13th International Engineering Research Conference (EURECA)
AB  - The purpose of the study is to enhance and deepen the research work on the topic area of third-party logistics (3PL) and warehouse management system (WMS) selection framework. This work is the next step of evolution in the authors' previous research in this topic area, using the conducted systematic literature review (SLR) results as a research method. The previous literature-based work is now widened in its scope by applying area experts' evaluation into the literature-based findings with the award-winning Finnish 3PL operators' experts. This research work utilizes the secondary data gathered from the SLR study, while the primary data is given as validation from the 3PL provider evaluation experience and its input view into the developed framework. Thus, a mixed approach with both qualitative and quantitative research methods was in use. This paper resulted in gaining profound understanding of the selection of WMS by 3PL for its customer. With new data and analysis, the framework has been developed to its newest form, including additions and changes from the 3PL experience and practicalities, novel Findings of the research, possible practical knowledge gap about WMS and their sustainability-related aspects on the 3PL warehousing context. After discussions, workshops, model benchmarking and collaborative development efforts with the 3PL experts, the new enhanced framework includes 4 modules (customer's warehouse characteristics for WMS, WMS categories, WMS technical criteria, WMS sensitive deployment issues). By giving this framework parameters for the practical importance validation for 3PL expert, the study has found out that that customer's warehouse characteristics played the vital role for deciding upon WMS selection, while WMS business issues and technical issues has also gained lots of attention as well as the choice of WMS category. Additionally, as further research directions. it is suggested to continue the research further with more practitioners' insights, expand the research scope towards different industries, more deeply evaluate WMS capabilities and functionalities. Plus, especially, it is suggested to focus on sustainability-related issues, as it seems neither the literature nor practitioners currently did not consider these within WMS context.

TI  - Long-term study of above- and below-ground biomass production in relation to nitrogen and carbon accumulation dynamics in a grey alder (<i>Alnus incana</i> (L.) Moench) plantation on former agricultural land
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - In the Northern and Baltic countries, grey alder is a prospective tree species for short-rotation forestry. Hence, knowledge about the functioning of such forest ecosystems is critical in order to manage them in a sustainable and environmentally sound way. The 17-year-long continuous time series study is conducted in a grey alder plantation growing on abandoned agricultural land. The results of above- and below-ground biomass and production of the 17-year-old stand are compared to the earlier published respective data from the same stand at the ages of 5 and 10 years. The objectives of the current study were to assess (1) above-ground biomass (AGB) and production; (2) below-ground biomass: coarse root biomass (CRB), fine root biomass (FRB) and fine root production (FRP); (3) carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) accumulation dynamics in grey alder stand growing on former arable land. The main results of the 17-year-old stand were as follows: AGB 120.8 t ha(-1); current annual increment of the stem mass 5.7 t ha year(-1); calculated CRB 22.3 t ha(-1); FRB 81 +/- A 10 g m(-2); nodule biomass 31 +/- A 19 g m(-2); fine root necromass 11 +/- A 2 g m(-2); FRP 53 g DM m(-2) year(-1); fine root turnover rate 0.54 year(-1); and fine root longevity 1.9 years. FRB was strongly correlated with the stand basal area and stem mass. Fine root efficiency was the highest at the age of 10 years; at the age of 17 years, it had slightly reduced. Grey alder stand significantly increased N and C-org content in topsoil. The role of fine roots for the sequestration of C is quite modest compared to leaf litter C flux.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of roots as affected by interspecific interactions in a young walnut/wheat alley cropping system in northwest China
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
AB  - Intercropping Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum Linn.) in northwest China is receiving increasing attention because it offers potential advantages for improving land-use efficiency, increasing economic returns to farmers and increased sustainability in crop production. We carried out a two-year field intercropping experiment, using a system composed of young Persian walnut trees with wheat to determine the root competitive interactions between the two species, aboveground biomass and the economic yield of each component of the intercropping system at a spacing of 4 x 6 m in Hetian old oasis, south Xinjiang province, northwest China. Roots were sampled by auger in the Persian walnut tree/wheat intercropping system and in the sole wheat and sole walnut systems, down to a depth of 1 m in the soil profile. The results show that the roots of the trees spread under the crop and that the roots of intercropped wheat tended to have a shallower distribution in the soil profile. The roots of both intercropped walnut and wheat had a lower root length density and root diameter and a higher specific root length at all soil depths than those of sole walnut trees and wheat in 2012. Although root competition belowground led to decreases in yield and biomass of both crops, intercropping of Persian walnut and wheat improved the utilization of plant growth resources (LER > 1) as compared with sole crops. Tree height, diameter at breast height and mean radius of crown of intercropped trees in both intercropping years had lower values when compared with the monoculture. We conclude that interspecific interactions occurred largely as below-ground competition between the species investigated. Competition for soil resources was the primary limiting factor for wheat productivity. Further research is needed to examine the dynamic processes of species interactions in intercropping systems with trees of increasing age.

TI  - Comparative use of vendace by humans and Saimaa ringed sea in Lake Pihlajavesi, Finland
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - The Saimaa ringed seat, Phoca hispida saimensis, is one of the most endangered ringed seals in the world. Its total population consisted of 240 adult seals in the Saimaa lake complex in 2000. We estimated the amount of vendace, Coregonus albula, consumed by the seals and compared it with fishermen's vendace catches and our vendace stock estimates in Lake Pihlajavesi, Finland. Our study area was the habitat of 43 mature seals and 17 immature seals as well as 12 pups in 2001. Five commercial two-boat trawlers fished in the area. Vendace stock size was estimated at 660 tonnes i.e., 12 kg ha(-1) in the study area in August-September 2001. The vendace catch by fishermen was approximately 250 tonnes, and the vendace consumption by the Saimaa ringed seal was estimated at 68 tonnes in 2001. We estimated that during the whole year seals ate approximately 8% of the vendace spawning stock biomass in the area while fishermen caught 30% of it. The seals and the fishermen together used less than 10% of the available vendace biomass in each month. Fishing pressure on the vendace stock was highest in August-October. The amount of vendace eaten by the seals exceeded the vendace catch in fisheries only in December-April. In periods of low vendace density, the seals can consume a higher proportion of the stock and reduce the catch per unit of effort in fisheries. However, our assumption that seals fed only on vendace should be considered as an extreme scenario when considering the conflict between fisheries and the seal. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - SOME ECOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN WINTER RAPE CULTIVATION
T2  - ROSTLINNA VYROBA
AB  - In the years 1959/1960 to 1992/1993 the portion of rape on arable land increased in the Czech Republic from 1.0 % to 5.3 %. Moreover, there was a whole-area replacement of cultivated rape species. Reports concerning the rape death of roebucks indicated possible ecological impacts of two-zero varieties (Onderscheka et al., 1987; Dusek , 1987 - written notification), in particular in Austria, where rape cultivation started to be extended not earlier than with the onset of 00 varieties. This led to stopping of the transition of the CSFR to the cultivation of 00 varieties in 1988 which was finished only in 1992/1993.
   The demandingness of the rape for the level of nutrition and protection is associated with problems in view of the ecology. For that reason since 1981/1982 has tested the possibility to minimize the need for insecticides by applying so called protective shelter bets of rape with turnip rape (Vasak et al., 1991). Shelter belts should help in the protection system against rape beetle where double insecticide spraying is commonly used in our country.
   The relation of deer and areas sown with rape was evaluated on the basis of statistical data of the Czech Huntsman's Union and the data on the change in areas sown with rape from regional statistical data. The results were processed through the analysis of variance for three average rape areas in the districts: up to 650 hectares, 651 to 1,300 hectares, above 1,300 hectares. Furthermore, the linear correlation and regression analyses were calculated (Tabs I and II). In the winter of 1988/1989 field investigations took place. These were carried out to determine the attractiveness of cultivated varieties and other food offers and it evaluated the behaviour of the roe deer in the country.
   Trials with an application of the shelter belts assessed the density of invasion of rape beetle in different distances (Tab. III) from the margin of the plot and with the shelter belt of rape with early blossoming mustard crop - primarily, the Swedish winter rape variety Brink, later, winter turnip rape Rex from Germany.
   The number of roe deer is growing with the growing of areas sown with rape, together with hunting and mortality per district. However, the percentage of mortality per 1 hectare of rape is falling, conditioned rather by very dynamic growth of rape areas which is not followed by the roe deer directly. With growing areas sown with rape, their yields are growing as well. With the growth of the number of roe deer, the stock of roebucks and thri hunting is growing linearly. The mortality of the roe deer is growing significantly.
   There was no evidence that the roebucks prefer some of the cultivated types of rape. They prefer significantly the rape against other sources of feedstuffs (quality hay). In the country the game chooses the plots near the forestry enclaves and holding covers. A negative effect of rape cultivation was manifested in large blocks.
   Negative effects of rape (S-methylcystein sulfoxide, low fibre contents, high contents of crude protein and nitrates) are not caused by glucosinolate contents. There were no differences found out in glucosinolate contents in biomass of 0 and 00 varieties.
   The rape as a source of food in lean winter period had a positive effect on the head of roe deer. However, it was recommended to reduce the area of plot to 20 and 40 hectares, to reduce interference of the deer, to administer additional feeding, to minimize and eliminate autumn nitrogen fertilization.
   Shelter belts of rape of 12 m (18 m) sown with turnip rape Rex are successful in trapping the invasion of rape beetle and allow to concentrate the protection only to 12 m of shelter belt. The problem arises with economy, as shelter belts of 25 hectare plot represent about 10 % of the area. Turnip rape is by about 33 % less yielding than rape. In double spraying, usually always needed, the shelter belt is yet economically neutral, however, ecologically very advantageous. An economic loss can be lowered by the choice of the mixture of rape and turnip rape seeds.

TI  - A multiscale integrated analysis of the factors characterizing the sustainability of food systems in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
AB  - Considering the existing world population, set of environmental impacts, and predicted changes in dietary trends, one can expect that, in the coming decades, food security will remain high on the list of sustainability concerns. In relation to this challenge, Europe's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) must address a diverse set of goals: (i) guarantee a stable and affordable food supply; (ii) preserve the socioeconomic stability of farmers by guaranteeing their economic viability; (iii) protect the environment by reducing pressures on agroecosystems; and (iv) improve food security by reducing import dependence. Policies related to these diverse goals are likely to generate adverse side-effects. A particularly uncomfortable concern is Europe's massive reliance on imported feed commodities. The European Union (EU) is unlikely to be capable of domestically producing currently imported agricultural commodities and a significant move to internalize imports would dramatically increase pressures on local ecosystems. Faced with that potential predicament, it is essential to have a robust information system capable of simultaneously addressing a variety of policy concerns. In response, this paper presents a novel accounting framework-Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism (MuSIASEM)- capable of generating an integrated set of indicators entangled across different scales and dimensions of analysis. Our versatile approach establishes a set of quantitative relations between: (i) the dietary intake of the society (desirability of the food supply); (ii) processes under human control (viability of the food system); (iii) processes outside of human control and associated with external biophysical limits determined by embedding ecosystems (feasibility of the food system); and (iv) the dependence on imported products (food security). The analysis of such relations can be tailored to the legitimate perceptions of different social actors affected by policies, anticipating potential conflicts and providing useful information for deliberation and negotiation. Our approach is illustrated with an analysis of the European agricultural system, covering the EU-27 plus the UK and Norway.

TI  - Social pedagogy: Theoretical legacy and practical work in the field
T2  - TIMARIT UM UPPELDI OG MENNTUN-ICELANDIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - In the discourses and debates on social pedagogy, we do not find consensus on the basic question: Is social pedagogy a field of research or practice?
   In social pedagogy, theories (of sociology, psychology, philosophy and pedagogy) are often a frame of reference, rather than tools for analysis.
   This article examines the relation between the historical development of sociology and recent debates on social pedagogy.
   Both sociology and social pedagogy were born as reactions to the social upheavals of industrialisation and migration. While Karl Marx emphasised the deep social change caused by capitalism, the first sociologists, such as Tonnies and Simmel, found continuity within this change.
   Two of the founding fathers of sociology, Emile Durkheim and George Herbert Mead, set focus on deeply rooted social mechanisms, which Durkheim called "conscience collective". Durkheim suggested that conscience collective is presented to each new generation as "a social fact", while Mead (and later Jurgen Habermas) argued that the foundation of the conscience collective is negotiated in the upbringing of each new generation.
   The Durkheimian angle has been married with structural functionalism, and has often led social pedagogues to look for dysfunctional upbringing in homes or/and in schooling and to find the remedies in the toolbox of social engineering.
   An alternative approach has been found in the legacy of Mead, focussing on searching processes among youth and social workers, and arenas for discussions with their peers. Habermas has elaborated on Mead's contribution, not least on Mead's view that children learn to know the world through interplay with "the significant other", most often their mother. Habermas emphasised that such learning continues. He takes an important step further than Mead, by insisting on the priority of the life world and its communicative action above the system and its strategic action.
   The history of social pedagogy follows the history of industrial cities, migration, periods of unemployment, waves of labour looking for work and finding informal learning in the city landscape shaped by subcultures of youth. Social pedagogic interventions have become more widespread and institutionalised since WW2, and there have been public and scientific debates on the matter. Such debates have ranged from moral panic to demands for serious research.
   This article presents and discusses a few major contributions and textbooks that have been published and widely cited in the Nordic countries in recent years. They all present social pedagogy as a safety net for young people who drop out of education, and often they develop deviant, and even destructive life styles. The social pedagogues suggest different remedies against exclusion and different forms of deviance. Such measures often require prolonged education, this time different from the national curriculum. They may offer practical skills, emphasise basic general competences, or focus on individual deficits - together with several other kinds of intervention. The remedies of the social pedagogues refer to sociological theories, but rather as a general frame rather than tools of practical work.
   Influential social pedagogues, such as Bent Madsen (Denmark) and P.-A. Gjertsen (Norway) emphasise that deviant youth often lack basic competences and that they have to be lifted from the school environment into leisure activities Stig-Arne Berglund (Sweden) takes a critical stance towards American criminology, especially its tendencies to stigmatise the deviance of young people.
   All these social pedagogues, want to establish arenas that take form as communities (German: Gemeinschafts), while the mechanisms of society in general (German: Gesellschaft) are neutralised. Some social pedagogues, for instance Lisbeth Eriksson (Sweden), want to add that "Gemeinschafts" are often oppressive, and that the present individual search for identity can become a heavy burden.
   It is a shared attribute of the social pedagogues discussed in the article that they all aspire to anchor their practical social pedagogy in the major contemporary theories of sociology. Furthermore, many of their concepts are inherited from the founding fathers of sociology from the late 19th century and the 20th century.

TI  - Feasibility of Innovative Smart Mobility Solutions: A Case Study for Vaasa
T2  - WORLD ELECTRIC VEHICLE JOURNAL
AB  - The global trend of urbanization and growing environmental awareness have risen concerns and demands to develop cities to become smarter. There is a grave need for ambitious sustainability strategies and projects, which can aid cities intelligently and comprehensively in this task. European Union (EU) launched 2014 the Horizon 2020 program (aka Horizon Europe), aiming to encourage the EU nations and their cities to take action to reach carbon neutrality through projects striving to smart city development. By promoting innovative, efficient, far-reaching, and replicable solutions, from the fields of smart energy production and consumption, traffic and mobility, digitalization and information communication technology, and citizen engagement, the objectives of the smart city strategies can be achieved. Horizon 2020 funded IRIS Smart Cities project was launched in 2017. One of the follower cities in the project has been the City of Vaasa in Finland. Vaasa's climate objective is to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, the city has taken several decisive measures to enhance de-carbonization during recent years. One essential target for de-carbonization activities has been traffic and mobility. The primary purpose of the research conducted was to study the smart mobility, vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and second life battery solutions in the IRIS Smart Cities project, demonstrated first by the Lighthouse cities and then to be replicated in the City of Vaasa. The aim was to study which importance and prioritization these particular integrated solutions would receive in the City of Vaasa's replication plan led by the City of Vaasa's IRIS project task team of 12 experts, with the contribution of the key partners and stakeholders. Additionally, the aim was to study the potential of the integrated solutions in question to be eventually implemented in the Vaasa environment, and the benefit for the city's ultimate strategy to reach carbon neutrality by 2030. The secondary object was to study the solutions' compatibility with the IRIS lighthouse cities' demonstrations and gathered joined experiences concerning the smart and sustainable mobility and vehicle-to-grid solutions, and utilization of 2nd life batteries. The results of the research indicated, that the innovative smart mobility solutions, including vehicle-to-grid and second life battery schemes, are highly relevant not only to the IRIS Lighthouse cities, but they also present good potential for the City of Vaasa in the long run, being compatible with the city's climate and de-carbonization goals.

TI  - Nonlinear finite element analysis of a 50 years old reinforced concrete trough bridge
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
AB  - In this paper, a nonlinear finite element model of a full scale bridge (Ornskoldsvik bridge, Sweden) is presented in connection with load tests. In order to quantify the carrying capacity of the bridge, a collapse load test was performed within the European Union founded project "Sustainable Bridges - Assessment for Future Traffic Demands and Longer Lives". The finite element model introduces new constitutive material models. Four materials are in particular modelled in accordance with the bridge characteristics: concrete, steel reinforcement bars, CFRP bars and steel/concrete interface. The concrete is described by a damage mechanics based model developed within the framework of the irreversible processes thermodynamics. This ensures consistency with respect to the well known physics principles (conservation and evolution). The steel reinforcement bars and the CFRP bars are modelled using classical elasto-plastic constitutive laws with an isotropic hardening. The steel/concrete interface is developed in such a way that it may include corrosion. The numerical results are very close to the experimental measurements. Based on that finite element model, the influence of local degradation due to uniform corrosion is then studied. Two effects are considered for this purpose: steel cross section reductions and bond strength variations at the steel/concrete interface. Although these latter results remain informative due to the lack of documented data regarding the corrosion content in the bridge, they allow corroborating experimental measurements published in the literature.

TI  - Sweden's Climate Act - its origin and emergence
T2  - CLIMATE POLICY
AB  - Sweden's 2017 Climate Act is part of a climate policy framework aiming for net zero domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 2045. The framework was based on a proposal from the All Party Committee on Environmental Objectives (the Committee), in which members from all participating parliamentary parties agreed unanimously. This was despite a contested climate debate running in parallel, notwithstanding strong criticism from business confederations and trade unions. Aiming to draw lessons of value for climate policy-making, this study explores the main factors that influenced the work and outcomes of the Committee, based on a series of in-depth interviews and document review. The research design is linked to policy process theories. The interviews mainly concern underlying motives, the role of knowledge, the influence of impact assessments, and international influence. It is shown that a continuous and comprehensive learning process in the Committee was instrumental for achieving consensus, including addressing concerns among some members regarding policy costs and constitutionality. The Committee was also influenced by policy developments elsewhere, referred to as policy diffusion, notably from the U.K. Climate Change Act and the UNFCCC COP 21 policy process. Over time, a cross-party consensus among Committee members emerged and led to the invention of an original policy proposal. The consensus was instrumental for generating support for the proposal in an otherwise conflictual political landscape. As a result, a governmental bill based on the proposal was eventually enacted into law, renewing Sweden's climate policy with a climate change act coupled to ambitious climate objectives. Key policy insights
   Joint learning on factually complex and normatively contested climate issues requires time and comprehensive processes but can lead to policy inventions and ambitious outcomes. Policy diffusion between countries may be important for raising ambitions and shaping innovative, new elements of national climate policy. Framework climate change acts and specific climate laws can be mutually supportive, i.e. frameworks foster more ambitious sectoral laws and the more precise sectoral laws, the easier it is to agree on stricter overall ambitions. Adoption of more stringent climate policies may require precise dismantling of arguments working against action, in particular on policy costs.

TI  - Evolution of a holistic systems approach to planning and managing road safety: the Victorian case study, 1970-2015
T2  - INJURY PREVENTION
AB  - Background The Victorian Safe System approach to road safety slowly evolved from a combination of the Swedish Vision Zero philosophy and the Sustainable Safety model developed by the Dutch. The Safe System approach reframes the way in which road safety is viewed and managed.
   Methods This paper presents a case study of the institutional change required to underpin the transformation to a holistic approach to planning and managing road safety in Victoria, Australia.
   Results The adoption and implementation of a Safe System approach require strong institutional leadership and close cooperation among all the key agencies involved, and Victoria was fortunate in that it had a long history of strong interagency mechanisms in place. However, the challenges in the implementation of the Safe System strategy in Victoria are generally neither technical nor scientific; they are predominantly social and political. While many governments purport to develop strategies based on Safe System thinking, on-the-ground action still very much depends on what politicians perceive to be publicly acceptable, and Victoria is no exception.
   Conclusions This is a case study of the complexity of institutional change and is presented in the hope that the lessons may prove useful for others seeking to adopt more holistic planning and management of road safety. There is still much work to be done in Victoria, but the institutional cultural shift has taken root. Ongoing efforts must be continued to achieve alert and compliant road users; however, major underpinning benefits will be achieved through focusing on road network safety improvements (achieving forgiving infrastructure, such as wire rope barriers) in conjunction with reviews of posted speed limits (to be set in response to the level of protection offered by the road infrastructure) and by the progressive introduction into the fleet of modern vehicle safety features.

TI  - Assessing Responsive Building Envelope Designs through Robustness-Based Multi-Criteria Decision Making in Zero-Emission Buildings
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - Responsive building envelopes (RBEs) are central to developing sustainability strategies for zero emission/energy buildings (ZEBs). RBEs are a large group of complex technologies and systems, which is why multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are helpful to navigate sustainability assessments considering various performance indicators. This article first provides a literature review of assessment criteria and key performance indicators for RBEs and an analysis of existing robustness-based MCDM methods. Then, a methodological approach to assess RBE designs in ZEB projects is proposed as an extension of a novel robustness-based MCDM method that normalizes the objective functions according to defined targets and combines them into one comprehensive indicator (MT-KPI), thereby eliminating the need to weight objectives. The proposed methodological approach is finally tested on a case study of a Norwegian ZEB, where five competitive RBE designs (including building integrated photovoltaics, phase change material, and electrochromic windows) and eight occupancy and climate scenarios are investigated considering three main performance areas: energy use, thermal comfort, and load matching. The results in the case study show that with the proposed MCDM approach the different designs have MT-KPI values between 1.4 and 12.8, where a lower value is better. In this specific case, the most robust building RBE alternative was identified as the one with electrochromic windows and a control based on incident solar radiation and indoor air temperature.

TI  - The response of methane and nitrous oxide fluxes to forest change in Europe
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Forests in Europe are changing due to interactions between climate change, nitrogen (N) deposition and new forest management practices. The concurrent impact on the forest greenhouse gas (GHG) balance is at present difficult to predict due to a lack of knowledge on controlling factors of GHG fluxes and response to changes in these factors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of the ongoing changes, we studied the response of soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) at twelve experimental or natural gradient forest sites, representing anticipated future forest change. The experimental manipulations, one or more per site, included N addition (4 sites), changes of climate (temperature, 1 site; precipitation, 2 sites), soil hydrology (3 sites), harvest intensity (1 site), wood ash fertilisation (1 site), pH gradient in organic soil (1 site) and afforestation of cropland (1 site).
   On average, N2O emissions increased by 0.06+/-0.03 (range 0-0.3) g N2O-N m(-2) yr(-1) across all treatments on mineral soils, but the increase was up to 10 times higher in an acidic organic soil. Soil moisture together with mineral soil C/N ratio and pH were found to significantly influence N2O emissions across all treatments. Emissions were increased by elevated N deposition, especially in interaction with increased soil moisture. High pH reduced the formation of N2O, even under otherwise favourable soil conditions.
   Oxidation (uptake) of CH4 was on average reduced from 0.16+/-0.02 to 0.04+/-0.05 g CH4-Cm-2 yr(-1) by the investigated treatments. The CH4 exchange was significantly influenced by soil moisture and soil C/N ratio across all treatments, and CH4 emissions occurred only in wet or water-saturated conditions.
   For most of the investigated forest manipulations or natural gradients, the response of both N2O and CH4 fluxes was towards reducing the overall GHG forest sink. The most resilient forests were dry Mediterranean forests, as well as forests with high soil C/N ratio or high soil pH. Mitigation strategies may focus on (i) sustainable management of wet forest areas and forested peatlands, (ii) continuous forest cover management, (iii) reducing atmospheric N input and, thus, N availability, and (iv) improving neutralisation capacity of acid soils (e.g. wood ash application).

TI  - Sustainable Public Procurement in Large Infrastructure Projects-Policy Implementation for Carbon Emission Reductions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The infrastructure construction sector is a significant source of carbon emissions, and more stringent procurement requirements are central to meeting reduction targets in this demand-led and project-based industry. This paper aims to analyze the implementation of international policies for reducing carbon emissions in infrastructure construction, focusing on the interaction between policy ambitions and procurement practices. Based on case studies of large projects and their contexts in five countries worldwide: Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and the US, a cross-country comparison is performed of how policies and practices for carbon reduction develop across multiple implementation levels. Three levels are included in the analysis: policy, industry, and project level. We identify the projects as either drivers of policy goals, frontrunners in industry-level development processes, or translators of national policy. These roles, and the associated pathways for carbon emission reduction, are context-specific and depend on the policy ambitions at the national or regional level, the maturity of the supplier market, and, often, on the strategies of individual champions at the project level. Long-term learning processes, both within and between the various levels, are essential for advancing carbon reduction.

TI  - The 2017 Oslo conference report on neglected tropical diseases and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases - focus on populations underserved
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
AB  - BackgroundIn 2017, the Centre for Global Health (CGH) at the University of Oslo in collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) held a meeting to discuss together with leading figures in disease control, research and development the issue of neglected tropical diseases and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. This commentary has taken up this discussion and the conclusions drawn at this meeting to make a case for the opportunity the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide in highlighting the interconnectedness of factors that are relevant in the successful fight against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and emerging infectious diseases (EIDS).Main bodyDespite NTDs being endemic and EIDS being epidemic, in order to prevent both disease groups effectively, it is important to appreciate that they share essential health determining factors, namely: neglect, poverty, a lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities and an absence of or severely limited provision of healthcare as well as in many cases a zoonotic nature. Instead of looking to simple disease management for the answer, the SDGs help to understand the interplay of multiple priority areas and thereby help to promote a more holistic approach to addressing these two disease groups.ConclusionsTheir commonalities mean that the Global Health community should leverage opportunities and efforts in the prevention and elimination of both NTDs and EIDs. Doing so using a One Health approach is considered to offer a public health best-buy. Concrete solutions are proposed.

TI  - Identifying and addressing barriers for the sustainable development of natural gas as automotive fuel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB  - In recognition of the risks associated with climate change, governments around the world have tried to develop and define policies to address greenhouse gas emissions with transport recognized as one of major sources of greenhouse gases and air pollution. Apart from climate change, there is another side to this coin, and that is the risks surrounding energy security and future oil supplies. Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly recognizing their role in contributing to the goal of decarbonizing the economy and reduce dependence on oil. Out of available alternate fuels compressed natural gas (CNG) is the one which is meeting the maximum needs of countries worldwide, who want to switch over to alternate fuels. However, despite the fact that CNG are often seen as a panacea by policy-makers, there are a number of barriers to their widespread market penetration and diffusion. This study aims to identify an approach to strategic framework for addressing the barriers to widespread adoption of compressed natural gas as transportation fuel. Besides assessing the barriers to natural gas vehicles, the study attempts to identify how they can affect various stakeholders. The paper systematically examines natural gas vehicles (NGVs) adoption patterns and the evolution of pertinent market structures throughout the world but majorly concentrated on eleven countries:, China, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, India, Brazil, Italy, United States, Germany, Sweden and South Korea. The underlying paper set out an objective of presentation of the framework for supporting policy makers in aspects including; identifying and assessing qualitative aspects of the barriers and consequently defining measures for their resolutions.

TI  - Trying Out Mobility as a Service Experiences from a Field Trial and Implications for Understanding Demand
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - The concept of mobility as a service (MaaS) has been proposed as a feasible way to achieve more sustainable transport. One example of such a service is UbiGo, a broker service for everyday urban travel developed and evaluated within the Go:Smart project in Gothenburg, Sweden. This paper presents evidence of travel behavior and related changes from a 6-month field operational test (FOT), during which 195 participants tested the new service. On the basis of the responses to participant questionnaires and interviews and the information recorded in travel diaries, change-enabling service attributes were identified. Such attributes included the transportation smorgasbord concept, simplicity, improved access and flexibility, and economy. Although not a service attribute per se, the FOT also enabled the new behaviors to be evaluated in a trial and a reevaluation of convenience. The broader implications of the findings of the FOT to obtain an understanding of travelers' new choices and behaviors for the future design of MaaS are discussed. Service design and demand are not independent of each other, and if a mobility service is to change behavior i.e., achieve an impact) as well as create added value, these goals need to drive design decisions and the deliberate, conscious development of service dimensions, such as customization, bundling, and the range of the offer. On the basis of the experiences gained, the authors emphasize the need for a more holistic and flexible perspective on mobility (and the design perspective on mobility services) that is focused on serving users' needs and that involves capitalizing on synergies between public and private actors to develop the MaaS offer and better meet the urban mobility challenge ahead.

TI  - Influence of the Fermented Feed and Vaccination and Their Interaction on Parameters of Large White/Norwegian Landrace Piglets
T2  - ANIMALS
AB  - Simple Summary Farm animals are constantly exposed to pathogenic microorganisms, which can lead to bacterial, as well as secondary infections caused by viruses. For this reason, vaccination is used. However, many discussions have been published about the effectiveness of this prophylactic measure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of fermented feed on non-vaccinated (NV) and vaccinated with Circovac porcine circovirus type 2 vaccine piglets' blood parameters, gut microbial composition, growth performance and ammonia emission. The 36-day experiment was conducted using 25-day-old Large White/Norwegian Landrace piglets, which were randomly divided into four groups each comprising 100 piglets (NV piglets fed with soya meal, vaccinated piglets fed with soya meal, NV piglets fed with fermented rapeseed meal and vaccinated piglets fed with fermented rapeseed meal). The results revealed that vaccination, as a separate factor, did not significantly influence piglets' blood parameters. Finally, rapeseed meal fermented with the selected lactic acid bacteria strains can be used instead of expensive imported soya, because the fermented feed did not cause undesirable changes in piglets' health and growth performance. Furthermore, the process is more sustainable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of fermented with a newly isolated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains combination (Lactobacillus plantarumLUHS122,Lactobacillus caseiLUHS210,Lactobacillus farraginisLUHS206,Pediococcus acidilacticiLUHS29,Lactobacillus plantarumLUHS135 andLactobacillus uvarumLUHS245) feed on non-vaccinated (NV) and vaccinated with Circovac porcine circovirus type 2 vaccine (QI09AA07, CEVA-PHYLAXIA Co. Ltd. Szallas u. 5. 1107 Budapest, Hungary) piglets' blood parameters, gut microbial composition, growth performance and ammonia emission. The 36-day experiment was conducted using 25-day-old Large White/Norwegian Landrace (LW/NL) piglets, which were randomly divided into four groups with 100 piglets each: S-nonV-non-vaccinated piglets fed with control group compound feed; S-V-vaccinated piglets fed with control group compound feed; RFnonV-non-vaccinated piglets fed with fermented compound feed; RFV-vaccinated piglets fed with fermented compound feed. Samples from 10 animals per group were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment. Metagenomic analysis showed that fermentation had a positive impact on theLactobacillusprevalence during the post-weaning period of pigs, and vaccination had no negative impact on microbial communities. Although a higher amount ofLactobacilluswas detected in vaccinated, compared with non-vaccinated groups. At the end of experiment, there was a significantly higher LAB count in the faeces of both vaccinated compared to non-vaccinated groups (26.6% for S(V)and 17.2% for RFV), with the highest LAB count in the S(V)group. At the end of experiment, the S(V)faeces also had the highest total bacteria count (TBC). The RF(V)group had a 13.2% increase in total enterobacteria count (TEC) at the end of experiment, and the S(V)group showed a 31.2% higher yeast/mould (Y/M) count. There were no significant differences in the average daily gain (ADG) among the groups; however, there were significant differences in the feed conversion ratios (FCR) between several groups: S(V)vs. S-nonV(11.5% lower in the S(V)group), RF(V)vs. RFnonV(10.
   2% lower in the RFnonV group) and S(V)vs. RFV(21.6% lower in the S(V)group). Furthermore, there was a significant, very strong positive correlation between FCR and TEC in piglets' faeces (R = 0.919,p= 0.041). The lowest ammonia emission was in RF(V)group section (58.2, 23.8, and 47.33% lower compared with the S-nonV, S(V)and RF(nonV)groups, respectively). Notably, there was lower ammonia emission in vaccinated groups (45.2% lower in S(V)vs. S(nonV)and 47.33% lower in RF(V)vs. RFnonV). There was also a significant, very strong positive correlation between ammonia emission and Y/M count in piglets' faeces at the end of the experiment (R = 0.974;p= 0.013). Vaccination as a separate factor did not significantly influence piglets' blood parameters. Overall, by changing from an extruded soya to cheaper rapeseed meal and applying the fermentation model with the selected LAB combination, it is possible to feed piglets without any undesirable changes in health and growth performance in a more sustainable manner. However, to evaluate the influence of vaccination and its interaction with other parameters (feed, piglets' age, breed, etc.) on piglets' parameters, additional studies should be performed and methods should be standardised to ensure the results may be compared.

TI  - Dynamic site index model and trends in changes of site productivity for <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> (L.) Gaertn. in southern Poland
T2  - DENDROBIOLOGY
AB  - Black alder is naturally widespread across all of Europe and has an increasing importance for forest ecosystems. Thanks to the considerable tolerance to adverse climatic and edaphic environmental conditions black alder is important both in open landscapes and can also be involved in the rehabilitation of disturbed soils. Assessment of site productivity is essential for providing a frame of reference for silvicultural diagnosis and prescription in order to ensure the sustainability of existing and newly established ecosystems. The most accepted method of evaluating site productivity is the site index (SI). The aim of the presented research was to develop the SI model for black alder in southern Poland. The developed SI model was used as a tool in order to test the research hypothesis assuming the increase in site productivity for black alder in southern Poland. The research material for development of SI model were stem analysis data from 180 research plots. Both, the local model parameter, which was estimated individually for every tree, and the other parameters estimated globally for the whole data set were estimated simultaneously. Changes in site productivity were analyzed on research plots and a set of 12,974 stands from the forest inventory database. Site indices calculated using the developed model are negatively correlated with age/positively correlated with establishment year of the stands. This confirms the existence of the phenomenon of increasing site productivity for black alder. During the last century site productivity measured with site index increased on average 5 m. Therefore, black alder that belongs to the fast-growing tree species should be considered of the increasing importance for forest management.

TI  - What incentives influence employers to engage in workplace health interventions?
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: To achieve a sustainable working life it is important to know more about what could encourage employers to increase the use of preventive and health promotive interventions. The objective of the study is to explore and describe the employer perspective regarding what incentives influence their use of preventive and health promotive workplace interventions.
   Method: Semi-structured focus group interviews were carried out with 20 representatives from 19 employers across Sweden. The economic sectors represented were municipalities, government agencies, defence, educational, research, and development institutions, health care, manufacturing, agriculture and commercial services. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the data were analysed using latent content analysis.
   Results: Various incentives were identified in the analysis, namely: "law and provisions", "consequences for the workplace", "knowledge of worker health and workplace health interventions", "characteristics of the intervention", "communication and collaboration with the provider". The incentives seemed to influence the decision-making in parallel with each other and were not only related to positive incentives for engaging in workplace health interventions, but also to disincentives.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the decision to engage in workplace health interventions was influenced by several incentives. There are those incentives that lead to a desire to engage in a workplace health intervention, others pertain to aspects more related to the intervention use, such as the characteristics of the employer, the provider and the intervention. It is important to take all incentives into consideration when trying to understand the decision-making process for workplace health interventions and to bridge the gap between what is produced through research and what is used in practice.

TI  - Competitive ability of natural Douglas fir regeneration in central European close-to-nature forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) has regenerated naturally in European forests since the middle of the 20th century. Some cases of an invasive character of the species have been reported under specific site conditions, but systematic data on the extent of natural regeneration and spread of Douglas fir across different forest communities are largely lacking. Due to its potential tolerance to increasing summer droughts, Douglas fir has been suggested as a sustainable future tree species for Central European forests. In this study, we investigated natural regeneration of Douglas fir in comparison to native tree species in 39 forest stands in Switzerland belonging to different forest communities. We analyzed the regeneration success of Douglas fir, Norway spruce (Picea abies), silver fir (Abies alba), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica) with respect to ecological site conditions. The proportion of Douglas fir seedlings (<130 cm height) was <5% in the majority of stands; but in four stands, Douglas fir was the most abundant species among seedlings. In most other stands, Norway spruce (occurring in 37 stands/ dominant in 10 stands), silver fir (38/2 stands) and beech seedlings (35/10 stands) were more abundant than Douglas fir seedlings. Saplings (>= 130 cm height but <12 cm diameter at breast height) of Douglas fir were observed in five stands with proportions between 10% and 23% and in eight stands with proportions of <10%, in particular in stands with a high proportion of Douglas fir seed trees. Beech saplings occurred in 28 stands and were most abundant in eleven stands. Saplings of silver fir (24/3 stands) and Norway spruce (19/6 stands) were less frequent. The abundance of Douglas fir seedlings correlated positively with the proximity to seed trees and light transmission of the canopy, but negatively with understory vegetation cover and litter abundance. Ungulate browsing did not significantly affect the regeneration of any tree species in the study stands. On the Central Plateau, Douglas fir was mainly planted in productive beech forest communities where it is strongly limited due to its low competitiveness compared to beech and other fast-growing deciduous tree species. On dry and less productive sites, where the canopy is not closed, Douglas fir is able to establish successfully. On such sites, a close monitoring of Douglas fir regeneration and the potential implementation of control measures is recommended.

TI  - MOBBING IN THE WORKPLACE AMONG RESPONDENTS-TEACHERS EMPLOYED IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS OF THE CITY OF POZEGA, POZESKO-SLAVONSKA COUNTY, REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
T2  - PRAVNI VJESNIK
AB  - Initial research into the phenomenon of workplace mobbing dates back to 1972 and was conducted in Sweden. Of exceptional importance for determining the existence of mobbing, is a proper understanding of the behaviour that can be subsumed under the term as well as its clear distinction from the usual conflicts in the workplace and various forms of harassment. The aim of the present paper is to check the existence of mobbing in the workplace among respondents - teachers employed in secondary schools in the City of Pozega, Republic of Croatia. In this sense, the paper is divided into two parts in terms of content: theoretical and special part. In the theoretical part of the paper, mobbing will be conceptually defined and its distinction towards harassment as a form of discrimination will be analyzed. The theoretical part of the paper includes an overview of earlier research into mobbing in the EU and the Republic of Croatia and an analysis of the procedure for obtaining legal protection in the case of mobbing in accordance with applicable regulations of the Republic of Croatia. A special part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of the results collected by the conducted empirical research. The mentioned research included 350 teachers employed in six secondary schools in the City of Pozega. These are the Gymnasium, the School of Economics, the Technical School, the School of Crafts, the School of Agriculture and Food and the Music School. At the end of the paper, the author presents concluding remarks in which she gives recommendations for improving the detected problems.

TI  - Influence of temperature and photoperiod on sprouting capacity of Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis root buds
T2  - WEED RESEARCH
AB  - Liew J, Andersson L, Bostrom U, Forkman J, Hakman I & Magnuski E (2012). Influence of temperature and photoperiod on sprouting capacity of Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis root buds. Weed Research.52, 449-457. Summary Timing of treatment is a key to successful and sustainable weed management. For perennial weeds, highly energy-demanding, repeated stubble cultivation or tillage is a common strategy in organic agriculture. The fragmentation of underground material stimulates root buds to grow and, if repeated, significantly reduces the energy and nutrient resources of the roots. However, the effect might differ depending on variation in sprouting over the season and among species. Here, we studied the impact of different photoperiods and temperatures on sprouting capacity of root buds of Cirsium arvense and Sonchus arvensis in a climate chamber experiment. Two populations of each species, collected in northern and southern Sweden, were used. Plants were exposed to long (18 h), short (12 h) or decreasing (from 18 to 8 h) photoperiods in combinations with high (18/12 degrees C for 16/8 h), low (12/6 degrees C), decreasing (from 21 to 5 degrees C in 4 weeks) or constant high (16 degrees C) temperatures. Sprouting capacity was evaluated based on the proportion of sprouting buds from short root fragments. Neither temperature nor photoperiod affected root bud sprouting in C. arvense, while in S. arvensis, photoperiod seemed to regulate sprouting capacity. The proportion of sprouted buds decreased in short photoperiods, especially if combined with high temperature. In northern conditions, this suggests that weeding strategies based on fragmentation of the root system of S. arvensis will have low efficiency if the autumns are warm.

TI  - Evaluation of the ReVAQ project to achieve safe use of wastewater sludge in agriculture
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
CP  - 5th World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association
AB  - The use of wastewater sludge on arable land in Sweden has been limited for some years due to the low quality, in some respects, of the sludge and to the reluctance of farmers and the food industry to use it. To improve the quality of the sludge, the ReVAQ project has been started, and it now involves seven municipal wastewater organisations. The goal of the project is to introduce a process in which the quality is successively improved by a series of actions taken by society. These actions include tracking and eliminating sources of heavy metals and other substances. As there are numerous sources of some of the substances, the work concentrates on the major sources. Another important activity is to provide information to the users of the wastewater system. The project is being evaluated by Urban Water AB. The results from the first two years indicate that it may be possible to reach the primary technical goal: to obtain a sludge quality that corresponds to that of household wastewater. The more ambitious goal of reaching a quality corresponding to that of WC water (the sum of urine and faeces) does not seem realistic without far-reaching changes in society. The organisations involved, which take the work seriously and are goal-oriented, have achieved measurable results in a short time. The work is also accepted and supported by the board members. More effort is needed, however, to inform the users about the system, and to [motivate them to] change their behaviour regarding matters such as the purchase of everyday products and the use of the toilet facilities.

TI  - Safe motherhood: the FIGO initiative
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
AB  - Over the last twenty years the international community-realizing that the tragedy of women dying during pregnancy and in childbirth could no longer be tolerated-launched a series of initiatives aimed at making safe motherhood a cornerstone of health services in all countries. Making pregnancy and delivery safe events is particularly complex, as it involves infrastructural and logistic, as well as technical, issues. Women die because they have no access to skilled personnel during pregnancy and at the time of delivery and because-if an emergency situation arises-they cannot reach a facility where emergency obstetric services are available. FIGO, the International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology-as the only global organization representing the Obstetricians of the world-decided some time ago that it could not limit its activities to proposing technical guidelines and debating scientific issues. It had to move into the field and, through its affiliated societies, help change the ability of the multitude of women in the developing world to obtain skilled attendance at birth. In 1997, plans were made to launch activities in five areas where maternal mortality was particularly high: Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador), Ethiopia, Mozambique, Pakistan, and Uganda. Five member societies from the developed world (the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the Italian Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of the United Kingdom: and the Swedish Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology) agreed to provide support to their counterparts in these five selected areas. The project is now in its final stage. Results are, by and large, positive, demonstrating that, by motivating health professionals in the field and for a relatively modest financial outlay, more efficient use of existing services could be made in a sustainable fashion to save lives.

TI  - Testing the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm for spatially explicit reconstruction of vegetation in northern Michigan and Wisconsin
T2  - QUATERNARY RESEARCH
AB  - The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) overcomes some of the fundamental problems in pollen analysis for quantitative reconstruction of vegetation. LRA first uses the REVEALS model to estimate regional vegetation using pollen data from large sites and then the LOVE model to estimate vegetation composition within the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) at small sites by subtracting the background pollen estimated from the regional vegetation composition. This study tests LRA using training data from forest hollows in northern Michigan (35 sites) and northwestern Wisconsin (43 sites). In northern Michigan, surface pollen from 152-ha and 332-ha lakes is used for REVEALS. Because of the lack of pollen data from large lakes in northwestern Wisconsin, we use pollen from 21 hollows randomly selected from the 43 sites for REVEALS. RSAP indirectly estimated by LRA is comparable to the expected value in each region. A regression analysis and permutation test validate that the LRA-based vegetation reconstruction is significantly more accurate than pollen percentages alone in both regions. Even though the site selection in northwestern Wisconsin is not ideal, the results are robust. The LRA is a significant step forward in quantitative reconstruction of vegetation.

TI  - Translanguaging space and translanguaging practices in multilingual Russian-speaking families
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
AB  - Translanguaging is seen both as a threat and as an opportunity for minority language development and transmission. While the theme of translanguaging has been explored especially in a context of migration, the novelty of this study lies in its investigation of the multiple contexts in which translanguaging is examined. In order to understand the nature of translanguaging, we adopt a novel interdisciplinary approach and view it in all its complexity, including liminal spaces of linguistic landscape. Family language policy affects the home linguistic environment. Our purpose is to investigate language choices by multilingual Russian-speakers in Cyprus, Sweden and Estonia, immigrant and minority settings, and try to understand how they are reflected in the multilingual interaction of the families. Using ethnographic participant observations and oral spontaneous multilingual production, our study attempts to describe how communication is managed through translanguaging practices among multilingual Russian-speaking families' members in the cultural and linguistic environments of the three countries. By looking closely at the complexities of translanguaging space, it is our ambition to gain new insights about how it is organised and how translanguaging becomes a valuable linguistic resource in multilingual families. Our results indicate that translanguaging practices can be used in family conversational contexts and contribute to the the three settings. A language shift can happen more quickly than expected, and, thus, it is important for parents to provide many opportunities for practising Russian as the L1.

TI  - Revised human impact in north-western Germany during the Neolithic: methodological limits and challenges
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB  - The present study aims to improve our understanding of the chronology of vegetation changes in north-western Germany during the Neolithic. Therefore, four archived peat profiles from small mires that had been pollen analysed and partly conventionally radiocarbon dated during the 1990s were re-evaluated. Based on new accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dates, there are considerable differences between the existing and the newly developed age-depth models. These are also caused by the exclusion of pollen events that were previously assumed to be synchronous, and results from archaeological investigations as dating horizons, hence avoiding circular reasoning in the present study. In addition to the re-evaluation of archived material, a new profile was recovered, pollen analysed and AMS radiocarbon dated to gain insights into the regional vegetation development and to put local human impact on the landscape in a broader context. The results indicate three different phases of human-induced vegetation changes. The local vegetation changes do not follow this general pattern, but reflect a very patchy landscape which in turn probably refers to quite small pollen source areas. The study emphasizes that vegetation changes seen in local pollen profiles should neither be regarded as general trends nor be used as dating horizons for neighbouring sites.

TI  - Assessment of Central Asian heat extremes by statistical downscaling: Validation and future projection for 2015-2100
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
AB  - Increasing heatwaves and extreme temperatures have recently been observed across Central Asia (CA). Accurately assessing and projecting the changing climate extremes at the local (station) scale required for climate risk management are therefore highly important. However, global and regional climate models often fail to represent the statistical distributions of observed daily extreme variables and hence extremes in complex terrain. In this work, we developed a statistical downscaling (SD) model to project summer daily maximum temperature (Tmax) and heatwave indices for 65 meteorological stations in CA toward 2100. The SD model involves first-order autoregression and multiple linear regression using large-scale Tmax and circulation indices (CIs) as predictors, and the model is cross-validated against historical observations. The local Tmax and heatwave indices are then projected for 2015-2100 driven by the output of a global climate model (CNRM-CM6-1) under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). The application of the SD model significantly improves forecasting of the probability distribution (10th/90th percentiles) of Tmax at stations, particularly across mountainous regions. The model also captures interannual variability and the long-term trend in Tmax, consistent with synoptic-scale inputs. SD projections demonstrate strong warming trends of summer Tmax in CA toward 2100 with rates between 0.35-0.64 degrees C per decade based on the SSP245 and SSP370 scenarios. Consequently, heatwave occurrence is projected to rise by 1.0-5.0 and 2.0-7.0 d per decade under the SSP245 and SSP370 scenarios, respectively, by 2100. Duration, intensity, and amplitude of heatwaves rise at greater rates under higher-emission scenarios, particularly in southeastern CA. The proposed SD model serves as a useful tool for assessing local climate extremes, which are needed for regional risk management and policymaking for adaption to climate change.

TI  - Characteristics of lightnings igniting forest fires in Austria
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
AB  - Besides anthropogenic causes, lightning is the major reason for forest fire ignition worldwide. Information on lightning characteristics and impact points is missing or controversial, due to the difficulty of lightning stroke localization and the relation to single forest fire events. Austria as an Alpine country experiences a high number of thunderstorms and lightnings, which ignite more than one third of forest fires from June to August. With data from the "Austrian Lightning Detection and Information System" (ALDIS) it was possible to link single lightnings and their characteristics to the location and attributes of individual forest fires. Three subsets with lightning data were compiled and analyzed regarding their strength (kA), polarity (positive or negative) and multiplicity (number of re-strokes). Additional data on the time of ignition, burned area, sea level, exposition and burned vegetation were investigated. Two fire weather sub-indices (FFMC Fine Fuel Moisture Code and BUI Build Up Index) of the Canadian FWI (Fire Weather Index) were calculated for the location of the impact point of each lightning and over a period of twenty days, including the day of ignition. Positive lightnings were significantly more likely to induce a fire. Both the FFMC and BUI showed a significant mean decrease after the day of ignition. Precipitation was significant lower at those impact points where forest fires were ignited. Burned area was larger when lightnings ignited during day hours. Most lightning fires occurred at higher altitudes with southerly or western exposition, mainly in stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L.). Pine species were four times more often affected than the natural tree species distribution would assume. The study results contribute to the international discussion on lightning fires and will help to provide recommendations for further modelling studies on the forecast of lightning caused forest fires.

TI  - Strategic niche management for sustainable mobility
T2  - SOCIAL COSTS AND SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY: STRATEGIES AND EXPERIENCES IN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES
CP  - 4th International Social Cost and Sustainability Conference
AB  - The existing system of land-based transport based on the individual use of automobiles for passenger transport and trucks for freight transport is not sustainable. Problems of pollution and congestion are pressing public authorities to take action but this is far from easy. One reason why it so difficult for authorities to do something about transport-related problems is that there appear to be no attractive alternatives. Sustainable technologies that fulfil important user requirements in terms of performance and price are most often not available on the market. Ideas of what might be more sustainable technologies and systems exist, but the long development times, uncertainty about market demand and social gains, and the need for change at different levels - in organisation, technology, infrastructure and the wider social and institutional context - provide a great barrier. This paper offers a way to escape the gridlock by engaging in what we call "Strategic Niche Management" (SNM). SNM aims at taking the new technologies to the market place to try and use them in selected settings - niches - by real users. The niches consist of domains of application in which the technology (or new mobility system) is already attractive to use due to specific circumstances (a local problem or the availability of specific, low cost resources). Experiences in the niche are then used to inform decisions about technical improvement and support policies, aimed at expanding the original niche and making a transition towards a more sustainable transport system. The protected space, in which the technology is temporary protected from the full force of normal selection pressures, acts as a test bed and incubator for the new technology. It may pave the way for private and government support policies in a gradual, non-distortionary, and thus feasable way. The paper provides three examples of SNM in Europe: the large-scale experiment with light-weight electric vehicles in Mendrisio (CH), organised car sharing in Switzerland and Rolling Highway in Sweden.

TI  - Rapid evolution of genetic and phenotypic divergence in Atlantic salmon following the colonisation of two new branches of a watercourse
T2  - GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
AB  - Background: Selection acts strongly on individuals that colonise a habitat and have phenotypic traits that deviate from the local optima. Our objective was to investigate the evolutionary rates in Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) in a river system (the Vefsna watershed in Norway), fewer than 15 generations after colonisation of two new branches of the watercourse for spawning, which were made available by construction offish ladders in 1889.
   Methods: Differences in age and size were analysed using scale samples collected by anglers. Age and size of recaptures from a tagging experiment were compared between the three branches. Furthermore, genetic analyses of scale samples collected in the three river branches during two periods were performed to evaluate whether observed differences evolved by genetic divergence over this short period, or were the result of phenotypic plasticity.
   Results: We demonstrate that evolution can be rapid when fish populations are subjected to strong selection, in spite of sympatry with their ancestral group, no physical barriers to hybridisation, and natal homing as the only reproductive isolating barrier. After fewer than 15 generations, there was evidence of genetic isolation between the two branches based on genetic variation at 96 single nucleotide polymorphism loci, and significant differences in several life history traits, including size and age at maturity. Selection against large size at maturity appears to have occurred, since large individuals were reluctant to ascend the branch with less abundant water. The estimated evolutionary rate of change in life history traits is within the upper 3 to 7% reported in other fish studies on microevolutionary rates.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that with sufficient genetic diversity, Atlantic salmon can rapidly colonise and evolve to new accessible habitats. This has profound implications for conservation and restoration of populations and habitats in order to meet evolutionary challenges, including alterations in water regime, whether altered by climate change or anthropogenic factors.

TI  - The effects on safety, time consumption and environment of large scale use of roundabouts in an urban area:: a case study
T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB  - An experiment with small roundabouts-as speed reducing measures-was carried out in a Swedish city. The purpose of the study was to test the large scale and long term effects of the roundabouts. The results showed that the roundabouts reduced the speed considerably at the junctions and on links between roundabouts. The lateral displacement the roundabout forces the driver to has a great importance for the speed of approaching cars to a roundabout. The speed-reducing effect is large already at a 2 m deflection. A larger deflection does not result in a larger effect. Conflict studies indicated an overall decrease in accident risk by 44%. Vulnerable road-users' risk was reduced significantly, while there was no reduction for car occupants. There is a relation between the reduction of approach speed and the reduction of injury accident risk. The time consumption at a time operated signal was reduced heavily by the instalment of a roundabout at a signalised intersection. On average, emissions (CO and NOx) at roundabouts replacing non-signalised junctions increased by between 4 and 6%, while a roundabout replacing a signalised intersection led to a reduction by between 20 and 29%. The noise level was reduced at junctions that were provided with roundabout. Car drivers were less positive to the roundabouts than bicyclists. In the long term, the unchanged roundabouts worked almost as good as they did shortly after the rebuilding. The study showed that details in the design are of decisive importance for road-users' safety. Special attention has to be paid to the situation of bicyclists. The transition between the cycle path/lane and the junction has to be designed with care-the bicyclists should be integrated with motorised traffic before they enter the roundabout. There should be only one car lane both on the approach, in the circulating area and on the exit. The size of the roundabout shall be as small as possible. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - Iconoclasm - A Road to Modernization?
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW
AB  - My point of departure is a conflict over images in the churches in Bergen, Norway in the 1560s, around 30 years after the Reformation. This introduced a brief period of iconoclasm in Denmark-Norway, inspired by Reformed theology. Soon, however, mainstream Lutheranism took over and statues and pictures were reintroduced. The different views on images in the two Protestant confessions - Lutheranism and Calvinism - are, of course, well known, as are also the various theological arguments in the debate between them. More interesting is the practical question of how it was possible to manage without images when addressing a largely illiterate audience. Here, Lutherans seemed to have basically the same attitude as Catholics, although they differed in the exact way the images were used. Both were 'mass religions', aiming at including the whole population and using whatever means necessary for this purpose. By contrast, Calvinism was an intellectual and elite religion, creating tight communities of true believers in accordance with the belief in Predestination. It has therefore been regarded as an important factor in modernization theories, from Weber's explanation of capitalism to later theories of the link between Reformed Protestantism and modern science. Although there is little to indicate that pictures are an obstacle to science, the intellectual and elitist character of Reformed Protestantism may have contributed to the scientific revolution in the early modern period. Generally, the history of iconoclasm illustrates the fact that images are a powerful medium, particularly when most people are illiterate, and that a religion that abstains from this medium is faced with the challenge of finding a replacement for it.

TI  - Pattern of Participation and a Comparative Analysis of Thai and Malaysian Students' Perception towards the Learning Platform and Environment of EU-SUPPORT Social Network
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING
CP  - 5th International Conference on e-Learning
AB  - The EU-SUPPORT network is a sub network under the Norwegian Environmental Education Network that focuses on schools from the European Union and some outside the EU to promote the quality / education for sustainability. The main activity of the project was the International Campaign of CO2 on the way to school measured by means of transportation to and from school. The resources and instructions of project activities were available on the website of CO(2)nnect and communication among participants was facilitated through web-based instruction under EU-SUPPORT network system. While students are engaged in learning activities, the development of social network is monitored through participation and interaction among participants. Pattern of the participation in the social network was represented in terms of the amount of discussion and frequency of participation. To examine if discussion was sustained, quality of discussion is determined by the average length of discussion thread. Communication messages were categorized into groups and the average discussion thread was calculated. Two hundred students from secondary schools in Thailand and Malaysia took part as distributed learners in this network through collaborative web-based project along with other network members from schools around the globe. A students' perception questionnaire was administered that included the constructs learning platform and leaning environment. Results from independent t-test analysis indicate that there is no significant difference between mean score of students' perception between the Thai and malaysian students in the learning platform though there is a significant difference in their perception towards the learning environment, t(198)=3.13, p.<0.05 (p=0.002). Considering that the EU-SUPPORT is a large network, the density of 0.31 measured is considered to be high. Consequently, interaction in this student collaborative social network under EU-SUPPORT appears to be active.

TI  - Estimation of pollen productivity and dispersal: How pollen assemblages in small lakes represent vegetation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Quantitative understanding of vegetation dynamics over timespans beyond a century remains limited. In this regard, the pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation enables unique research opportunities by quantifying changes in plant community compositions during hundreds to thousands of years. Critically, the methodological basis for most reconstruction approaches rests upon estimates of pollen productivity and dispersal. Previous studies, however, have reached contrasting conclusions concerning these estimates, which may be perceived to challenge the applicability and reliability of pollen-based reconstruction. Here we show that conflicting estimates of pollen production and dispersal are, at least in part, artifacts of fixed assumptions of pollen dispersal and insufficient spatial resolution of vegetation data surrounding the pollen-collecting lake. We implemented a Bayesian statistical model that related pollen assemblages in surface sediments of 33 small lakes (<2 ha) in the northeastern United States, with surrounding vegetation ranging from 10(1) to >10(5) m from the lake margin. Our analysis revealed three key insights. First, pollen productivity is largely conserved within taxa and across forest types. Second, when local (within a 1-km radius) vegetation abundances are not considered, pollen-source areas may be overestimated for some common taxa (Cupressaceae, Pinus, Quercus, and Tsuga). Third, pollen dispersal mechanisms may differ between local and regional scales; this is missed by pollen-dispersal models used in previous studies. These findings highlight the complex interactions between vegetation heterogeneity on the landscape and pollen dispersal. We suggest that, when estimating pollen productivity and dispersal, both detailed local and extended regional vegetation must be taken into account. Also, both deductive (mechanistic models) and inductive (statistical models) approaches are needed to better understand the emergent properties of pollen dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes.

TI  - How the European Union reaches the target of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions under the Paris Agreement
T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
AB  - In the future promotion of Paris Agreement, the European Union (EU) has become an object of concern in the world through its own performance at improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. This research collects data from 28 EU countries and Norway from 2010 to 2015 to evaluate their energy and CO2 emission efficiency through a meta-frontier non-radial directional distance function. Different from previous studies, only considering the individually countries efficiency comparison, this research divides the sample countries into two groups, the group of North-Western European countries and the group of Central-Eastern European countries. The empirical results show that there is a declining trend in the efficiency value of Central-Eastern European countries from 2010 (0.832) to 2015 (0.792), and a significant average technology gap ratio at 0.904. We then compare energy and CO2 emissions' room for improvements for specific countries and conclude that the Central-Eastern European countries should learn from the management experience of the North-Western European countries. It is an effective way to improve the energy and CO2 emission performances of EU countries by restricting the transfer of high carbon emissions industries and encouraging the long-term sustainable development of renewable energy.

TI  - Strengthening road safety strategy development 'Towards Zero' 2008-2020-Western Australia's experience scientific research on road safety management SWOV workshop 16 and 17 November 2009
T2  - SAFETY SCIENCE
AB  - With a significant list of achievements in traffic safety over some 40 years, Australia's most successful initiatives have emerged from consideration of the scientific basis for achieving effective results. Over time, the increasing use of scientific methods has matured to an extent whereby road safety strategies for entire jurisdictions are now being formed and optimised on the basis of evidence-based mathematical modelling of predicted strategy performance over periods of ten or more years ahead. This paper describes the approach used in the State of Western Australia (WA) to support the development of its new strategy, 'Towards Zero', addressing the 12-year period from 2008 to 2020. Also described is the early development of the modelling approach in the State of Victoria, Australia, subsequently applied, refined and adapted to Western Australia. The 'Towards Zero' strategy aims to ensure that road safety policies continue to evolve within a strategic framework, based on Australasia's Safe System framework, which was derived from the best elements of the Swedish Vision Zero and the Dutch Sustainable Safety visions.
   The process for the development of the strategy involved a greater degree of community and stakeholder engagement than has been the case previously, based on the fundamental belief that the community should be provided with the best evidence about what works no matter how controversial, so that it can debate and consider the options available to improve safety.
   It is equally important to have a strategy based on the best possible evidence. The Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) was appointed by the WA Office of Road Safety to identify, describe and recommend proven counter-measures within the Safe System framework and develop a series of scientifically sound directions and options.
   This paper outlines the modelling technique used by MUARC along with results and summarises the community consultation process. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Increased seawater temperature and light during early springs accelerate receptacle growth of <i>Fucus vesiculosus</i> in the northern Baltic proper
T2  - MARINE BIOLOGY
AB  - In many temperate estuarine areas, ongoing climatic changes are expected to lead to higher seawater temperatures, to increased inflow of freshwater and nutrients (due to increased rainfall) and to altered light conditions. During the last two decades, several winters have been unusually mild in southern Finland, and the subsequent springs have been early. This may have consequences for the seasonality of many species, including the bladder-wrack, Fucus vesiculosus, whose reproductive cycle may be especially sensitive. In the present study, F. vesiculosus receptacles from the field were weighed regularly during three warm (early) springs and compared with receptacles from three cold (late) springs. On average, the first sign of receptacle growth in the field occurred 5-6 weeks earlier and receptacles probably matured 2-3 weeks earlier during the warm springs than during the cold springs. This may be due to differences in seawater temperatures among years, but significantly heavier receptacles at 0.8 m compared to at 3.1 m further suggests the importance of light for receptacle growth as a measure of maturation, since there were no depth-related differences in seawater temperatures. Also, when plotting receptacle wet weights against seawater temperatures, the importance of light can be seen as different regression relationships (slopes and intercepts). In an outdoor aquarium experiment, the effects of temperature and light on receptacle growth were also tested, and there were significant differences between shallow and deep specimens, but temperature and light had no effects, except on initial receptacle growth. Since oogonian development, and thereby the time for zygote release, followed the receptacle growth curve, this could mean a mismatch between the timing of F. vesiculosus zygote settlement and the cover of competing filamentous algae, but such species interactions require further investigations in order to better understand their possible consequences.

TI  - Energy rating methodology for light-duty vehicles: geographical impact
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The aim of this paper was to describe a new energy dependency score methodology and its consequent application to cars sold in twelve regions: Europe (EU-28) and eleven specific countries worldwide (Australia, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and USA). This methodology was developed as a potential tool to inform consumers of their choice impact on the country's economy. This methodology is based on primary energy assessments and origins for each energy pathway associated with a gasoline-, diesel-, natural gas (used for H-2 production)- or electricity (balanced with country electricity mix)-powered vehicle. An energy dependency index was attributed to the best-case (100 % endogenous production) and worst-case (0 % endogenous production) scenarios and consequently weighted with vehicle fuel consumption. This enabled obtaining an energy dependency index (10-0). This index could be assigned to an environmental and social index to provide a sustainability index and therefore complement a road vehicle environmental rating system, providing a combined index rating. Internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid vehicles (that have oil products as energy source) rate the lowest for almost all locations, with the exception of regions that are energy independent (Norway, Saudi Arabia or Russia). Electric vehicles rank higher when comparing to the other technologies analyzed for all locations in this study. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle shows generally a rank in an intermediate place, except for Japan where it scores lower than all other technologies.

TI  - Rainfall exclusion and thinning can alter the relationships between forest functioning and drought
T2  - NEW PHYTOLOGIST
AB  - Increasing drought caused by the ongoing climate change, and forest management by thinning that aims at mitigating its impact, may modify the current relationships between forest functions and drought intensity and preclude our ability to forecast future ecosystem responses. We used 15 yr of data from an experimental rainfall exclusion (-27% of rainfall) combined with thinning (-30% stand basal area) to investigate differences in the drought-function relationships for each component of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and stand transpiration in a Mediterranean Quercus ilex stand. Rainfall exclusion reduced stand ANPP by 10%, mainly because of lowered leaf and acorn production, whereas wood production remained unaffected. These responses were consistent with the temporal sensitivity to drought among tree organs but revealed an increased allocation to wood. Thinning increased wood and acorn production and reduced the sensitivity of standing wood biomass change to drought. Rainfall exclusion and thinning lowered the intercept of the transpiration-drought relationship as a result of the structural constraints exerted by lower leaf and sapwood area. The results suggest that historical drought-function relationships can be used to infer future drought impacts on stand ANPP but not on water fluxes. Thinning can mitigate drought effects and reduce forest sensitivity to drought.

TI  - Scale-related patterns in the spatial and environmental components of stream macroinvertebrate assemblage variation
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim We examined the relative contributions of spatial gradients and local environmental conditions to macroinvertebrate assemblages of boreal headwater streams at three hierarchical extents: bioregion, ecoregion and drainage system. We also aimed to identify the environmental variables most strongly related to assemblage structure at each study scale, and to assess how the importance of these variables is related to regional context and spatial structuring at different scales.
   Location Northern Finland (62-68 degrees N, 25-32 degrees E).
   Methods Variation in macroinvertebrate data was partitioned using partial canonical correspondence analysis into components explained by spatial variables (nine terms from the cubic trend surface regression), local environmental variables (15 variables) and spatially structured environmental variation.
   Results The strength of the relationship between assemblage structure and local environmental variables increased with decreasing spatial extent, whereas assemblage variation related to spatial variables and spatially structured environmental variation showed the opposite pattern. At the largest extents, spatial variation was related to latitudinal gradients, whereas spatial autocorrelation among neighbouring streams was the likely mechanism creating spatial structure within drainage systems. Only stream size and water acidity were consistently important in explaining assemblage structure at all study scales, while the importance of other environmental variables was more context-dependent.
   Main conclusions The importance of local environmental factors in explaining macroinvertebrate assemblage structure increases with decreasing spatial extent. This scale-related pattern is not caused solely by changes in study extent, however, but also by variable sample sizes at different regional extents. The importance of environmental gradients is context-dependent and few factors are likely to be universally important correlates of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. Finally, our results suggest that bioassessment should give due attention to spatial structuring of stream assemblages, because important assemblage gradients may not only be related to local factors but also to biogeographical constraints and neighbourhood dispersal processes.

TI  - Defining macroinvertebrate assemblage types of headwater streams:: implications for bioassessment and conservation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
AB  - We used data from 235 boreal headwater streams in Finland to examine whether macro invertebrate assemblages constitute clearly definable types, and how well biologically defined assemblage types can be predicted using environmental variables. Two-way indicator species analysis produced 10 assemblage types, which differed significantly from each other (multiresponse permutation procedure, MRPP). However, based on MRPP and nonmetric multidimensional scaling, there was wide variation among sites within each assemblage type, and high degrees of overlap among assemblage types. Such continuous variation was also evidenced by the low number of effective indicator taxa (indicator value method) for each assemblage type. Furthermore, discriminant function analysis based on environmental variables showed a moderate yet variable prediction success (59.6% of sites correctly predicted; range 0-96% per group). Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that variation in assemblage structure was primarily related to latitude and water chemistry, especially pH and water color. The absence of discrete macroinvertebrate assemblage types in boreal headwater streams may stem from a number of reasons: (1) macroinvertebrate taxa inhabiting boreal streams tend to exhibit individualistic, taxon-specific responses to environmental gradients, (2) they have wide environmental tolerances and geographic distributions, and (3) boreal streams are characterized by frequent, unpredictable disturbances. Our results suggest that local filters in headwater streams are relatively weak, resulting in poorly distinguishable assemblage types. By contrast, the major latitudinal gradients in macro invertebrate assemblage structure suggest that regional-scale filters, e.g., temperature, exert strong control over taxon distributions in headwater streams. We suggest that a tiered approach combining regional stratification and subsequent prediction of assemblage structure could provide a suitable framework for the bioassessment and conservation of boreal headwater streams.

TI  - Impact of several common tree species of European temperate forests on soil fertility
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
AB  - The aim of the present work was to provide a synopsis of the scientific literature concerning the effects of different tree species on soil and to quantify the effect of common European temperate forest species on soil fertility. The scientific literature dealing with the tree species effect on soil has been reviewed. The composition of forest overstory has an impact on the chemical, physical and biological characteristics of soil. This impact was highest in the topsoil. Different tree species had significantly different effects on water balance and microclimate. The physical characteristics of soils also were modified depending on the overstory species, probably through modifications of the soil fauna. The rates of organic matter mineralization and nitrification seem to be dependent on tree species. A coniferous species, Picea abies, had negative input-output budgets for some nutrients, such as Ca and Mg. This species promoted a higher soil acidification and a decrease in pH. Thus, it should not be planted in very poor soils in areas affected by acidic atmospheric depositions. Nevertheless, the effect of the canopy species on soil fertility was rarely significant enough to promote forest decline. The impact of a tree species on soil fertility varied depending on the type of bedrock, climate and forest management.

TI  - Does road salting confound the recovery of the microcrustacean community in an acidified lake?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Numerous boreal lakes across the Northern Hemisphere recovering from acidification are experiencing a simultaneous increase in chloride (Cl) concentrations from road salting. Increasing Cl may have profound effects on the lake ecosystem. We examine if an increase in Cl from road salting has modified the recovery of the microcrustacean community in an acidified boreal lake undergoing chemical recovery (study lake). Results from the study lake were compared with an acidified "reference lake". The community changed during the study period in the study lake mainly driven by the reduction in acidification pressure. Despite the community changes and an increase in species richness, the absence of several acid sensitive species, previously occurring in the lake, indicates a delayed biological recovery relative to the chemical recovery. Moreover, changes in occurrence of acid sensitive and acid tolerant species indicated that the biological recovery was slower in the study lake compared to the "reference". Although recurrent episodes of high aluminum and low pH and decreasing Ca are likely important factors for the delay, these do not explain, for instance, the shift from Cyclops scutifer to Bosmina longispina in the study lake. Although the contribution of Cl was not significant, the correlation between Cl and the variation in microcrustacean community was twice as high in the study lake compared to the "reference". We argue that small, sheltered forest lakes may be especially sensitive to increased Cl levels, through changes in pattern of stratification, thus providing a mechanism for the shift from C. scutifer to B. longispina. The reduction of the acidification pressure seems to override the Cl effects on microcrustaceans at low Cl levels in salt-affected lakes recovering from acidification. However, prognoses for growing traffic and increasing road salting raise concern for many recovering lakes located in proximity to roads and urbanized areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Social hotspots life cycle assessment: A case study on social risks of an antimicrobial keyboard cover
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - This article explores the application of social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) to products or technologies in their earliest developing phase. Indeed, it would be beneficial to have an overview of the social risks generated by novel products and understand what their potential supply chain would be like. To this end, this study presents a S-LCA study for identifying hotspots linked to a novel product: an antimicrobial keyboard cover integrating gold nanoparticles. Firstly, countries which could supply Europe with the input materials required in the system were identified, then by following the S-LCA methodology working hours and working functional hours were estimated. Ultimately, social risks were calculated by combining working functional hours with social risk levels and weights, concerning the relative importance of each category and sub-category. The analysis helped to determine which countries could supply the materials needed and hence become part of the potential supply chain of antimicrobial keyboard covers integrating gold nanoparticles. Furthermore, it led to the identification of main social hotspots linked to each material used. In general, results show that the stakeholders most at risk of adverse social impacts across different sectors and countries are workers. Indeed, they may be affected on both their rights and work conditions, health and safety. The process of gold mining highlights the difference in terms of social risks between more developed countries, such as Australia and Sweden, and developing countries, such as South Africa. The production of chemicals presents a homogeneity in terms of risk hours associated to the considered European countries.

TI  - To criminalise or not to criminalise IUU fishing: The EU's choice
T2  - MARINE POLICY
AB  - The fight against the global phenomenon of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is carried out through a wide variety of international, regional and national instruments, although its effectiveness is not sufficient in view of the results obtained. The search for the most effective solution is currently under way. Among the possible models to adopt, some countries, such as Norway and Indonesia, have advocated for the criminalisation of IUU fishing. The EU has also opted for a management-based model to combat IUU fishing that relies on administrative sanctions, also leaving its Member States the option of adopting criminal sanctions. Subsequently, in the proposed recast Directive on environmental crime, the EU has not recognised IUU fishing as an either an environmental or autonomous crime, unless it converges with transnational organised crime and other associated crimes in the fisheries sector. The EU has promoted its model in non-member countries, and has contributed towards paving the way to a level playing field which comprises the most authoritative set of international legal instruments on IUU fishing, both soft and hard, established by the UN and FAO. Nevertheless, discussions are ongoing on the need to reform EU legal instruments to better contribute to the sustainable use of marine resources in the 21st century in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals as foreseen in the EU Green Deal.

TI  - Neste Oil's environmental strategies and organization 1960-2005
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
AB  - This is a follow-up study for an earlier research in which the environmental strategies and organization (ESO) of a Finnish oil company, Neste, during 1960-1991 were studied. This study continues analysing the ESO of Neste during 1992-1998 and its follower, Fortum, during 1998-2004. In 2005 Neste Oil was separated again from Fortum. The seven areas of their ESO - strategy, structure, systems, skills, staff, symbolic behaviour and shared values will be evaluated on a scale: stable, reactive, anticipatory, entrepreneurial and creative.
   The ESO of Neste started to rise in the 1960s from the stable level towards the reactive level in the 1970s and proceeded to the anticipatory level in the 1980s. Neste's ESO developed drastically in the environmental decade of the 1990s. Six of Neste's ESO areas reached the entrepreneurial level then, and the seventh, shared values, was coming closer. Skills had even some creative features.
   Fortum adopted most of Neste's ESO practices, but by the beginning of the 2000s society was demanding most of them anyway. Fortum adopted very few new ESO practices. Hence Fortum's ESO areas remained at the anticipatory level on the average. Skills and structure had some anticipatory features, but in one part of the skills, external communication, as well as in symbolic behaviour the company resorted occasionally to reactive practices.
   Fortum remained at the reactive level in the issues of sustainable development, but it recognised the integration of economic, social and environmental responsibilities as its short-term ESO challenge. Its. other, unrecognised, EOS challenge was management psychological. The new Neste Oil has these environmental strategy and organization challenges to meet.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATION IN AZERBAIJAN: RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPETITIVENESS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
T2  - MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affecting the achievement of most of the Sustainable Development Goals, is leading to a significant crisis, especially in less developed economies, and poses serious challenges to governments around the world. Negative annual GDP growth per capita in Azerbaijan in 2020 amounted to -4.95% (below the world average of 0.56%), necessitating the resumption of short-term economic growth and achieving long-term competitiveness, sustainable development, and inclusive economy. Azerbaijan's positions in these areas, namely 58th place out of 141 countries in the global competitiveness ranking (63rd place for innovation potential and 73rd place for ICT implementation), 55th place out of 165 countries in the Sustainable Development Index, 80th place out of 131 countries according to the Global Innovation Index testify to the important role of innovation management in Azerbaijan. The article's main purpose is to study the relationship between innovation development, competitiveness, and sustainable development of the country. To empirically confirm the hypotheses, a sample of 9 countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, Germany, France, Finland, Estonia, Poland, Czech Republic) was formed. Several indicators were analysed based on data from the statistical department of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the World Intellectual Property Organization from 2010 to 2020. Statistical analysis of indicators of sustainable development, competitiveness, and innovative development of the studied countries. With the help of correlation-regression analysis and the Granger test (using the STATA software package), the mutual directions of influence of indicators of innovative development, the competitiveness of the country, and sustainable development in Azerbaijan and other sample countries were established. A regression model with random effects was built. The impact of the parameters of innovative development on the annual GDP growth per capita as a key component of the country's competitiveness and its sustainable development was formalized and assessed. The obtained results could be useful in developing measures to increase competitiveness and achieve sustainable development goals in Azerbaijan and further research.

TI  - LINNAEUS AND THE TROGLODYTE Early European encounters with the Malay world and the natural history of man
T2  - INDONESIA AND THE MALAY WORLD
AB  - This article explores the ways in which early modern knowledge of the Malay world informed European science, through a case study of the classification of humans in the work of the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus. In the 1758 edition of his Systema Naturae, Linnaeus proposed an entirely new species of human, Homo troglodytes, a counterpoint to Homo sapiens, said to be a resident of the Malay world. Whereas this different' species has hitherto been seen through Linnaeus' application of his own taxonomic principles, and has also been dismissed as a product of an uncritical reliance on travel lies' of the day, this article takes the Homo troglodytes back to his assumed natural habitat. Through a detailed examination of Linnaeus' sources and the genealogies of European writing on the Malay world in the 18th century a complex picture emerges, framed by local folklore and an early modern ethnography of difference'. Crucially, it is suggested that information about the Malay world available to Linnaeus was ultimately generated by the unique ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity of the region, in particular the ambivalent relationships between the ethnically different peoples of the coast and interior, a longstanding theme in Southeast Asian history. The figure of the troglodyte then becomes a powerful interlocutor between interpretations of the diversity of the Malay world that served to shape not only natural history, but also Enlightenment debates on the relationship between man and beast.

TI  - MORTUARY PRACTICES AND DOG GRAVES IN MESOLITHIC SOCIETIES OF SOUTHERN SCANDINAVIA
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGIE
AB  - During the first half of the 1980s, excavations were conducted in an area close to Skateholm, in the southernmost part of Sweden. The object of the project was to study the Mesolithic settlement around an ancient lagoon on the southern Scanian coast. The Late Atlantic oceanic transgressions had forced the society to seek shelter on ever-higher ground. At three sites, within the compass of an area no greater that 400 metres, graves dating to the period 6 300-5 700 BP were located to settlement areas. At two of these, almost ninety graves were excavated, showing a complicated mortuary practice with good evidence of the activities from the moment it was realized that the individual was clearly dying, up to the act of refilling the grave.
   Among the graves, 10 were dug for dogs. One grave contained a dog with an antler, a decorated antler artifact and three flint flakes as grave goods. Two categories of grave goods, antlers and blades are reminiscent of human graves. Among other factors which are similar to human graves is the strewing of red ochre over the corpse of the dog. The relation between dogs and humans can also be shown in a spatial perspective. Six of eight canine graves from the same cemetery lie within a delimited area.
   Two dogs appear to have been formally killed and placed in the human graves, and single skeletal parts occur in the filling in other human graves, which may mean that the animal was dismembered.
   The reason why dog graves have not been identified might be that they were not buried as deep as the humans as observed in Skateholm. However, dog interments have been found in other south Scandinavian sites form the Mesolithic, from both the late part as well as the old part of the period. Dogs have been found earlier in Mesolithic sites, but have been interpreted as discarded corpses.
   Buried dogs is a phenomenon which is known from the Late Palaeolithic. They were a part of the mortuary practice among hunter-gatherers in many parts of the world, such as Northern America and South-eastern Asia.
   During recent years archaeological research has been concentrated more than previously around the study of mortuary practices and what this can provide in terms of new information on the societies which the graves represent. Several researchers have tried to relate the graves to a hypothetical spiritual and social world with which the society surrounded itself. Others consider that the mortuary practices and cemeteries were used by certain members for the purpose of maintaining the existing social organization. Both points of view are equally valid in that the habitat of the dead provides an insight into the land of the living, and vice versa.
   Earlier theories which sought to show that interment during the Stone Age was a simple and uncomplicated affair have been confounded by recent discoveries of two, large-scale Mesolithic cemeteries in southernmost Sweden. These burials demonstrate, on the contrary, that burial customs during the period 6 300-5 700 BP were a complexity quite unknown during any other period of prehistory.

TI  - The significance of optical properties in competition among visual and tactile planktivores: A theoretical study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - A mathematical model describing competition for a common food resource among visual and tactile planktivores is developed. Sensitivity of the competitive regime to environmental changes are studied by analysing their effects on foraging rates and niche availability of both planktivore types. Depth, spatial, daily and seasonal variations in factors of biotic and abiotic origin may result in great changes in the competitive regime. Optical properties of the water column is of greatest importance for competition. In addition the abundance and size of prey, small scale turbulence, and the seasonal and daily variations in sun irradiance are of importance. Inherent contrast of prey organisms is likely to modify the effect from the above factors under certain circumstances only, but may together with prey size, also enhance niche differentiation among the competitors. By studying the zero growth rate isoclines for populations of tactile and visual planktivores at different depths, we show that the water column is a habitat divided into different competitive regimes. These can be thought of as relatively stable niches separated by an ecotone of rather unpredictable and ever changing competitive regime, due to changes in environmental factors. In most cases it is optimal for visual planktivores to stay at shallow depths, while tactile planktivores compete better at greater depths. However, by simulations we show that high predation pressure can make near surface waters hostile to many visual planktivores such as fish, thereby making this highly productive niche available to tactile planktivores such as jellyfish. Results are discussed in relation to naturally occurring environmental variations and the impact of anthropogenic factors. Changes in optical properties due to eutrophication might have drastic effects on the outcome of competition, and thus on the structure of marine food chains. While too little is known about the physiology, life history and behaviour of most pelagic organisms to make specific predictions, this work indicates a potential for strong competitive interactions among different functional types of planktivores.

TI  - Biofuels in the energy transition beyond peak oil.: A macroscopic study of energy demand in the Stockholm transport system 2030
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - The objective of this study is to examine the potential for a full transition to domestically produced biofuels in the Stockholm County transport system in 2030, without exceeding the proportional share of national bioenergy assets. This target is chosen in order to test the potential of biofuel assets in Sweden, facilitating the transition to renewable fuel systems, and to display the potential of transport energy demand at macrolevel under tighter conditions on the energy market after fossil oil production has peaked. The distribution of bioenergy to the transport sector, including conversion losses and relationships to other energy sectors, is analysed explicitly. State-of-the-art traffic forecasting models, complemented with a specially designed energy quantification model, are applied to assess energy quantities needed at different vehicle efficiency levels and mobility patterns. The purpose is not to determine the most energy-efficient transport system possible, or to forecast the optimal distribution of bioenergy set aside for the transport sector in the future. Rather, we try to visualise, at a more conceptual level, energy demand as dependent on principle transport strategies, future technological developments and a type of planning that takes technological interlinkages between evolving components into strategic account. This work highlights the importance of implementing both demand and supply-side policies in order to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in all energy sectors before making assessments of reasonable distributions of bioenergy between energy sectors and other biomass usage.

TI  - Sustainable design for users: a literature review and bibliometric analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Due to the environmental impact associated with the products' use, sustainable design has extended consideration of products' production to consumption. This study puts forward the concept of sustainable design for users (SDfUs). Using related keywords of sustainable design and user-centered design, we identify a total of 447 usable articles published during 1992-2019 from Scopus. Results of bibliometric analysis show that the number of SDfUs articles has generally continuously increased since 2007. The most productive scholars are from the USA, the UK, and China, while the top three organizations are Loughborough University, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and Delft University of Technology. Different focuses of SDfUs appear among developed and developing countries. Green building design has emerged as one key area that uses the concept of SDfUs in developed countries such as the USA and the UK. SDfUs studies in developing countries such as China focus on design for end-of-life products' treatment and disposal. Most SDfUs studies examine how design can contribute to environmental performance through emission reduction and energy saving during products' use, and articles in one of five clusters from co-word analysis explore users' behaviors for sustainable design in the textile industry. This paper is the first study that systematically reviews the literature on SDfUs. It provides valuable insights for scholars in the SDfUs-related fields to identify their research directions and partners. Results on clusters from network analysis also offer practical implications for enterprises to learn from the construction and textile industries.

TI  - Forts on Burial Mounds: Interlocked Landscapes of Mourning and Colonialism at the Dakota-Settler Frontier, 1860-1876
T2  - HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AB  - During the 19th century, the U.S. government took ownership of Dakota homelands in Minnesota and the Dakota Territory, leading to increasingly violent conflicts and decades of war. Military and militia forts were built at the physical boundaries of contested space to push hostiles west and to protect European American settlers. Fort Wadsworth, constructed in South Dakota during the 1864 Dakota Campaign, and Fort Juelson, built in 1876 by Norwegian immigrants during an Indian scare in Minnesota, were both knowingly constructed on top of burial mounds, appropriating and reshaping sacred Native American landscapes into protective enclosures for the dominating, yet fearful, colonizers. Aerial laser scanning, geophysical survey, and historical research explore the archaeological expression and significance of these interlocked landscapes at geographic and cognitive frontiers.

TI  - Pesticide residues in honeybee-collected pollen: does the EU regulation protect honeybees from pesticides?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
AB  - Researchers globally identify pesticides as one of the main reasons for pollinator decline. In the European Union (EU), extensive legislation is implemented to protect pollinators from harmful pesticide exposure. The aim of our study was to discover whether the pesticide residue levels in honeybee matrices, such as nectar and pollen, exceeded the chronic or acute toxicity levels when beehives were located next to fields treated with specific insecticides. The insecticides were used according to the EU legislation and its national implementation. The experiments were conducted in turnip rape, oilseed rape, and caraway fields in southern Finland during the years 2019 and 2020. The pesticides used in the experiments contained the active substances lambda-cyhalothrin (2019), esfenvalerate (2020), and tau-fluvalinate (2020). However, the honeybee-collected pollen and nectar were analyzed for residues of more than 100 active substances. The results showed that the pesticide residue levels clearly remained under the oral acute toxicity for honeybees, although we found high levels of thiacloprid residues in the pollen collected in 2019. The pesticide residues in nectar were below LOQ values, which was most likely due to the rainy weather conditions together with the chosen sampling method. No statistically significant differences were observed between the insecticide-treated and untreated fields. In light of our research, the EU legislation protected honeybees from oral acute toxicity during the years 2019 and 2020. However, potential sublethal effects of thiacloprid and other pesticide compounds found in the collected pollen cannot be ruled out. In the future, constant monitoring of pesticide exposure of honeybees and wild pollinators should be established to ensure that pesticide legislation, and its implementation across the EU successfully protects pollinators and their services in agricultural environments.

TI  - Codesigning a resilient food system
T2  - ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB  - Global changes, especially the progression of climate change, create a plethora of adaptation needs for social-ecological systems. With increasing uncertainty, more resilient food systems that are able to adapt and shape their operations in response to emerging challenges are required. Most of the research on this subject has been focused on developing countries; however, developed countries also face increasing environmental, economic, and social pressures. Because food systems are complex and involve multiple actors, using codesign might be the most productive way to develop desirable system characteristics. For this study, we engaged food system actors in a scenario-planning exercise to identify means of building more resilient food systems. In particular, the actors focused on determinants of adaptive capacity in developed countries, with Finland as a case study. The brainstorming session followed by a two-round Delphi study raised three main characteristics for effective food system resilience, namely, energy and nutrient sovereignty, transparency and dialogue in the food chain, and continuous innovativeness and evidence-based learning. In addition, policy interventions were found instrumental for supporting such food system resilience. The main actor-specific determinants of adaptive capacity identified included the farmers' utilization of agri-technology and expertise; energy and logistic efficiency of the input and processing industry; and for retail, communication to build consumer trust and environmental awareness, and effective use of information and communication technology. Of the food system actors, farmers and the processing industry were perceived to be the closest to reaching the limits of their adaptive capacities. The use of adaptive capacity as a proxy seemed to concretize food system resilience effectively. Our study suggests that the resilience approach generates new perspectives that can guide actors in developing food systems that are adaptive in uncertainty.

TI  - Environmental assessment of cod (Gadus morhua) from autoline fisheries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - Purpose The main purpose of this study has been to document the environmental performance of products based on autoline-caught cod and the distribution of environmental impacts in the value chain from fishing to retail. Another aim has been to document the performed environmental improvement analyses.
   Methods Standard life cycle assessment methodology has been employed and the following impact categories studied: global warming potential (GWP), acidification, eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, ozone layer depletion and cumulative energy demand.
   Results and discussion Products derived from autoline-caught cod have a GWP in the range of 0.16-7.6/1.7-4.4 kg CO2-eq/kg product delivered to consumer, using economic and mass allocation, respectively. The main impacts come from fuel consumption and release of refrigerants in the fishery. The products studied represent each of the four major processing outputs. The differences between the products can partly be attributed to differences in methodology (system borders, allocation), partly to actual physical differences. A comparison with published results from other studies indicates that seafood products sourced from Northeast Arctic cod fished with the autoline method has a relatively good environmental performance. A number of possible options for improving the environmental performance of the products were identified. The most internal improvement action was stopping leakages in fish freezers.
   Conclusions This study has given a detailed overview of the environmental performance of seafood products sourced from Northeast Arctic cod from autoline fisheries in Norwegian territorial waters. This study has demonstrated the usefulness of such results in improving the environmental performance of the products. However, the usefulness of the results in communication to external actors is limited because few data exists on other products fulfilling the same functions and using the exact same methodology and assumptions. In order to achieve comparability between results from competing products, it is necessary to use a standardised and detailed calculation method. At the moment, no such method seems to be available. The literature study indicated that the environmental impact of Northeast Arctic cod products sourced from autoline fisheries compares well with other cod products on the market. Some cod stocks are sustainably managed, others not. Hence, it is recommended to break down results not only to species level but also fish stock level when the aim is to guide seafood customers towards making informed purchasing decisions.

TI  - From flatfish to sticklebacks: assemblage structure of epibenthic fauna in relation to macroalgal blooms
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - On the Swedish west coast, blooms of green macroalgae have become a common feature over recent decades. Assemblage structure of epibenthic fauna was studied in randomly selected shallow soft substratum bays, with and without macroalgae, using quantitative sampling techniques. The study was performed biannually (June and August) over 4 yr in 4 regions along the coast. Mat-forming macroalgae on average covered 35% of the surface area in vegetated bays, with an overall mean biomass of 100 g DW m(-2). The assemblage structure of epibenthic fauna was different in the presence of macroalgae, a pattern which was consistent over years and regions. Within the subset of bays containing vegetation, there were no bay-scale relationships between the biomass of algae and the abundance, biomass or number of species of epibenthic fauna. However, a detailed analysis revealed that the species had different responses to an increase in algal biomass at the scale of individual samples (0.5 m(2)). The flatfish Pleuronectes platessa occurred predominantly in samples completely free of vegetation. The shrimp Crangon crangon and the gobies Pomatoschistus spp. were found most commonly in the open sand habitat, and rapidly decreased in abundance with increasing biomass of algae. Gobius niger, Mysidacea, Anguilla anguilla, Sygnathus typhle and Palaemon spp. were most prevalent at a low to moderate biomass of algae. Sticklebacks (Pungitius pungitius and Gasterosteus aculeatus) increased in abundance with increasing algal biomass, and remained dominant at the highest level of algal biomass recorded. Thus, macroalgal blooms have the potential to change the structure and function of shallow soft substratum habitats, lowering their value as nursery and feeding grounds for commercial fish species.

TI  - Influence of organised scaring on distribution and habitat choice of geese on pastures in Northern Norway
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Animals' habitat choices are often difficult to evaluate in nature due to the influence of various environmental factors, including human impact. In the present study we evaluate how such impacts influence habitat selection and local distribution of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus staging in Northern Norway during spring. In recent years, geese have been scared by farmers who protect their cultivated properties. We identified and classified various habitats by satellite images and field survey. Comparing data gathered in years before and during periods of intensive scaring enable us to evaluate how such disturbance influences habitat selection in geese. The scaring activities were recognised at three levels; no scaring, occasional scaring and intensive scaring, the latter representing repeated scaring during the complete 24 h cycle. Based on area estimations of the various habitat types in each scaring category, it appeared that the farmers primarily protected habitats of highest quality and, as a consequence. geese were more frequently registered at less productive habitats. This represents a contrast to the undisturbed situation some years earlier, where geese distributed evenly on the various field habitats. If the future agricultural policy continues towards an increased intensive agricultural practice, farmers may carry on to protect their intensively managed fields and geese will be banished to less productive farmland. Such polarisation will eventually reduce the carrying capacity for geese, creating a situation where they are unable to move freely to exploit resources of crucial importance for migration and reproduction.

TI  - Remarkable elevational tolerance in an African odonata larval assemblage
T2  - ODONATOLOGICA
AB  - The spatial patterns in species richness and abundance were investigated here at a series of reservoirs at different elevations, to establish which factors determine species distributions along this topographic gradient. Larvae of 18 spp. were sampled in small reservoirs across a 1250 in elevational gradient at one latitude. Most spp. occurred throughout all elevations indicating that this subtropical odon. assemblage as a whole is remarkably tolerant of elevational changes. Although Anisoptera larval species richness and abundance increased significantly with increasing elevation, there was no change in Zygoptera species richness, while Zygoptera abundance decreased significantly Species-site-variable triplots for Anisoptera and Zygoptera larvae indicated that no measured site variable on an individual basis clearly accounted for larval species assemblage distribution patterns. Nevertheless, canonical axes and their respective intra-set correlation coefficients showed that some measured site variables e.g. floating/submerged vegetation, turbidity, pH, water temperature (resulting from sunny or shade habitat conditions), marginal grasses, water depth as well as elevation to some extent, explained the main variation in species assemblage composition/distribution in a broadly similar manner for both suborders. Generally, the reservoirs recruited spp. from the regional pool, irrespective of the elevation of the pool. These spp. were all geographically widespread spp. that took advantage of the presence of these man-made reservoirs, and included only one national endemic. Although these artificial water bodies are not increasing the 'extent of species occurrence', they play a major role in increasing 'area of occupancy'. Furthermore, these spp. are remarkably vagile, habitat-tolerant, as well as elevationally-widespread. A reasonable explanation is that this assemblage is the historical survivor over many millennia of oscillating wet/dry periods and natural selection. The present-day spp. are those that readily recolonise pools after drought has been broken, and are pioneering residents of new water bodies over a wide elevational range.

TI  - Denmark's Engagement in the Oslo Peace Process
T2  - ISRAEL STUDIES REVIEW
AB  - Since 1993, professional and historical record literature has largely focused on the Norwegian involvement in the Oslo peace process. Denmark's extensive mediation efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have not received similar scrutiny. This article assesses Denmark's involvement in the period following the Oslo Declaration of Principles in 1993. Denmark's peace engagement included two main diplomatic tracks. The unofficial track was designated as the Louisiana Process and the official track was named the Road Map for Peace. In both tracks, Denmark was able to demonstrate a comprehensive foreign policy that reflected a unique mediation strategy. Denmark's capacity to alter the nature of the conflict was restricted by its meager resources and its inability to impose decisions on the involved parties.

TI  - Dispersal of persistent organic pollutants from fiber-contaminated sediments: biotic and abiotic pathways
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS
AB  - Purpose Numerous sites contaminated with fiber emissions from pulp and paper industries are found in coastal areas of the Baltic Sea, but there is limited knowledge about the magnitude of dispersal of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) from these anthropogenic, organic-rich sediments called fiberbanks. The aim of this study was to quantify and compare different POP dispersal pathways from such fiberbanks. Dispersal mechanisms studied included abiotic and biotic routes (dissolved in water, particle-bound, and bioaccumulation). Materials and methods Contaminated fibrous sediments located in angstrom ngermanalven River estuary in north-eastern Sweden were studied in sediment types representing different fiber content (i.e., fiberbanks, fiber-rich sediments, and less fiber impacted sediments). Sediment-to-water fluxes of dissolved contaminants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)) were measured in situ using benthic flux chambers. Particle resuspension was measured by sampling bottom water, before and after disturbing the sediment surface. Benthic biota was collected to determine the body burden of contaminants and to determine biota-pore water accumulation factors (BAF(PW)) and biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs). In addition, concentrations of dissolved POPs in the water column were measured in field using passive samplers. Instrumental analysis was performed using gas chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-MS/MS). Results and discussion The flux of dissolved sigma(20)PCBs was approximately two times higher from one of the investigated fiberbanks (3.4 ng m(- 2) day(- 1)) compared to the other. The average particle burden of PCBs was also higher at this fiberbank after artificial disturbance (15 ng g(-1) particle), which indicates that larger amounts of contaminants are likely to disperse via particle resuspension from this site compared to the other fiberbank (4.8 ng g(- 1) particle). The difference might be associated with a layer of recently settled minerogenic material that covers one of the fiberbanks, which probably functions as a protective barrier. The lack of benthic biota implies that contaminant release by bioturbation is negligible in the studied fiberbanks. However, benthic biota from fiber-rich sediment showed bioaccumulation and biomagnification of contaminants. Conclusions The importance of diffusive flux from fiberbanks under undisturbed conditions became apparent when the different dispersal pathways were quantified. However, no dispersal pathway could be judged as irrelevant, since even under undisturbed conditions, advective particle transport was significant. Additionally, the uptake by biota and trophic transfer can be considerable. Quantification of dispersal routes and understanding of the relative importance of various pathways is critical for proper risk assessment and management of contaminated sediments.

TI  - Predicting the Architecture of Military ICT Infrastructure
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT (ECISM 2017)
CP  - 11th European Conference on Information Systems Management (ECISM)
AB  - Military forces are in transition towards digitalised forces following the example of their mother societies. In this transition, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) remains a key enabler to gain more effect from units composed of men, procedures, machines, software, and information. This paper studies the evolution of military ICT infrastructure and composes a roadmap to predict its architecture; a roadmap to help enterprise architects evaluate options when designing an ICT infrastructure to support digitalised military forces.
   The paper approaches the ICT systems architecture and program challenges from post-positivist view, trying to create new tools through an empirical observation and case study method. A hypothetical model is created with general systems modelling logic, which is then tested to practical information collected over thirty years in Defence Forces of Finland. Observation data is compared with two documented sources providing triangulating testing and improved integrity of resulting roadmap for ICT infrastructure evolution. The generalisation of the roadmap is made by referring to similar features found in other military forces and their missions. Finally, some examples of utilisation of the ICT evolutionary roadmap are given to help enterprise architects to analyse the current situation, the possible paths and end states.
   For many architects, it is hard to define how the management and cultural nature of an organisation will react to improving technology. The roadmap for ICT infrastructure evolution helps the architect to assess the status of the current situation from technical, management and organisation viewpoints at the same time. The approach helps architects to consider different paths of development and to optimise technical solutions with management structures and cultures.

TI  - Exploring the sustainable logistics innovation process
T2  - INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB  - Purpose - The development of more sustainable logistics calls for innovative thinking. In order to accelerate the development in the field, there is a need for increased understanding of the process behind successful implementation of sustainable logistics innovations (SLI). The purpose of this paper is to explore the SLI process, in order to identify critical factors, challenges as well as actors involved.
   Design/methodology/approach - A multiple-case study in six Swedish retailers and logistics service providers (LSPs), successful in SLI implementations, was conducted. Both within-case and cross-case analyses were applied.
   Findings - The SLI process consists of five phases. The positive relationship between formalisation and SLI success is supported. Critical activities and challenges not known from literature were found in each phase. Examples are the use of logistics and customer KPIs, quickness, developing simple concepts, using a sustainability business case template and selecting where to test SLIs. Some phases are involving many internal and external actors, while others involve few internal actors. Customers are not particularly involved, and retailers involve their LSP suppliers.
   Research limitations/implications - This study addresses the lack of empirical research in logistics innovation and has bridged the gap of innovation studies in other companies than in LSPs. Furthermore it has combined two developing areas, sustainable innovation and logistics innovation, into SLI. A number of critical activities and challenges, and complex patterns for actors' involvement in the SLI process phases are explored as insights from particular cases; these results could be analytically generalised to theory.
   Practical implications - The practical implications lie in guiding managers who wish to improve sustainability and innovativeness in logistics and, consequently, business success. Knowledge from successful companies about which phases to go through in which sequence, which challenges that can be expected and who to include in the SLI process could imply that more companies focus on SLI.
   Social implications - Knowledge on how to include sustainability in a clear innovation process, e.g., by making strong business cases, should imply an accelerated development of sustainable logistics in society.
   Originality/value - This study addresses the lack of empirically-based research in logistics innovation and expands the concept to retailers.

TI  - Twenty years on: changes in lizard encounter rates following eradication of rats from Kapiti Island
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Introductions of mammalian predators have led to extinctions or declines of many species on islands; hence eradications of these mammals have played a major role in biodiversity conservation. However, eradications are costly and sometimes controversial. It is therefore important to conduct carefully designed sampling programmes that allow benefits to native species to be quantified. We report the results of sampling conducted in 1994-1996 and 2014-2015 to estimate changes in relative abundance of lizards on Kapiti Island over 20 years following the eradication of Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and kiore (Rattus exulans) in 1996. Sampling was conducted in five different habitats over the island, and in each habitat involved repeatedly sampling 4-5 pitfall stations (five pitfall traps each) and conducting spotlighting and daytime searches along 2-3 transect lines. We used generalised linear mixed modelling to estimate proportional changes in lizard encounter rates while accounting for effects of month, weather variables, and changes in vegetation density. Pitfall capture rates for northern grass skinks (Oligosoma polychroma), brown skinks (Oligosoma zelandicum), and copper skinks (Oligosoma aeneum) were estimated to increase 2- to 28-fold in habitats where they were detected in 1994-1996, and these species were also found in 2014-2015 in habitats where they were not detected in 1994-1996. Spotlighting encounter rates for geckos (predominantly Raukawa geckos, Woodworthia maculata) were estimated to increase 3.7-fold between the two time periods. There were sparse observations of ornate skinks (Oligosoma ornatum). forest geckos (Mokopirirakau granulatus) and Wellington green geckos (Naultinus punctatus), whereas goldstripe geckos (Woodworthia chrysosiretica). which were discovered on the island in 2013, were not detected in the areas sampled. Most lizards continue to be found in habitats with low. dense vegetation, a pattern that may be at least partially attributable to predation pressure from the abundant weka (Gallirallus australis) on the island.

TI  - Combining genetic analyses of archived specimens with distribution modelling to explain the anomalous distribution of the rare lichen <i>Staurolemma omphalarioides</i>: long-distance dispersal or vicariance?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimThe rare lichen species Staurolemma omphalarioides is known mainly from the lowlands and coastal areas of the Mediterranean region but has also been found in coastal parts of central Norway. Despite extensive search efforts by experts for more than half a century, the species has been found nowhere in the gap. Our aim is to identify the most plausible explanation for this anomalous distribution by combining genetic analysis of archived specimens with distribution modelling.
   LocationEurope, western Middle East and North Africa (but mainly the Mediterranean and Atlantic floristic regions).
   MethodsWe used multi-locus DNA sequencing of archived specimens and phylogenetic and network analyses to reveal potential genetic lineages within S.omphalarioides. We used georeferenced specimens and bioclimatic variables to model the distributions of the species and two genetic lineages, and to find the main environmental correlates of the distributions.
   ResultsOur phylogeographical results show that S.omphalarioides contains genetic variation that correlates with geographical distance, although with a few shared haplotypes across disjunct ranges. Distributions of the species as well as the two genetic lineages are non-random. Distribution models predict occurrences of the species as well as one of its genetic lineages outside the current range of the species.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate that neither the species nor its component genetic lineages have reached their potential distributions. Shared haplotypes across disjunct distributions, and absence from regions with suitable refugial habitats along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe, support long-distance dispersal, rather than vicariance, as the primary cause for the current distribution of the species.

TI  - Exploring the Political Discursive Lock-Ins on Sustainable Aviation in Sweden
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - This article analyses the political discourse about governing the future of the aviation industry in Sweden and how a polarized and entrenched discursive path dependency around aviation makes it difficult to invest into aviation's possible futures as a sustainable transport. We find three different politically merged frames in the political discussion about governing the road to sustainable aviation: (1) Neoliberal sustainable aviation, (2) Green Keynesian sustainable aviation and (3) National environmentalists' aviation. We can see a discrepancy between two merged frames that believe sustainable aviation will be possible with more or less government support and steering (Neoliberal sustainable aviation and Green Keynesian sustainable aviation) whereas the third merged frame (National environmentalists' aviation) argues that aviation is bound to be environmentally inferior to trains and, therefore, all focus should go to the later. We can see that there is not just a path dependency in the merged frame of National environmentalists' aviation that discounts the possibility that both the role of aviation or its sustainability can change as the technology changes. There is here a static perceived view of technology as being forever clean or dirty. Another path dependency is the linkage of aviation transport with particular political parties where the green party, for instance, oppose aviation while the conservative party wants to support aviation and innovation in aviation. This polarization is actually the largest and most important aspect of the discursive lock-in as this undermines any compromises or large-scale future investments in sustainable aviation.

TI  - Discrimination between acute and chronic decline of Central European forests using map algebra of the growth condition and forest biomass fuzzy sets: A case study
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Forest decline is either caused by damage or else by vulnerability due to unfavourable growth conditions or due to unnatural silvicultural systems. Here, we assess forest decline in the Czech Republic (Central Europe) using fuzzy functions, fuzzy sets and fuzzy rating of ecosystem properties over a 1 x 1 km grid. The model was divided into fuzzy functions of the abiotic predictors of growth conditions (F-pred including temperature, precipitation, acid deposition, soil data and relative site insolation) and forest biomass receptors (F-rec including remote sensing data, density and volume of aboveground biomass, and surface humus chemical data). Fuzzy functions were designed at the limits of unfavourable, undetermined or favourable effects on the forest ecosystem health status. Fuzzy sets were distinguished through similarity in a particular membership of the properties at the limits of the forest status margins. Fuzzy rating was obtained from the least difference of F-pred - F-rec. Unfavourable F-pred within unfavourable F-rec indicated chronic damage, favourable F-pred within unfavourable F-rec indicated acute damage, and unfavourable F-pred within favourable F-rec indicated vulnerability. The model in the 1 x 1 km grid was validated through spatial intersection with a point field of uniform forest stands. Favourable status was characterised by soil base saturation (BS) > 50%, BCC/Al > 1, C-org > 1%, MgO > 6 g/kg, and nitrogen deposition < 1200 mol (H+)/ha.year. Vulnerable forests had BShumus 46-60%, BCC/AI 9-20 and NDVI approximate to 0.42. Chronic forest damage occurs in areas with low temperatures, high nitrogen deposition, and low soil BS and C-org levels. In the Czech Republic, 10% of forests were considered non-damaged and 77% vulnerable, with damage considered acute in 7% of forests and chronic in 5%. The fuzzy model used suggests that improvement in forest health will depend on decreasing environmental load and restoration concordance between growth conditions and tree species composition.

TI  - Social media and EU companies' engagement in circular economy: A LinkedIn approach
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - In the Internet age, companies utilize social media platforms to increase their network, visibility, and profits. LinkedIn is one of the most popular such platforms, offering profile hosting and several basic services for free that both companies and customers make good use of. In this study, data-driven and qualitative approaches of assessing the topic of circular economy as a LinkedIn activity in the EU and UK are performed. Data were collected by LinkedIn registered companies with the keyword "circular economy", extracting variables such as number of employees, date of foundation, company's activities, etc. Results indicate that 3727 EU company profiles are involved in circular economy activities. The majority of these companies operate in the UK, followed by the Netherlands and Italy. In total, there are >120 k employees in companies with circular economy activities in the EU, with Finland having the highest representation per half million population. With the extracted data, we provide a primary descriptive and statistical analysis for each country's engagement in circular economy, based on the business' sector activity. In addition, a presentation of circular economy companies per industrial sector and country is provided. The findings indicate that the examined companies give collective information regarding differentiations among the countries they operate in, but also shed light to the penetration of circular economy entrepreneurship in the EU. Monitoring the characteristics of the examined LinkedIn companies, as well as their descriptions and hashtags, essential insights on the progress and penetration of this ongoing economic transformation is provided. This approach offers significant perspectives for future country-specific in depth-analyses on this trending topic. (c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach Journalists' narratives of practices for managing and responding to user comments perceived as offensive are analysed qualitatively. For this purpose, ten interviews with journalists from nine different news organisations in Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Canada were conducted. Findings The study finds that the environment in which the journalists work plays a vital role in the evolution of the practices. Practices, indissolubly tied to the contexts or sites in which people's activities take place, are conditioned by moral values, traditions and collective experiences which journalists enact through the practice they engage in when they are dealing with user posts online. The site, conceived as an information landscape, is that of the newsroom. Practices for managing users online evolve through actors participating in a process of learning and their ability to adopt the cultural norms and values of their environment. Originality/value This study sheds light on the mechanisms behind the evolution of practices for handling user-generated content online and it reports on the importance of properties such as norms, values and emotions for how things are done in the information landscape of news journalism.

TI  - Pollen productivity estimates for quantitative reconstruction of vegetation cover on the Swiss Plateau
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - We present the first step to quantitatively reconstruct vegetation cover in central Europe. Modern vegetation and pollen deposition were compared for 20 small to medium sized lakes and their catchments on the Swiss Plateau, a relatively flat region between the Jura Mountains and the Alps. To correct for the pollen dispersal bias in pollen assemblages, vegetation abundance was distance-weighted using three different approaches. The Relevant Source Area of Pollen (RSAP) and pollen productivity of 13 plant taxa were estimated using three different submodels of the Extended R-Value model (ERV-model). RSAP was 800 m regardless of the applied distance-weighting or ERV submodel. Pollen Productivity Estimates (PPE) varied from 10 to < 0.1 among pollen taxa and differed slightly between the models. Relative to grasses most trees were higher pollen producers and some were equal producers, whereas the herb taxa showed lower PPE. Generally, PPE from lowland Switzerland differ from those found in other European regions. Sampling strategies of vegetation and pollen samples are a likely cause for this variation. However, pollen productivity is also influenced by regionally different factors, such as climate, vegetation structure, geology and soil types. In addition, differences at genus or species level may occur between areas. Our comparison between the different regions in Europe shows that PPE of one region may not be directly applicable to other regions.

TI  - PSYCHOTHERAPY OF PSYCHOSES IN BALZACS BOOK OF MYSTICS
T2  - DYNAMISCHE PSYCHIATRIE
AB  - "Seraphita", a story in Balzac's "Book of Mystic", is understood here as the key to the comprehension of the central problematic nature in the life of the poet and as the decisive turning point in his literary creativity. "Seraphita" takes place in the glacial landscape of Norway. The angelical being Seraphita, a relative of the mystic Swedenborg, is perceived by the young woman Minna as a man and by the traveller Wilfrid as a woman. Both of them idolize ardently this figure. But Seraphita rejects them and refers their excessive longings to God. Minna and Wilfrid resist the refusal of Seraphita, jealous of each other, and they are only capable of letting go of their desire for love at the time point of her death. As the angelic, ethereal and entranced being is dying, both of them experience the vision of a light explosion, in which Seraphita ascends to a heavenly wedding. After her death Minna and Wilfrid find to each other and decide to share the way to God together.
   There are three steps of interpretation of this story: Referring to its mystical content first the story is interpreted as a way of liberation from exaggerated earthly longings and desires to a return to divine prime origin.
   With regard to the biography of Balzac the story is seen as an attempt to heal himself through re-experiencing and overcoming his early privations shared with his sister Laure. Balzac and his 16 months older sister grew up until his fourth year with a nanny, and then they were taken away by the unknown parents and put in two different hostels. Their up-bringing was put in the hands of an evil governess, who brought the children every sunday to the mother for punishment. Balzac wrote about his mother: "I have never had a mother." - "She is a monstrosity." - "My mother is the cause of everything loathsome in my life." - "She is only wicked." Balzac retreats very early from the world into godliness. With eight years he went into a catholic boarding school, with 14 years he was expelled because of "mental illness".
   In the story the author sees the early and prenatal rejection reflected in the hostile, frozen landscape of Norway. With this story Balzac completes a phase of writing, which is about madness. Also the grave identity crisis of the years 1831-33 comes to an end, and Balzac succeeds in breaking through to his great potential of creativity, which characterizes the cycle of novels "The Human Comedy". In "Seraphita" and in his spiritual involvement at that time Balzac comes closer to the work of the mystic Swedenborg. The vision of an "unio mystica" in "Seraphita" matches an extreme opening of the ego-boundaries, which ends in a regeneration of the ego on a better integrated basis.
   In the historical dimension of the story Balzac returns in the form of the androgynous, angelical figure of Seraphita to the God of creation, counteracting the then prevailing misuse of power by the Catholic Church, which Balzac unmasked in other works. The story represents his own wish of the integration of masculinity and feminity, the core of every creativity, as Ammon (1984) has pointed out. The androgynous principle, as understood by Gunter Ammon, the suspension of restricting, rigid thinking and life styles and of the "divide and rule" is seen by the author symbolized in the dimension of reconciliation and the life worshipping Utopia in Balzac's "Seraphita".

TI  - Shifts in fine-scale distribution and breeding success of boreal waterbirds along gradients in ice-out timing and habitat structure
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - Climate change and other anthropogenic stressors affect freshwater ecosystems worldwide. A prominent manifestation of climate change impacts on aquatic systems at high latitudes is the advance of ice-out date (IOD). Earlier IOD should be advantageous for species such as migratory waterbirds that are dependent on open water to initiate breeding; earlier breeding usually means higher reproductive success. However, advance of IOD may induce phenological mismatches that have negative impacts on the species involved. This may alter habitat dynamics, challenging habitat selection by breeding individuals. An additional challenge is imposed by changes in habitat quality, particularly if preferred habitats deteriorate. Here, we investigated how the fine-scale distribution of breeding individuals and breeding success have changed along gradients in IOD and habitat structure (richness of emergent vegetation) in a boreal waterbird assemblage in southeastern Finland from 1991 to 2018. IOD varied considerably between nearby lakes. The distribution of breeding individuals of the common teal (Anas crecca) and horned grebe (Podiceps auritus) shifted toward lakes with relatively late IOD while Eurasian wigeon (Mareca penelope) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) shifted toward lakes with sparse emergent vegetation. Also, breeding success in common teal showed a decreasing trend at lakes with relatively early IOD, while it increased on lakes with relatively late IOD. Success in tufted duck breeding decreased on lakes with rich emergent vegetation, while the opposite was true on lakes with sparse emergent vegetation. The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) was the only species that did not show a shift in breeding distribution or breeding success along either of the environmental gradients. The findings suggest that a potentially positive climate-driven impact on breeding phenology (earlier IOD) was over-ridden by negative changes in habitat quality. The results underline the need to understand the complexity of the effects of multiple stressors in boreal freshwater ecosystems for their successful management.

TI  - Factors predicting incidence of butt rot and trunk rot in individual stems of main tree species in a cool-temperate natural mixed forest in Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - We examined the incidence of heart rot (butt rot and trunk rot) in stems of each main tree species, with regard to the effects of individual and site characteristics, in the northern Japanese natural mixed forest. We addressed the hypotheses that incidences of rot are influenced by species identification, individual size, local vegetation, and topographic conditions. The proportions of tree individuals with heart rot (totally 36.7%) varied with tree species, with trunk rot having a significantly higher incidence in two broadleaved species (Quercus crispula and Betula ermanii) than coniferous species (Abies sachalinensis). However, butt rot incidence was similar among tree species, suggesting that each rot type appeared differently by species. The random forest classifications did not necessarily show high accuracy; it was suggested that heart rot incidence in stems of Acer mono and A. sachalinensis occurs randomly. However, in the models for both rot types of B. ermanii and trunk rot of Q. crispula, we revealed that diameter at breast height was highly important factor. Another important variable was sum of basal area of the neighboring trees, in which the incidence of both rot types tended to increase at low and high tree basal area. In addition, it was appeared that the butt rot incidence in B. ermanii was sensitive to steep slope.

TI  - The urban water system - A future Swedish perspective
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB  - It is argued, that the use of water can no longer be regarded as an almost free commodity. The idea to assess and value the environmental impact of the water use represents a hue change of paradigm. The key issue is that any future wastewater treatment system has to be evaluated according to a quantitative criterion. This has to consider:
   hygienic aspects: we believe that nobody will accept a lower hygienic standard than today.
   environmental impact: the wastewater impact on the environment has steadily increased the need for better treatment. We need to be prepared for changes in the society by having a readiness manifested as continuing dynamic research environment in this area. Too often the knowledge build-up has been re-active instead of pro-active.
   economising resources: wastewater treatment looks and probably should look quite different in densely populated urban areas and in rural areas. Considering resource handling one has to consider already invested capital costs, land use, water re-use, organic and nutrient use and re-use, as well as overall use of energy.
   user aspects: technical functionality, economy and liability in different aspects require profound consideration.
   A sustainable wastewater treatment has to adapt to a local environment and the total resource demand has to be calculated, including a direct environmental impact on receiving waters, air and soil as well as energy consumption and nutrient recycling. Thus, there is an apparent need for,
   quantitative performance index: the quest for sustainable development has to be based on objective reasons as well as subjective ones. An integrated performance index is part of a necessary decision making model for the design and operation of wastewater treatment systems. In this index, it is evident that a trade-off should be made between the pursued quality of the process outputs (liquid solids, gas) and the associated efforts (investments, operation) required to achieve this considering the inputs (wastewater). In order to make this trade-off, however, a common framework is needed to quantitatively compare the different objectives.
   A metric to judge the sustainability of different options will facilitate a fruitful dialogue between e.g. politicians, ecologists, engineers and economists. Only a truly interdisciplinary approach can help to solve the challenges ahead. (C) 1997 IAWQ, Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

TI  - 10 ISSUES OF <i>Ra</i>, REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA
T2  - RA-REVISTA DE ARQUITECTURA
AB  - With this issue Ra, Revista de Arquitectura reaches its first 10. It is an appropriate moment, despite such a short history, to look back briefly. It is not about a celebration, nor a self-gratifying examination -this new issue adds nothing to the editorial line taken then, but rather serves to thank and recognise all those people who have contributed, for the great effort which it takes to create an academic journal of these characteristics in the immense publishing panorama that surrounds us. As the habitual lyrics sung and popularized by the group "Golpes Bajos", "bad time for poetry", that one must remember is the title of a poem by Bertold Brecht, (an expression that the Royal Academy of Language (RAE), already includes in the dictionary to explain the adjective "bad").
   And it is not precisely the publications that try to bring to their pages architecture of thought, debate, or reflection, those that fill the bookcases of the bookstores. This is not a pessimistic vision, as is the poem of Brecht, rather the contrary. It seems pertinent to recover here the encouraging words of Fritz Neumeyer (Ra 6, 2004) who asserted that architecture does not truly exist for those architects obsessed with image, or objects, or intoxicated with space. Only those for whom architecture is familiar, and not alien, and who do not fall into presumptions or into sensitive aesthetics, are able to have a world view through architecture. To contribute to this effort is more than sufficient. Not long ago, a good friend of Ra, who still, paradoxically, has not published any article, vehemently encouraged us to continue, though against the grain, on this path. The first issue of the magazine was published in February of 1997 as an inseparable supplement to another one, Re, Revista de Edificacion. Re was already established, and then had reached 24 issues and at present have 36. Jose Luque Valdivia (1, 1997) and Jose Manuel Pozo (2, 1998) both coordinated the first issues. Inigo Beguiristain, under the guidance of an editorial board formed by Miguel Angel Alonso del Val, Juan M. Ochotorena and Jose Manuel Pozo, to which Mariano Gonzalez Presencio joined shortly thereafter, coordinated the next two issues (3, 1999/4, 2000). Laura Martinez de Guerenu took over the coordination of the following issue (5, 2003). Starting with issue 7, published in 2005, Maristella Casciato, Luis Fernandez Galiano, Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani, Jorge F Liernur, Carlos Montes Serrano, Stanislaus von Moos, Jose Antonio Ruiz de la Rosa and Carlos Sambricio joined the original editorial board, forming in this way a more extensive scientific commission of international reach. Since 2006, Ra is member of FAST-IP, Federation of Architectural Studies Independent Publications, a federation of non-profit academic journals, of which Future Anterior (GSAPP, Columbia University), Thresholds (Department of Architecture, MIT) and Springerin, a magazine of art and culture published in Vienna, are also members. In addition, this path has allowed its indexing, first in 2005 in the Avery Index for Architectural Periodicals, and recently, since 2007, in the Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI). Both are benchmark data bases in their fields. And Ra is, at the moment, the only indexed Spanish journal of architecture of the 29 in A&HCI, along with prestigious, recognised journals with a long history such as L Architecture d'Aujourd'hui, Architectural Record, Architectural Design, Journal of Architectural Education, Lotus, A+U, ... among others.
   We must also recognise the work of Igone Santesteban, Elena Pena, Ana Gozalo, Izaskun Garcia Ederra, and of all the architecture student collaborators who have spent time to prepare editions of the journal. Ra began in 1997 with an editorial, the only one until now, signed by Juan Miguel Otxotorena, Dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Navarre, where the opportunities were explained, as well as the benefit of the birth of the new supplement. That text, we can say, is still totally valid today, and also printed on the flap of the cover:
   "Ra aspires, from here, to build an apt forum for the expression of the results of academic study and debate in relation to the diverse areas of interest in architecture and the city typical of the university vision: understanding them as cultural realities of unquestionable importance and impact and an object of careful attention, study and research. Ra seeks to serve as a channel, in particular, for the intellectual production of the departments of Theory and History, Urban Planning and Architectural Projects, although from the beginning it has been open to articles and collaborations from other professional and educational institutions.
   And it seeks to enhance that one perception of architecture that does not lose sight of its cultural dimension, in the widest sense of the word, the only limitation being to avoid fully descending to the publication of projects and current work in the area of design and built projects, more suitable to other publishing circles and thoroughly covered by so many other accredited, experienced and solvent magazines". Indeed, in these 10 issues the journal has published articles from the research of the departments of Theory and History, Urban Planning and Projects at the School of Architecture at the University of Navarre (ETSAUN), and have had collaborations from researchers worldwide, some of whom have also been in the classrooms of the School. It would not be right to name here some, considering them more relevant, while forgetting so many others. At the end of this issue we provide the indexes that testify to the wide and diverse origin of all of them. Equally, the commitment to the heterogeneity of the subjects, avoiding therefore a monograph, has been fully conscious and consistent, considering it to be the best way to reflect the cultural dimension and, in a certain sense, the unorthodoxy of architecture, if we understand this as a revitalising factor and constructive value.
   In this issue number 10, we offer the Spanish version of "The Status of Man and His Objects: A Reading of The Human Condition" by Kenneth Frampton, given in the book that takes the title precisely from the content of the article "Labour, Work and Architecture: collected essays on architecture and design", (Phaidon Press, London & New York, 2002). Although published originally in 1979, Frampton supervised and revised in detail the original text with Carlos Naya in attendance, selecting, in addition the images that accompany it. In "The Status of Man and His Objects: A Reading of The Human Condition", Frampton takes as a point departure the concepts of work and tabour, public and private, that come from the reading of the well-known text by Hannah Arendt, to define the situation of architecture in the contemporary society. Ruben A. Alcolea Rodriguez, on the other hand, in "From the city to compressed air Genesis of the modern photography of architecture", demonstrates the original, close relations between photography and architecture since the discovery of the new technique in the mid-19th century. And how photography and photographers, even better than the actual architects, after portraying the city, were able to take a better reading of modern architecture with the exhibition "Film und Foto", organised by the German Werkbund in 1929.
   Luis Rojo de Castro offers a "personal reflection, free and unorthodox" about one of the trips, rather the drawings made on the trip (or redone later) by Le Corbusier, a long voyage that in 1929 would take him to South American soil and that many authors consider to be a decisive point of reflection in his theories. In "[Ideograms]. Precisions on "precisions"', the relationship between critical thought and the projects of the master is established from some of these drawings, full of meaning beyond the immediate or evident.
   Francisco Gonzilez de Canales develops in "Experiments with oneself. 1937-1959" the concept of domestic self-experimentation from the voluntary or involuntary exile of architects and artists in the middle of the last century. Some noteworthy examples, or rather pretexts are: Casa de Isla Negra by Pablo Neruda and Germin Rodriguez Arias, an exiled Spanish architect; the cabin in the middle of the Swedish forest, The Box, by Ralph Erskine; Eames House in Los Angeles; the self-built house in Sedona by Max Ernst; the Malaparte house by Adalberto Libera; the glass house by Lina Bo and Pietro M. Bardi in Sao Paulo; the house in El Pedregal by Juan O'Gorman; the also self-built house in Castlecrag by Ruth and Wilfried Lucas; and the Smithson house in Fonthill.
   Francisco Gomez Diaz brings us the biography and work of the exiled San Sebastian architect in Cuba, Martin Dominguez Esteban. The article "Martin Dominguez Esteban. The work of an exiled Spanish architect in Cuba" should have been part of the presentations at the VIth International Congress "History of Modern Spanish Architecture" (T6 Ediciones, 2008). In any case, the more than remarkable work of an architect who, for some of the reasons that are detailed, and until more or less recently, had gone relatively unnoticed in the history of modern Spanish architecture, is presented here.
   In "Two fragments of OTAYSA in the Universidad Laboral of Seville: five gymnasiums and a dying workshop", Jose Joaquin Parra Banon thoroughly dissects the gymnasiums and a workshop in the group of educational buildings projected at the beginning of the 50s by the Oficina Tecnica de Arquitectura e Ingenieria (OTAYSA), formed by the brothers Felipe and Rodrigo Medina Benjumea, Alfonso Toro Buiza and Luis Gomez Estern, for the Universiclad Laboral of Seville. Original and recent photographs, along with original and redrawn plans, accompany the story, at times stormy, of the use and also the abandonment of this proposal, faithful to the ideas of the Modern Movement.
   Finally, Jose Manuel Pozo, writes "The opportunity of a Congress: reflections of a scissors", an article on the last Congress, "History of Modern Spanish Architecture", the VIth edition, which took place in March of 2008 under the title "Crossed Glances: exchanges between Latin America and Spain in Modern Spanish Architecture" in which recognised researchers on both sides of the Atlantic participated. Roberto Segre, Jorge F. Liernur, Carlos Ferreira Martins, Fernando Perez de Oyarzun. Enrique X. de Anda Alanis, Helio Pinon, Alberto Sato, Javier Martinez and Federico Deambrosis gave the main presentations at the congress, along with a dozen papers and a hundred attendees. There the glances exchanged between Spain and Latin America, architecture and exiled Spanish architects and the role played by Latin American editorials were presented and debated mainly. Finally, the indexes of all the articles and their published authors are included, 10 issues to date. To all, thank you very much.

TI  - Modeling forage potential for red deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>): a tree-level approach
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) are mixed feeders that consume both herbaceous and woody plants. As a consequence, intensive browsing on trees where red deer populations are particularly dense often leads to serious conflicts between the interests of forestry and hunting stakeholders. Therefore, understanding the density of deer that forest system can bear requires the ability to measure amount of potential forage provided by non-commercial tree species within a stand that serve as forage. Our objective was to build models that estimate forage potential (i.e., maximum biomass edible and accessible for consumption by red deer per tree) based on tree size [i.e., stem base diameter (d(0))]. We developed models for three tree species commonly consumed by red deer in Central Europe, aspen (Populus tremula), goat willow (Salix caprea) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia). To construct models of forage potential, we harvested 380 young (age of 2-15 years) trees on 14 sites in the Western Carpathians of Slovakia. Tree biomass was first divided into three components (stem bark, branches and foliage), each of which was subdivided into edible and non-edible portions based on branch diameter and height from the ground and then dried and weighed. We then quantified edible biomass by tree species, tree component and season (growing vs. dormant). The total amount of tree mass (forage potential) that could be consumed by red deer generally increased with tree size, but the relative contributions of different tree components varied by tree size, tree species and season. Our models predicted that the maximum forage potential per tree was ~ 500 g in aspen, 350 g in goat willow and 300 g in rowan in summer, and nearly 500 g in aspen, 300 g in goat willow and 250 g in rowan in winter. Together with theoretical knowledge and practical experience, our forage potential models can be used to help forest and wildlife managers both to better measure edible tree biomass for red deer populations and how edible tree biomass might be used to minimize the risk of deer damaging commercially valuable trees.

TI  - PLANT REFLECTED SPECTRA DEPENDING ON BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH CONDITIONS
T2  - 7TH INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE RURAL DEVELOPMENT 2015: TOWARDS THE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE, INNOVATIONS AND SOCIAL PROGRESS
CP  - 7th International Scientific Conference on Rural Development - Towards the Transfer of Knowledge, Innovations and Social Progress
AB  - Sustainable and economically based forestry needs modern inventory and monitoring techniques. One of the most common technologies for identification of forest tree species and monitoring of forest growth conditions is the hyperspectral remote sensing. This technology gives an opportunity to economize human resources and time for data collecting and processing. The spectral behaviour of plant leaves depends on number of factors, including environmental background. The aim of this study was to assess the tree reflectance spectra in relation to the growth conditions to take into account potential differences for increasing precision of species identification in Latvian forests and for estimating of forest growth conditions. Remote sensing data were obtained using a specialized aircraft (Pilatus PC-6), which is equipped with a high-performance airborne VNIR pushbroom hyperspectral system (AisaEAGLE). The study area was flown at 1000 m altitude. Data was recorded in the 400-970 nm spectral range, spectral resolution was 3.3 nm, ground resolution 0.5 m. Data processing consisted of manually selecting trees with a recognizable tree crowns in the airborne images. Tree centres were adjusted by putting them in the accurate position according to the situation in aerial photography. All trees with a diameter at breast height DBH of more than 5 cm were measured and for each tree coordinates, its species, height, DBH, crown width and length were recorded. Differentially corrected Global Positioning System measurements were used to determine the position of each plot centre. Data from different hyperspectral bands were compared using ANOVA at confidence level 95 %. Four species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), and European aspen (Populus tremula L.) - were examined in distinct forest site types. The spectral response of studied species was 1) different between species and 2) different between site types within each species, correlating with soil fertility gradient and soil moisture gradient. Differences between species occurred most in the intensity of reflected electromagnetic radiation rather than distinctive locations of maximums or minimums in spectrum curve, and near infrared (NIR) region of spectrum showed more differences between species than visible light zone. Most informative wavebands for distinguishing differences between site types were 805 nm and 644 nm.

TI  - Evolution of soil solution aluminum during transport along a forested boreal hillslope
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
AB  - Aluminum ( Al) transfer from soils to surface waters is a crucial determinant of aquatic biodiversity in acidified and/or naturally acid surface waters. Defining how landscapes and acid deposition influence Al export depends on our understanding of the mobilization of Al within catchments. This paper documents the evolution of Al chemistry in water during its transport through a hillslope by using soil water chemistry combined with hydrometric data. Al levels moving laterally from upslope mineral soils were low (< 0.1 mg.L-1). This is not consistent with a vertically infiltrating acidification front mobilizing Al from across the catchment. As water moves laterally downslope into the peaty soils of the riparian zone ( RZ), Al increased along with organic acids and iron. The RZ in this study was thus a net source of Al to soil solution on all 9 sampling occasions where Al was measured, as well as a net source of dissolved organic carbon ( DOC) on another dozen measurement occasions. The potential for Al concentrations being modified during transport through the RZ needs to be accounted for in efforts to relate acid deposition to toxic stream Al concentrations. Organic carrying capacity was in excess of Al for all samples. Only samples from the deeper mineral soils showed supersaturation; however, none of the samples showed degrees of supersaturation high enough for spontaneous mineral precipitation. A key area for further research is how the RZ can sustain a larger Al pool than upslope mineral soils when the supply of Al from these upslope soils to lateral flux is currently lower than that from the RZ. Two possibilities are either episodic downslope transport during periods of high lateral flow, or drainage-induced changes in hydrology that transformed the RZ from an accumulator of Al to a source of Al.

TI  - IMPACT OF SOIL-CLIMATIC AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS SOUTHWESTERN SLOVAKIA TO THE PRODUCTION INDICATORS OF FAST GROWING WILLOW SALIX
T2  - WOOD RESEARCH
AB  - On the research field base of the Department of Sustainable Development of the Slovak University of Agriculture in Kolinany, in 2011 the production parameters and biomass production were observed in the case of five Short-Rotation Willow Coppice (SRWC) varieties of Swedish energy crop - willow Salix (Tora, Gudrun, Tordis, Inger and Sven). Within the field experiment performed on a small plot of land with approximately 10 666 subjects per hectare the following indicators were observed: The number of living shoots in individuals, shoot length, shoot thickness, yield of dry biomass for individual and total biomass dry matter (DM) yield in t.ha(-1). The number of shoots produced by individuals in the fertilized variant ranged from 5.00 to 7.33 shoots and in the unfertilized variant from 5.00 to 7.66 shoots. The average thickness of shoots of fertilized variant ranged from 27.05 mm to 35.91 mm. In the case of the fertilized variant the indicator was lower and varied from 25.66 mm to 30.32 mm. The average length of shoots of fertilized variant ranged from 6.11 m to 7.78 m and the unfertilized 5.22 to 7.46. As for the average yield of biomass (dry) DM in kg, in case of the fertilized variant, the individuals reached values from 6.59 kg to 11.39 kg and the unfertilized variant from 6.16 kg to 8.26 kg. The average yield of biomass DM in t.ha(-1) in the fertilized variant ranged from 70.28 t.ha(-1) to 121.48 t.ha(-1) and in the unfertilized variant from 65.70 t.ha(-1) to 88.10 t.ha(-1). Annual production of biomass DM in t.ha-1 for individual SRWC varieties and fertilizer in a five-year growing cycle is from13140 t.ha(-1) to 24297 t.ha(-1).

TI  - Business meetings at a distance - decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative energy demand?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Transportation, or rather access, is a major challenge in relation to achieving environmental goals and in striving for sustainable development. One potential means suggested to decrease the environmental impact related to accessibility is mediated meetings. However, few studies have quantified the potential environmental impacts with a life cycle perspective. With inspiration from a project involving four major Swedish media companies experiencing an increasing need for business travel and decreasing resources, this study assessed the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative energy demand (CED) related to different types of business meetings, using a life cycle perspective. The potential consequences for emissions of GHG and CED in two hypothetical companies introducing mediated meetings were also assessed. The results indicated that mediated meetings using personal computers can reduce GHG emissions and CED per meeting and that more advanced mediated solutions are preferable to meetings which require travel, if the equipment is frequently used to replace travel. However, advanced technology that is under-used may give similar or higher GHG emissions and CED than meetings traveled to by train. All mediated meeting alternatives studied here had lower GHG emissions and CED than meetings which required travel by plane or car. LCD screen manufacture contributed the main environmental impact of mediated meetings, but the meeting rooms needed, electricity use for equipment and internet use for data transmission were also important in some cases. As LCD screen manufacture and internet energy use were main issues and as the data on these issues are uncertain, they should be further assessed+ and updated in future studies. Introduction of mediated meetings in companies and organizations should involve a thorough consideration of needs and possible solutions to achieve the best possible environmental benefits through efficient use and replacement of travel.

TI  - "GREEN" ECONOMY: ROLE OF SOVEREIGN FUNDS
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB  - The paper examines the potential role of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) in implementation of the UN-initiated 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular; the Sustainable Development Goals relating to combining long-term growth of global economy with protection of the Earth's environment, i.e. the creation of low-carbon (colloquially "green") economy. By definition, such a transition is highly capital-intensive, thus demanding mobilization of all available sources of financing. SWFs as state-run investment vehicles are among the most prospective ones. In recent decade, they noticeably strengthened their role in the world economy. SWFs proved to be the fastest growing group of institutional investors. Their cumulative AUM was estimated at around 7.4 Billion US dollars as of early 2018. By now, the world's leading SWFs from Norway, China, Singapore, Persian Gulf and some other states evolved into full-fledged market-driven investors with an active portfolio management strategy. In the conditions of current economic and geo-political turbulence SWFs show growing interest to the opportunities of "green" financing while seeking for viable alternatives to the increasingly fading traditional fixed-income instruments. However, the scale of SWFs' involvement in the creation of global "green" economy is still rather tiny as compared to the needs of respective investments, the activities of private business, as well as to the state funds' own financial capabilities. While considering the reasons of current situation and the prospects of its improvement the author argues that a massive "greening" of SWFs' investment strategies can (and should) be triggered by powerful political push from the respective national governments, namely, by major legal re-formatting of their mandates in the light of the Sustainable Development Goals. It can be expected that, with such push in place, in the upcoming years the state investment vehicles may change the rules, as well as the whole landscape, of the global "green "financing system.

TI  - HOLOCENE HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENT, VEGETATION AND HUMAN SETTLEMENT ON CATTA NESS, LUNNASTING, SHETLAND
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Pollen, charcoal, chemical, physical, magnetic and tephra analyses of C-14-dated Holocene lake sediments from Dallican Water, Catta Ness, north-east Shetland, are presented and interpreted in the light of models of Holocene climatic change, the Shetland archaeological record, and local documentary evidence. The sequence was subdivided and analysed using principal components analysis, a numerical zonation of the pollen data using optimal and binary divisive techniques, and measures of palynological richness and rates of change between samples. 2. Sedimentation began at 9900 years BP, and until 9620 BP consisted of minerogenic sediments eroded from raw soils. Vegetation was herbaceous until 9500 BP, when Betula woodlands began to develop. 3. During the period 9620-7500 BP woodland diversified (Betula, Corylus avellana, Juniperus communis, Quercus, Alnus glutinosa and possibly Ulmus and Fraxinus excelsior) with tall-herb communities that included a high proportion of ferns. Lake sediments became predominantly organic as soils became more stable, with some leaching of cations, and erosion was reduced. 4. From 7500 to 5400 BP tree cover changed little, but the herb and fern communities were replaced by plants of heathland and mires. Erosion increased slightly and charcoal accumulation was high. These changes suggest the presence of Mesolithic people, and, associated with them, a mammalian herbivore (possibly red deer), which reduced the herb and fern communities by grazing. 5. After 5400 BP, vegetation passed through a series of successional stages, returning within a few hundred years to a type similar to that prevailing earlier than 7500 BP. Contemporaneously, erosion decreased as soils restabilized. Charcoal accumulation was low. We suggest that the herbivore had become extinct, and the islands became uninhabited. 6. From c. 4800 BP, Calluna vulgaris and other mire plants increased, probably due to natural soil leaching and acidification. The extent of peatland greatly increased, sealing sources of supply of erodible material. Pollen and charcoal data suggest that people were present on the island from c. 4500 BP, supporting archaeological dating for occupation of Shetland by agricultural communities. The first phase of clearance on Catta Ness was c. 4000 BP, and lasted for c. 400 years. Woodland then increased to its former levels. 7. Woodland was almost completely cleared from the area within 150 years c. 3120 BP, probably as a deliberate act to extend rough grazing. This dramatic event cannot be correlated with any known cultural changes in the Shetland archaeological record, and probably results from local human activity. Heath plants increased substantially, and sediments became more organic as erosion sources continued to diminish. 8. Vegetation and land use have remained more or less constant for the past 3000 years, despite major cultural changes, such as the building of brochs c. 2000 BP and the arrival of Norse people c. 1150 BP. Documentary evidence suggests that the area of land under cultivation on Catta Ness has not changed within the last 350 years. 9. This study has confirmed the former presence of Alnus glutinosa on Shetland, and indicated that Quercus was also present. Thus, the early Holocene woodlands of Shetland were, at least locally, more diverse than had hitherto been realized. 10.
   At least two layers of volcanic ash occur in the sediments, probably originating from Icelandic sources. A layer of basic ash c. 9300 BP is identified as the Saksunarvatn ash previously described from the Faroe Islands. A complex layer of acidic ash c. 4000 BP is probably part of the Hekla 4 ash fall. These horizons hold considerable potential as dating horizons within the Holocene of the north-east Atlantic, and contribute to understanding of the distribution of Holocene tephras in the area. This is the first complete Holocene tephra record to be obtained from the British Isles.

CP  - 9th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (NordiCHI)
AB  - Climate change is an important area of concern today. Yet it is often difficult for individuals to estimate their own climate footprint and to understand their personal climate impact. However, an activity tracking approach can help individuals to track and visualize their otherwise invisible climate impacts to better understand their personal impact and that of their community. This includes a wide range of activities and thus goes beyond fitness trackers as it aims at a more holistic quantified self with the angle of climate impact. This paper describes the Ducky platform, which is designed to quantify, visualize, and communicate everyday climate activities to understand and motivate its users towards environmental-and climate-friendly behavior. This includes both individual and collaborative impacts. We describe the motivation and system approach and the inclusion of research findings about Norwegian households' climate impacts into the platform together with an initial evaluation.

TI  - Palaeoecology of <i>Sphagnum riparium</i> (Angstrom) in Northern Hemisphere peatlands: Implications for peatland conservation and palaeoecological research
T2  - REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY
AB  - Sphagnum riparium (Angstrom) is a rare constituent of modern peatland plant communities and is also very rarely found as a subfossil in peat archives. We present new data on the occurrence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in three Northern Hemisphere peatlands from Yellowknife (NW Canada), Abisko (N Sweden), and the Northern Ural Mountains (NW Russia). Sphagnum riparium macrofossils were present in transitional phases between rich fen and oligotrophic bog. Sphagnum riparium was a dominant species in the three sites and was found in combination with Sphagnum angustifolium, Drepanocladus sp., and vascular plants including Andromeda polifolia, Chamedaphne calyculata and Oxycoccus palustris. Testate amoebae indicate that the species occurred in wet to moderately wet conditions (water-table depth inferred from a testate amoeba transfer function model ranged between 25 and 0 cm under the peatland surface). The wet-indicator taxa Archerella flavum and Hyalosphenia papilio dominated the testate amoeba communities in peat horizons containing Sphagnum riparium. The presence of Sphagnum riparium macrofossils in peat profiles in the Northern Hemisphere can be interpreted as an indication of wet minerotrophic conditions, often corresponding to a rise in water-level and establishment of a wet habitat. Sphagnum riparium is a transient species in these peatlands and is replaced by communities dominated by more acidophilic species such as Sphagnum angustifolium, Sphagnum russowii, and Sphagnum fuscum. Our data show that although Sphagnum riparium is a transient peat-forming species, it is widespread in sub-arctic and boreal environments. The subfossil occurrence of Sphagnum riparium in the Northern Hemisphere may indicate that its range has increased during the Late Holocene. The conservation of Sphagnum riparium in peatlands depends on the existence of relatively short-lived transitional communities which potentially can be artificially created. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Recovery of soil macrofauna after wildfires in boreal forests
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Forest wildfires can severely affect the soil faunal community. We hypothesised that the recovery of soil animals after a fire would occur through (1) immigration from the unburnt forest into the burnt area and (2) survival in less-burnt patches or deep soil layers. To test the rate of recovery, and whether immigration or survival was the main recovery factor, we studied soil macrofauna after two wildfires occurring in 2001 in central Sweden and north-western Russia. The animals were studied up to 2007 by taking soil and litter samples including unburnt and burnt forest plots 20 and 60 m from the edge of the unburnt forest. Total abundance and species richness was 1.5-5 times higher in the unburnt than in the burnt areas shortly after fire. Animals in deep soil layers had a better survival after fire than surfaced-welling species. The burnt area was colonised within a few months by flying insects, mostly dipterans. When the post-fire vegetation had established after 1-2 years, plant-feeding groups like aphids, cicadellids and thripses became even more abundant than in the unburnt forest. Millipedes established faster in the area close to the forest edge than in the central part of the fire area indicating migration from the forest edge, but most slow-dispersing soil animals seemed to recover through survival in the burnt area. The biomass of both microbi-detritivores and predators showed a delayed recovery in the burnt area and had only reached 40-60% of that in the unburnt forest six years after the wild-fire, indicating reduced habitat quality for the former and food shortage for the latter group.

TI  - Localisation of Nursery Areas Based on Comparative Analyses of the Horizontal and Vertical Distribution Patterns of Juvenile Baltic Cod (<i>Gadus morhua</i>)
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of juvenile cod is essential for obtaining precise recruitment data to conduct sustainable management of the eastern and western Baltic cod stocks. In this study, the horizontal and vertical distribution and density patterns of settled juvenile 0- and 1-group Baltic cod are determined, and their nursery areas are localised according to the environmental factors affecting them. Comparative statistical analyses of biological, hydrographic and hydroacoustic data are carried out based on standard ICES demersal trawl surveys and special integrated trawl and acoustic research surveys. Horizontal distribution maps for the 2001-2010 cohorts of juvenile cod are further generated by applying a statistical log-Gaussian Cox process model to the standard trawl survey data. The analyses indicate size-dependent horizontal and distinct vertical and diurnal distribution patterns related to the seabed topography, water layer depth, and the presence of hydrographic frontal zones (pycnoclines) as well as intraspecific patterns in relation to the presence of adult cod. The extent of the nursery areas also depends on the cod year class strength. Juvenile cod (>= 3 cm) are present in all areas of the central Baltic Sea (CBS), showing broad dispersal. However, their highest density in the Baltic Basins is found at localities with a 40-70 m bottom depth in waters with oxygen concentrations above 2 ml O-2.l(-1) and temperatures above 5 degrees C. The smallest juveniles are also found in deep sea localities down to a 100 m depth and at oxygen concentrations between 2-4 ml O-2.l(-1). The vertical, diurnally stratified and repeated trawling and hydroacoustic target strength-depth distributions obtained from the special surveys show juvenile cod concentrations in frontal zone water layers (pycnocline). However, the analyses indicate that in the CBS, juvenile cod of all sizes do not appear to aggregate in dense schooling patterns, which differs from what has been reported from the North Sea.

TI  - Effects of habitat cover, landscape structure and spatial variables on the abundance of birds in an agricultural-forest mosaic
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Numerical studies of the relationship between birds and their habitat are important because they provide understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on avian diversity. However, collinearity between explanatory variables and spatial autocorrelation can hamper the detection of key environmental factors underlying bird-environment relationships identified by traditional regression approaches. This study utilized two alternative statistical methods to address these difficulties in biodiversity modelling.
   2. We examined bird abundance patterns, spatial structure and relationship to environmental factors in an agricultural-forest mosaic landscape in Finland. We used data from 105 grid squares each 25 ha in size. Using variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning methods, we determined the independent and joint effects of habitat cover, landscape structure and spatial variables on the total number of bird pairs and that of agricultural bird pairs.
   3. The explanatory variables highlighted as important predictors of bird patterns by the two methods generally coincided well. The total number of bird pairs was negatively related to agricultural land, and positively to cover of forests and landscape heterogeneity. However, a clear majority of the explained variation in bird patterns was related to the joint effect of predictors, and the independent contributions of predictors were small. The univariate importance of landscape heterogeneity decreased greatly if the habitat cover variables were considered simultaneously.
   4. Most of the explained variation in the number of agricultural bird pairs was related to the joint effects of the explanatory variables. In addition, the independent effect of habitat cover variables was considerable and agricultural birds showed a positive relationship with semi-natural grasslands.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning approaches provide deeper insights into bird-environment relationships than traditional regression methods. This is particularly so when they are employed in a complementary manner. Our results indicate that a major part of the spatial structure in bird patterns in agricultural-forest mosaics can be caused by the clumping of habitats either preferred or avoided by birds. Moreover, at a scale of 25 ha, the abundance of bird pairs is not necessarily related to landscape heterogeneity as such, but depends more on the distribution of the most important habitats for birds.

TI  - Den Entry Behavior in Scandinavian Brown Bears: Implications for Preventing Human Injuries
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT
AB  - Encounters between Scandinavian brown bears (Ursus arctos) and humans that result in human injuries and fatalities typically coincide with den entry in October and November, and commonly occur near a den. Our aim was to determine when bears arrive at their dens, identify potential predictors of this event, document behavior and activity associated with this period, and attempt to explain the increased risk of bear-caused human injuries in this period. We analyzed global positioning system (GPS) location and activity data from brown bears in south-central Sweden, using generalized linear mixed models, statistical process control, and activity analyses. Bears arrived at their den sites between 6 October and 1 December. Timing varied by reproductive category, bear age, and year. Half of all bears significantly reduced their activity before arriving at the den area: on average 2,169m away from the den and 1.8 days before arrival. The other half reduced their activity after arriving at the den area. The latter bears took longer time to reach hibernation activity levels, but we did not find a difference in the start date of hibernation between the 2 groups. Bears also appeared to be sensitive to disturbance in this period, with higher den abandonment rates than later in winter, particularly for males and for bears that had not visited their den sites previously. Den entry occurred from October to December, with high variability and poor predictability of its timing. Therefore, restricting hunting or other recreation activities to reduce risk of injury by bears and disturbing bears probably would be both impractical and ineffective. Our findings can be used to educate hunters about bear behavior at this time of year. Many people associate dens with an increased risk of a bear responding aggressively to disturbance to defend its den, but our results indicate that other behavioral, and possibly physiological, changes in this period also may be involved.

TI  - Non-linear regional weather-growth relationships indicate limited adaptability of the eastern Baltic Scots pine
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Under changing climate, temporal and spatial stability (stationarity) of growth responses of trees to weather and climate, which has often been presumed without explicit testing, is crucial for prediction of productivity and sustainability of forests. However, considering evolutionary adaptation of tree populations to wide spatiotemporal ecological gradients, extrapolation of linear responses, which could be observed in limited parts of the gradients (certain locality), can result in biased results. Accordingly, the plasticity of responses of tree-ring width of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) to meteorological conditions across the regional climatic gradient was assessed using a mixed generalized additive model. The linear responses were assessed using a bootstrapped correlation analysis for comparison. The radial growth responses of the eastern Baltic population of Scots pine showed explicit regional gradients according to the local climates, indicating gradual shifts in the effects of winter temperature and summer moisture regime. Accordingly, temperature in late-winter and summer, as well as summer water deficit were identified as the main regional drivers of tree-ring width. Their effects were generally non-linear, indicating explicit spatiotemporal gradients in growth responses in the mid-part of species distribution. This also implied limited efficiency of simple linear models for the assessment of radial growth under moderate conditions. The responses to summer temperature indicated local optima, while the responses to drought index showed threshold values. The responses to winter temperature indicated positive effect of warming on growth. In some stands, specific non-stationary responses though were evident, suggesting that trees have adapted (specialized) to certain local climatic conditions, which are changing and thus explaining temporal shifts in growth responses. Nevertheless, the estimated responses suggested phenotypical adaptability limits of the eastern Baltic populations of Scots pine in a longer term, supporting the necessity of climate-smart management for sustainability of forest in the region in the future.

TI  - Public-Private Partnership Models for Science, Technology, and Innovation Cooperation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY
AB  - The paper looks at cooperation models for science, technology, and innovation with clear aims at delivering value and progress in these fields. Such cooperation models have been established in various forms in many countries. One special form of cooperation is the public-private partnership which also comes in many different forms. The article is based on the analysis of 20 public-private partnerships located in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, and The Netherlands. Public-private partnerships for science, technology, and innovation have various institutional and organizational models. The common central issue of all different models is an interdisciplinary management committee consisting of both academic and industrial representatives which is responsible for the alignment of all partners' interests. In addition, public-private partnerships need carefully developed strategies and well-thought-out contractual basis in line with respective stakeholder communication. Frequently, public-private partnerships are established by a small number of partners but extended at later development stages requiring a seamless and transparent partner selection procedure. Equally important is a sustainable financial agreement which allows mid-term and long-term work by the public-private partnerships. Moreover, in the course of globalization, the regulatory requirements for publicprivate partnerships in countries and regions are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, in addition to statutory regulations, human resources, scientific excellence, and infrastructure are important determinants for locations which aim at providing attractive framework conditions for public-private partnerships. Finally, it must be noted that two different research cultures meet in public-private partnerships: Synergies have to be found between basic academic research and applied industrial research, and they have to be used for mutual added value. Before establishing publicprivate partnerships formally, particular attention must be paid to so-called competing values. These must be regulated in a contract, and transparent control and sanction mechanisms must be introduced. In so doing, the mistrust associated with divergent interests (for example in relation to intellectual property rights) can be effectively prevented from the outset.

TI  - Healthcare managers' experiences of technostress and the actions they take to handle it - a critical incident analysis
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB  - Background Healthcare managers, in comparison with other healthcare professionals, have an increased likelihood of experiencing technostress at work. Since knowledge about the causes and severity of technostress and about the strategies healthcare managers use to handle it is limited, the aim of this study was to describe their experience of technostress and the actions they employ to address it. Methods An explorative design based on the critical incident technique was used. In total, 20 healthcare managers (10 women, 10 men) from four hospitals in two county councils in Sweden were purposively selected according to professional background, hierarchical management position, control span, time in the management position, and sex. Semi-structured interviews with regard to critical incidents and actions taken to handle technostress were conducted. Results Healthcare managers' experiences of technostress (n = 279) were categorised related to three main areas. These involved 'negative aspects of digital communication' (e.g. high workload, invasion of private life, and negative feelings related to digital communication), 'poor user experience of ICT systems (such as illogicality of the ICT system, time-consuming ICT system, or malfunctioning ICT system) and 'needs to improve organisational resources' (e.g. needs associated with digital literacy, user influence and distribution of work and ICT systems). Actions taken to handle technostress (n=196) were described relating to three main areas involving 'culture, norms and social support' (such as good email culture, and co-worker support), 'individual resources' (e.g. individual strategies and competence) and 'organisational resources' (such as IT-related assistance and support). Conclusions Healthcare managers described negative aspects of digital communication, poor user experience of ICT systems, and lack of organisational resources as potential technostress creators. These problems were handled by taking action related to culture, norms and social support, and individual as well as organisational resources. All these features, along with consideration of healthcare managers' job demands and resources in general, should be incorporated into actions monitored by healthcare organisations to improve or maintain a sustainable digitalised environment for healthcare managers.

TI  - Antibiotic growth promoters in animal nutrition
T2  - BERLINER UND MUNCHENER TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT
AB  - From 01. 07./09. 1999 on six further antibiotic growth promoters have been banned - with only four substances remaining in this group of feed additives. Therefore, the discussion on a possible induction of bacterial resistance by antibiotic growth promoters, especially in potentially pathogenic bacteria, will sooner or later come to an end which is not least in the interest of the reputation of animal husbandry and food of animal origin. Unfortunately, no short-term solution for health problems by legislation - especially in the gastrointestinal tract - during rearing and the beginning of the fattening period is possible as experiences in Sweden have distinctively shown. Anyway, growth promoting feed additives were not a cure-all of rearing problems, in spite of their use considerable amounts of antibiotics were prescribed during this period. But growth promoters (especially chinoxalines) were most suitable for the prophylaxis of a microbial imbalance in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, after the ban of these effective representatives of feed additives the amount of prescribed antimicrobial drugs for metaphylaxis and therapy should be critically observed. The questions of practicable alternatives will be primarily addressed to the fields of animal nutrition, veterinary medicine and feed industry. To answer these questions and to evolve new solutions (as well as to check their suitability in practice) is considerably more intricate than simply to ban these substances which is more attractive for the media, however. It is no progressive solution to give up antimicrobial growth promoters as feed additives and to use the same substances (for example olaquindox) as therapeutics now (prescribed by veterinarians) or to switch to zincoxide or copper (in a dosage high above all nutrient requirements) in order to prevent postweaning problems due to E. coli. But one has to take into consideration the reasons for the use of antibiotics (growth promoters and therapeutics) or other "aids" (e.g. ZnO, Cu) in food producing animals (especially in beef-cattle, pigs and poultry) in "modern" production systems. The matter for conflict is the contrast between a minimised use of antimicrobial substances, as science as well as general public demand, and the requirements of ''modern" livestock industry (rationalisation, increase in performance, specialisation, concentration) and general economy (save of resources, lowering of production costs). These well-known and expected problems arise in an almost exemplary manner in the case of antibiotic growth promoting feed additives. Therefore it is most difficult to impart suggestions to the persons involved as well as to the public.

TI  - Public Sector Platforms going Open: Creating and Growing an Ecosystem with Open Collaborative Development
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON OPEN COLLABORATION (OPENSYM)
CP  - 16th International Symposium on Open Collaboration (OpenSym)
AB  - Background: By creating ecosystems around platforms of Open Source Software (OSS) and Open Data (OD), and adopting open collaborative development practices, platform providers may exploit open innovation benefits. However, adopting such practices in a traditionally closed organization is a maturity process that we hypothesize cannot be undergone without friction.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate what challenges may occur for a newly-turned platform provider in the public sector, aiming to adopt open collaborative practices to create an ecosystem around the development of the underpinning platform.
   Method: An exploratory case-study is conducted at a Swedish public sector platform provider, which is creating an ecosystem around OSS and OD, related to the labor market. Data is collected through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement.
   Results: Findings highlight a fear among developers of being publicly questioned for their work, as they represent a government agency undergoing constant scrutiny. Issue trackers, roadmaps, and development processes are generally closed, while multiple channels are used for communication, causing internal and external confusion. Some developers are reluctant to communicate externally as they believe it interferes with their work. Lack of health metrics limits possibilities to follow ecosystem growth and for actors to make investment decisions. Further, an autonomous team structure is reported to complicate internal communication and enforcement of the common vision, as well as collaboration. A set of interventions for addressing the challenges are proposed, based on related work.
   Conclusions: We conclude that several cultural, organizational, and process-related challenges may reside, and by understanding these early on, platform providers can be preemptive in their work of building healthy ecosystems.

TI  - Modern pollen-vegetation relationships along an altitudinal transect in the central Pyrenees (southwestern Europe)
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - Modern proxy-calibration studies are a powerful tool for paleoecological interpretation. This paper analyzes the relationships among modern pollen rain, vegetation and altitude in the central Pyrenees, where several paleo-palynological studies have been developed, but a modern analog survey is still unavailable. The work analyzes the pollen content of moss polsters from different vegetation communities along an altitudinal transect, as well as the flora and vegetation using the Braun-Blanquet system. DCCA showed that altitude satisfactorily explains both vegetation (r(2) = 0.988) and pollen (r(2) = 0.841) gradients. Besides the complexity of pollen-vegetation relationships, some regularities were found to be useful for paleoecological and paleoenvironmental interpretation. In general, altitudinal vegetation and pollen patterns show similarities, but pollen belts and boundaries are less well defined, likely because of the homogenizing effect of upward wind transport. Palynological differentiation of montane from subalpine/alpine belts is straightforward from the trends of the more significant pollen types, mainly the low-altitude deciduous trees and the high-mountain herbs. Palynological differences between subalpine and alpine belts, which boundary coincides with the treeline, are more subtle and need quantitative criteria and complementary proxies. From an individual point of view, four main groups of pollen were distinguished, in relation to their usefulness as vegetation and altitudinal indicators: (1) very good indicators, (2) good indicators, (3) non indicators, and (4) allochthonous pollen types. The first two groups resulted to be useful as indicator taxa for modern analogs for paleovegetational and paleoaltitudinal reconstruction, while the latter two groups should be interpreted with caution in paleoenvironmental studies.

TI  - Effects of interspecific competition from surrounding vegetation on mortality, growth and stem development in young oaks (<i>Quercus robur</i>)
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Facilitation by a neighboring woody understory has been suggested as a cost-effective and sustainable way to regenerate oaks. However, concerns about reduced plant growth and quality due to competing neighboring vegetation have hindered implementation. Here we studied competitive effects from herbaceous and woody vegetation on survival, growth, canopy development and stem quality in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) in an open-field experiment in southern Sweden. Oaks were grown for eight years in four different competition treatments: no competing vegetation, with herbaceous vegetation (mainly grasses), with woody vegetation, and with both herbaceous and woody vegetation. During the first four years, competition had little effect on oak survival. However, after eight growing seasons, survival rates decreased to about 20% for oaks surrounded by woody vegetation, in contrast to oaks grown with only herbaceous vegetation that had a survival rate of near 100%. Competition from herbaceous and woody vegetation both reduced oak stem diameter and height growth, but they affected height growth differently. During the first growing seasons, oaks in the treatment with woody vegetation were able to keep up with the height growth of the surrounding vegetation. Thereafter, height growth stagnated, and after eight growing seasons heights of oaks in the treatment with woody competitors were only 30-39% that of oaks in the treatment without competing vegetation. In contrast, competition from herbaceous vegetation only restricted oak height development marginally. Interspecific competition not only restricted growth and survival but also shifted shoot architecture, resulting in a greater frequency of oaks with straight monopodial stems. Although competition from both herbaceous- and woody vegetation positively affected stem straightness, plots with woody vegetation had a greater proportion (0.42) of oaks with a single straight monopodial stem. Our results demonstrate that the facilitative competitive effects from herbaceous and woody vegetation could be used to control allocation patterns in young oaks, promoting development of tall straight monopodial stems. Considering the observed trade-off between high stem quality and survival, we recommend long-term assessment of this trade-off prior to application in practical forestry. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - From banal to everyday nationalism: narrations of nationhood
T2  - GEOGRAPHY
AB  - We encounter the nation on a daily basis, often in unnoticed ways, but ways that nonetheless communicate ideas and ideals of nationhood to us. Nationalism remains an incredibly powerful force, not only in 'hot' moments of conflict or crisis, but also in the pervasive daily communication of identity, history and values. These communications are often understood as taking the form of banal or everyday nationalism. This article reflects on how such processes continually (re)create narratives of belonging and nationhood, and the role of language, landscape and material culture in 'flagging' national identities to citizens. Crucially, these practices are not just inherently political and power-laden (in other words they may be banal, but they are not benign), they are also subject to contestation and challenge as competing visions of the nation are narrated.

TI  - Measures to Prevent Environmental Corruption Crimes
T2  - JURNAL CITA HUKUM-INDONESIAN LAW JOURNAL
AB  - The international conference on the environment which was held in Stockholm, Sweden in 1972 to Rio de Janeiro 1992, to Rio + 10 in Johannesburg 2002, emphasized the need for coordination and integration between natural resources, human resources, and artificial resources in every national development, with a population, development approach, and the environment to the integration of social, economic and environmental aspects. The Government of Indonesia is committed to carrying out sustainable development with various efforts, one of which is the issuance of environmental permits. The environmental damage that occurs in the region, is the responsibility of local governments as a whole from the existence of the authority to issue permits granted. Corruption in the environmental sector is a barrier to the path of sustainable development. Licensing is one of the instruments to prevent natural damage as well as controlling environmental management activities. But on the other hand, licensing is a fertile ground for corrupt practices that hinder sustainable development. The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of the importance of supervision of licensing for the creation of the concept of environmentally sustainable development. The research method used is a normative juridical research method that is descriptive analysis through doctrinal law review. It can be concluded that environmental problems and obstacles that occur in the licensing sector are often mixed with corrupt practices by the government which has the authority to give permits. This has caused delays in sustainable development and damage to the environment which has an impact on the community's economic sector.

TI  - The greening of financial markets
T2  - FINANCE FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT: TESTING NEW POLICY APPROACHES
CP  - 5th Expert Group Meeting on Finance for Sustainable Development
AB  - Since the 1970s, public awareness of environmental problems has led to environmental laws based on command and control regulations. Another important development which harnesses market forces efficiently has been the development of environmental liability legislation.. Environmental liability has made risks real for companies and investors. Although it has made for losses, it has also created significant business opportunities for innovative companies With, good management. Hence the emergence of corporate environmentalism. Leading corporations are adopting environmentalism and corporate social responsibility as drivers of brand differentiation, product development and competitive advantage.
   Though the financial community has been a laggard, particularly as regards investment portfolios, some major banks, insurers and investment managers are now at the point of making the further business link from corporate, environmentalism to sustainable finance. Sustainable finance will mean not only that investors will disinvest in some stocks they would otherwise hold but also that they will seek out and be overweight in firms which are eco-efficient and gain competitive advantages through good environmental and social practices and image.
   This process is being accelerated by government acting in creative ways. One way is demand creation through reporting legislation which obliges pension funds to state their policy on socially responsible investment; for example, recent UK legislation. Another way is the application of environmental screening to government-controlled funds, for example, as being considered by the Ministry of Finance for the Norwegian Petroleum Fund.
   In short, in the US and Europe we are beginning to see the outlines of a virtuous circle, connecting public concerns, environmental legislation, corporate environmentalism and financial markets. The concept of fiduciary responsibility is, in the,process of, being. expanded to include the broader interests of the owners of capital, beyond short term profit maximization at any social or environmental cost.
   This paper describes, this process, identifies particular barriers to sustainable finance in developing markets, and on this basis proposes policies and instruments for surmounting these barriers, including the introduction of appropriate liability legislation, the adoption of environmental reporting requirements for initial public offerings and listed companies; the introduction of expanded fiduciary responsibility for pension funds; the introduction of environmental and social screening for government funds; and the creation of investment objects designed for international investors which,satisfy certain sustainable finance criteria.

TI  - Potential of Energy Willow Plantations for Biological Reclamation of Soils Polluted by <SUP>137</SUP>Cs and Heavy Metals, and for Control of Nutrients Leaking into Water Systems
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Willow is a low-maintenance crop that has potential for energy production and enhancing the local environment. The area of commercial plantations of willow in Europe is mostly concentrated in Sweden, with more than 20 000 ha. Willow trees are used not only for energy production, but also for reclamation of polluted soils because a plantation may grow for 20-25 years, with a three-year period of harvesting. Our research covers issues of reclamation of soils contaminated by radionuclides and heavy metals, and decreasing of eutrophication of water ecosystems with using willow plantations. The field studies of phytoremediation of soil contaminated by Cs-137 by willow plants were conducted in eastern Belarus, in the area where agricultural activity was banned after Chernobyl disaster. This region is heavily polluted with Cs-137 (from 185 to 555 kBq/m(2)) and heavy metals. The transferring factors of accumulated Cs-137 and heavy metals from the soil to willow biomass were determined. The field experiments showed that willow does not accumulate actively Cd and Pb, but it accumulates Zn, Cu and Mn intensively. The potassium application decreases the accumulation of Cs-137 in willow biomass and increases accumulation of Cu, Zn and Mn, but has no influence on accumulation of Cd and Pb. Our results confirmed that soils polluted with radionuclide and heavy metals could be used for willow cultivation as energy crop, if adequate management is applied. The different potential of the willow species concerning heavy metals accumulation was also established. The yield of willow biomass on polluted soils achieved 11.5-12.8 DMg ha(-1)per year, depending on variety, that is competitive with the ordinary yield of willow on mineral fertile soils. Willow plantations also may be used for accumulations of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in watersheds. It enables to decrease impact for water ecosystems and to control eutrophication.

TI  - Wheat Yield Estimation at High Spatial Resolution through the Assimilation of Sentinel-2 Data into a Crop Growth Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - Monitoring crop growth and estimating crop yield are essential for managing agricultural production, ensuring food security, and maintaining sustainable agricultural development. Combining the mechanistic framework of a crop growth model with remote sensing observations can provide a means of generating realistic and spatially detailed crop growth information that can facilitate accurate crop yield estimates at different scales. The main objective of this study was to develop a robust estimation methodology of within-field winter wheat yield at a high spatial resolution (20 m x 20 m) by combining a light use efficiency-based model and Sentinel-2 data. For this purpose, Sentinel-2 derived leaf area index (LAI) time series were assimilated into the Simple Algorithm for Yield Estimation (SAFY) model using an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The study was conducted on rainfed winter wheat fields in southern Sweden. LAI was estimated using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 data with semi-empirical models. The enhanced two-band vegetation index (EVI2) was found to be a useful VI for LAI estimation, with a coefficient of determination (R2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.80 and 0.65 m2/m2, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the assimilation of LAI derived from Sentinel-2 into the SAFY model using EnKF enhances the estimation of within-field spatial variability of winter wheat yield by 70% compared to the baseline simulation without the assimilation of remotely sensed data. Additionally, the assimilation of LAI improves the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation by decreasing the RMSE by 53%. This study demonstrates an approach towards practical applications of freely accessible Sentinel-2 data and a crop growth model through data assimilation for fine-scale mapping of crop yield. Such information is critical for quantifying the yield gap at the field scale, and to aid the optimization of management practices to increase crop production.

TI  - Variation in the nutritional composition of farmed Atlantic salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i> L.) fillets with emphasis on EPA and DHA contents
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS
AB  - The increase in the global popularity and production of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) has led to compositional changes in their feeds that can potentially diminish their nutritive value. Thus, the aim of the study was to compare the lipid, protein, fatty acid (omega-3) and mineral contents of salmon fillet portions available in the UK and estimate their contribution towards consumer dietary intake levels. Twenty pre-packaged fresh salmon fillets, encompassing all ranges (value, standard, premium and organic) and farmed origins (Scotland and Norway) were purchased from 10 main UK-wide retailers and analysed for their nutritional compositions. Lipid contents were between 11.2-16.3 % wet weight (ww), except the Retailer 10 value product which was significantly lower due to a high proportion of tail pieces. No difference in protein contents (17.5-20.2 % ww) were observed between fillets. However, fatty acid profiles showed marked variations between samples with marker fatty acids 18:1n-9 (24.3-42.0 %), 18:2n-6 (8.3-15.1 %) and 18:3n-3 (2.6-8.1 %) reflecting the differing levels of vegetable oil inclusion and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA, 5.6-16.6 %) indicating the level of marine oils included within salmon feeds. Consequently, EPA + DHA contents varied from 0.88 to 2.36 g EPA + DHA.130 g(-1) flesh ww, equivalent to supplying 26-67 % of the recommended 3.5 g EPA + DHA weekly intake suggested for optimal cardiac health in adults. Similarly, selenium contents differed significantly between samples delivering between 13.9-55.5 % and 17.3-69.3 % of the 75 and 60 mu g day(-1) UK intake for males and females, respectively. Additionally, EPA + DHA and selenium contents were both affected by farmed origin, reflecting differences in production strategies of the two salmon producing nations. Overall, the study highlights the contrasting nutritional profiles of farmed salmon fillets available to consumers based on retailer requirements (healthy versus sustainable product) and how this can affect the recommended dietary intakes from a human nutrition perspective.

TI  - Climate change and dietary choices - how can emissions of greenhouse gases from food consumption be reduced?
T2  - FOOD POLICY
AB  - Results from an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption during the life-cycle of carrots, tomatoes, potatoes, pork, rice and dry peas consumed in Sweden are presented and discussed. The life-cycle is delineated to the part of the production chain prior to purchase by the consumer. The study shows that emissions, expressed in g CO2 equivalents, are highest for pork and rice and lowest for potatoes, carrots and dry peas. The most important stages of emissions in the life-cycle are identified for each of the different food items, Crop farming is the most important stage for rice and tomatoes while rearing of animals is the most important stage for pork and storage is the most important stage for carrots. Comparison with an energy analysis shows that important stages in the life-cycle of food may be under-evaluated when energy only is accounted for. This may lead to a sub-optimisation of pollution control exemplified by the case of transportation. Also, it is shown that the choice of functional unit has a decisive influence on the outcome of the study. The recommendation is to compare whole meals, or diets with the same nutritional qualities. A comparison of four meals composed of the food items under analysis shows that a meal with tomatoes, rice and pork has nine times higher emissions than a meal made from potatoes, carrots and dry peas. Emissions of greenhouse gases from consumption patterns based on the food items analysed are compared with an assumed sustainable limit of greenhouse gas emissions. The conclusion is that current food consumption patterns in the developed countries exceed the level of sustainability by at least a factor of 4, Prospects for achieving sustainable food consumption patterns are questionable in view of current trends in food demand.

TI  - The position of home-care nursing in primary health care: A critical analysis of contemporary policy documents
T2  - NURSING INQUIRY
AB  - Internationally, primary health care has in recent years gained a more central position in political priorities to ensure sustainable health care for the population. Thus, more people receive health care locally and in their own homes, where home-care nursing plays a large role. In this article, we investigate how home-care nursing is articulated and made visible in contemporary Norwegian policy documents. The study is a Fairclough-inspired critical discourse analysis seeking to uncover the position of nursing in the prevailing political ideologies on current primary health care. In the documents, we identified several complementary and conflicting understandings about home-care nursing. Home-care nursing is presented as a basic part of a municipality's health services, but at the same time, its content and contribution are unclear and almost invisible. We argue that the absence of nursing leads to significant perspectives being left out and tie this to the fact that some patient groups and tasks seem to be disadvantaged. The political placement of home-care nursing in the health-care landscape is thus not just about nursing as a professional practice but also concerns fundamental care values in our society in relation to disadvantaged groups and work tasks.

TI  - The Importance of Adopting a Safe System Approach-Translation of Principles into Practical Solutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The 1990s saw the emergence of the Swedish Vision Zero and the Dutch Sustainable Safety philosophies on road safety. At the time, both were considered somewhat radical and ambitious departures from the status quo. The principles that underpinned both the Dutch and Swedish philosophies were combined into an internationalized form, now known more widely as the Safe System. The Safe System came to attention early in the 2000s, when formally adopted by a number of countries committed to preventing severe road trauma. The Safe System defines a new way of thinking about road safety compared with what had commonly been used around the world in the decades before its conception. The Safe System strives to eliminate death and severe injury from the world's roads. It also underlines the importance of the safe management of kinetic energy and system-based design that seeks to ensure that crashes are prevented or, at worst, crash forces fall within the threshold of human tolerance to severe injury. Once this thinking is embraced by the system designer, new solutions begin to emerge, and existing designs can be seen in a different, more insightful light. The process of transitioning to the ambitious, ethically based philosophy of the Safe System, as a means of addressing the risks of using our roads, has not happened smoothly or quickly. Practitioners have had difficulty in translating the philosophy and principles of the Safe System into practice. It is hoped that by providing examples of the differences in decisions made under Safe System principles when designing and operating roads, large gains will be made toward the lasting elimination of road trauma. A major focus of the discussion is on the Safe System-aligned design of infrastructure, coupled with vehicle operating speeds, while also recognizing the contributions to risk reduction that can come from improved human performance and the evolving safety features and technologies of modern vehicles.

TI  - Long-term simulation of the eutrophication of the North Sea: temporal development of nutrients, chlorophyll and primary production in comparison to observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
AB  - The ecosystem model ERSEM II has been used to hindcast the development of the ecosystem of the North Sea during the years 1955 to 1993. The simulation was driven by the box-aggregated output from a general circulation model of the North Sea of corresponding duration; radiation, river inputs, atmospheric input and boundary conditions at the borders to the Atlantic Ocean and to the Baltic Sea were applied as realistically as possible. The general features of the eutrophication process are reproduced in the hindcast: the coastal areas show strong changes in nutrient concentrations in the hindcast as well as in the observations. Eutrophication not only shows up in the nutrient concentrations, but also in primary production. The simulated spatial distributions of phosphate, nitrate and primary production compare well with the observed ones. In addition, the hindcast simulates considerable trend-like changes of the nutrients in the southern part of the North Sea, where the nutrients are transported from the continental coastal strip to the southern central North Sea. The line from the river Humber to southern Norway separates the region of noticeable anthropogenic influence of riverine and atmospheric input from the northern area, which is mainly influenced by the Atlantic nutrient inflow. The observed annual cycles in the central and northern North Sea are quite well reproduced by the hindcast. The comparison of the hindcast with the long-term observations at two sites in the continental coastal zone of the North Sea shows that the long-term behaviour of phosphate, nitrate and silicate is simulated well. Primary production is increased in summers during the main period of eutrophication, 1975 to 1989, in the hindcast and in the observations. The flagellates at Helgoland, however, experience much more pronounced annual cycles with much less interannual variability in the hindcast than in the observations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Long-term impacts of repeated cover cropping and cultivation approaches on subsoil physical properties
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - The intensification of arable agriculture has resulted in an increase in vehicle wheel load and the intensity of field operations, which has increased the risk and incidence of degradation in physical properties of the uncultivated subsoil layer. Biopores generated by the long-term, repeated use of specific cover crops within an arable rotation has been suggested as an approach to improve subsoil physical properties. Therefore, this paper aimed to determine the impact of long-term repeated cover cropping and the interaction of rotation treatments with different cultivation approaches on subsoil physical properties. Data was collected at the NIAB 'Sustainable Trial for Arable Rotations' long-term, rotation and cultivation field experiment established in 2006. Rotation treat-ments comprised a brassica cover crop alternated annually with winter wheat (ALTCC) compared to continuous winter wheat (CWW). Cultivation treatments comprised PLOUGH (250 mm depth), and non-inversion cultivation at 250 mm (DEEP) and 100 mm (SHALLOW) depths. Penetration resistance and volumetric soil moisture were collected at bi-monthly intervals during the 2018/19 growing season. Undisturbed soil cores were collected for laboratory analyses of soil water retention, water stable aggregates, root morphology digital scanning and biomass, and X-ray computed tomography (CT). Results showed that treatment ALTCC combined with SHALLOW, resulted in lower penetration resistance and increased moisture in the subsoil. This increased subsoil moisture persisted later into the season compared to the control. SHALLOW increased subsoil water retention, improved subsoil root morphology and increased subsoil porosity. Benefits from treatment ALTCC were not observed where combined with higher intensity, deeper cultivation. Overall, the combination of treatments ALTCC with SHALLOW, produced significant benefits to subsoil physical properties.

TI  - Putting Your Head in the Tiger's Mouth: Submarine Espionage in Territorial Waters
T2  - COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW
AB  - Incidents by suspected Russian submarines spying in Swedish and Finnish waters in 2014 and 2015, and the ample history of such incidents over the past sixty-five years involving Chinese, British, North Korean, American, and Soviet (and Russian) submarines, suggest undersea spying occurs with some regularity, yet the political and legal consequences are uncertain. While submarine intrusions into the territorial sea are not uncommon, the legal standards that govern such operations and the rights and duties of affected coastal states are murky.
   First, although it is apparent that submarine espionage violates the sovereignty of the coastal state in the territorial sea, it is unclear whether the operations are inconsistent with the law of the sea, or even international law more generally. Certainly undersea operations and spying in territorial waters without coastal state consent are not compatible with the regime of innocent passage in the law of the sea, but it is unclear whether they are lawful as "non-innocent" passage. Second, even if the affected coastal state has suffered a violation of its sovereignty, there is disagreement over lawful coastal state responses or countermeasures. Although the law of the sea recognizes coastal state prescriptive jurisdiction over vessels not in innocent passage in order to "require" them to leave the territorial sea, the authority to enforce such measures especially against warships with sovereign immune status is unresolved. Third, it is doubtful whether states may take recourse to forceful action or invoke the doctrine of self-defense against submarine intrusions, even though several states appear to have done so.
   These issues have particular salience in the Asia-Pacific region, where regional states are invested in development and expansion of submarine fleets. Sophisticated undersea technologies are entering service in states situated along an arc that stretches from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean in the west to Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia in the east. Many of these states, such as those surrounding the South China Sea, are engaged in fierce maritime disputes. The lack of consensus concerning the legal standards of submarine espionage, combined with a lack of operational naval acumen and simmering maritime rivalries, raises the risks of conflict.
   The Article presents a roadmap of legal issues associated with submarine espionage in the territorial sea, and the conclusions will tend to generate greater confidence, predictability, and stability at sea. While submarine espionage does not appear to be inconsistent with the law of the sea, espionage in the territorial sea is injurious to the sovereignty of the coastal state. In response to such incursions, coastal states may, without impinging on their sovereign immune status, require submarines to leave the territorial sea. The use of force in self-defense, however, may not be invoked by the coastal state to compel compliance.

TI  - Measuring sustainability at farm level-A critical view on data and indicators
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
AB  - Measuring sustainability at farm level is a priority for both research and policy and requires sustainability indicators to track progress. Indicators make the sustainability concept more concrete and guide farm level decisions, playing a decisive role in determining food system impacts on societies and the environment. Data availability is often a limiting factor when choosing indicators, but not enough attention is paid to the role of data in indicator construction and assessment results. This paper assessed the critical role of data in indicator construction and the potential limitations that current data availability imposes on farm-level sustainability assessments, using the example of dairy farms in Sweden. To do so we used a five-step approach consisting of a literature review, an inventory of data sources, an expert consultation, a matching and gap analysis, and a critical assessment. We found that 20 indicators categorized under 12 out of 20 sustainability themes had measurement issues due to missing scope, temporary data, or additional data requirements. At least some indicators within all themes in the social and economic dimensions were measureable, while all indicators for pesticides, nonrenewable energy, and soil quality in the environmental dimension had measurement issues. In the critical assessment, we argue that for some indicators, there are trade-offs between data availability and issues of comprehensibility and analytical validity. Furthermore, we found that no single data source could be used to measure all themes; which means that merging of different data sets is needed for a broader on-farm sustainability assessment. Our findings are relevant for the discussion on sustainability indicators and will also inform future programs aimed at collecting sustainability data at farm level, which should consider the broad data needs identified, and the potential to merge data to enable holistic sustainability assessments.

TI  - Sensory qualities of whole wheat pan bread - influence of farming system, milling and baking technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF CEREAL SCIENCE
AB  - Organic wheat production has increased in Sweden, and there is a need to describe the quality of the final product. To optimize utilization of alternatively grown wheat for human consumption, it is necessary to understand the effects of crop and processing variation on the sensory qualities of the final product. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of farming systems, milling technique, and variation in formulation on the sensory attributes of whole wheat pan bread. Six samples of wheat (Triticum aestivum, variety Kosack) from field trials, three grown in conventional farming systems and three in organic farming systems (biodynamic and ecological), were roller- and stone-milled, respectively. Breads were baked according to an experimental design in which two levels of flour and two levels of kneading were also included. Sensory analysis, achieved through a descriptive profiling test, was conducted with eight trained assessors using 19 sensory attributes for 48 different bread types in two replicates. Image analysis was used to establish the slice area of the breads. Milling technique had a greater impact on the sensory qualities of bread and on the slice area than did farming system and baking technique. Conventional wheat had lower protein and ash contents, but higher volume weight than did the organic wheat. Damaged starch, extensographic values (R-m, E) and farinographic values for water absorption, dough development time and dough stability were higher for roller-milled samples than for the stone-milled. Whole meal breads of roller-milled wheat were dominated by sweetness, juiciness and compactness attributes, whereas those from stone-milled wheat were characterized by saltiness, deformity and roasted cereal attributes. The six wheat samples revealed that variation in breads' sensory qualities was larger for the three organic samples than for the three conventional samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Amplifying actions for food system transformation: insights from the Stockholm region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB  - Food is essential to people and is one of the main ways in which people are connected to the world's ecosystems. However, food systems often cause ecosystem degradation and produce ill-health, which has generated increasing calls to transform food systems to be more sustainable. The Swedish food system is currently undergoing substantial change. A varied set of local actors have created alternative sustainability initiatives that enact new ways of doing, thinking, and organizing. These actors can increase the transformative impact of their initiatives through multiple actions and a variety of amplification processes. We analyzed the actions adopted by 29 food initiatives active in the Stockholm region using information available online. We conducted 11 interviews to better understand the amplification processes of speeding up (i.e., accelerating impact), scaling up (i.e., influencing higher institutional levels), and scaling deep (i.e., changing values and mind-sets). Our results indicated that the initiatives mainly seek to stabilize and grow their impact while changing the awareness, values, and mind-sets of people concerning the food they consume (scaling deep). However, these approaches raise new questions about whether these actions subvert or reinforce current unsustainable and inequitable system dynamics. We suggest there are distinct steps that local and regional governments could take to support these local actors via collaborations with coordinated forms of initiatives, and fostering changes at the municipality level, but these steps require ongoing, adaptive approaches given the highly complex nature of transformative change and the risks of reinforcing current system dynamics.

TI  - Registered nurses' experiences of their decision-making at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NURSING
AB  - Aims and objectivesTo describe registered nurses experiences at an Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre.
   BackgroundIt is important that ambulances are urgently directed to patients who are in need of immediate help and of quick transportation to a hospital. Because resources are limited, Emergency Medical Dispatch centres cannot send ambulances with high priority to all callers. The efficiency of the system is therefore dependent on triage. Nurses worldwide are involved in patient triage, both before the patients arrival to the hospital and in the subsequent emergency care. Ambulance dispatching is traditionally a duty for operators at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres, and in Sweden this duty has become increasingly performed by registered nurses.
   DesignA qualitative design was used for this study.
   MethodsFifteen registered nurses with experience at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres were interviewed. The participants were asked to describe the content of their work and their experiences. They also described the most challenging and difficult situations according to the critical incidence technique. Content analysis was used.
   ResultsTwo themes emerged during the analysis: Having a profession with opportunities and obstacles' and Meeting serious and difficult situations', with eight sub-themes. The results showed that the decisions to dispatch ambulances were both challenging and difficult. Difficulties included conveying medical advice without seeing the patient, teaching cardio-pulmonary resuscitation via telephone and dealing with intoxicated and aggressive callers. Conflicts with colleagues and ambulance crews as well as fear of making wrong decisions were also mentioned.
   ConclusionsWork at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres is a demanding but stimulating duty for registered nurses.
   Relevance to clinical practiceGreat benefits can be achieved using experienced triage nurses, including increased patient safety and better use of medical resources. Improved internal support systems at Emergency Medical Dispatch centres and striving for a blame-free culture are important factors to attract and retain employees.

TI  - Signatures of selection reveal candidate genes involved in economic traits and cold acclimation in five Swedish cattle breeds
T2  - GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION
AB  - Background Thousands of years of natural and artificial selection have resulted in indigenous cattle breeds that are well-adapted to the environmental challenges of their local habitat and thereby are considered as valuable genetic resources. Understanding the genetic background of such adaptation processes can help us design effective breeding objectives to preserve local breeds and improve commercial cattle. To identify regions under putative selection, GGP HD 150 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used to genotype 106 individuals representing five Swedish breeds i.e. native to different regions and covering areas with a subarctic cold climate in the north and mountainous west, to those with a continental climate in the more densely populated south regions. Results Five statistics were incorporated within a framework, known as de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) to detect signatures of selection. The obtainedp-values were adjusted for multiple testing (FDR < 5%), and significant genomic regions were identified. Annotation of genes in these regions revealed various verified and novel candidate genes that are associated with a diverse range of traits, including e.g. high altitude adaptation and response to hypoxia (DCAF8,PPP1R12A,SLC16A3,UCP2,UCP3,TIGAR), cold acclimation (AQP3,AQP7,HSPB8), body size and stature (PLAG1,KCNA6,NDUFA9,AKAP3,C5H12orf4,RAD51AP1,FGF6,TIGAR,CCND2,CSMD3), resistance to disease and bacterial infection (CHI3L2,GBP6,PPFIBP1,REP15,CYP4F2,TIGD2,PYURF,SLC10A2,FCHSD2,ARHGEF17,RELT,PRDM2,KDM5B), reproduction (PPP1R12A, ZFP36L2,CSPP1), milk yield and components (NPC1L1,NUDCD3,ACSS1,FCHSD2), growth and feed efficiency (TMEM68,TGS1,LYN,XKR4,FOXA2,GBP2,GBP5,FGD6), and polled phenotype (URB1,EVA1C). Conclusions We identified genomic regions that may provide background knowledge to understand the mechanisms that are involved in economic traits and adaptation to cold climate in cattle. Incorporatingp-values of different statistics in a single DCMS framework may help select and prioritize candidate genes for further analyses.

TI  - Critical review of the research on the management of prefabricated construction
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - As a sustainable construction method, prefabricated construction is increasingly being adopted worldwide to enhance productivity and to alleviate the adverse environmental and social effects as a result of conventional construction activities. In addressing management issues of prefabricated construction, an impressive number of studies have been published by internationally renowned journals related to construction management over the past decades. However, it seems that a systematic summary on the research development in the management of prefabricated construction (MPC) discipline is lacking. Therefore, this paper examines the latest research trend in this discipline by analyzing published construction management research in 10 leading journals during the period from 2000 to 2013 (as of end of June) in terms of the annual number of MPC papers, contributions of institutions, adopted data collection and processing methods, and research interest. The analysis reveals that prefabrication is becoming increasingly important to the entire construction industry. Researchers from developed countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, Sweden, and Australia, have made significant contributions to the development of the prefabrication domain, while those from developing countries, including China, Turkey, and Israel where construction remains as their main economic activity, have shown increasing interest in promoting prefabrication-related research. Major research topics in MPC include "industry prospect", "development and application", "performance evaluation", "environment for technology application", and "design, production, transportation and assembly strategies". Moreover, some innovative technologies, such as Global Position System (GPS), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), have been effectively applied in this field and are considered as strong vehicles in improving the performance of future prefabricated construction practices. This study is of value in helping scholars gain an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art of MPC research and allows them to continue from the findings of previous studies.

TI  - Comparative analysis of energy costs on farms in the European Union: A nonparametric approach
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - A rational and efficient use of the various sources of energy available to farms allows, not only for cost cutting, but also, a reduction in the environmental impacts bringing positive externalities and contributions toward sustainability. Of course, this efficiency depends on several factors that may influence the dynamics and performance of the farms in question which may also change spatially between countries and regions. These questions related to the great diversity of realities in the agricultural sector are especially relevant within the European Union (EU) context. In this framework, the main objective of the research presented here is to make an efficiency analysis of energy costs in farms across EU countries and regions, stressing possibilities of savings and taking into account the several realities. For this purpose, data at farm level from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) was considered for the period 2014 e2016 which were then explored through the nonparametric approach Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). For the nonparametric analysis the Cobb-Douglas model was considered as a base. In this way, the total production (euros) was considered as output. Paid labour (hours), the total fixed assets (euros) and the energy costs (euros) were considered as inputs. In an alternative attempt to take into account the different realities across the EU countries the statistical information in monetary units was corrected by the Price Level Indices and was deflated by the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices. Furthermore, to alternatively consider the diversity of contexts of the farms from the EU, the several regions and countries here were clustered through cluster analysis, after factor analysis so as to avoid problems of collinearity. As main insights, it is worthy of stressing the possibilities of significantly reducing the costs of energy consumption in farms from many EU regions. For example, it is possible to reduce the costs of energy use by about 55% in Pohjanmaa (Finland), 53% in Cyprus, 56% in Makedonia-Thraki (Greece), 52% in Thessalia (Greece), 56% in Puglia (Italy) and 53% in Basilicata (Italy). In these contexts the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) should play a determinant role. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Critical challenges in implementing sustainable transport policy in Stockholm and Gothenburg
T2  - CITIES
AB  - This paper explores the mental-models of Swedish planners in order to understand the extent to which they support the ideals of sustainable transport. Focussing on three critical challenges: forecast-led versus vision-led planning; tackling congestion; and, public acceptability; the findings, drawn from in-depth interviews, demonstrate mostly advanced thinking. However, implementation can be at odds with these mental models, highlighting important lessons for other cities. There is a disconnect between the objectives of reducing car use and the continuation of investments in increasing road capacity, and a difficulty in transitioning from forecast-led planning to back-casting. Political controversies and public acceptability for measures to decrease car use are an added challenge.

TI  - Accounting for littoral primary production by periphyton shifts a highly humic boreal lake towards net autotrophy
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - The prevailing view that many humic lakes are net heterotrophic is commonly based on pelagic measurements alone. Poor light conditions in humic lakes are assumed to constrain littoral primary production (PP), such that the littoral zone has been considered an insignificant contributor to whole-lake PP. However, that assumption is based on models and inferences from pelagic processes which do not take littoral zone structure into account. Many lakes have an extensive ring of aquatic vegetation lying near the water surface, which provides substratum for epiphytic algae under well-illuminated conditions. We measured both pelagic and littoral PP and community respiration (CR) in Mekkojarvi, a small, highly humic headwater lake, in southern Finland throughout the open water season in 2012. We used a C-14 incorporation technique to measure pelagic PP, while littoral PP was determined using changes in dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations during insitu incubations. We then estimated whole-lake PP and CR for both the littoral and pelagic zones. We found that littoral PP usually dominated whole-lake PP, contributing >90% to total PP in summer. A mean pelagic production to respiration ratio (GPP:CR) of 0.4 clearly indicated strong net heterotrophy, but a value of 2.2 for the littoral zone indicated strong autotrophy. For both habitats combined, the mean whole lake GPP:CR was 1.6, indicating net autotrophy. We suggest that littoral PP can contribute significantly to whole-lake PP even in highly humic lakes, and that the littoral contribution can shift some lakes which have been considered net heterotrophic to metabolic balance or even net autotrophy during the ice-free period. Small humic lakes like Mekkojarvi with rings of littoral vegetation are widespread, especially in the boreal zone, and at least for similar lakes, evaluating lake metabolism from pelagic measurements alone is likely to be misleading.

TI  - Structural vulnerability of a sandy loam exposed to intensive tillage and traffic in wet conditions
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
AB  - Sustainable soil management requires that the structural degradation is balanced or exceeded by regeneration. Our objective was to investigate the vulnerability of topsoil structure to stress exerted by intensive tillage or traffic. The study addressed the short-term stability to disturbance as well as the recovery (resilience) within a year. A field experiment was conducted in a randomised block design on a humid sandy loam in 1997-1999. Each year, either compaction from a heavy tractor (PAC) or puddling by intensive rotary cultivation (PUD) produced a severe impact on topsoil structure. The PAC and PUD treatments were carried out on wet soil in early spring. The mechanical treatments were referenced by plots (REF), which were left undisturbed until the :;oil had dried to a friable condition and ready for seedbed preparation. The PAC and PUD treatments were prepared for sowing at the same time as the reference plots. Penetration resistance was recorded in the spring of 1998 and 1999 to a depth of 200 mm. Soil was sampled from the 0-40 mm layer in May 1998 and in March, May and November 1999. The soil was air-dried and separated into four aggregate size fractions. The aggregates were subjected to tensile strength and density measurements. The penetration resistance in the 0-200 mm layer ranked in the order PAC much greater than PUD > REF. Both mechanical treatments significantly increased the density of 4-8 mm aggregates. One or 2 months after the mechanical treatments, they had increased tensile strength relative to REF by 44 and 33% in 1998 and by 13 and 33% in 1999 for the PAC and PUD treatments, respectively. Thus, our result showed substantial topsoil degradation when exposed to the PAC and PUD treatments. i.e. the sandy loam showed low stability. In November 1999, the PUD-treated aggregates were still markedly stronger than those found in the REF soil. Hence, the PUD-treated soil showed little resilience within a 6-month summer period. There was no significant difference in aggregate tensile strength between the treatments in March 1999 after a winter with cycles of freezing and thawing and a mouldboard ploughing operation in early spring. Our results thus imply that soil degradation induced by soil compaction or intensive rotary cultivation early spring may reduce the ease of tillage in the following autumn, whereas little residual effect can be expected in the following spring.

TI  - Let's do those 60 minutes! Children's perceived landscape for daily physical activity
T2  - SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY
AB  - In a scientific effort to understand the reasons for low physical-activity levels among children, there is a need to consider how children perceive and interact with their complex environments holistically. This study outlines an image of the perceived landscape within which children in two lower-socioeconomic contexts engage in daily physical activity. By applying bioecological perspectives (Bronfenbrenner, U. 2005. Making human Beings human: Bioecological perspectives on human development. SAGE), the aim included an analysis of how the perceived landscape and its interrelated factors influence children's physical activity. We used 15 focus-group interviews with children (n = 63, ages 8-13) from four different rural and suburban areas of southern and central Sweden. Through analyzing the children's stories about their experiences of everyday physical activity from a bioecological perspective, an image of a complex landscape was revealed. Structural (schools' institutional frameworks), cultural (local sports cultures), and environmental factors (e.g. schoolyard design) were evident in interpersonal relations within the microsystem and interacted with personal characteristics, primarily gender and level of physical competence and, thereby, affected the possibilities of the children engaging in proximal processes related to physical activity. This study contributes new qualitative understanding based on children's voices about how the performance of daily physical activity among younger children (ages 7-13) in lower-socioeconomic areas may be considered an interactional process between individuals and their perceived environment, which can be thought of as a multidimensional landscape. Implications include actions which contribute to more diverse environments enabling proximal processes among a broader group of children.

TI  - Well to wheel analysis of low carbon alternatives for road traffic
T2  - ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
AB  - Several alternative fuel-vehicle combinations are being considered for replacement of the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the dependence on fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency has proposed the inclusion of low carbon alternatives such as electricity, hydrogen and biofuels in the transport sector for reducing the GHG emissions and providing a sustainable future. This paper compares the use of these alternative fuels, viz. electricity, hydrogen and bio-ethanol in combination with battery electric vehicle (BEV) and fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technologies on the basis of their overall efficiency and GHG emissions involved in the conversion of the primary energy source to the actual energy required at wheels through a well-to-wheel analysis. The source of energy for electricity production plays a major role in determining the overall efficiency and the GHG emissions of a BEV. Hence electricity production mix of Germany (60% fossil fuel energy), France (76% nuclear energy), Sweden and Austria (60 and 76% renewable energy, respectively), the European Union mix (48% fossil fuel energy) and the United States of America (68% fossil fuel energy) are considered for the BEV analysis. In addition to the standard hydrogen based FCEVs, CNG and bioethanol based FCEVs are analysed. The influence of a direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) on GHG emissions and overall chain efficiency is discussed. In addition to the standard sources of bio-ethanol (like sugarcane, corn, etc.), sources like wood waste and wheat straw are included in the analysis. The results of this study suggest that a BEV powered by an electricity production mix dominated by renewable energy and bio-ethanol based DEFC electric vehicles offer the best solution in terms of GHG emissions, efficiency and fossil fuel dependency. Bio-ethanol as a fuel has the additional advantage to be implemented readily in ICE vehicles followed by advancements through reformer based FCEVs and DEFC electric vehicles. Although important, this analysis does not include the health effects of the alternative vehicles. Bio-ethanol used in an ICE may lead to increased emission of acetaldehydes which however might not be the case if it is used in fuel cells.

TI  - Design of an autarkic water and energy supply driven by renewable energy using commercially available components
T2  - DESALINATION
CP  - 5th Conference on Desalination Strategies in South Mediterranean Countries (EuroMed 2006)
AB  - Around the world there are a lot of remote coastal areas suffering from natural drinking water resources and a lack of energy. These locations ask for new innovations for an environmentally friendly solution represented by the combination of RO desalination plants and renewable energy sources like wind. But how to combine a desalination plant with fluctuating energy source like wind? How to "store" energy? Are the components already applied in practice and commercially available? What about the costs? The R&D department of ENERCON did a lot of work in this field and brings the 3 important components together: wind energy converters (WEC), RO desalination plants and "stand-alone" systems for energy management. Related to wind energy, the ENERCON WECs are well known for their performance and quality. The R&D department also developed new innovations in the design of RO desalination plants: The ENERCON Energy Recovery System for very low energy consumption, high flexibility, efficient combination with fluctuating energy sources and no use of chemicals. In belongings to the third important field, energy storing and stand alone systems ENERCON developed a system which provides 100% energy supply by wind energy all over the year on the island Utsira in Norway for 2 years now. Aiming at the goal of sustainable development these systems fulfil all requirements for environmentally friendly and economic operation: no use of fossil fuels and therefore no CO, emissions/no use of chemicals and therefore no negative impact to the marine environment.

TI  - A differential multi-criteria analysis for the assessment of sustainability performance of European countries: Beyond country ranking
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Sustainable development as a concept that aims to enhance the quality of life without affecting environment has been in focus in European policies since the last decade of 20th century. The objectives of EU Sustainable Development Strategy (EU SDS) are grouped into ten thematic areas, where almost each theme has at least one headline and several operational sustainable development indicators (SDIs). A large number of SDIs is needed to evaluate all EU SDS goals, which imposes the use of multivariate data mining techniques. This paper presents an empirical study carried out to assess the sustainability performance of European countries using the differential multi criteria analysis (DMCA) technique. The PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization MeTHod for Enrichment Evaluations) was applied on 38 headline and operational SDIs defined under the EU SDS. This DMCA was applied to 30 European countries over a 10-year period (2004-2014) with the aim to determine the theme specific, as well as, overall sustainability progress. The DMCA reveals that the majority of European countries have made progress in sustainability in the studied period, where Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary and Sweden, have enhanced their sustainability performance concerning all themes. There are only two countries, namely Greece and Ireland, which have not made overall progress in this period. Also, above the average progress has been made concerning social inclusion, sustainable transport, and climate change and energy, while in all other themes additional efforts should be made in order to ensure sustainable performance progress in future years. Although the progress in reducing uneven development between EU members has been made, after 2009 a positive trend can be observed only in a limited number of SDS themes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Marine protected areas rescue a sexually selected trait in European lobster
T2  - EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS
AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly implemented worldwide to maintain and restore depleted populations. However, despite our knowledge on the myriad of positive responses to protection, there are few empirical studies on the ability to conserve species' mating patterns and secondary sexual traits. In male European lobsters (Homarus gammarus), the size of claws relative to body size correlates positively with male mating success and is presumably under sexual selection. At the same time, an intensive trap fishery exerts selection against large claws in males. MPAs could therefore be expected to resolve these conflicting selective pressures and preserve males with large claws. We explored this hypothesis by contrasting claw size of males and females in three pairs of MPAs and nearby fished areas in southern Norway. By finding that male lobsters have up to 8% larger claws inside MPAs compared to similarly sized males in fished areas, our study provides evidence that MPAs rescue a secondary sexual trait. Recovery from harvest selection acting on claws is the most likely explanation; however, the higher abundance of lobster inside MPAs does not rule out a plastic response on claw size due to increased competition. Regardless of the underlying cause, our study demonstrates (a) the value of protected areas as a management tool for mitigating fisheries-induced evolution and (b) that MPAs help maintaining the scope for sexual selection in populations with vulnerable life histories and complex mating system.

TI  - The occurrence and distribution of carabid beetles (Carabidae) on islands in the Baltic Sea: a review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION
AB  - The distribution and occurrence of carabid beetles have been studied extensively in a number of archipelagoes in the Baltic Sea, a ca. 377,000 km(2), fairly shallow and young sea in northern Europe. This work has revealed some surprising results related to colonisation success and maintenance of populations. Dispersal from the mainland and between islands appears to be relatively easy because inter-island distances are small (tens or hundreds of metres) and the salinity of the Baltic is low, which allows survival during drift. This is reflected in the higher than expected proportion of brachypterous species on small islands. A lack of energetically expensive wings, flight muscles and flight fuel may give brachypterous species an advantage - in terms of resource allocation for survival and fecundity - over macropterous species in the colonisation of an island. Once an island is reached, successful colonisation mainly depends on the presence of suitable habitat. The most abundantly collected carabids on these islands are habitat generalists, but some degree of habitat association exists. Yet, the composition of carabid assemblages differs substantially among islands, possibly a result of chance effects. There is evidence that species on smaller islands occur in a wider variety of vegetation types than species on larger islands. Both habitat diversity and area per se are implicated in the positive species-area relationships found, but the small island effect has been identified as being significant in most of the archipelagoes investigated. Pterostichus melanarius, a eurytopic, wing-polymorphic species abundantly collected on the mainland is, unexpectedly, absent from small islands. Possible reasons for this include; (1) interspecific predation and competition for food by the closely related but slightly larger P. niger, which is dominant on small islands, (2) the apparent inability of P. melanarius to reproduce on small islands, (3) its reduced dispersal power as compared to P. niger and (4) the possible absence of some essential resources from small islands. In conclusion, the conservation value of highly threatened cultural landscapes on Baltic Sea islands, such as species rich wooded meadows, is discussed as well as the possible negative effects of climate change on carabid beetles.

TI  - New investment strategies in the modem electricity distribution business - Reliability in the long-term planning
T2  - 2007 IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING, VOLS 1-10
CP  - IEEE-Power-Engineering-Society General Meeting
AB  - The reliability requirements and the role of the supervisory authority in the electricity distribution business have grown strongly in the past few years. Electricity distribution companies are forced to consider new investment strategies to meet the challenges arising from the new operational environment. Aged electricity networks are subject to the more challenging weather conditions. To meet the new requirements, the traditional line extension approach is no longer an acceptable and sustainable planning method.
   There are various new technical solutions and methods to develop electricity networks. In this paper, different kinds of electricity distribution investment strategies in the modern business environment are studied. Strategies are based on several new technical innovations successfully implemented in Finnish electricity distribution companies. Methods such as roadside networks, 1000 V low voltage system, underground cables and low-cost primary substations are exploited successfully in the long-term planning process.

TI  - Understanding element distribution during primary metal production
T2  - GREEN PROCESSING 2006
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Sustainable Processing of Minerals and Metals
AB  - The selection and design of process options to deliver outcomes consistent with sustainable development requires simultaneous consideration of multiple objectives, within a climate of uncertainty including the environmental and social aspects of technology management in addition to the technical and economic aspects of such. An issue of particular relevance in primary metal production is the deportment of minor and trace components within orebodies, products and wastes and the implications of such deportment for eco-efficiency in particular, the long-term environmental impact of solid waste management practices. The identification of opportunities to enhance recovery of valuable by-products and simultaneously improve the environmental acceptability of final waste output requires a clear understanding of the distribution of the relevant ore components, which results from the choice of processing route and unit operation efficiency. This is challenging, given that process streams generated during primary metal production are generally poorly characterised and the behaviour and deportment of trace to minor and trace components is not well understood.
   This paper demonstrates how current data gaps and inconsistencies can be systematically addressed through the meaningful reconciliation of empirical plant data with a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms and parameters influencing element behaviour and deportment during the formation and subsequent beneficiation of mineral ore deposits. On this basis, quantitative distribution data and a comprehensive and comprehensible inventory of unit process inputs and outputs as a function of ore compositions and processing technology options can be generated, which is consistent with early design stage information requirements, both in terms of detail and accuracy, ie is 'first-order' in nature. This predictive approach to element distribution during primary metal production provides decision-makers with key information in the early design stages of a project (in terms of developing processes within the context of sustainability), whilst simultaneously guiding further data collection and environmental impact prediction studies.

TI  - Efficacy of different clearing saw methods in biological sprout control in birch (<i>Betula pendula</i> [roth] and <i>B. pubescens</i> [Ehrh.]) compared to manual and mechanized application
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The efficiency of young stand management can be improved by preventing stump sprouting of unwanted hardwoods in conifer plantations allowing reducing the number of repeated pre-commercial thinning operations. A biological sprouting control using a decay fungus, Chondrostereum purpureum, is an environmentally-friendly option due to its ability to decay stumps and thus prevent sprouting when applied on stump surfaces. The aim of this study was to investigate the biological sprout control efficacies of four different clearing saw methods, a lightweight mini-harvester Tehojatka and a separately done manual treatment, and to compare their efficacies to control (cutting only). In addition, the possible effect of the hot blade of a clearing saw on the viability of C. purpureum was studied, and time and inoculum consumption were determined. The study was conducted in eight forest regeneration areas of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] H. Karst) with naturally grown birch (Betula pendula [Roth] and B. pubescens [Ehrh.]) seedlings. After two growing seasons, mortality was highest in the manual fungal treatment (43.3%) and lowest with the Tehojatka (16.0%) whereas in the control it was only 4.7%. The manual fungal treatment and the clearing saw methods that sprayed the inoculum directly on stump surfaces were more effective (nozzle at the side of blade, stump mortality 36.0%; nozzle at the stem of a clearing saw, 26.9%) than those methods that sprayed the inoculum on the blade (nozzle under the blade, 22.9%). The automatically functioning clearing saw (fungal inoculum is spread only when touched on the stem of a sapling) resulted in the poorest mortality rate (16.0%). The hot blade of a clearing saw slightly decreased the number of colony forming units of C. purpureum in fungal inoculum, but in practice there were still a sufficient number of colony forming units for biological sprout control. The manual fungal treatment consumed the least amount of inoculum and was thus the most accurate. However, it was also the most time-consuming option due to the double work (separate cutting of saplings and the application of inoculum), and therefore would hardly be selected for a practical sprout control. Tehojatka showed the highest consumption of inoculum, and that in the clearing saw methods was also at an unacceptable level. Thus, improvement in the accuracy will be needed to reduce the consumption before the clearing saw or mechanized fungal treatment methods can be used as commercially sustainable solutions for the biological control of hardwood sprouting.

TI  - Wood Ash Application Reduces Bryophyte Cover and Changes Species Composition in a Norway Spruce (<i>Picea abies</i>) Plantation
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Return of wood ash from power plants to plantations makes it possible to recycle nutrients, counteract acidification, and to reduce economically costly waste deposition of the wood ash. However, current legislation restricts the amount of wood ash that can be applied and it is desirable to increase the allowed application dose, if possible, without negative effects on the plantation ecosystems. Here, we applied wood ash in levels corresponding to 0, 3, 9, 15, 30, and 90 t ash ha(-1) and monitored the effect of the different ash doses on bryophytes in a Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantation with a dense bryophyte cover dominated by Hypnum jutlandicum, Dicranum scoparium, and Pleurozium schreberi. We used two complementary methods, image analysis, and pinpoint registration during a three-year period. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply this combined effort, which provides a much more exhaustive description of the effects than the use of each method separately. Moreover, the inclusion of a wide range of different wood ash levels enabled us to establish detailed dose-response relationships, which previous authors have not presented. The bryophyte cover decreased with increasing ash level with concomitant changes in species composition. At ash doses above the currently allowed 3 t ha(-1), the ash significantly reduced the bryophyte cover, which only re-established very slowly. With increasing wood ash dose, the dominating species changed to Brachythecium rutabulum, Ceratodon purpureus, and Funaria hygrometrica. We conclude that application of more wood ash in spruce plantations than currently allowed will reduce total cover of bryophytes and cause a pronounced change in bryophyte species composition. These changes will in particular harm bryophyte species with specific environmental requirements and generally impair the bryophyte cover as habitat for invertebrates and its economic value for moss harvesting.

TI  - Managers' Attitudes to Different Action Proposals in the Direction to Extended Working Life: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - In many countries, the retirement age is postponed due to the global demographic change, and a larger amount of older people need to participate in working life. However, how and what measures and action proposals that could extend and increase employees' voluntary and sustainable participation in working life have not entirely been investigated. The employer is responsible for enabling employees' access to measures that facilitate participation in the workplace, for enabling employability and a sustainable extended working life. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate Swedish managers' attitude to action proposals that could increase employees' participation in an extended working life. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate associations between different univariate estimates and in data modelling. The nine determinate areas of the swAge model, for a sustainable working life and employability, was used as analysis model, i.e., self-rated health and diagnoses; physical work environment; mental work environment; work schedule, work pace and time for recuperation; financial incentives; personal social environment; social work environment; stimulation, motivation and self-crediting through work tasks; and competence, skills and knowledge development. The results stated decreased physical work demands to be the final measure in the multivariate modelling associated to whether the managers believe their employees 'can work' until age 65 and older, however, changing work tasks in the workplace when needed, rotation between different work tasks to decrease physical as well as mental workload and strain, and decreased mental work demands proved to be statistically significant in the univariate estimates. The strongest measure activity in the organisations, associated to managers believing their employees 'want to work' until age 65 and older in the multivariate modelling, was decreased work pace, however, increased time for recuperation between work shifts also proved to be statistically significant in the univariate estimate. The management's perspectives on measures and action proposals associated to whether employees 'can' and 'want' to work will hopefully contribute to an increased understanding in society and the organisational process of creating a sustainable extended working life.

TI  - AN INTERNATIONAL APPROACH TO ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK WITHIN COLLABORATIVE DIGITAL MEDIA PROJECTS
T2  - 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)
CP  - 5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - Background
   The Intercultural Design Camp (ICDC) is a collaboration between the Schools of Creative Practice of four European higher education institutions: Linkoping University, Sweden; The University of the West of Scotland; Stuttgart Media University, Germany and Artevelde University College Ghent, Belgium.
   Emerging from the development of a joint post-graduate proposal, the ICDC project has grown. Piloted in 2009 in Muensingen, Germany as a one-week summer school, the focus of the project was intended to strengthen internalization between the students and staff of the partner Universities. Working to a given theme, and collaborative creative briefs, student participants developed and produced multimedia solutions and artefacts [1].
   This pilot was very successful and acted as a catalyst to staff and student Erasmus exchange and the sharing of best practice in Learning, Teaching and Assessment between the partners. A second self-funded 'pilot' camp was planned and undertaken in Dumfries, Scotland in 2010. Discussions continued regarding the extension of the ICDC project to become a two-week event in order to allow student participants the time to develop and produce an extended piece of cross-media product [1].
   The cost for realizing an extended concept would be high. An application for funding within the EU Life-Long-Learning-Programme was successfully made. A third, this time EU funded Design Camp took place in Grebbestad (Sweden) in August 2011 [2]. Further EU funding allowed realizing a fourth ICDC in Kemmel, Belgium, August 2012.
   Learning Teaching, Assessment and Feedback
   The content of the ICDC is designed to extend and further the student's abilities and participation in contemporary methods and practices associated with creative media practice and convergent production. At the camp, and in response to given thematic briefs, an International group of students with divergent backgrounds and skill-sets, come together in small creative teams to develop and produce a collaborative project in which a range of ideas, experience and technologies converge. These Collaborative Projects often have an on-line output, whether through products devised for streaming, pod-casting or interactive broadcast. An innovative variety of projects are encouraged. These could include digital photography and the moving image, interactive design and performance, site-specific installations and exhibitions.
   Students are also encouraged to experience contemporary creative context within the areas of practice while at the camp. This is delivered via lectures given by the visiting and host staff. Students are also encouraged to evaluate the benefits of a variety of production approaches and techniques. The project addresses the interface between research and practice in creative media practice and encourages participants to gain solid experience of working in interdisciplinary creative teams.
   With every run of the Intercultural Design Camp the objectives and expectations have been raised. In the first run, as already mentioned, the main intention was to bring together students and teachers from different European Countries to work and live together in order to foster the internationalization. The second run had mainly the same approach but the intensiveness of the experience has been increased by strengthen the aspect of cooperative international work. The focus of the third camp was on the one hand to switch from solely conceptual work to additional productive activities and on the other hand to incorporate internet-based international cooperation prior to the camp. Therefore the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) Moodle has been chosen as base tool and first experiences have been gained through the Grebbestad camp [2]. Generally the intensification of the digital cooperation in the preliminary stage of the camp and particularly the integration of the camp into the student records have been the main aspects of this years' Intercultural Design Camp. To give frequent and helpful feedback to the students and to assess their work at the end of the camp are the crucial aspects in this respect, but doing this with international groups from quite different educational and cultural systems and also different grading systems is a quite challenging task.

TI  - Musa Jarullah Bigiyef and the Islamic Congresses (1926-1931)
T2  - HITIT THEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Musa Jarullah Bigiyev (1875-1949) was born in Rostov city of Kazan. He studied in Bukhara, Egypt, Hijaz, and India. He is a scholar that devoted his life to Islamic sciences and various religious, political, social, and cultural issues of Muslims. He wrote works in many fields such as Qur'anic sciences, Tafsir,.adith, Kalam, Fiqh, Usul al-Fiqh, Sirah, Islamic History, and Arabic language, and literature. He participated in several national and international meetings on various intellectual and political problems of the society that he lived in and the Islamic world. The first of these congresses, which took place between May 13-19.1926 following the Turkish Grand National Assembly abolished the caliphate with the Law No. 431 dated March 3, 1340 (1924), was the Caliphate Congress convened in Cairo (al-Mu'tamar al-Islami al-Amm li al- Khilafa). It was proposed by the representatives of Egyptian religious education institutions - especially the administrators of al-Azhar- in response to this decision. Musa Jarullah was invited to this meeting by the Egyptian congress organization committee, but he was not able to attend the meeting, as he was not given an entry visa, again, by the Egyptian authorities. Some people claimed that Musa Jarullah was an opponent of the Bolshevik administration in Russia and giving him an entry visa to Egypt could have potentially put Egypt in a collision course with Russia. In an effort to avoid such a situation, the Egyptian authorities, it is further claimed, did not issue a visa to Musa Jarullah. In this article, we demostrate that the claim in question does not fully reflect the truth, and that the primary reason why Musa Jarullah was not given a visa was not because Egypt was afraid of Russia; but rather, the primary reason behind this should be sought, we argue, in his opposition to the Egyptian administration under the British shadow, the possibility of the election of the Egyptian King Fuad (1868-1936) as the "New Islamic Caliph", and the general approach of the scholars of al-Azhar to the caliphate. We tried to analyze Musa Jarullah Bigiyef's views on the Islamic caliphate in general and the Ottoman caliphate in particular as well as the approaches the scholars of al-Azhar and Egyptian officials who organized this meeting adopted towards the caliphate. The second congress discussed here is the World Muslim Congress (alMu. tamar al-.alam al-Islami), which was held in Mecca between June 7 - July 5, 1926. Considering the transportation possibilities of the time period, this congress, which was organized in a way that conflicted with the Caliphate Congress held in Egypt in terms of time, was a meeting held by Abd al-Aziz Ibn Sa.ud (1880-1953), who declared himself as the King of Hejaz, in an effort to consolidate his legitimacy in the Islamic world. In this congress, some practical and domestic issues related to public order such as the reconstruction of the Hejaz region, especially Mecca and Medina, and the improvement of the pilgrimage organization were discussed. Musa Jarullah Bigiyef attended this congress, albeit somewhat late due to visa problems, he and expressed his views on some issues by taking the floor several times. The last congress to be examined in the article is the General Islamic Congress ((al-Mu'tamar al-alam al- Islami al-Amm), which was held in Jerusalem between December 7-17, 1931.

TI  - Environmental impacts of alternative antifouling methods and use patterns of leisure boat owners
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT
AB  - Purpose Leisure boaters in the Baltic Sea apply more copper as antifoulant than needed and permitted. Initiatives have been started to identify efficient means making boat owners comply with regulations through changed consumer behavior. We compare the environmental impacts of conventional and alternative antifouling methods, using Life Cycle Assessment methodology.
   Methods Two non-toxic methods were compared with biocide paint. To study the influence of boat owner use patterns, paint and brush washer scenarios (e.g., different paints, amounts, and maintenance) were created based on current use and recommendations. The functional unit was an average Swedish leisure boat kept fouling free for 1year and impact categories studied were freshwater eco-toxicity and greenhouse gas emissions. Production of paints, fuel, electricity, and material used in the non-toxic methods was included. Sensitivity analysis was performed regarding the characterization method for toxicity, the fuel consumption data, and the copper release data.
   Results and discussion The non-toxic methods, hull cover and brush washer, performed best, but a trade-off was identified when the brush washer was located further away from the home port, when additional transportation increased greenhouse gas emissions. The resources needed for the non-toxic methods (production of materials and electricity used) cause considerably lowertoxic emissions than paint. In the paint scenarios, using less paint and cleaning the boat over a washing pad with water treatment reduces aquatic emissions significantly. Fuel-related emissions were consistently lower than paint-related emissions. In the best-performing paint scenario, fuel- and paint-related emissions represented 26 and 67% of total emissions, respectively.
   Conclusions The non-toxic methods hull cover and brush washers lead to lower emissions, especially when brush washers were located close to the home port. Lacking such infrastructure, painting less is a way to reduce emissions, by using lower amounts of paint and painting less frequently. More widespread use of these antifouling strategies would considerably reduce copper emissions from leisure boating to the Baltic Sea. We suggest that support to marinas for investments in brush washers and washing pads should be further developed to enable boat owners to choose more sustainable antifouling methods and that information campaigns on the combined economic, health, and ecosystem impacts of antifouling are especially designed for boaters, marinas, market actors, and policy makers for a change to take place towards more sustainable practices.

T2  - HITIT THEOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Musa Jarullah Bigiyev (1875-1949) was born in Rostov city of Kazan. He studied in Bukhara, Egypt, Hijaz, and India. He is a scholar that devoted his life to Islamic sciences and various religious, political, social, and cultural issues of Muslims. He wrote works in many fields such as Qur'anic sciences, Tafsir,.adith, Kalam, Fiqh, Usul al-Fiqh, Sirah, Islamic History, and Arabic language, and literature. He participated in several national and international meetings on various intellectual and political problems of the society that he lived in and the Islamic world. The first of these congresses, which took place between May 13-19.1926 following the Turkish Grand National Assembly abolished the caliphate with the Law No. 431 dated March 3, 1340 (1924), was the Caliphate Congress convened in Cairo (al-Mu'tamar al-Islami al-Amm li al- Khilafa). It was proposed by the representatives of Egyptian religious education institutions - especially the administrators of al-Azhar- in response to this decision. Musa Jarullah was invited to this meeting by the Egyptian congress organization committee, but he was not able to attend the meeting, as he was not given an entry visa, again, by the Egyptian authorities. Some people claimed that Musa Jarullah was an opponent of the Bolshevik administration in Russia and giving him an entry visa to Egypt could have potentially put Egypt in a collision course with Russia. In an effort to avoid such a situation, the Egyptian authorities, it is further claimed, did not issue a visa to Musa Jarullah. In this article, we demostrate that the claim in question does not fully reflect the truth, and that the primary reason why Musa Jarullah was not given a visa was not because Egypt was afraid of Russia; but rather, the primary reason behind this should be sought, we argue, in his opposition to the Egyptian administration under the British shadow, the possibility of the election of the Egyptian King Fuad (1868-1936) as the "New Islamic Caliph", and the general approach of the scholars of al-Azhar to the caliphate. We tried to analyze Musa Jarullah Bigiyef's views on the Islamic caliphate in general and the Ottoman caliphate in particular as well as the approaches the scholars of al-Azhar and Egyptian officials who organized this meeting adopted towards the caliphate. The second congress discussed here is the World Muslim Congress (al-Mu'tamar al-alam al-Islami), which was held in Mecca between June 7 - July 5, 1926. Considering the transportation possibilities of the time period, this congress, which was organized in a way that conflicted with the Caliphate Congress held in Egypt in terms of time, was a meeting held by 'Abd al-'Aziz Ibn Sa'ud (1880-1953), who declared himself as the King of Hejaz, in an effort to consolidate his legitimacy in the Islamic world. In this congress, some practical and domestic issues related to public order such as the reconstruction of the Hejaz region, especially Mecca and Medina, and the improvement of the pilgrimage organization were discussed. Musa Jarullah Bigiyef attended this congress, albeit somewhat late due to visa problems, he and expressed his views on some issues by taking the floor several times. The last congress to be examined in the article is the General Islamic Congress ((al-Mu'tamar al-alam al- Islami al-Amm), which was held in Jerusalem between December 7-17, 1931.
   The Mufti of Jerusalem, al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni (1897-1974) organized this congress in an effort to discuss some of the political and economic issues the Islamic world was facing such as developing the feelings of unity and brotherhood among Muslims, defending the Palestinian lands against the Jews, whose numbers were increasing day by day through emigration, establishing an Islamic university in Jerusalem and repairing the Hejaz railway. Musa Jarullah attended this congress as the representative of Chinese Turkistan and Finnish Muslims. The present work provides with a detailed analysis of Musa Jarullah Bigiyef's participation in the aforementioned congresses, his negotiations in these congresses, and his evaluations about them, and it also makes an effort to correct some of the misconceptions regarding these issues.

TI  - Artificial intelligence to predict West Nile virus outbreaks with eco-climatic drivers
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
AB  - Background In Europe, the frequency, intensity, and geographic range of West Nile virus (WNV)-outbreaks have increased over the past decade, with a 7.2-fold increase in 2018 compared to 2017, and a markedly expanded geographic area compared to 2010. The reasons for this increase and range expansion remain largely unknown due to the complexity of the transmission pathways and underlying disease drivers. In a first, we use advanced artificial intelligence to disentangle the contribution of eco-climatic drivers to WNV-outbreaks across Europe using decade long (2010-2019) data at high spatial resolution. Methods We use a high-performance machine learning classifier, XGBoost (eXtreme gradient boosting) combined with state-of-the-art XAI (eXplainable artificial intelligence) methodology to describe the predictive ability and contribution of different drivers of the emergence and transmission of WNV-outbreaks in Europe, respectively. Findings Our model, trained on 2010-2017 data achieved an AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) score of 0.97 and 0.93 when tested with 2018 and 2019 data, respectively, showing a high discriminatory power to classify a WNV-endemic area. Overall, positive summer/spring temperatures anomalies, lower water availability index (NDWI), and drier winter conditions were found to be the main determinants of WNV-outbreaks across Europe. The climate trends of the preceding year in combination with eco-climatic predictors of the first half of the year provided a robust predictive ability of the entire transmission season ahead of time. For the extraordinary 2018 outbreak year, relatively higher spring temperatures and the abundance of Culex mosquitoes were the strongest predictors, in addition to past climatic trends. Interpretation Our AI-based framework can be deployed to trigger rapid and timely alerts for active surveillance and vector control measures in order to intercept an imminent WNV-outbreak in Europe.

TI  - Comparison of airborne LiDAR and shipboard acoustic data in complex shallow water environments: Filling in the white ribbon zone
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
AB  - Shallow coastal areas of oceans, seas and lakes pose significant remote sensing and navigational challenges due to the transient nature of bathymetric features that characterize these areas (e.g., shoals and shoaling). Seabed data/ maps often represent these areas as "white ribbon" zones, where sparse data coverage presents a particular challenge to defining and enforcing sustainable use of marine resources. Given the lengthy perimeter of coastlines, there is a need for cost-efficient methods for producing high resolution maps of shallow areas. The research described here compares airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) with shipboard acoustic surveys around the Kvarken Archipelago of the northern Baltic Sea.
   The Kvarken Archipelago includes a unique, brackish shallow water marine environment with a number of moraines. The landscape of the area is characterised by fields of ridged, washboard-like De Geer moraines. The moraines combined with an ongoing glacio-isostatic uplift typical of the area, lead into succession of the elevated structures from the seafloor to land, where present seabed structures will rise on land in future. The ongoing modification of the environment by both climatic and geologic forces contributes to complex geomorphic and ecological feedback systems operating on a range of spatial and temporal scales.
   Airborne LiDAR can provide high resolution remote sensing data on shallow coastal areas. The technology is especially effective in areas with very shoal waters, like those found along the Finnish coast. LiDAR enables continuous detection of topographic (elevation) and bathymetric (depth) data and can thus generate continuous maps of transition zones between continental and marine areas. Environmental conditions such as water clarity and ice cover can affect LiDAR depth detection capabilities: these conditions require complementary accuracy assessment strategies. As LiDAR cannot determine detailed information on seafloor surface substrate, and anything on subsurface substrate type, geological conditions are determined through the application of acoustic-seismic. methods, sediment sampling and underwater video.
   Data from LiDAR surveys provide a detailed topographic and bathymetric map of the study area up to water depths of 14 m. The seabed bathymetry model shows a series of elevated, narrow, elongate features that appear throughout the study area. These parallel ridges represent the uppermost geomorphic features of the seafloor. Interpretation of acoustic bathymetric surveys indicates that these ridges are De Geer moraines. The general orientation of these moraines differs from that associated with older features of the northern Kvarken Archipelago. Eroded remnants of older De Geer moraines are overprinted at a high angle by the younger landforms. De Geer moraines in the study area thus represent two phases of deglaciation and finally the eastward ice-sheet/ice edge retreat. The combined approach of using LiDAR and acoustic bathymetric data provides new insights into past glacial dynamics of the Kvarken Archipelago and the Gulf of Bothnia.

TI  - Climate change performance of hydrogen production based on life cycle assessment
T2  - GREEN CHEMISTRY
AB  - Hydrogen has the potential to revolutionize how we power our lives, from transportation to energy production. This study aims to compare the climate change impacts and the main factors affecting them for different categories of hydrogen production, including grey hydrogen (SMR), blue hydrogen (SMR-CCS), turquoise hydrogen (TDM), and green hydrogen (PEM electrolysis). Grey hydrogen, blue hydrogen, and turquoise hydrogen, which are derived from fossil sources, are produced using natural gas and green hydrogen is produced from water and renewable electricity sources. When considering natural gas as a feedstock, it is sourced from the pipeline route connected to Russia and through the liquefied natural gas (LNG) route from the USA. The life cycle assessment (LCA) result showed that grey hydrogen had the highest emissions, with the LNG route showing higher emissions, 13.9 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2, compared to the pipeline route, 12.3 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2. Blue hydrogen had lower emissions due to the implementation of carbon capture technology (7.6 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2 for the pipeline route and 9.3 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2 for the LNG route), while turquoise hydrogen had the lowest emissions (6.1 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2 for the pipeline route and 8.3 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2 for the LNG route). The climate change impact showed a 12-25% increase for GWP20 compared to GWP100 for grey, blue, and turquoise hydrogen. The production of green hydrogen using wind energy resulted in the lowest emissions (0.6 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2), while solar energy resulted in higher emissions (2.5 kg CO2 eq. per kg H2). This article emphasizes the need to consider upstream emissions associated with natural gas and LNG extraction, compression, liquefaction, transmission, and regasification in assessing the sustainability of blue and turquoise hydrogen compared to green hydrogen.
   Green H2 production reduces emissions by 80-95% compared to grey H2 thus meeting the REDII directive. However, blue and turquoise H2 fall short of meeting this criterion without CO2 sequestration.

TI  - Projected impacts of sowing date and cultivar choice on the timing of heat and drought stress in spring barley grown along a European transect
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
AB  - Barley is one of the most important cereals for animal and human consumption. Barley heading and grain filling are especially vulnerable to heat and drought stress, which are projected to increase in the future. Therefore, site -specific adaptation options, like cultivar choice or shifting sowing dates, will be necessary. Using a global climate model ensemble and a phenology model we projected spring barley heading and maturity dates for 2031-50 for climatically contrasting sites: Helsinki (Finland), Dundee (Scotland) and Zaragoza (Spain). We compared the projected future heading and maturity dates with the baseline period (1981-2010) and described corresponding heat and drought stress conditions and how they were affected by adaptation options, i.e. shifting the sowing date by + /-10-20 days, choosing early or late heading cultivars or combining both adaptation options, with agroclimatic indicators. At all sites and sowing dates, heading and maturity in 2031-50 occurred earlier (up to three weeks with earliest sowing) than in the baseline period. Along the European transect, the projected heading and grain filling periods were hotter than under baseline conditions but advancing heading alleviated heat stress notably. Different indicators signaled more severe drought conditions for 2031-50. At Helsinki, delayed heading periods were exposed to less drought stress, likely because the typical early summer droughts were avoided. At Zaragoza, fewer, yet more intense, rainfall events occurred during grain filling of the early cultivars. Only under scenario RCP4.5, heading and grain filling periods at Dundee were slightly wetter for the early cultivars. Our study provides a unique overview of agroclimatic conditions for heading and grain filling periods projected for 2031-50 along a climatic transect and quantifies the effects of different adaptations for spring barley. The approach can be extended by coupling the agroclimatic indicators with crop modelling.

Originally a dynamic feeding solution for catenaryless tramways, APS supplies electricity to vehicles at ground level by means of a segmented conductive rail installed on the road surface. Service proven in 7 tramway networks, the technology has undergone further developments to comply with other applications: the static recharge of autonomous trams and buses, as well as the dynamic feeding of road vehicles. APS is currently being tested for powering trucks on highways, as part of the ERS project included in a programme by the Swedish Energy Agency.

TI  - Predicting autumn population sizes of tetraonid game birds from reproduction data of pied flycatcher <i>Ficedula hypoleuca</i>
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Data on the breeding success of the pied flycatcher, which reflects the combined effects of various biotic and abiotic factors affecting the quality of the breeding habitat each year, could explain more than three quarters of the variation in the autumn population levels of woodland tetraonids (capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse T. tetrix) in a subalpine forest area in Lierne, central Norway, during the period 1986-1995. The applicability of a simple regression model is evaluated on the basis of the data from 1996. Much less time is required to collect these breeding parameters on the flycatcher from nest boxes than to obtain reasonably good population estimates for the tetraonid species themselves directly. Data on the production of pied flycatcher, collected well in advance of the shooting season, could be used to set bag limits for woodland tetraonids the following autumn. This might be used as a tool for sustainable harvest to avoid future over-exploitation of these species in years with predicted low production. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial lag effect of aridity and nitrogen deposition on Scots pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i> L.) damage
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is a widespread tolerant forest tree-species; however, its adaptability to environmental change differs among sites with various buffering capacity. In this study, we compared the spatial effects of aridity index (AI) and nitrogen deposition (ND) on biomass density in natural and man-made pine stands of differing soil fertility using geographically weighted multiple lag regression. Soil fertility was defined using soil series as zonal trophic (27.9%), acidic (48.2%), gleyed (15.2%) and as azonal exposed (2.5%), maple (2.4%), ash (0.8%), wet (2.1%) and peat (0.9%) under pine stands in the Czech Republic (Central Europe; 4290.5 km(2); 130-1298 m a.s.l.). Annual AI and ND in every pine stand were estimated by intersection between raster and vector from 1 x 1 km grid for years 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010 of severe non-specific forest damage spread. Biomass density was obtained from a MODIS 250 x 250 m raster using the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for years 2000-2015, with a decrease in EVI indicating non-specific damage. Environmental change was assessed by comparing predictor values at EVI time t and t+lambda. Non-specific damage was registered over 51.9% of total forest area. Less than 8.8% of damaged stands were natural and the rest (91.2%) of damaged stands were man-made. Pure pine stands were more damaged than mixed. The ND effect prevailed up to 2007, while AI dominated later. Temporal increasing ND effect under AI effectiveness led to the most significant pine stand damage in 2008 and 2014. Predictors from 2000 to 2007 afflicted 58.5% of non-specifically damaged stands at R-2 0.09-0.76 (median 0.38), but from 2000 to 2010 afflicted 57.1% of the stands at R-2 0.16-0.75 (median 0.40). The most damaged stands occurred on acidic sites. Mixed forest and sustainable management on natural sites seem as effective remediation reducing damage by ND. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Airborne fungal colonisation of coarse woody debris in North Temperate <i>Picea abies</i> forest:: impact of season and local spatial scale
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Coarse woody debris is important for mycodiversity in forest ecosystems, but its availability in managed stands is reduced. Leaving dead wood during felling is suggested as an option to sustain and restore the diversity. However, little is known what fungi would colonise freshly cut wood left on managed sites, and how the colonisation process is influenced by ecological factors. During summer and autumn, 120 freshly cut Picea abies stem sections over 8 cm in diameter were placed upright in mapped locations over two discrete plots separated by 100 m in a north-temperate forest. After seven weeks the sections were collected, and isolation and identification of fungi was done from their upper surfaces. In all 943 fungal strains were isolated, representing 97 species. Species richness in the summer survey was 42.5% higher than during the autumn survey. Low species similarity characterized the different seasons (Sorensen indices: S-S = 0.36 and S-N = 0.34) and for 21 species (22%) observation frequency was significantly affected by season. As a result, community structures in summer and autumn differed notably (z-test ; P < 0.001). Species richness between the two plots differed by less than 10%, but there were 64 species (66%) found only in one of them, thus qualitative similarity was low (S-S = 0.49). Quantitative similarity was higher (S-N = 0.63), indicating that the dominant species colonised wood to a similar extent in both areas. Fungal community structure differed significantly among the two plots (z-test; P < 0.001). Our data showed that freshly cut CWD contributed to mycodiversity in managed north-temperate forest, providing habitats for numerous individuals from over 100 species. The fungal community within a single stand differed markedly both across small distances and over the seasons. In order to sustain and enhance mycodiversity in managed stands, coarse wood should always be left during harvesting. This study also demonstrates the importance of molecular identification and ITS sequence databases for exploring fungal diversity in natural communities.

TI  - Direct and size-dependent effects of climate on flowering performance in alpine and lowland herbaceous species
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
AB  - QuestionsEffects of climate on flowering performance are often investigated independently of plant size. We ask how temperature and precipitation impact flowering probability and flower production: via direct effects, size-dependent indirect effects, changes in minimum size for flowering and/or changes in reproductive investment.
   LocationTwelve calcareous grasslands in western Norway (4 degrees 50-8 degrees 45E, 60 degrees 20-61 degrees 50N).
   MethodsThe investigations were carried out at the rear temperature edge of alpine plants and at the leading temperature edge of lowland plants to capture the variety of climate responses occurring in different parts of species climate niches within our study landscape. The study was conducted within a natural climatic grid' consisting of temperature gradients replicated along a precipitation gradient. In each study site, we sampled populations of two alpine (Viola biflora, Veronica alpina) and two lowland (Viola palustris, Veronica officinalis) species. The relative importance of each effect was assessed under a 2 degrees C increase in mean summer temperature and a 10% increase in annual precipitation.
   ResultsFlowering was climate- and size-dependent in all species except Viola palustris. Both direct climate effects and climate-driven variation in reproductive investment were detected for the three other species. Indirect climate effects were detected for Veronica officinalis, and climate-driven variation in minimum size for flowering in Viola biflora. Climatic responses were not consistent within or between distributional types (alpine vs lowland) or genera. A temperature increase of 2 degrees C was predicted to increase flower production by 22% for Veronica alpina and by 74% for Veronica officinalis. A precipitation increase of 10% had a limited impact on Viola biflora flowering probability (0.08% increase) and increased Veronica officinalis flower production by 1.7%.
   ConclusionsOur study shows that climate affects flowering performance both directly and through size dependence. Understanding such size-dependent responses to climate is important for our understanding of how climate change will affect flowering performance and recruitment in plant populations.

TI  - Species distribution models reveal apparent competitive and facilitative effects of a dominant species on the distribution of tundra plants
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - Abiotic factors are considered strong drivers of species distribution and assemblages. Yet these spatial patterns are also influenced by biotic interactions. Accounting for competitors or facilitators may improve both the fit and the predictive power of species distribution models (SDMs). We investigated the influence of a dominant species, Empetrum nigrum ssp. hermaphroditum, on the distribution of 34 subordinate species in the tundra of northern Norway. We related SDM parameters of those subordinate species to their functional traits and their co-occurrence patterns with E. hermaphroditum across three spatial scales. By combining both approaches, we sought to understand whether these species may be limited by competitive interactions and/or benefit from habitat conditions created by the dominant species. The model fit and predictive power increased for most species when the frequency of occurrence of E. hermaphroditum was included in the SDMs as a predictor. The largest increase was found for species that 1) co-occur most of the time with E. hermaphroditum, both at large (i.e. 750 m) and small spatial scale (i.e. 2 m) or co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at large scale but not at small scale and 2) have particularly low or high leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Species that do not co-occur with E. hermaphroditum at the smallest scale are generally palatable herbaceous species with low LDMC, thus showing a weak ability to tolerate resource depletion that is directly or indirectly induced by E. hermaphroditum. Species with high LDMC, showing a better aptitude to face resource depletion and grazing, are often found in the proximity of E. hermaphroditum. Our results are consistent with previous findings that both competition and facilitation structure plant distribution and assemblages in the Arctic tundra. The functional and co-occurrence approaches used were complementary and provided a deeper understanding of the observed patterns by refinement of the pool of potential direct and indirect ecological effects of E. hermaphroditum on the distribution of subordinate species. Our correlative study would benefit being complemented by experimental approaches.

TI  - Disparities in travel times between car and transit: Spatiotemporal patterns in cities
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Cities worldwide are pursuing policies to reduce car use and prioritise public transit (PT) as a means to tackle congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The increase of PT ridership is constrained by many aspects; among them, travel time and the built environment are considered the most critical factors in the choice of travel mode. We propose a data fusion framework including real-time traffic data, transit data, and travel demand estimated using Twitter data to compare the travel time by car and PT in four cities (Sao Paulo, Brazil; Stockholm, Sweden; Sydney, Australia; and Amsterdam, the Netherlands) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. We use real-world data to make realistic estimates of travel time by car and by PT and compare their performance by time of day and by travel distance across cities. Our results suggest that using PT takes on average 1.4-2.6 times longer than driving a car. The share of area where travel time favours PT over car use is very small: 0.62% (0.65%), 0.44% (0.48%), 1.10% (1.22%) and 1.16% (1.19%) for the daily average (and during peak hours) for Sao Paulo, Sydney, Stockholm, and Amsterdam, respectively. The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio R (PT travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day. A systematic comparison between these two modes shows that the average travel time disparity is surprisingly similar across cities: R < 1 for travel distances less than 3 km, then increases rapidly but quickly stabilises at around 2. This study contributes to providing a more realistic performance evaluation that helps future studies further explore what city characteristics as well as urban and transport policies make public transport more attractive, and to create a more sustainable future for cities.

TI  - Taxonomic resolution of the genus <i>Bythotrephes</i> Leydig using molecular markers and re-evaluation of its global distribution
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Bythotrephes Leydig is a predatory, onychopod cladoceran native to Eurasia that typically inhabits oligo- and mesotrophic water bodies of the Palaearctic region. It recently invaded 70 North American lakes, prompting a re-evaluation of the taxonomic status, global distribution, and determinants of local occurrence and abundance. European studies have reported two distinct species, B. longimanus, which lacks a kink on the caudal process, and B. cederstroemi, which possesses one. We employed sequencing of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) in addition to Directed Amplification of Minisatellite-region DNA (DAMD) using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to assay the genetic nature of these 'species'. These analyses revealed that the two taxa are consistent with a single, common species, Bythotrephes longimanus Leydig 1860, thus resolving the nomenclatural issue. Furthermore, a common haplotype was identified between Lake Ontario and Lake Puruvesi, Finland, suggesting a potential invasion corridor via the nearby Baltic Sea. Statistical analysis revealed that the two forms also occur in similar habitats in Eurasia and North America. Habitat characteristics of water bodies in Northern Europe, where both forms arc found and occasionally co-occur, do not differ statistically, Similarly, no significant differences were detected between characteristics of Eurasian habitats that support longimanus 'forms' and those of inland lakes in North America that support cederstroemi 'forms'. Human activities have had a strong effect on the distribution of Bythotrephes in both Europe and North America. Global and local distributions have been affected by ballast water transfer and by boating and fishing activities, respectively. Cultural eutrophication, oligotrophication and acidification alter the suitability of habitats for fish predators, and may indirectly influence Bythotrephes' local occurrence and abundance.

TI  - Iron-sulfur geochemistry and acidity retention in hydrologically active macropores of boreal acid sulfate soils: Effects of mitigation suspensions of fine-grained calcite and peat
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Acid sulfate soils discharge large amounts of sulfuric acid along with toxic metals, deteriorating water quality and eco-system health of recipient waterbodies. There is thus an urgent need to develop cost-effective and sustainable measures to mitigate the negative effects of these soils. In this study, we flushed aseptically-prepared MQ water (reference) or mitigation suspensions containing calcite, peat or a combination of both through 15-cm-thick soil cores from an acid sulfate soil field in western Finland, and investigated the geochemistry of Fe and S on the surfaces of macropores and in the solid columnar blocks (interiors) of the soil columns. The macropore surfaces of all soil columns were strongly enriched in total and HCl-extractable Fe and S relative to the interiors, owing to the existence of abundant Fe oxyhydroxysulfates (schwertmannite and partly jarosite) as yellow-to-brownish surface-coatings. The dissolu-tion/hydrolysis of Fe oxyhydroxysulfates (predominantly jarosite) on the macropore surfaces of the reference columns, although being constantly flushed, effectively buffered the permeates at pH close to 4. These results suggest that Fe oxyhydroxysulfates accumulated on the macropore surfaces of boreal acid sulfate soils can act as long-lasting acidifi-cation sources. The treatments with mitigation suspensions led to a (near-)complete conversion of jarosite to Fe hy-droxides, causing a substantial loss of S. In contrast, we did not observe any recognizable evidence indicating transformation of schwertmannite. However, sulfate sorbed by this mineral might be partially lost through anion -exchange processes during the treatments with calcite. No Fe sulfides were found in the peat-treated columns. Since Fe sulfides can support renewed acidification events, the moderate mineralogical changes induced by peat are desir-able. In addition, peat materials can act as toxic-metal scavengers. Thus, the peat materials used here, which is rela-tively cheap in the boreal zone, is ideal for remediating boreal acid sulfate soils and other similar jarosite-bearing soils.

TI  - The effects of green tree retention and subsequent prescribed burning on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in boreal pine-dominated forests
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - We studied how two methods to promote biodiversity in managed forests, i.e. green tree retention and prescribed fire, affect the assemblages of carabid beetles. Our experiment consisted of 24 study sites, each 3-5 ha in size, which had been prepared according to factorial design. Each of the eight treatment combinations determined by the two factors explored - tree retention level (0, 10, 50 m(3)/ha(-1) and uncut controls) and prescribed use of fire (yes/no) - was replicated three times. We sampled carabids using pitfall traps one year after the treatments. Significantly more individuals were caught in most of the burned sites, but this difference was partially reflective of the trap-catches of Pterostichus adstrictus. The fire did not increase no. of P. adstrictus in the uncut sites as much as in the other sites. Species richness was significantly affected by both factors, being higher in the burned than in the unburned sites and in the harvested than in the unharvested sites. Many species were concentrated in the groups of retention trees in the burned sites, but only a few were in the unburned sites. The species turnover was greater in the burned than in the unburned sites, as indicated by the NMDS ordinations. Greater numbers of smaller sized species and proportion of brachypterous species were present in the burned sites. Fire-favored species, and also the majority of other species that prefer open habitats were more abundantly caught in the burned sites than in the unburned sites. Dead wood or logging waste around the traps did not correlate with the occurrence of species. We conclude that carabids are well adapted to disturbances, and that frequent use of prescribed fire is essential for the maintenance of natural assemblages of carabid beetles in the boreal forest. Small retention tree groups can not maintain assemblages of uncut forest, but they can be important by providing food, shelter and breeding sites for many species, particularly in the burned sites.

TI  - Post-fledging migration of common murres <i>Uria aalge</i> in the Baltic Sea:: management implications
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - In this study of common murre Uria aalge chicks, at Stora Karlso in the Baltic Sea (Sweden), we used two data sets to investigate the post-fledging migration to learn more on potential threats from human activities. Firstly, we radio tracked 12 chicks on average 5.1 h during their first night at sea, after jumping from the breeding cliffs in early July. Their average speed was 1.9 km h(-1) and all chicks swam in a similar direction (SW) with a mean bearing of 235 degrees. By searching an area of ca 400 km(2) further off the island between two and sis days after the radio tracking, we concluded that they did not stop, even temporarily, within 40 km off the island, but had continued the swimming migration. Our second data set was made up by 400 recoveries of ringed chicks. Only those recovered within eight months after fledging (until February) were included. Two birds recovered at the Polish coast in the beginning of August had moved on average 10.7 and 12.3 km day(-1) (i.e. 0.45-0.51 km h(-1)). In August, all chicks, except one, were found south of Gotland > 70 km away. The average distance to the recovery sites in August was 253.5 km (n = 11). The pattern of distribution of birds reported in September, October and during the winter period from November to February was about the same as in August. The average direction from the colony to the recovery sites was S to SW. Important findings from nature management perspective are: 1) our data suggest that the route of the chicks at least partly coincide with ship routes with at least 42 000 passages each year. Hence, there is a potential for a great part of the common murre population to get in contact with oil spillage at this stage, notably in the first half of July. 2) From the 400 reported recoveries of ringed chicks we concluded that the most important over wintering areas are around Bornholm and the Bay of Gdansk. Hence, these are the most likely areas for conflicts with the fishery and oil spillage during the winter.

TI  - Latitudinal shift in thermal niche breadth results from thermal release during a climate-mediated range expansion
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - AimClimate change is currently altering the geographical distribution of species, but how this process contributes to biogeographical variation in ecological traits is unknown. Range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. We sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species.
   LocationSouthern and central Sweden.
   MethodsTo evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of >2000 wild-caught damselflies (Ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. We then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. Niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions.
   ResultsUpper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. In contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. Adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge.
   Main conclusionsOur results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (Brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. Population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends.

TI  - Genome description of Phlebia radiata 79 with comparative genomics analysis on lignocellulose decomposition machinery of phlebioid fungi
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
AB  - BackgroundThe white rot fungus Phlebia radiata, a type species of the genus Phlebia, is an efficient decomposer of plant cell wall polysaccharides, modifier of softwood and hardwood lignin, and is able to produce ethanol from various waste lignocellulose substrates. Thus, P. radiata is a promising organism for biotechnological applications aiming at sustainable utilization of plant biomass. Here we report the genome sequence of P. radiata isolate 79 originally isolated from decayed alder wood in South Finland. To better understand the evolution of wood decay mechanisms in this fungus and the Polyporales phlebioid clade, gene content and clustering of genes encoding specific carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in seven closely related fungal species was investigated. In addition, other genes encoding proteinsreflecting the fungal lifestyle including peptidases, transporters, small secreted proteins and genes involved in secondary metabolism were identified in the genome assembly of P. radiata.ResultsThe PACBio sequenced nuclear genome of P. radiata was assembled to 93 contigs with 72X sequencing coverage and annotated, revealing a dense genome of 40.4 Mbp with approximately 14 082 predicted protein-coding genes. According to functional annotation, the genome harbors 209 glycoside hydrolase, 27 carbohydrate esterase, 8 polysaccharide lyase, and over 70 auxiliary redox enzyme-encoding genes. Comparisons with the genomes of other phlebioid fungi revealed shared and specific properties among the species with seemingly similar saprobic wood-decay lifestyles. Clustering of especially GH10 and AA9 enzyme-encoding genes according to genomic localization was discovered to be conserved among the phlebioid species. In P. radiata genome, a rich repertoire of genes involved in the production of secondary metabolites was recognized. In addition, 49 genes encoding predicted ABC proteins were identified in P. radiata genome together with 336 genes encoding peptidases, and 430 genes encoding small secreted proteins.ConclusionsThe genome assembly of P. radiata contains wide array of carbohydrate polymer attacking CAZyme and oxidoreductase genes in a composition identifiable for phlebioid white rot lifestyle in wood decomposition, and may thus serve as reference for further studies. Comparative genomics also contributed to enlightening fungal decay mechanisms in conversion and cycling of recalcitrant organic carbon inthe forest ecosystems.

TI  - Isotopic analysis of cyanobacterial nitrogen fixation associated with subarctic lichen and bryophyte species
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - Dinitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria is of particular importance for the nutrient economy of cold biomes, constituting the main pathway for new N supplies to tundra ecosystems. It is prevalent in cyanobacterial colonies on bryophytes and in obligate associations within cyanolichens. Recent studies, applying interspecific variation in plant functional traits to upscale species effects on ecosystems, have all but neglected cryptogams and their association with cyanobacteria. Here we looked for species-specific patterns that determine cryptogam-mediated rates of N(2) fixation in the Subarctic. We hypothesised a contrast in N(2) fixation rates (1) between the structurally and physiologically different lichens and bryophytes, and (2) within bryophytes based on their respective plant functional types. Throughout the survey we supplied (15)N-labelled N(2) gas to quantify fixation rates for monospecific moss, liverwort and lichen turfs. We sampled fifteen species in a design that captures spatial and temporal variations during the growing season in Abisko region, Sweden. We measured N(2) fixation potential of each turf in a common environment and in its field sampling site, in order to embrace both comparativeness and realism. Cyanolichens and bryophytes differed significantly in their cyanobacterial N(2) fixation capacity, which was not driven by microhabitat characteristics, but rather by morphology and physiology. Cyanolichens were much more prominent fixers than bryophytes per unit dry weight, but not per unit area due to their low specific thallus weight. Mosses did not exhibit consistent differences in N(2) fixation rates across species and functional types. Liverworts did not fix detectable amounts of N(2). Despite the very high rates of N(2) fixation associated with cyanolichens, large cover of mosses per unit area at the landscape scale compensates for their lower fixation rates, thereby probably making them the primary regional atmospheric nitrogen sink.

TI  - Wood ash use in forestry - a review of the environmental impacts
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - The use of wood fuel for energy production in the UK is set to increase in the near future as part of a government commitment to increase renewable sources to 10 per cent by 2010. The ash generated as a by-product of combustion, whether for heat or power generation, has potential use as a fertilizer in forest systems. This review assesses the available information on factors affecting the quality of the ash and environmental implications arising from its application. The key determinants of wood ash chemistry are the tree species combusted, the nature of the burn process and the conditions at the application site. Wood ash from hardwood species produces higher levels of macronutrients in their ash than conifers, and the silica content is frequently lower. A furnace temperature between 500 and 900 degrees C is critical to the retention of nutrients, particularly potassium, and determines the concentrations of potentially toxic metals including aluminium in the ash. Fly ash, the lightest component that accumulates in the flue system, can contain high concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, lead and arsenic and this ash should not be used as fertilizer. The form of the ash at application is important, with loose ash releasing Ca, K and Na more rapidly than granulated ash. Heavy metal, radionuclide and dioxin contamination of wood ash-based fertilizers is minimal and unlikely to affect ecosystem function. The effects of wood ash are primarily governed by application rate and soil type. The benefits are maximized at low dose rates, with possible toxicity from applications in excess of 10 t ha(-1). For most forest sites, a single wood ash application per rotation could replace all the nutrients lost after whole-tree harvesting (excepting N). Long-lasting positive effects on tree growth have been observed on shallow peats, in which the humus is slowly mineralized in response to elevated pH and increased nutrient availability. In contrast, wood ash application to podzols is only effective in enhancing tree growth when nitrogen availability is non-limiting. To date, published research of wood ash effects on trees growing in clays and loams is minimal. A lag time for positive tree responses to wood ash application is often observed, and may be the result of phosphorous limitation at higher soil pH. The greatest reported adverse ecological effects are to acidophilic ecosystems, particularly the constituent bryophyte, soil bacteria and ectomycorrhizal communities.

TI  - Cancer patients' decision-making regarding treatment and nursing care
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
AB  - Background. Patient participation in decision-making has produced many debates among health care professionals. The research evidence concerning patient participation in decision-making is not clear, and shows conflicting results.
   Aims. To identify to what extent cancer patients participate in decision-making and to what extent background characteristics, information obtained and relationships with staff explain cancer patients' participation in decision-making.
   Design/Method. A structured questionnaire based on earlier research and qualitative interviews was designed. The questionnaire was completed by 273 cancer patients who were inpatients or outpatients in haematology, oncology clinics and other clinics at two university hospitals in Finland. The questionnaire consisted of five areas: (1) demographic data; (2) mood; (3) information obtained; (4) relationships with staff; and (5) decision-making. The scale used was ordinal. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests such as Mann-Whitney U -test, Kruskall-Wallis, and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests.
   Results. The majority of the respondents perceived that they had participated in making treatment decisions at least to some extent, together with the physician. In decision-making about nursing care, respondents felt that they had participated most in decisions about personal hygiene, rest and sleep. Respondents' physical condition, marital status, age and time since diagnosis, as well as information obtained and relationships with staff, were associated with participation in decision-making.
   Conclusion. This study provided evidence that some cancer patients participated in decision-making and felt participation to be important. Staff played a crucial role in patient participation in decision-making. In future, staff should work to improve cancer patients' opportunities to participate in decision-making in order that those who wish to be involved can do so.

TI  - Health-promoting factors in higher education for a sustainable working life - protocol for a multicenter longitudinal study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background The World Health Organization has highlighted the importance of health promotion for health service providers in order to ensure sustainable working life for individuals involved in providing health services. Such sustainability begins when students are preparing to manage their own future health and welfare in working life. It has been suggested that universities, employees and trainee health professionals should adopt or follow a salutogenic approach that not only complements the providing of information on known health risks but also favors health promotion strategies. This paper describes the study design and data collection methods in a planned study aiming to explore health-promoting factors for a sustainable working life among students in higher education within healthcare and social work. Methods This protocol describes a multicenter longitudinal study involving Swedish students on higher education programs in the healthcare and social work sectors. In 2018, the study invited students on seven education programs at six universities to participate. These programs were for qualification as: biomedical laboratory scientists (n = 121); dental hygienists (n = 87); nurses (n = 1411); occupational therapists (n = 111); physiotherapists (n = 48); radiographers (n = 60); and, social workers (n = 443). In total, 2283 students were invited to participate. Participants completed a baseline, a self-reported questionnaire including six validated instruments measuring health-promoting factors and processes. There are to be five follow-up questionnaires. Three while the students are studying, one a year after graduating, and one three years after graduating. Each questionnaire captures different health-promoting dimensions, namely: health-promoting resources (i.e. sense of coherence); occupational balance; emotional intelligence; health and welfare; social interaction; and work and workplace experiences/perceptions. Discussion This study focuses on the vastly important aspect of promoting a sustainable working life for healthcare and social work employees. In contrast to previous studies in this area, the present study uses different, validated instruments in health promotion, taking a salutogenic approach. It is hoped that, by stimulating the implementation of new strategies, the study's findings will lead to education programs that prepare students better for a sustainable working life in healthcare and social work.

TI  - Warm range margin of boreal bryophytes and lichens not directly limited by temperatures
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - Species at their warm range margin are potentially threatened by higher temperatures, but may persist in microrefugia. Whether such microsites occur due to more suitable microclimate or due to lower biotic pressure from, for example competitive species, is still not fully resolved. We examined whether boreal bryophytes and lichens show signs of direct climate limitation, that is whether they perform better in cold and/or humid microclimates at their warm range margin. We transplanted a moss, a liverwort and a lichen to 58 boreal forest sites with different microclimates at the species' southern range margin in central Sweden. Species were grown in garden soil patches to control the effects of competitive exclusion and soil quality. We followed the transplanted species over three growing seasons (2016-2018) and modelled growth and vitality for each species as a function of subcanopy temperature, soil moisture, air humidity and forest type. In 2018, we also recorded the cover of other plants having recolonized the garden soil patches and modelled this potential future competition with the same environmental variables plus litter. Species performance increased with warmer temperatures, which was often conditional on high soil moisture, and at sites with more conifers. Soil moisture had a positive effect, especially on the moss in the last year 2018, when the growing season was exceptionally hot and dry. The lichen was mostly affected by gastropod grazing. Recolonization of other plants was also faster at warmer and moister sites. The results indicate that competition, herbivory, shading leaf litter and water scarcity might be more important than the direct effects of temperature for performance at the species' warm range margin. Synthesis. In a transplant experiment with three boreal understorey species, we did not find signs of direct temperature limitation towards the south. Forest microrefugia, that is habitats where these species could persist regional warming, may instead be sites with fewer competitors and enemies, and with sufficient moisture and more conifers in the overstorey.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability in mire pool limnology
T2  - FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY
AB  - The significance of mires (peat-accumulating wetlands) is increasingly being recognised internationally because of their susceptibility to climate change and their biodiversity values. Mires are best known in the Northern Hemisphere, but numerous examples occur in the South. The objectives of this study were to characterise physicochemical conditions in a representative mire in New Zealand, and to draw comparisons with similar environments elsewhere. We measured a suite of physical, chemical and nutrient variables over two full annual cycles in mire pools in a subalpine area. Seasonal variation in and temporal coherence of several chemical variables were inconsistent among pools, and this is explained by variation in water source and pool size. For most variables, temporal variability was at least as high as spatial variability. In comparison with peat-based wetlands in northern Europe, these New Zealand sites tended to have higher pH at given concentrations of Ca. Data from mire pools in other regions, including Tasmania and other parts of New Zealand, shared the same characteristics. Inter-Hemi spheric differences in rainfall chemistry may partly account for the pH differences, but low levels of organic acids (measured as DOC) appear more likely to be responsible. The mechanisms leading to low DOC are uncertain, but could include the effects of high rainfall, and vegetation differences. All pools were confirmed as ultra-oligotrophic in winter, though summer peaks in productivity exceeded thresholds for mesotrophic conditions. As in the Northern Hemisphere, nutrient patterns were independent of the Ca/pH gradient. Despite significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity of these mire pools, their average water chemistry also differs from that typical in rivers and lakes in New Zealand. Given that mire pools are already known to support higher proportions of endemism in benthic diatoms compared to other freshwater habitats in New Zealand, we suggest they may constitute an unusual environment type on which more detailed aquatic biological studies are warranted.

TI  - Seedling Response to Simulated Browsing and Reduced Water Availability: Insights for Assisted Migration Plantations
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - To facilitate forest transition to future climate conditions, managers can use adaptive silvicultural tools, for example the assisted translocation of tree species and genotypes to areas with suitable future climate conditions (i.e., assisted migration). Like traditional plantations, however, assisted migration plantations are at risk of failure because of browsing by ungulate herbivores. The ability of seedlings to tolerate browsing could also be hampered by low water availability, as is expected under climate change. Using a greenhouse experiment with five eastern North American tree species, we evaluated the effects of simulated winter browsing and reduced water availability on the growth (total biomass, shoot:root ratio), survival, and chemical composition (nitrogen, total phenolics, flavonoids) of seedlings. We compared seedlings from three geographic provenances representing three climate analogues, i.e., locations with a current climate similar to the climate predicted at the plantation site at a specific time (here: current, mid-century and end of the century). We hypothesized that seedlings would allocate resources to the system (shoots or roots) affected by the most limiting treatment (simulated browsing or reduced water availability). Additionally, we evaluated whether the combination of treatments would have an additive or non-additive effect on the growth, survival and chemical composition of the seedlings. Quercus rubra seedlings reacted only to the water reduction treatment (changes in biomass and N concentration, dependent on geographic provenance) while Pinus strobus reacted only to the simulated browsing treatment (biomass and chemical composition). We also observed non-additive effects of reduced water availability and simulated browsing on Prunus serotina, Acer saccharum and Thuja occidentalis. In general, shoot:root ratio and investment in chemical defense did not vary in response to treatments. The regrowth response observed in Q. rubra and A. saccharum suggests that these species could tolerate periodic browsing events, even when water availability is reduced. More information is required to understand their long-term tolerance to repeated browsing events and to harsher and more frequent water stress. We highlight the importance of species-specific growth and allocation responses that vary with geographic provenance, which should be considered by managers when planning climate-adapted strategies, such as assisted migration.</p>

TI  - Non-native species change the tune of tundra soils: Novel access to soundscapes of the Arctic earthworm invasion
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have used soundscapes to address diverse ecological questions. Sound represents one of the few sources of information capable of providing in situ insights into processes occurring within opaque soil matrices. To date, the use of soundscapes for soil macrofauna monitoring has been experimentally tested only in controlled laboratory environments. Here we assess the validity of laboratory predictions and explore the use of soil soundscape proxies for monitoring soil macrofauna (i.e., earthworm) activities in an outdoor context. In a common garden experiment in northern Sweden, we constructed outdoor mesocosm plots (N = 36) containing two different Arctic veg-etation types (meadow and heath) and introduced earthworms to half of these plots. Earthworms substantially altered the ambient soil soundscape under both vegetation types, as measured by both traditional soundscape indices and fre-quency band power levels, although their acoustic impacts were expressed differently in heath versus meadow soils. While these findings support the as-of-yet untapped promise of using belowground soundscape analyses to monitor soil ecosystem health, direct acoustic emissions from earthworm activities appear to be an unlikely proxy for tracking worm activities at daily timescales. Instead, earthworms indirectly altered the soil soundscape by 're-engineering' the soil matrix:an effect that was dependent on vegetation type. Our findings suggest that long-term (i.e., seasonal) earth-worm activities in natural soil settings can likely be monitored indirectly via their impacts on soundscape measures and acoustic indices. Analyzing soil soundscapes may enable larger-scale monitoring of high-latitude soils and is directly ap-plicable to the specific case of earthworm invasions within Arctic soils, which has recently been identified as a potential threat to the resilience of high-latitude ecosystems. Soil soundscapes could also offer a novel means to monitor soils and soil-plant-faunal interactions in situ across diverse pedogenic, agronomic, and ecological systems.

TI  - Assessing the usefulness of citizen science data for habitat suitability modelling: Opportunistic reporting versus sampling based on a systematic protocol
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - Aim To evaluate the potential of models based on opportunistic reporting (OR) compared to models based on data from a systematic protocol (SP) for modelling species distributions. We compared model performance for eight forest bird species with contrasting spatial distributions, habitat requirements and rarity. Differences in the reporting of species were also assessed. Finally, we tested potential improvement of models when inferring high-quality absences from OR based on questionnaires sent to observers. Location Both datasets cover the same large area (Sweden) and time period (2000-2013). Methods Species distributions were modelled using logistic regression. Predictive performance of OR models to predict SP data was assessed based on AUC. We quantified the congruence in spatial predictions using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. We related these results to species characteristics and reporting behaviour of observers. We also assessed the gain in predictive performance of OR models by adding inferred absences. Finally, we investigated the potential impact of sampling bias in OR. Results For all species, and despite the sampling biases, results from OR overall agreed well with those of SP, for the nationwide spatial congruence of habitat suitability maps and the selection and directions of species-environment relationships. The OR models also performed well in predicting the SP data. The predictive performance of the OR models increased with species rarity and even outperformed the SP model for the rarest species. No significant impact of observer behaviour was found. Main conclusions Relatively simple analyses with inferred absences could produce reliable spatial predictions of habitat suitability. This was especially true for rare species. OR data should be seen as a complement to SP, as the weakness of one is the strength of the other, and OR may be especially useful at large spatial scales or where no systematic data collection protocols exist.

TI  - Making Concrete Pavements Competitive by Using the Standardized Framework for Comparisons of Infrastructure Projects in Terms of Cost-Efficiency and Climate Impact
T2  - NORDIC CONCRETE RESEARCH
AB  - Despite the new Swedish client requirement to reduce the climate impact from the construction of roads, there has been relatively little research so far on how the optimization measures regarding the environmental impact of road pavements can be integrated in the traditional design. An increase in axle weights, changes of the traditional ways of travel, e.g. the use of automated and guided vehicles, and stricter customer requirements on reducing the climate impact require new approaches to steer the road and pavement industry towards more climate neutral solutions. This paper analyzes the latest standards for sustainability assessment of engineering works in an attempt to adjust these standards for assessing various road design options in a comparable and fair way, also when various materials are included.

TI  - Ecological niche shifts of understorey plants along a latitudinal gradient of temperate forests in north-western Europe
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim In response to environmental changes and to avoid extinction, species may either track suitable environmental conditions or adapt to the modified environment. However, whether and how species adapt to environmental changes remains unclear. By focusing on the realized niche (i.e. the actual space that a species inhabits and the resources it can access as a result of limiting biotic factors present in its habitat), we here examine shifts in the realized-niche width (i.e. ecological amplitude) and position (i.e. ecological optimum) of 26 common and widespread forest understorey plants across their distributional ranges.
   Location Temperate forests along a ca. 1800-km-long latitudinal gradient from northern France to central Sweden and Estonia.
   Methods We derived species' realized-niche width from a -diversity metric, which increases if the focal species co-occurs with more species. Based on the concept that species' scores in a detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) represent the locations of their realized-niche positions, we developed a novel approach to run species-specific DCAs allowing the focal species to shift its realized-niche position along the studied latitudinal gradient while the realized-niche positions of other species were held constant.
   Results None of the 26 species maintained both their realized-niche width and position along the latitudinal gradient. Few species (9 of 26: 35%) shifted their realized-niche width, but all shifted their realized-niche position. With increasing latitude, most species (22 of 26: 85%) shifted their realized-niche position for soil nutrients and pH towards nutrient-poorer and more acidic soils.
   Main conclusions Forest understorey plants shifted their realized niche along the latitudinal gradient, suggesting local adaptation and/or plasticity. This macroecological pattern casts doubt on the idea that the realized niche is stable in space and time, which is a key assumption of species distribution models used to predict the future of biodiversity, hence raising concern about predicted extinction rates.

TI  - The World Health Organization fetal growth charts: concept, findings, interpretation, and application
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
AB  - Ultrasound biometry is an important clinical tool for the identification, monitoring, and management of fetal growth restriction and development of macrosomia. This is even truer in populations in which perinatal morbidity and mortality rates are high, which is a reason that much effort is put onto making the technique available everywhere, including low-income societies. Until recently, however, commonly used reference ranges were based on single populations largely from industrialized countries. Thus, the World Health Organization prioritized the establishment of fetal growth charts for international use. New fetal growth charts for common fetal measurements and estimated fetal weight were based on a longitudinal study of 1387 low-risk pregnant women from 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Norway, and Thailand) that provided 8203 sets of ultrasound measurements. The participants were characterized by median age 28 years, 58% nulliparous, normal body mass index, with no socioeconomic or nutritional constraints (median caloric intake, 1840 calories/day), and had the ability to attend the ultrasound sessions, thus essentially representing urban populations. Median gestational age at birth was 39 weeks, and birthweight was 3300 g, both with significant differences among countries. Quantile regression was used to establish the fetal growth charts, which also made it possible to demonstrate a number of features of fetal growth that previously were not well appreciated or unknown: (1) There was an asymmetric distribution of estimated fetal weight in the population. During early second trimester, the distribution was wider among fetuses <50th percentile compared with those above. The pattern was reversed in the third trimester, with a notably wider variation >50th percentile. (2) Although fetal sex, maternal factors (height, weight, age, and parity), and country had significant influence on fetal weight (1-4.5% each), their effect was graded across the percentiles. For example, the positive effect of maternal height on fetal weight was strongest on the lowest percentiles and smallest on the highest percentiles for estimated fetal weight. (3) When adjustment was made for maternal covariates, there was still a significant effect of country as covariate that indicated that ethnic, cultural, and geographic variation play a role. (4) Variation between populations was not restricted to fetal size because there were also differences in growth trajectories. (5) The wide physiologic ranges, as illustrated by the 5th-95th percentile for estimated fetal weight being 2205-3538 g at 37 weeks gestation, signify that human fetal growth under optimized maternal conditions is not uniform. Rather, it has a remarkable variation that largely is unexplained by commonly known factors. We suggest this variation could be part of our common biologic strategy that makes human evolution extremely successful. The World Health Organization fetal growth charts are intended to be used internationally based on low-risk pregnancies from populations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. We consider it prudent to test and monitor whether the growth charts' performance meets the local needs, because refinements are possible by a change in cut-offs or customization for fetal sex, maternal factors, and populations. In the same line, the study finding of variations emphasizes the need for carefully adjusted growth charts that reflect optimal local growth when public health issues are addressed.

TI  - Maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS): implementation and legal issues
T2  - MARITIME BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to see whether the concept of autonomous ship is having an effect on pioneering the sea transportation as well as improvement of ship safety and the possibility of local development. Following the lead of the first autonomous surface ship by Norway that met to develop the Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Application (AAWA) and introduce of autonomous operation to the region. this study also aims to compare the initiation of action by surface ships to that of the air and land vehicle automation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The ideas for writing this paper came from meeting and interview with maritime professionals such as ship captains, marine chief engineers and naval architects. Through the review of various international journals, the development of Autonomy and Technology are explored and analysed. Owing to the practical approach of this paper, a qualitative research method is used with collecting and analysing information.
   Findings - The findings of this paper are as follows: it brings out the importance on the potentials of unmanned vessels and its competitive advantages over existing cargo ships. Besides its contribution to reduce fatigue and workload of navigating officers, the improvement of navigational safety by eliminating human errors and reduction of harmful exhaust emission can make shipping safer and more sustainable. However, as the technology is still under development, it is too early for a final evaluation. That said, as the international regulation body, International Maritime Organisation is required to gain acceptance to future unmanned shipping and to designate routes and impose regulations for their safe operation.
   Originality/value - Recently, there are many conferences and meetings on autonomous surface vessel focussing on regulation, technology, human-factor, legal and regulatory framework for such ships around the world. This paper summarises the current development of the autonomous surface ships, in term of the design and technology, their interaction and co-existence with manned ships and suggest some operation issues on board an autonomous surface ship during voyage. Taking Hong Kong as an example, this paper attempts to examine the feasibility for introducing the autonomous surface ships in local waters.

AB  - This article describes cooperation between authorities and universities in order to increase innovation capacity and thereby achieve change in performance and execution for better contribution to a sustainable future. Through action research, the authors have developed new knowledge about dialogical organisational development as a method for increasing innovation capacity. The paper recognises that administrative and adaptive leadership must work together effectively if organisations are to function properly and that the complexity cannot be controlled with complicated systems; adaptation is more important than fixing administrative structures. There is a need for a dynamic relationship between the formal and the informal in organisations-between top-down administrative forces and complex, adaptive and emergent forces. The study also shows that there is a need for a wider range and simultaneous use of management models adapted to different contexts and needs.

AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) work as a new agenda for sustainable development globally. Many if not most of the SDGs can be combined with different levels of education. This paper leans on previous work in Sustainable Education Design (SED), which looked at sustainability from its multifaceted angles with a broad global scope. The context of the study is a campus at a research-intensive Finnish university. The methodology entailed participatory service design approaches. For piloting, one classroom was chosen as a test bed. The data consist of workshops, use walks and structured interviews. The analysis started from identifying KPIs of sustainable learning environment creation, after which these were tested against Sustainable Education Design Criteria described in a manual book earlier. The key findings include nine preliminary alternative KPIs that were merged with previous SED criteria and related SDGs. The alternative KPIs were trialled in the test bed environment. These proposed alternative KPIs can be used as indicators for sustainability, innovation and learning during participatory change processes and in evaluating the outcome.

TI  - Doing environmental concerns in consulting engineering
T2  - ENGINEERING STUDIES
AB  - This article is a study of how environmental concerns are enacted and dealt with by consulting engineering companies in Norway. Consulting engineering companies play a key role in the ongoing shaping and reshaping of the physical qualities of nature and culture, of landscapes, and the built environment. To what extent do they take on such responsibilities and what makes them engage with environmental issues? What does it mean to do environmental concern? The far most important way of doing environmental concern was to fulfill legal regulations and framework. This compliance with legal rules was not as much about professional ethics as it was a translation into business opportunities. Such a re-assemblage of environmental concerns among consultant engineer companies may be called the legal compliance as business. Thus, legal codes and regulations seem to be the most effective instruments to shape environmental practices of consulting engineers.

TI  - Eco-energy and urbanisation: messages from birds about wind turbine proliferation
T2  - BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
AB  - By 2010, 51% of humans live in cities, rising to 70% by 2050. Energy consumption increases exponentially with the proportion of the populace living in conurbations. Fossil fuels supply 85% of global human energy, yet many acknowledge the need to switch to renewable sources, especially given recent concerns over nuclear power safety. Finland will consume 14% more electrical energy by 2035, plus another 14% were the country to switch to electric cars. Such increased demand could be met by 2730 x 2.3 MW wind turbines (covering 1050 km(2) of sea). Wind turbines may cause displacement from bird feeding areas, barriers to movement, modifications to habitats and collision mortality. Effective implementation of Strategic Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Assessment should guide sensitive positioning of wind farm development to avoid conflicts with avian populations. Experiences from existing developments, combined with modelling approaches, must ensure attempts generate renewable energy from wind do not impact unacceptably upon local nature.

TI  - GILL RAKER COUNTING FOR APPROXIMATING THE RATIO OF RIVER- AND SEA-SPAWNING WHITEFISH, <i>COREGONUS LAVARETUS</i> (ACTINOPTERYGII: SALMONIFORMES: SALMONIDAE) IN THE GULF OF BOTHNIA, BALTIC SEA
T2  - ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA
AB  - Background. The ability to distinguish between stocks in mixed fisheries is a prerequisite for a sustainable fisheries management. In the Gulf of Bothnia the relative contribution of endangered river-spawning and sea-spawning whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (Linnaeus, 1758), to fisheries catches are currently not well known. This also applies to the southern Aland Islands, a major feeding ground for river-spawning whitefish from northern rivers. River-and sea-spawning whitefish are mixed while away from the breeding grounds and off the spawning season, and cannot be distinguished based on external features.
   Materials and methods. Analysis on gill raker numbers of river-spawning (n = 480) and sea-spawning (n = 456) whitefish from twelve locations at the Finnish west coast and the Aland Islands was performed. In whitefish sampled from feeding grounds at the Aland Islands the strontium concentration was analysed in otoliths from fish (n = 20) with low (27) and high (30) number of gill rakers.
   Results. A marked difference in the mean gill raker number of the river- and sea-spawning whitefish stocks was observed. The weighted mean of gill rakers of whitefish caught at spawning locations showed that the number of gill rakers of fish from rivers and the sea were 29.9 +/- 2.14 (n = 480) and 26.7 +/- 2.21 (n = 456), respectively. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (t = 22.50, df = 934, P < 0.0001). The means differed by 3.20 (2.92-3.48, 95% CL) indicating the groups are well separated. In whitefish sampled at feeding grounds at the Aland Islands, otolith strontium concentration was higher (t = 2.09, df = 18, P = 0.04) in fish having 27 gill rakers (3.86 +/- 0.30 mg.g(-1), n = 10), compared to those having 30 gill rakers (3.54 +/- 0.35 mg.g(-1), n = 10). Otolith strontium analysis thereby supported the utility of gill raker counting data for estimating the proportion of river-and sea-spawning whitefish in mixed populations. As expected, the gill raker counting method successfully indicated temporal alterations in the proportions of river-and sea-spawning whitefish on feeding grounds.
   Conclusion. Gill raker counting is an easy, fast, and inexpensive method that can be used to estimate the spatio-temporal occurrence and migratory patterns of river-and sea-spawning whitefish at the southern feeding grounds in the Gulf of Bothnia, and thereby aid in a sustainable management of whitefish stocks.

TI  - "I try to encourage my students to think, read, and talk science" intelligible identities in university teachers' figured worlds of higher education biology
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
AB  - Higher education biology is often imagined, perceived, and described as having reached gender equality in terms of who gets to participate in disciplinary practices. However, like any other natural science discipline, higher education biology is a world whose landscapes are shaped by (re)productions of historical, cultural, and social norms. We explore these norms through the lens of identity, asking what identities are recognized by university biology teachers at a large Swedish university, analyzing 94 teaching statements written when applying for faculty positions in biology. We argue that in and through teaching statements, university biology teachers negotiate and perform overarching academic and disciplinary norms and discourses with the goal to present themselves as intelligible candidates. As statements of value, they thereby display implicit and explicit identities recognized in worlds of higher education biology. Using a discourse analytical framework, we identified two university teacher identities imagined as intelligible: Research Science Teachers and Facilitating Science Teachers. Research Science Teachers position research and associated masculine-coded competences as anchor points of biology practice. They consider researchers to be ultimate knowers and consequently to be best suitable for university teaching with the goal to recruit students into research. Facilitating Science Teachers, even though aware of the hegemonic position of research, disentangle imaginaries of what makes a researcher from what makes a university teacher. They transgress dominant imaginaries of research as the ultimate competence for themselves and students, and create spaces for alternative identity work. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of (re)productive processes in science education, providing perspectives of how to together infract intergenerational (re)productions of hegemonic norms of doing science. Additionally, this study provides further evidence that higher education biology is not a gender-neutral higher education landscape.

TI  - Increased coordination in public transport-which mechanisms are available?
T2  - TRANSPORT POLICY
AB  - After several years of New Public Management reforms within public transport, coordination seems to receive increased attention. With examples of actual as well as suggested changes taken from Denmark. Sweden and the UK the aim of the article is to analyse and classify the mechanisms utilized and suggested to increase coordination between core stakeholders within passenger railway services and bus services. Four distinctive mechanisms of coordination are suggested, namely organisational coordination, contractual coordination, partnership coordination and discursive coordination. Each coordination mechanism has its strengths and failures. The article also debates to what extent the mechanisms conflict with three core characteristics of New Public Management: Unbundling of the public sector into corporatized units; more contract-based competitive provision; and greater emphasis on output controls.

TI  - Auditioning for Hollywood: A Comparative Study of Tax Incentives Offered to the Film Industry
T2  - INTERTAX
AB  - The European film landscape is characterized by a strong presence of Hollywood productions. In 2019, American productions held approximately 70% of the market within the European Union while European productions had 25%. As a response, the EU has introduced differing types of financial support schemes with the aim of offsetting the imbalance between the American and the European film industries.This article describes and analyses tax incentives offered to the film industry from two main lines of inquiry: (1) a comparative and empirical tax study of twelve jurisdictions (Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States) in which the design of such tax incentives is investigated, and (2) a conceptual tax policy discussion on how states may design and implement such tax incentives.

TI  - Environmental Regulation in the Pulp and Paper Industry: Impacts and Challenges
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
AB  - Purpose of Review In this article, we review existing research addressing how environmental regulations have influenced the pulp and paper industry. These regulations appear in different forms and designs and address air and water pollution as well as climate change. The paper devotes particular attention to how various regulations have affected sustainable technological change and the prospects for inducing deep emission reductions without jeopardizing industrial competitiveness and future investments. Recent Findings Experiences from key pulp and paper regions, not least the Nordic countries, suggest that gradually tightening performance standards have contributed to radical reductions in emissions, e.g., chlorine compounds and biological oxygen demanding agents, and without imposing excessive compliance costs. This outcome can largely be attributed to how the regulations have been designed-and implemented-in practice, as well as to the presence of efficient and legitimate institutions. Long-term emission reduction targets, in combination with extended compliance periods and trustful firm-regulator relationships, contributed to radical technological innovation and permitted radical emission reductions without excessive compliance costs. The development of alternative bleaching technologies is an apt example. In contrast, the impact of carbon pricing schemes, including the EU emissions trading scheme, on carbon dioxide emissions reductions and related technological change in the pulp and paper industry has however been modest. Self-regulation, certification, and community pressure have exerted relatively modest influences on the environmental performance of the industry. Important avenues for future research are identified. These include the following: (a) comparative research on how policy mixes in various countries have influenced environmental compliance and innovation; processes; (b) future studies of environmental regulations, their design and implementation, in emerging pulp and paper producing countries, not least China; and (c) research on how environmental regulations can affect ongoing restructurings in the industry towards a broader palette of products in biorefineries.

TI  - Euthanasia and the rehabilitation of wildlife casualties in Finland: decision-making varies depending on the background education of the caregivers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
AB  - Caring for wildlife casualties is a common aspect of animal-protection work. The range of care options of wildlife in Finland vary from professional zoos to voluntary members of the public. There are complex ethical concerns to be considered in deciding whether an injured animal should be treated or euthanized. Differing opinions and poor communication may lead to unnecessary conflicts among caregivers. We investigated opinions behind the decision-making of caregivers related to wildlife casualties using a web-based questionnaire. We asked the respondents to rate their level of agreement with 27 statements on a seven-point Likert scale. Seventy-eight respondents were included in our analysis. Animal-related education was classified as veterinarian (n = 14), other (n = 18), and none (n = 49). The median (IQR) levels of age and work experience were 43 (17) and 5 (9) years, respectively, regardless of educational level. The groups were tested for differences level of agreement with the statements in Kruskall-Wallis tests (with Bonferroni-corrected pair-wise tests). Overall, the strongest disagreement was with statements proposing euthanasia on the grounds that the species was common [1 (2)], the treatment would be costly [1 (4)] or long-term [1 (4)], or there was no end-of-life-solution immediately available [1 (2)]. The highest agreement was with the statement advocating not euthanizing the animal if it could easily be returned to its natural habitat [7 (0)]. The respondents differed in their perceptions depending on their animal-related education. The cost and length of treatment, the prevalence of the species, and a known end-of-life solution influenced the euthanasia-related decisions of veterinarians more than of respondents in the other educational groups. Those with no animal-related education expressed the least willingness to euthanize an injured wild animal, even if it would be partly dependent on humans for the rest of its life or even if the treatment would be very stressful. We concluded that attitudes and practices related to euthanasia differ depending on the respondents' education, and that more discussion is needed on the ethical aspects behind the decision-making. This would help to increase mutual understanding among caregivers and facilitate the development of uniform standards that would potentially benefit animal welfare.

TI  - Phylogeny and cultivation of the holocarpic oomycete <i>Diatomophthora perforans</i> comb. nov., an endoparasitoid of marine diatoms
T2  - MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS
AB  - Oomycetes infecting diatoms are biotrophic parasitoids and live in both marine and freshwater environments. They are ubiquitous, but the taxonomic affinity of many species remains unclear and the majority of them have not been studied for their molecular phylogeny. Only recently, the phylogenetic and taxonomic placement of some diatom-infecting, early-diverging oomycetes was resolved, including the genera Ectrogella, Miracula, Olpidiopsis, and Pontisma. A group of holocarpic diatom parasitoids with zoospores swarming within the sporangium before release were found to be unrelated to the known genera with diatom-infecting species, and were re-classified to a new genus, Diatomophthora. However, about a dozen species of holocarpic diatom parasitoids with unclear affinity remained unsequenced, which includes a commonly occurring species so far identified as Ectrogella perforans. However, this assignment to Ectrogella is doubtful, as the species was not reported to feature a clear-cut diplanetism, a hallmark of Ectrogella s. str. and the whole class Saprolegniomycetes. It was the aim of the current study to clarify the phylogenetic affinities of the species and if the rather broad host range reported is correct or a reflection of cryptic species. By targeted screening, the parasitoid was rediscovered from Helgoland Roads, North Sea and Oslo Fjord, Southern Norway and investigated for its phylogenetic placement using small ribosomal subunit (18S) sequences. Stages of its life cycle on different marine diatoms were described and its phylogenetic placement in the genus Diatomophthora revealed. A stable host-parasite axenic culture from single spore strains of the parasitoid were established on several strains of Pleurosigma intermedium and Coscinodiscus concinnus. These have been continuously cultivated along with their hosts for more than 2 years, and cultural characteristics are reported. Cross-infection trials revealed the transferability of the strains between hosts under laboratory conditions, despite some genetic distance between the pathogen strains. Thus, we hypothesise that D. perforans might be in the process of active radiation to new host species.

TI  - Spatial and temporal evolution of lead isotope ratios in the North Atlantic Ocean between 1981 and 1989
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
AB  - [1] Lead concentrations and isotope ratios were measured in North Atlantic surface water samples collected in 1981 (29degrees - 79 degreesN, 6 degreesE - 49 degreesW) and in 1989 (23degrees - 39 degreesN, 29degrees - 68 degreesW). In the early 1980s, Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios in the North African Basin averaged 1.193 +/- 0.005 (1 sigma). Similar radiogenic ratios within the level of analytical precision ( average 0.29%) were found in the Labrador and Iceland Basins ( 1.198 +/- 0.006) and in the Norwegian Sea ( 1.196 +/- 0.008). These radiogenic mixed layer signatures along with atmospheric global lead emission patterns suggest that most North Atlantic lead in the early 1980s was derived from North American leaded gasoline. Samples in the East Iberian Basin near Portugal and France showed lower Pb-206/Pb-207 ratios, between 1.167 and 1.182, indicating a significant influence of less radiogenic atmospheric lead transported from Europe and possibly the influence of the Rio Tinto acid mine drainage very close to shore in the Gulf of Cadiz. [Pb] across the entire North Atlantic Basin ranged between 54 and 145 pmol/kg, with the lowest values ( 54 - 74 pmol/kg) found at high latitudes (> 65 degreesN). In the late 1980s, surface waters in the western subtropical North Atlantic ( North American Basin/ Sargasso Sea, > 47 degreesW) and in the eastern subtropical North Atlantic ( North African Basin/ Central Iberian Basin, < 45 degrees W) showed very similar Pb-206/Pb-207 signatures with little zonal variation, ranging from 1.177 to 1.192. Lead concentrations ranged between 47 and 137 pmol/kg, increasing slightly from west to east. South of 25 degrees N in the equatorial North Atlantic, crossing the subtropical/tropical surface water boundary, the Pb-206/Pb-207 seawater signatures were significantly less radiogenic (1.170 - 1.175) and concentrations were lower ( <= 51 pmol/ kg). This difference suggests a relative increase in the atmospheric lead supply from the western Mediterranean/North African continent via Trade Easterlies and illustrates the effective barrier between the subtropical/tropical surface water exchanges. Triple-isotope plots (Pb-206, Pb-207, and Pb-208) suggest that most of the lead can be accounted for by wet aerosol deposition derived from the adjacent landmasses of America to the west ( transported via the North American Westerlies) and from Europe to the east ( transported via the European Easterlies) and probably by some advected surface waters from the Sargasso Sea. The 1989 triple-isotope plot suggests, however, a third lead source in the subtropical western North Atlantic, possibly leaded gasoline from Mexico. Gasoline lead emission patterns as well as atmospheric lead isotope signatures confirm that gasoline was the main pollutant source in the early 1980s but suggest that contributions from high-temperature industrial processes ( coal combustion, steel manufacture, waste incineration) have been increasing in the late 1980s. From isotopic mass balance estimates, lead inputs to the 1980s North Atlantic were dominated by North American sources (> 53%). These elemental and isotopic results demonstrate the strongly variable isotopic and elemental signatures of North American and European lead throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, frequently dominated by high Pb-206/Pb-207 and [Pb] North American signatures throughout the subtropical North Atlantic gyre.

TI  - Sickness Presenteeism among Employees Having Workplace Conflicts-Results from Pooled Analyses in Latvia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The study's objective was to investigate the associations between workplace conflicts and self-reported sickness presenteeism defined as going to work while being ill. Cross-sectional survey data pooled from four national surveys in years 2006, 2010, 2013 and 2018 with a study sample of 6368 employees (mean age 42.9 years and 52.9% females) were used. Respondents were randomly drawn from different regions and industries; therefore, the sample is representative of the working population of Latvia. The computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) method was used to collect data at respondents' places of residence. The associations between conflicts in the workplace and presenteeism were analyzed by using binomial logistic regression and calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusted (aOR) for gender, age, education, and survey year. On average, 11% of respondents reported sickness presenteeism during the last year. The odds of presenteeism significantly increased for all types of workplace conflicts, but most for conflicts with managers (OR = 2.84). The odds of presenteeism doubled for those reporting conflicts with other employees (OR = 2.19) and conflicts with customers (OR = 1.85). The odds of sickness presenteeism were significantly higher if the workplace conflicts occurred often (seven times for conflicts between managers and employees, and four times for conflicts with customers) and with other employees. Presenteeism frequency increased more than three times if respondents had more than two types of conflict at work. The results of this study show that having any type of conflict in the workplace significantly increases the frequency of sickness presenteeism, especially when conflicts are frequent or an employee has more types of conflicts in the workplace. The study results justify the need to implement targeted and effective workplace conflict management measures at the organizational level to decrease sickness presenteeism.

TI  - Collaborative and partnership research for improvement of health and social services: researcher's experiences from 20 projects
T2  - HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Background: Getting research into policy and practice in healthcare is a recognised, world-wide concern. As an attempt to bridge the gap between research and practice, research funders are requesting more interdisciplinary and collaborative research, while actual experiences of such processes have been less studied. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to gain more knowledge on the interdisciplinary, collaborative and partnership research process by investigating researchers' experiences of and approaches to the process, based on their participation in an inventive national research programme. The programme aimed to boost collaborative and partnership research and build learning structures, while improving ways to lead, manage and develop practices in Swedish health and social services.
   Methods: Interviews conducted with project leaders and/or lead researchers and documentation from 20 projects were analysed using directed and conventional content analysis.
   Results: Collaborative approaches were achieved by design, e.g. action research, or by involving practitioners from several levels of the healthcare system in various parts of the research process. The use of dual roles as researcher/ clinician or practitioner/PhD student or the use of education designed especially for practitioners or 'student researchers' were other approaches. The collaborative process constituted the area for the main lessons learned as well as the main problems. Difficulties concerned handling complexity and conflicts between different expectations and demands in the practitioner's and researcher's contexts, and dealing with human resource issues and group interactions when forming collaborative and interdisciplinary research teams. The handling of such challenges required time, resources, knowledge, interactive learning and skilled project management.
   Conclusions: Collaborative approaches are important in the study of complex phenomena. Results from this study show that allocated time, arenas for interactions and skills in project management and communication are needed during research collaboration to ensure support and build trust and understanding with involved practitioners at several levels in the healthcare system. For researchers, dealing with this complexity takes time and energy from the scientific process. For practitioners, this puts demands on understanding a research process and how it fits with ongoing organisational agendas and activities and allocating time. Some of the identified factors may be overlooked by funders and involved stakeholders when designing, performing and evaluating interdisciplinary, collaborative and partnership research.

TI  - Synergistic, additive and antagonistic impacts of drought and herbivory on <i>Pinus sylvestris</i>: leaf, tissue and whole-plant responses and recovery
T2  - TREE PHYSIOLOGY
AB  - Forests typically experience a mix of anthropogenic, natural and climate-induced stressors of different intensities, creating a mosaic of stressor combinations across the landscape. When multiple stressors co-occur, their combined impact on plant growth is often greater than expected based on single-factor studies (i.e., synergistic), potentially causing catastrophic dysfunction of physiological processes from an otherwise recoverable situation. Drought and herbivory are two stressors that commonly co-occur in forested ecosystems, and have the potential to 'overlap' in their impacts on various plant traits and processes. However, the combined impacts from these two stressors may not be predictable based on additive models from single-stressor studies. Moreover, the impacts and subsequent recovery may be strongly influenced by the relative intensities of each stressor. Here, we applied drought stress and simulated bark-feeding herbivory at three levels of intensity (control, moderate and severe) in a full factorial design on young Pinus sylvestris L. seedlings. We assessed if the combined effects from two stressors were additive (responses were equal to the sum of the single-factor effects), synergistic (greater than expected) or antagonistic (less than expected) on a suite of morphological and physiological traits at the leaf-, tissue- and whole-plant level. We additionally investigated whether recovery from herbivory was dependent on relief from drought. The two stressors had synergistic impacts on specific leaf area and water-use efficiency, additive effects on height and root-to-shoot ratios, but antagonistic effects on photosynthesis, conductance and, most notably, on root, shoot and whole-plant biomass. Nevertheless, the magnitude and direction of the combined impacts were often dependent on the relative intensities of each stressor, leading to many additive or synergistic responses from specific stressor combinations. Also, seedling recovery was far more dependent on the previous year's drought compared with the previous year's herbivory, demonstrating the influence of one stressor over another during recovery. Our study reveals for the first time, the importance of not only the presence or absence of drought and herbivory stressors, but also shows that their relative intensities are critical in determining the direction and magnitude of their impacts on establishing seedlings.

TI  - Healthcare system intervention for prevention of birth injuries - process evaluation of self-assessment, peer review, feedback and agreement for change
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Patient safety is fundamental in high quality healthcare systems but despite an excellent record of perinatal care in Sweden some children still suffer from substandard care and unnecessary birth injuries. Sustainable patient safety improvements assume changes in key actors' mental models, norms and culture as well as in the tools, design and organisation of work. Interventions positively affecting team mental models on safety issues are a first step to enhancing change. Our purpose was to study a national intervention programme for the prevention of birth injuries with the aim to elucidate how the main interventions of self-assessment, peer review, feedback and written agreement for change affected the teams and their mental model of patient safety, and thereby their readiness for change. Knowledge of relevant considerations before implementing this type of patient safety intervention series could thereby be increased.
   Methods: Eighty participants in twenty-seven maternity units were interviewed after the first intervention sequence of the programme. A content analysis using a priori coding was performed in order to relate results to the anticipated outcomes of three basic interventions: self-assessment, peer review and written feedback, and agreement for change.
   Results: The self-assessment procedure was valuable and served as a useful tool for elucidating strengths and weaknesses and identifying areas for improvement for a safer delivery in maternity units. The peer-review intervention was appreciated, despite it being of less value when considering the contribution to explicit outcome effects (i.e. new input to team mental models and new suggestions for actions). The feedback report and the mutual agreement on measures for improvements reached when signing the contract seemed exert positive pressures for change.
   Conclusions: Our findings are in line with several studies stressing the importance of self-evaluation by encouraging a thorough review of objectives, practices and outcomes for the continuous improvement of an organisation. Even though effects of the peer review were limited, feedback from peers, or other change agents involved, and the support that a clear and well-structured action plan can provide are considered to be two important complements to future self-assessment procedures related to patient safety improvement.

TI  - Effect of a mHealth exercise intervention compared with supervised exercise therapy in osteoarthritis management: protocol of the DigiOA trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - Introduction Soaring prevalence of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) inflicts high costs on the healthcare system. A further rise in the OA incidence is expected, generating increased demand of care potentially challenging accessibility and threatening to overwhelm the healthcare system. Innovative solutions that may improve accessibility to recommended OA care for patients in primary care and maintain healthcare sustainability are warranted. Digitalising home exercise therapy may be one such solution. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mobile health app providing digitalised home exercises, compared with supervised exercise therapy in patients with OA. Second, we will evaluate the cost-efficiency of the intervention and explore potential differences in outcome and adherence to exercises in the experimental treatment group.
   Methods and analysis A two-armed non-inferiority randomised controlled trial will be conducted. In total, 156 patients with hip and/or knee OA will be recruited from physiotherapy clinics in primary care in Norway. Following patient education, patients will be randomised to either 6 weeks of standard treatment (2 weekly sessions of supervised exercise therapy) or experimental treatment (home exercises via the Virtual Training (VT) app). Primary outcome is the proportion of Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) responders at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes include physical performance, patient-reported outcomes related to pain, fatigue, disease activity, physical function, mental health, health related quality of life, self-efficacy, utilisation of healthcare services and medication, digital competence and use of apps.
   Ethics and dissemination Patients will sign an informed consent form before participating in the trial. Approval has been granted by the Regional Ethics Committee (201105) and Data Protection Officer at Diakonhjemmet Hospital (00221). Patient research partners will contribute in all parts of the study.

The length of the bridge is 711 m, and a main span of 298 m. At the time of completion, the bridge had the words longest span for this type of bridge.
   The cost of the project is 471 mill NOK. The initial estimated cost was 502 mill NOK.
   The construction work has not started at part 2 of the project. The planning/design work has been very time consuming due to the conflict between environmental and road interests. The Norwegian Parliament made a decision in December 1998 about the location of the road alignment.
   Technical data for part two:
   Total length 30 km. Total length of tunnels 9,4 km. Two bridges 300 m and 200 m.

TI  - A bibliometric review of grid parity, energy transition and electricity cost research for sustainable development
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - As the topic of sustainable development continues to prominence in global affairs, the case for renewable energy has never been stronger. To be regarded as a perfect alternative to conventional (non-renewable) energy sources in many climes, renewable energy, such as solar and wind, shows promise when considering concepts like grid parity. A significant number of studies have been devoted to understanding the concept. However, only a few studies have committed themselves to analysing the research activity carried out on it. This paper will present a bibliometric and empirical review of worldwide grid parity, energy transition, and electricity cost research. To situate the progress in this research area, a detailed search of Scopus was used to identify and situate research development in the field from 1965 until 2021. Using the data extracted from Scopus and VOSviewer for analysis, we explore different aspects of the publications, such as the volume, growth rate, and coverage of published documents, the most influential research papers and journals in this research area, and the most studied research themes in recent years. We also discuss Governmental policies in developed and developing economies that have accelerated the attainment of Grid parity in certain countries. Also, an empirical review of top-down, bottom-up, and artificial neural network approaches to evaluating grid parity was conducted. The study revealed a steady increase in the research articles focused on grid parity, energy transition, and electricity cost research from 2006. The geographic distribution of the publications shows that most of the publications on the subject originated from the USA, Germany, China, United Kingdom, and Spain, raking in 42.2% of the publications. Also, the top 7 authors with the highest document count from Scopus are from Finland, which coincidentally is one of the countries making significant progress in Grid parity attainment. Of the total document count from Scopus, only 0.02% are papers published from African Countries. Could this reluctance to publish research findings on energy transition be one of the reasons for the slow progression of sustainable energy for all in Africa? Therefore, it is imperative now more than ever for more research focusing on the attainment of grid parity, energy transition, and electricity costs for developing countries to be brought to the fore. This article provides a review of state-of-theart research on the attainment of grid parity and energy transition with a focus on the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) models of renewable energy sources.

TI  - Plant life management and modernisation: Research challenges in the EU
T2  - NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN
CP  - 7th European Commission Conference on Euratom Research and Training in Reactor Systems (FISA) on Nuclear Engineering and Design
AB  - The European network of excellence NULIFE (nuclear plant life prediction) has been launched with a clear focus on integrating safety-oriented research on materials, structures and systems and exploiting the results of this integration through the production of harmonised lifetime assessment methods. NULIFE will help provide a better common understanding of the factors affecting the lifetime of nuclear power plants which, together with associated management methods, will help facilitate safe and economic long-term operation of existing nuclear power plants. In addition, NULIFE will help in the development of design criteria for future generations of nuclear power plant.
   NULIFE was kicked-off in October 2006 and will work over a 5-year period to create a single organization structure, capable of providing harmonised research and development (R&D) at European level to the nuclear power industry and the related safety authorities. Led by VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland), the project has a total budget in excess of 8 million euros, with over 40 partners drawn from leading research institutions, technical support organizations, electric power utilities and manufacturers throughout Europe. NULIFE also involves many industrial organizations and, in addition to their R&D contributions, these take part in a dedicated End User Group.
   Over the last 15 years the European Commission has sponsored a significant number of R&D projects under the Euratom Framework Programme and its Joint Research Centre has developed co-operative European Networks for mutual benefits on specific topics related to plant life management. However, their overall impact has been reduced due to fragmentation. These networks are considered forerunners to NULIFE. The importance of the long-term operation of the plants has been recognized at European level, in the strategic research agenda of SNETP (Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform). In NULIFE, the joint EU-wide coordinated research strategy for plant life integrity management and long-term operation has been defined.
   Mapping exercise of expertises performed under NULIFE confirmed that NULIFE R&D resources are versatile and high quality. In addition to the wide range of technical expertise available, these are widely spread at geographical and organizational level. Four expert groups, with identified members and links to national programmes, have now produced state-of-the-art type reports related to their expertises. Stress corrosion cracking and thermal fatigue pilot projects have finished concluding reports. Several project proposals have been introduced and optimised for new NULIFE pilot projects or other R&D projects.
   Based on NULIFE business plan, the discussion of long-term business plan, operational model and statute of the future NULIFE institute has been started. NULIFE maintains the sustainability of nuclear power by focusing on the continued, 60+ years of safe operation of nuclear power plants. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Frankincense yield is related to tree size and resin-canal characteristics
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Boswellia papyrifera Hochst. is the most important global source of frankincense. Tree numbers are rapidly decreasing in many populations of B. papyrifera in Ethiopia, where most of the internationally traded frankincense comes from. Improper tapping is among the frequently mentioned reasons for this decrease within populations. We still lack sustainable techniques for frankincense tapping, and these techniques are not yet tuned to individual trees since we are unaware how tree characteristics influence frankincense yield. This study investigates the relationships between different tree characteristics and their relation to frankincense yield. We selected 53 trees and measured frankincense yield and their DBH, tree age, number of leaf apices, radial growth, bark thickness, total resin-canal area, and total number of resin canals in a cross-section. Regression and path analysis were used to unravel cause-effect relationships between tree characteristics and frankincense yield. Frankincense yield was independent of the actual radial growth rate, but increased with increasing total resin-canal area in the bark, stem diameter, tree age, and the number of leaf apices. We show that frankincense yield by trees is not only a simple function of tree size. Remarkably, trees that grew slower over their whole life history produced more frankincense, suggesting an intra-specific trade-off in growth rate and frankincense production. Overall, this study thus shows that frankincense production is the result of complex plant trait networks and long term tree life properties. The results contribute to management regimes that minimize the damage to trees, while maximizing benefits in terms of frankincense yield and can also be used for selection and propagation of trees which are well suited for frankincense production.

TI  - Wood ant colouration as an ecological indicator for the level of disturbance in managed coniferous forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - The search for ecological indicators of population well-being in natural and managed ecosystems is a crucial aspect of effective biomonitoring, conservation and nature protection. In long-term monitoring programs environmental stress has a measurable effect on naturally selected traits, such as body shape or size. However, changes in colouration provide information about early warning responses. The red wood ant Formica aquilonia is ecologically and territorially dominant among wood ant species in European boreal coniferous forest, and possesses variable red-brownish melanin-based cuticular colouration. F. aquilonia gynes, which are unfertilized queens, exhibit colour variability on the head, propodeum and abdomen, yet only head colour features allow setting clearly visible and symmetrical (left/right) classes of morphs. We studied phenotypic colour variability, melanisation and fluctuating asymmetry of colour patterns in faces of F. aquilonia gynes from natural (forest interiors) and disturbed (clear-cut zones and forest edges) habitats in Finland. We defined five variable, clearly visible and symmetrical (left/right) colour morphs of gynes' faces. Individuals of totally dark morph were present only in disturbed habitats. General analyses of melanisation degree showed, that gynes from disturbed habitats were significantly darker compared to those from forest interiors. Individuals from the same nest tend to have a similar degree of melanisation. The mean darkness of face was highest among individuals from forest-edge nests and the lowest from forest interior nests. In all habitat types the darkness of face increased with an increase in head width. Increase of cuticular melanisation in F. aquilonia gynes in disturbed habitats could be explained with the theory of thermal melanism and stress-induced immune defence. Although some amount of fluctuating asymmetry among left/right symmetrical colour variations on faces of F. aquilonia gynes was found, it was affected neither by habitat type nor by head width. Melanisation degree of red wood ants have a potency to be used as ecological indicator for the level of disturbance in managed coniferous forests and fluctuating asymmetry of colour variations in ants might be studied furtherly in cases of more severe environmental concerns.

TI  - Phosphorus use efficiency in agricultural systems: A comprehensive assessment through the review of national scale substance flow analyses
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - This paper redefined the agricultural production system and its subsystems with respect to phosphorus (P) flow to improve the assessment of the phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), which is a key indicator for P security and sustainability of water resources. It also assessed the key P inflows, outflows, and PUE in the crop-pasture subsystem, livestock subsystem and the overall agricultural production system to present a comparative picture for these systems across various nations. PUE in the overall agricultural production system (averaged as 46% for the selected thirteen nations) is lower compared to the crop-pasture subsystem (averaged as 72%) but is higher than the livestock subsystem (averaged as 18%). Nations with high PUE in the crop-pasture subsystems usually showed high PUE in the overall agricultural production system. The proportional contribution of the livestock subsystem to the PUE of the overall agricultural production system is substantially higher than the crop-pasture subsystem for a number of EU countries (e.g., Netherlands (85%), Norway (84%), Switzerland (80%)), while the contribution of the crop-pasture subsystem is higher for some Asian countries (e.g., Bangladesh (93%) and India (87%)) and USA (80%). This study indicates that there is a high potential for improving PUE in the agricultural production system of Asian countries particularly through diverting manure-bound P from non-agricultural land or unproductive use to agricultural lands. This study suggests that shifting more towards crop production for plant-based food from animal feed/pasture production for animal-based food (meat) could improve PUE in the agricultural production system. Knowledge gaps identified and limitations addressed in this study could be useful for improving future national scale substance flow analyses (SFAs) of P for the better assessment of P flow and PUE in the agricultural production system.

TI  - Climate change, non-indigenous species and shipping: assessing the risk of species introduction to a high-Arctic archipelago
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
AB  - AimAnticipated changes in the global ocean climate will affect the vulnerability of marine ecosystems to the negative effects of non-indigenous species (NIS). In the Arctic, there is a need to better characterize present and future marine biological introduction patterns and processes. We use a vector-based assessment to estimate changes in the vulnerability of a high-Arctic archipelago to marine NIS introduction and establishment.
   LocationGlobal, with a case study of Svalbard, Norway.
   MethodsWe base our assessment on the level of connectedness to global NIS pools through the regional shipping network and predicted changes in ocean climates. Environmental match of ports connected to Svalbard was evaluated under present and future environmental conditions (2050 and 2100 predicted under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario). Risk of NIS introduction was then estimated based on the potential for known NIS to be transported (in ballast water or as biofouling), environmental match, and a qualitative estimate of propagule pressure.
   ResultsWe show that Svalbard will become increasingly vulnerable to marine NIS introduction and establishment. Over the coming century, sea surface warming at high latitudes is estimated to increase the level of environmental match to nearly one-third of ports previously visited by vessels travelling to Svalbard in 2011 (n=136). The shipping network will then likely connect Svalbard to a much greater pool of known NIS, under conditions more favourable for their establishment. Research and fishing vessels were estimated to pose the highest risk of NIS introduction through biofouling, while ballast water discharge is estimated to pose an increased risk by the end of the century.
   Main conclusionsIn the absence of focused preventative management, the risk of NIS introduction and establishment in Svalbard, and the wider Arctic, will increase over coming decades, prompting a need to respond in policy and action.

TI  - Increased air humidity and understory composition shape short root traits and the colonizing ectomycorrhizal fungal community in silver birch stands
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Climate change is predicted to bring about a rise in precipitation and air humidity at northern latitudes, which could have considerable impact on forest management. This paper investigates the effect of increased air humidity and understory composition on short root morphology and on the relative abundance of colonizing ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungal associates in silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) stands.
   Short root morphological traits of silver birch were analyzed at increased humidity and ambient conditions for two different understories (early-successional grasses and diverse "forest" understory) in three consecutive years (2009-2011). The fungal community was determined in 2010 (after three seasons of misting) using molecular methods. The study was conducted on the Free Air Humidity Manipulation (FAHM) experimental facility established in Estonia.
   Silver birches responded to the rise in air humidity by forming longer and thinner short roots, which can be interpreted as a morphological adaptation leading to an increase in the absorptive area. The response was stronger when humidification concurred with the species-poor understory of pioneer grasses. The inter- and intra-treatment variation in short root morphological parameters decreased by the third year. Using molecular methods, overall 64 EcM taxonomic units were distinguished. Hydrophilic fungal morphotypes dominated significantly in humidified plots, hydrophobic morphotypes in control plots.
   Our results suggest that rising air humidity causes a morphological stress response in EcM short roots. Young trees show the ability to adapt to climate change with great plasticity by modifying short root length, diameter and specific root length (SRL). Humidification leads to a shift in the fungal colonizers towards the dominance of hydrophilic taxa, which may alter ecosystem functioning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Walking distances to public transport in smaller and larger Norwegian cities
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT
AB  - This paper contributes to the scarce empirical knowledge concerning distances and durations of walking trips to public transport in smaller cities and in European cities. Results show that walking trips to local public transport stops last 4.1-6.0 min (328-520 m), on average, in different cities, and walking trips to railway stations last 6.6-8.6 min (528-688 m). Walks are longer on the workplace side than on the home side of the journey. Walking distances to local public transport stops increase with city size. Short trips to stops increase the likelihood of using public transport for commutes. Survey results suggest that higher frequencies and direct connections are more important than shorter walks to stops to make more people commute by public transport in the smaller cities. The results may be relevant for smaller and larger cities aiming to improve public transport competitiveness versus the private car on commutes.

TI  - Environmental Change at Deep-Sea Sponge Habitats Over the Last Half Century: A Model Hindcast Study for the Age of Anthropogenic Climate Change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
AB  - Deep-sea sponges inhabit multiple areas of the deep North Atlantic at depths below 250 m. Living in the deep ocean, where environmental properties below the permanent thermocline generally change slowly, they may not easily acclimatize to abrupt changes in the environment. Until now consistent monitoring timeseries of the environment at deep sea sponge habitats are missing. Therefore, long-term simulation with coupled bio-physical models can shed light on the changes in environmental conditions sponges are exposed to. To investigate the variability of North Atlantic sponge habitats for the past half century, the deep-sea conditions have been simulated with a 67-year model hindcast from 1948 to 2014. The hindcast was generated using the ocean general circulation model HYCOM, coupled to the biogeochemical model ECOSMO. The model was validated at known sponge habitats with available observations of hydrography and nutrients from the deep ocean to evaluate the biases, errors, and drift in the model. Knowing the biases and uncertainties we proceed to study the longer-term (monthly to multi-decadal) environmental variability at selected sponge habitats in the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. On these timescales, these deep sponge habitats generally exhibit small variability in the water-mass properties. Three of the sponge habitats, the Flemish Cap, East Greenland Shelf and North Norwegian Shelf, had fluctuations of temperature and salinity in 4-6 year periods that indicate the dominance of different water masses during these periods. The fourth sponge habitat, the Reykjanes Ridge, showed a gradual warming of about 0.4 degrees C over the simulation period. The flux of organic matter to the sea floor had a large interannual variability, that, compared to the 67-year mean, was larger than the variability of primary production in the surface waters. Lateral circulation is therefore likely an important control mechanism for the influx of organic material to the sponge habitats. Simulated oxygen varies interannually by less than 1.5 ml/l and none of the sponge habitats studied had oxygen concentrations below hypoxic levels. The present study establishes a baseline for the recent past deep conditions that future changes in deep sea conditions from observations and climate models can be evaluated against.

TI  - Achievements and Challenges in Improving Temperate Perennial Forage Legumes
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN PLANT SCIENCES
AB  - The expected move towards more sustainable crop-livestock systems implies wider cultivation of perennial forage legumes. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa subsp. sativa) is the main perennial legume in most temperate regions, especially where farm systems rely largely on forage conservation. White clover (Trifolium repens) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) are dominant in specific regions and farm systems. Although breeding progress for disease and insect resistance has been achieved, these crops have shown lower rates of genetic gain for yield than major grain crops, owing to lower breeding investment, longer selection cycles, impossibility to capitalize on harvest index, outbreeding mating systems associated with severe inbreeding depression, and high interaction of genotypes with cropping conditions and crop utilizations. Increasing yield, persistence, adaptation to stressful conditions (drought; salinity; grazing) and compatibility with companion grasses are major breeding targets. We expect genetic gain for yield and other complex traits to accelerate due to progress in genetic resource utilization, genomics resource development, integration of marker-assisted selection with breeding strategies, and trait engineering. The richness in adaptive genes of landraces and natural populations can be fully exploited through an ecological understanding of plant adaptive responses and improved breeding strategies. Useful genetic variation from secondary and tertiary gene pools of Medicago and Trifolium is being increasingly accessed. Genome sequencing projects in alfalfa and white clover will enrich physical, linkage and trait maps. Genome sequences will underpin fine mapping of useful loci and subsequent allele mining, leveraging the synteny of these crops with M. truncatula. Low-cost genome-wide markers generated through genotyping-by-sequencing will make genomic selection for adaptation and forage yield possible for these crops. Genetic markers will also be used for dissecting quantitative traits and developing toolboxes of functional markers for stress tolerance and other traits. Under current regulatory policies, transgenic approaches are likely to be limited to a few breakthrough traits. The key challenge for future applications of genomics technologies is their seamless integration with breeding system logistics and breeding schemes.

TI  - Relative pollen productivities of the major plant taxa of subtropical evergreen-deciduous mixed woodland in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE
AB  - Quantifying the relationship between pollen and vegetation is an essential step in the pollen-based quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation cover. In this study, we use the Extended R-Value (ERV) model and a modern dataset of pollen (collected from moss polsters) and related vegetation from 50 sites in the Daba Mountains (subtropical China) to (i) estimate the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) of the moss samples and the relative pollen productivities (RPPs) of nine major plant taxa-characteristic of the region, and (ii) evaluate the obtained RPPs. The RSAP estimates of moss polsters vary between 225 and 610 m depending on the ERV submodels and models of pollen dispersal and deposition used. The RPP estimates are different from values published in previous studies from temperate and subtropical China. This may be explained by differences in methodology, climate and vegetation (species composition and spatial distribution), of which vegetation is probably the most important factor. The ranking of the RPP estimates for the nine taxa is Pinus > Juglandaceae > D - Quercus (deciduous Quercus) > Poaceae > Rosaceae > Cyperaceae > Anacardiaceae > Castanea > Fabaceae. We use a 'leave-one-out' cross-validation strategy and the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) for pollen-based reconstruction of regional and local plant cover to evaluate the ERV model-based RPP estimates. Both the REVEALS (Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites)-based and the LOVE (LOcal Vegetation Estimates)-based plant cover using the RPP estimates are closer to the modern vegetation composition than pollen percentages, thus confirming the applicability of the ERV model and the LRA approach in subtropical China.

TI  - Integrated modelling of Atlantic mackerel distribution patterns and movements: A template for dynamic impact assessments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Modelling is important for impact assessments of anthropogenic pressures on wildlife. Models are particularly useful when dealing with complex dynamic systems (as pelagic ecosystems) where data are limited and if various 'what if' scenarios should be tested. The aim of this study was to produce and implement an integrated modelling approach, linking high resolution hydrodynamic models (HDM) of the marine environment with correlative species distribution models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM), for describing the spatio-temporal distribution and movements of Atlantic mackerel (Scornber scombrus) in the Norwegian Sea. The SDM was fitted with scientific mackerel trawl data as response variables (collected in July and August 2006-2014) and temperature (from the HDM), water depth and time period as predictors of spatial distributions. The SDM was able to produce dynamic predictions of a similar order of magnitude as observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) as well as realistic large-scale distribution patterns, when tested on independent data (not included in the modelling). The ABM was calibrated, with normalized SDM predictions (habitat suitability as a proxy for food availability) and hydrodynamics as input and simulated on a single year (2013) for the period May-October, when the migratory mackerel is present in the study area. A pattern-oriented modelling (POM) approach was used to verify if the model reproduced multiple observed real-world patterns. The ABM produced similar patterns as observed regarding migration timing, growth and large scale geographic distribution. Fine scaled information on mackerel movement and behaviour is limited, which is also reflected in the results. More data and knowledge are therefore required to improve the patterns emerging from fine scaled processes. The potential of the model for assessing an impact of a single seismic survey (mimicking a real survey) was finally evaluated. The exercise allowed estimating the number of affected fish (within 50 km from the sound source) and potential changes in local migrations, with the specific assumed minimum sound pressure thresholds (resulting in a fleeing reaction by the mackerel) set to 165 dB re 1 mu Pa. The model framework was shown to be useful by allowing simulations of impact scenarios in a realistic and dynamic environment. The model can be further updated when data on fine scale movements of mackerel and most importantly when improved data on response behaviour to impacts of sound become available.

AB  - Despite the growth of the research on lean and green manufacturing systems, consideration of how circular economy principles complement lean has been virtually absent from the literature due to a mismatch between research on lean green, which has focused on the internal manufacturing operations (product and process levels), and research on the circular economy, which takes a broader, more holistic view of environmental impact (the system level). Only a few researchers have considered the lean and the circular together. We argue that there is a need to understand the complementarities and conflicts between "lean" and "circularity". By combining the system level with process and product levels, this paper highlights which potentials in a lean manufacturing context are identified from a circular perspective and how to realize them. In this paper, we present a critical case study conducted at a Swedish manufacturing firm/original equipment manufacturer within the heavy-duty and off-road (HDOR) industry. Our results show that the company is locked into a lean and linear production, where material waste is not seen as a resource. We present how the three levels interplay and argue that they be combined when trying to integrate circular measures into this context.

TI  - European Water Framework Directive and its impact on water transport in the European Union
T2  - INLAD WATERWAYS; PORTS AND CHANNELS; AND THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT
CP  - 84th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - As a result of the July 1999 European Summit held in Gothenburg, Sweden, all European Union policy areas are subject to the guiding principle of sustainable development. Within this context, the European Commission published a white paper on transport policy to 2010, focusing on the need to foster more environmentally and socially sustainable means of transport to achieve a modal shift away from road transport. The white paper mentions inland navigation as a mode with great potential to contribute to a shift toward more sustainable modes than roads and recognizes that among other measures, infrastructural improvements must be realized on the European waterways. However, European environmental legislation, namely, the Water Framework Directive (WFD), is likely to challenge the strategy of necessary improvements on European waterways. The target conflict arising from environmental legislation that is capable of contradicting efforts to ensure sustainability in the transport sector is examined. Within this context, several aspects of WFD are described: development; the current implementation status in the national law of European Union member states and the potential consequences for waterway infrastructure, dredging, and navigability; and the general role of inland navigation in a competitive transport market. Possible instruments foreseen in the WFD to balance the interests of environmental concerns and those of the navigation sector are also addressed.

TI  - Predictability of repeated carnivore attacks on livestock favours reactive use of mitigation measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. Predation on livestock is one of the main reasons for low tolerance against large carnivores in many parts of the world. Measures to reduce the conflicts have been developed, but resources for using them are often scarce. If wildlife managers as well as farmers learn more about when the risk of predation on livestock is higher, they will be able to make more effective use of resources for reducing predation.
   2. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the risk of predation on livestock immediately after an attack is higher on the affected farm compared with other farms in the same area. Data on sheep predation by brown bear Ursus arctos, lynx Lynx lynx and wolf Canis lupus in Sweden 1998-2006 were used in the analysis.
   3. On depredated farms there was approximately a 55 times higher risk for a repeat predation event within 12 months compared to any other farm in the same area. During the first 5 weeks, 63%, 60% and 50% of the repeat attacks had occurred.
   4. We suggest that the main mechanism behind repeat attacks on livestock is that carnivores return to the kill site to feed on carrion. Where livestock are still present and unprotected at the kill site when the carnivore returns, the farms will suffer a higher likelihood of a further attack compared to livestock on other farms. This study uses data from Sweden but we argue that the pattern will be the same in any part of the world where the ranges of livestock and large carnivores overlap.
   4.Synthesis and applications. As the risk of an attack is higher directly after an initial attack, it will be more cost-effective to implement measures designed to reduce livestock predation by large carnivores at that time, i.e. within the following 5 weeks. Temporary proactive measures are usually simpler and cheaper than permanent deterrents and we recommend their use wherever resources are limited.

TI  - Not planning a sustainable transport system
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
AB  - The overall objective of the Swedish transport policy is to ensure the economically efficient and sustainable provision of transport services for people and business throughout the country. More specifically, the transport sector shall, among other things, contribute to the achievement of environmental quality objectives in which the development of the transport system plays an important role in the achievement of the objectives. The aim of this study is to analyse if current transport planning supports this policy. This is done by analysing two recent cases: the National Infrastructure Plan 2010-2021, and the planning of Bypass Stockholm, a major road investment. Our results show that the plans are in conflict with several of the environmental quality objectives. Another interesting aspect of the planning processes is that the long-term climate goals are not included in the planning processes, neither as a clear goal nor as factor that will influence future transport systems. In this way, the longterm sustainability aspects are not present in the planning. We conclude that the two cases do not contribute to a sustainable transport system. Thus, several changes must be made in the processes, including putting up clear targets for emissions. Also, the methodology for the environmental assessments needs to be further developed and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Social Acceptance of Wind Energy in Urban Landscapes
T2  - TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB  - Although wind energy has high potential as a sustainable energy source to fight climate change, and the post COVID-19 world may require accelerated transition to renewable energy systems, many wind energy projects nevertheless face community resistance. Research on social acceptance of wind energy has increased rapidly, but understanding still lacks regarding the different types of acceptance, whether or not the acceptance correlates with demographics, and what drives acceptance of wind farms in the urban landscape. Our analysis of 2,376 residents in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, focused on the gaps in understanding and identified three groups of people: Protagonists, Centrists, and Antagonists. While Protagonists are highly positive about wind energy projects in the city, Antagonists oppose them, and Centrists adopt a middle-of-the-road approach. Further, three factors matter for social acceptance in urban landscapes: 1) distance, as residents prefer offshore wind farms to be farther away from the city's inhabitants, 2) gender, as women are more accepting of wind energy compared with men, and outright opponents of wind energy are more likely men, and 3) participation, as residents wish to participate in decision-making processes regarding wind farms, but lack interest in having ownership of and responsibility for wind energy projects. The study discusses the implications of these findings for developers and policymakers of wind energy projects in the urban context.

TI  - Railway timetabling for the future? A pilot study on a single track line
T2  - JOURNAL OF RAIL TRANSPORT PLANNING & MANAGEMENT
AB  - No country uses optimisation methods to establish a value maximising allocation of operators' demand for scarce railway infrastructure. Using the same input as was used in the year 2020 (T20), when the official timetable for one specific line in Sweden was developed by the infra-structure manager, this paper presents the outcome of the combined use of dual optimisation and rapid branching to produce a solution to an actual optimisation problem. These methods generate a timetable with the same number of trains as in T20 and some qualities that are better than those of the official timetable. The pilot study therefore confirms that it is worthwhile to further develop formal optimisation mechanisms towards larger-scale applications. Being able to handle conflicts-of-interest on a single-track line means that the problem on a double track line has fewer restrictions.

TI  - The end of the "Ottoman harem": Turkish-Russian rivalry in the Black Sea in the 18th century
T2  - CAHIERS BALKANIQUES
AB  - Except for a few short and exceptional periods, the Black Sea was a major issue of competition and conflict between Russia and the Ottoman Empire throughout the 18th century. After two centuries of Ottoman domination, as soon as the Istanbul peace treaty was signed (June 13, 1700) the lock on the door of the <<harem>> jumped. From now on, the Russia of Peter the Great and Catherine II will know its irresistible territorial extension towards the south while radically modifying the Pontic geographical and human landscape, creating cities, industries and fleets. It took five armed conflicts between the two countries to finally end in an unnatural alliance because of Napoleon Bonaparte's Egyptian expedition. But it is only an accident of course, the raw reality will take back its rights.

TI  - Social Sustainability Work in Product Development Organizations: An Empirical Study of Three Sweden-Based Companies
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Companies responsible for product development (PD) and manufacturing play an important role in supporting society in achieving sustainability, and yet they do not always include full sustainability considerations in PD decisions. The social dimension of sustainability has been largely neglected in the PD field and there is very little empirical evidence of social sustainability implementation in general. The aim of this paper is to investigate how social sustainability is currently included in PD organizations and what their motivations are to do so. Results from a comparative case study approach with three organizations include rich descriptions across four dimensions: The scope of the work and their view of interdependencies with other social systems, their definition of social sustainability and the issues they work with, what guides strategic decisions, and how this internal work is structured. The results reveal that the three product development organizations are heterogenous in their approaches to social sustainability and that the more advanced approach shows a better understanding of the complexity of social sustainability and a broader perspective of its interdependencies, which goes hand-in-hand with a way of organizing that overcomes traditional hierarchies and allows for more collaborative and strategic work in this area. This systems perspective also drives what issues are included in an organization's work; scope and definition of social sustainability become more encompassing and aligned. Finally, our study shows that social sustainability impacts connected to products' lifecycles, when addressed, are done so by functions outside design activities, as opposed to product developers. A greater understanding of how companies currently approach social sustainability and what challenges they might face in integrating it in organizational and design related practices has been called for; our paper contributes to this but acknowledges that more work is needed.

TI  - Overview of potential geothermal reservoirs in Denmark
T2  - NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES-GEOLOGIE EN MIJNBOUW
AB  - The Danish onshore subsurface contains very large geothermal resources that have the potential to make a significant contribution to transforming Danish energy consumption toward a more sustainable energy mix. Presently, only a minor fraction of this green energy is exploited in three small plants. The main factors that have hampered and delayed larger-scale deployment are related to uncertainties in the geological models, which inevitably lead to high economic risks that are difficult for smaller district heating companies to mitigate without support from a compensation scheme. To facilitate and stimulate much wider use of the Danish geothermal resources, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) and other research institutes have conducted several regional research projects focusing on the geological and geochemical obstacles with the principal objective of reducing the exploration risks by selecting the best geological reservoirs. One of the most important geological factors causing uncertainty is the quality of the reservoirs and their ability to produce the expected volume of warm geothermal brine. Thus, great emphasis has been placed on investigating and understanding the relationships between reservoir sandstone, porosity, permeability, petrography, diagenetic processes and alterations related to variable sediment sources, basin entry points, depositional systems and climate, burial and thermal history. Mesozoic sandstones comprise the most important geothermal reservoirs in Denmark. Details concerning the reservoir quality are compiled and compared for the Lower Triassic Bunter Sandstone, Triassic Skagerrak, Upper Triassic - Lower Jurassic Gassum and Middle Jurassic Haldager Sand formations. The Bunter Sandstone Formation contains extensive aeolian and more confined fluvial sandstones with high porosity and permeability. However, highly saline formation water could be unfavourable. The Skagerrak Formation comprises well-sorted braided stream sandstones in the centre of the basin, and is otherwise characterised by muddy sandstones and alluvial fan conglomerates. An immature mineralogical composition has caused intensive diagenetic changes in the deepest buried parts of the basin. The Gassum Formation consists of shoreface, fluvial and estuarine sandstones interbedded with marine and lacustrine mudstones. In the upper part of the formation, the sandstone beds pinch out into mudstones towards the basin centre. Pervasive siderite- and calcite cement occurs locally in shallowly buried sandstones, and with burial depth the maximum abundances of quartz and ankerite cement increase. Sandstones of shallow burial represent excellent reservoirs. The relatively coarse grain size of the Haldager Sand Formation results in high porosity and permeability even at deep burial, so the formation comprises a high-quality geothermal reservoir. Substantial progress has been made, and a well-established regional geological model combined with reservoir quality is now available for areas with cored wells. This has enabled an improved estimation of reservoir quality between wells for exploration of geothermal reservoirs.

TI  - Is There Progress towards Environmental Sustainability among Road Haulage Companies?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Road freight transport contributes to a significant and growing share of greenhouse gas emissions. This study analyses the development of environmental practices and awareness of road freight hauliers and whether hauliers witness an interest from their shippers towards energy efficiency. Results of an original survey (N = 256) conducted in 2019 among Finnish hauliers are presented and compared with those from a similar survey completed in 2011 (N = 295). The results highlight the lack of improvement in hauliers' environmental practices during a decade when ambitious climate goals were set. Even though hauliers share the view that emissions from road freight transport must be reduced in future, their environmental practices did not change much during the 2010s. The hauliers rarely perceive an interest from their shippers towards energy efficiency. The results show that hauliers should be supported and encouraged to pursue more environmentally aware practices. Shippers in the supply chain should be a driver, not an obstacle, to increasing road hauliers' sustainability. There should be more communication between hauliers and supply chain actors, and environmental sustainability should gain more importance when selecting carriers.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES (HICSS 2016)
CP  - 49th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - Cooperation and competition have traditionally been considered separate modes of interaction between firms. Recent research, however, observes that firms simultaneously engage in cooperation and competition with each other. Still the interplay of these modes is under-researched and surprisingly little is known about the nature of 'coopetition'. Our objective with this paper is to build new revelatory theory on the various facets of coopetition in vertical IT standardization and discuss their respective implications for environmental sustainability. We rely on an eleven year study of a standard development effort aimed at greening the Swedish road haulage industry. Framing analysis is applied to scrutinize relations between cooperative modes and competitive behaviors of participating firms. The findings help explicate how and why stabilized cooperation may render intensified competition that undermines IT standardization efforts to green an industry. Our theorizing about this paradoxical tension paves the way for future network studies of coopetition dynamics in converging industries.

TI  - Fine root growth and element concentrations of Norway spruce as affected by wood ash and liquid fertilisation
T2  - PLANT AND SOIL
AB  - A field experiment to test various management practices of sustainable forestry was conducted in a Swiss spruce forest for two growing seasons. Treatments were a control (C), yearly application of 4000 kg ha(-1) wood ash (A), daily irrigation with a steady state fertilisation as 'optimal nutrition' (F) and irrigation with a water control (W). Samples were taken on a 5 x 5 m grid once a year with a soil corer to determine fine root biomass (less than or equal to 2 mm) and soil pH of the topsoil. A subset of the fine root samples was further analysed for its nutrient composition by CN and ICP-AES analyses. The dynamics of root growth were observed with the aid of ingrowth-cores after 1, 1.5, and 2 years of treatment and the growth pattern was analysed in terms of biomass, tips, forks, length and root diameter of the samples. The A, F and also the W treatment resulted in a significant increase of soil pH in the topsoil. The fine root density increased over the two growing seasons, irrespective of the treatment. The root growth was only slightly different between the treatments with a initially faster growth under the A treatment. The W treatment reduced the number of root tips and forks, and the root length, while the A treatment increased the number of root tips, forks and the root length, but reduced the diameter. The differences between the three harvesting times (March 1999, October 1999, March 2000) of the ingrowth-cores stressed seasonal differences in root growth and the development of quasi 'steady state' root dynamics. The root turnover was not changed by the treatments. The elements in the fine roots were strongly affected by the treatments A and F and sometimes by W. Fine root N increased with the F treatment, while C concentrations decreased under the A, F and W treatments. The Ca and Mg concentrations were strongly enhanced by A but also by the F treatment. The K and P concentrations in the fine roots were improved by all three applications. Due to the pH increase Al, Fe and Mn concentrations in the fine roots were decreased by the A and F treatments. S and Zn concentrations showed inconsistent changes over the growing seasons. The results of this study were comparable with those of other studies in Europe and confirm the abilities of the fine roots as indicators of forest nutrition, to some extent more sensitive than the commonly used foliar analysis.

TI  - Food-web structure and mercury dynamics in a large subarctic lake following multiple species introductions
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - The rate of non-native fish introductions into freshwater ecosystems has more than doubled during the past three decades, posing a serious threat to native biodiversity. Despite potential benefits for fisheries, little is known about how introduced species interact with native communities at the food-web level, or impact energy transfer dynamics and accumulation of contaminants in lake ecosystems. Here, we explored the trophic structure of a large, oligotrophic subarctic lake and assessed the trophic niche use and potential ecosystem-wide consequences of two introduced salmonid species: piscivorous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and zooplanktivorous vendace (Coregonus albula). We used a combination of diet, stable isotope and total mercury concentration data to test the hypotheses that the introduced fishes: (i) show partial niche overlap with the native fish community; (ii) increase total isotopic food-web size and dietary linkages by increasing the diversity of niches present within the system, in comparison to analyses where only the native species were considered; and (iii) have differing mercury bioaccumulation rates from native species due to differences in trophic ecology and habitat preferences, being higher in pelagicthan in littoral species. Trophic interactions between the introduced and native species were extensive, with evidence of reciprocal predation, resource competition and possible competitive exclusion apparent. Despite partial niche overlap with native species, the inclusion of introduced species in our analysis increased both total isotopic niche space and the number of dietary linkages present in the food web. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that introduced vendace may have led to a shift in system-wide reliance on pelagically derived energy, whereas generalist foraging by piscivorous lake trout may have further integrated littoral and pelagic food-web compartments. Mercury bioaccumulation rates were highly species-specific and varied among habitats, but were generally higher in the pelagic food-web compartment. However, contrary to expectations, vendace had lower mercury levels than native pelagic species, potentially reducing the extent of biomagnification within the lake. Our study demonstrates how introduced fishes may elicit complex and unpredictable responses in food-web structure and ecosystem function, and thus complicate contaminant bioaccumulation and transfer processes within freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - The Effect of Short-Term Upwelling Events on Fish Assemblages at the South-Eastern Coast of the Baltic Sea
T2  - WATER
AB  - Multiple stressors, such as overfishing, pollution, climate change, biological invasions etc., are affecting fish communities, and thus can have versatile effects on marine ecosystems and socio-economic activities as well. Understanding the changes in the fish community structure is ecologically and economically important, yet a very complex issue, requiring comprehensive analysis of multiple factors. The role of regional oceanographic variability, namely, coastal upwelling, is often neglected when it comes to the analysis of fish assemblages. In this perspective, we were aiming, for the first time in the Baltic Sea, to assess the upwelling influence on fish communities and fish community-based ecological indices used under Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The study covered a long-term period (2000-2019) for upwelling identified by satellite data analysis and fish gillnet surveys, performed in three distinct locations in the coastal waters of the SE Baltic Sea. Overall, our study revealed that temporal dynamics of fish abundance and community composition were associated with the presence of coastal upwelling. The study outcomes suggest that the fish community was more diverse and a higher number of some fish species was observed before upwelling. During upwelling, there was more evident dominance of 1-2 main marine fish species. Through the changes in fish abundance and species composition upwelling was also responsible for the changes in fish community structure-based indices for marine environment status, i.e., in the majority of the cases a decrease in Trophic, Piscivorous Fish, and Diversity indices were observed. Our study demonstrates that upwelling can affect both, the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of coastal fish communities, therefore, it is important to consider this when predicting shifts in the distribution of fish stocks or assessing environmental status indicators, especially under changing climate. We believe that our approach adds novel information to the study of coastal ecosystems of the Baltic Sea and is important for better management of socio-economic activities in the coastal zone.

TI  - Detection of Standing Deadwood from Aerial Imagery Products: Two Methods for Addressing the Bare Ground Misclassification Issue
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Deadwood mapping is of high relevance for studies on forest biodiversity, forest disturbance, and dynamics. As deadwood predominantly occurs in forests characterized by a high structural complexity and rugged terrain, the use of remote sensing offers numerous advantages over terrestrial inventory. However, deadwood misclassifications can occur in the presence of bare ground, displaying a similar spectral signature. In this study, we tested the potential to detect standing deadwood (h > 5 m) using orthophotos (0.5 m resolution) and digital surface models (DSM) (1 m resolution), both derived from stereo aerial image matching (0.2 m resolution and 60%/30% overlap (end/side lap)). Models were calibrated in a 600 ha mountain forest area that was rich in deadwood in various stages of decay. We employed random forest (RF) classification, followed by two approaches for addressing the deadwood-bare ground misclassification issue: (1) post-processing, with a mean neighborhood filter for "deadwood"-pixels and filtering out isolated pixels and (2) a "deadwood-uncertainty" filter, quantifying the probability of a "deadwood"-pixel to be correctly classified as a function of the environmental and spectral conditions in its neighborhood. RF model validation based on data partitioning delivered high user's (UA) and producer's (PA) accuracies (both > 0.9). Independent validation, however, revealed a high commission error for deadwood, mainly in areas with bare ground (UA = 0.60, PA = 0.87). Post-processing (1) and the application of the uncertainty filter (2) improved the distinction between deadwood and bare ground and led to a more balanced relation between UA and PA (UA of 0.69 and 0.74, PA of 0.79 and 0.80, under (1) and (2), respectively). Deadwood-pixels showed 90% location agreement with manually delineated reference to deadwood objects. With both alternative solutions, deadwood mapping achieved reliable results and the highest accuracies were obtained with deadwood-uncertainty filter. Since the information on surface heights was crucial for correct classification, enhancing DSM quality could substantially improve the results.

LIBS is ideally suited for their fast and effective measurement, but matrix effects complicate quantitative geological LIBS applications due to the extensive amount of different minerals, rock types, and lithologies, as well as all textural and optical parameters increasing physical matrix effects. This is challenging for the application of LIBS in geological exploration, since LIBS data processing highly depends on matrix-matched models. The fast acquisition of new data is in conflict with the large amount of existing minerals and lithologies. As a result, new appearances are common during ongoing drilling campaigns, resulting in incomplete train sets for supervised classification and quantification. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) classification model to resolve related issues by separating known minerals in geological drill cores based on a set of train samples, while also detecting unknown material, i.e. new lithologies and/or minerals not in the train set. Using a combination of supervised Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and semi-supervised One-Class Support Vector Machines (OC-SVM), main minerals and known accessory minerals were effectively separated from unknown material in LIBS mappings of Spodumene and Muscovite pegmatite, as well as from Metagreywacke in drill cores from the Rapasaari lithium deposit in Finland. Self-learning was applied to automatically increase the number of train samples, which effectively decreased the number of unknowns due to physical matrix effects in coherent crystals. Validation with respect to the main minerals revealed an almost perfect classification of albite, spodumene, K feldspar, quartz, and muscovite. Measurement points of Metagreywacke, which were only included in the test set, were correctly detected as unknown. Transferring the developed model onto LIBS mappings and drill core profile measurements displayed excellent classification results for main and accessory minerals included in the train set. Mixed spectra at mineral borders, as well as accessory minerals not in the train set were correctly identified as unknown.

TI  - Academic response to improving value and reducing waste: A comprehensive framework for INcreasing QUality In patient-oriented academic clinical REsearch (INQUIRE)
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
AB  - Background
   Compelling evidence has demonstrated that a large proportion of investment in biomedical research is wasted; this waste is avoidable. Academic institutions have, thus far, shown limited response to recommendations for increasing value and reducing waste. We formulated an academic response by (i) achieving consensus across a wide range of stakeholder groups on a comprehensive framework for quality of patient-oriented clinical research and (ii) highlighting first successful examples of its operationalization to facilitate waste-reducing strategies at academic institutions.
   Methods and findings
   Based on a systematic review of quality definitions, concepts, and criteria in the medical literature (systematic MEDLINE search up to February 15, 2015, with independent and in duplicate article selection) and on stakeholder websites from 13 countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States), we systematically developed a comprehensive framework for the quality of clinical research. We identified websites through personal contacts with experts in clinical research or public health who also suggested, for each country, websites of the following 7 stakeholder groups: patient organizations; academic research infrastructures; governmental bodies; regulatory agencies; ethics committees; the pharmaceutical industry; and funding agencies. In addition, we searched websites of inter-or supranational bodies involved in clinical research until no further insights emerged. After consolidation of the identified definitions, concepts, and criteria of quality in a basic framework structure, we conducted 4 rounds of an adapted online Delphi process among the same 7 stakeholder groups from 16 countries. The Delphi process ultimately achieved consensus on structure and content. The framework addresses 5 study stages (concept, planning and feasibility, conduct, analysis and interpretation, and reporting and knowledge translation) and includes the following dimensions: (i) protection of patient safety and rights, (ii) relevance/patient centeredness and involvement, (iii) minimization of bias (internal validity), (iv) precision, (v) transparency/access to data, and (vi) generalizability (external validity) of study results. These dimensions interact with 2 promoters-infrastructure and sustainability through education-that include a set of factors that may enhance all listed quality dimensions. Each quality dimension contains specific questions and explanatory items that guide quality assessment at each research stage from conceptualization of the research question through reporting and knowledge translation of study results. In the last survey round, Delphi participants from 9 countries (Austria, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, and US) agreed on the structure, content, and wording of the research stages, quality dimensions, specific questions, and descriptive examples of the final framework. In Switzerland, INQUIRE has resulted in a roadmap that guides initiatives to increase value within the Swiss Clinical Trial Organization network and through affiliated researchers.
   Conclusions
   We present a framework based on a consensus of different stakeholder groups guiding the practical assessment of clinical research quality at all stages of a research project. Operationalization of this common structure will support the increase of value by guiding academic institutions and researchers in developing quality enhancement initiatives, from posing the right research question to the transparent publication of results.

TI  - Reality Lab Digital Railway - Digitalisation for Sustainable Development
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS AND WORKSHOP ON INDUSTRIAL AI 2021
CP  - International Congress and Workshop on Industrial Artificial Intelligence (IAI)
AB  - This paper summarizes the project "Reality Lab Digital Railway" (VDJ). The goal of the project is to open up Trafikverket's core business within railway for the development and demonstration of digital information solutions that are tested by primary actors and end users. The project is mainly financed by Vinnova and Trafikverket.
   The implementation takes place within the framework of Trafikverket's main process "Research and develop innovation" and in accordance with Trafikverket's project model (XLPM). The project is carried out in close collaboration with the project "ePilot" at Lulea Railway Research Centre (JVTC). A key project strategy is to address prioritised stakeholder needs through various initiatives to increase Trafikverket's ability to contribute to the project goal.
   The results of the project can be summarized in regulations, organization, roles and technologies that contribute to Trafikverket's ability to achieve the project goals. Examples of results are methodologies and tools for establishing and actively managing a more dynamic regulatory framework that clarifies the need for innovation as well as the specification of the application of digital technologies to strengthen the industry's ability. To support industry collaboration during development and demonstration projects, physical and digital assets as well as IT-solutions have also been established. The project has also produced proposals for agreements regarding information management between Trafikverket and external parties.
   The future organization of VDJ will mainly be based on informal and formal competence networks, both within Trafikverket and externally. The approach is based on existing processes related to research and innovation, testing activities and the development of systems and components. In order to enable ongoing operations within VDJ at Trafikverket, the following functions and activities are central:
   A platform for receiving, storing, analysing and providing large amounts of industrial information. This platform should be able to be used during all stages of development, testing and ongoing operations.
   Standardized agreements with operators and system suppliers regarding management of asset-related information. This is to support demonstration, testing and application of vehicle-based solutions for monitoring the infrastructure.
   Adaptation of maintenance contracts to support development and demonstration in railway operations. This is in addition to today's opportunity for research and innovation projects to use amendments, additions and outgoing work in the maintenance contracts.
   Further development of implemented methodologies and tools to identify functions to monitor so that they also meet the requirements for traffic safety within railway. This is to support a more active management of dynamic maintenance programs and strategies, which in turn support the identification and establishment of need-based solutions for monitoring of the railway infrastructure.

TI  - Habitat selection by adult Golden Eagles <i>Aquila</i> <i>chrysaetos</i> during the breeding season and implications for wind farm establishment
T2  - BIRD STUDY
AB  - Capsule: Global Positioning System (GPS)-tagged adult Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos breeding in forests in northern Sweden selected clear-cuts, coniferous forests with lichens and steep slopes during the breeding season but avoided wetlands and mixed forest.
   Aims: To investigate the habitat selection patterns of tree-nesting Golden Eagles, and identify how potential conflicts with wind farm development could be minimized.
   Methods: The study is based on GPS tracking data from 22 adult eagles. We estimated home range sizes using a biased random bridge approach and habitat selection patterns using resource selection functions following a use-availability design.
   Results: Core home range size among adults was variable during the breeding season (5-30 km(2)). Individual movement extents were variable, but sexes did not significantly differ in their scale of movement. At the landscape scale, individuals selected for clear-cuts and coniferous forest with ground lichens, whereas wetland, water bodies and mixed forest were avoided. Steeper and south facing slopes were selected for, whereas, north facing slopes were avoided.
   Conclusions: Potential conflicts between eagles and wind energy establishment can be reduced if wind farms are placed away from steep slopes, minimizing areas that are clear-cut during construction, and locating turbines within dense, young and other less favoured forest habitats.

TI  - Using Complexity Assessment to Inform the Development and Deployment of a Digital Dashboard for Schizophrenia Care: Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Health care is becoming more complex. For an increasing number of individuals, interacting with health care means addressing more than just one illness or disorder, engaging in more than one treatment, and interacting with more than one care provider. Individuals with severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are disproportionately affected by this complexity. Characteristic symptoms can make it harder to establish and maintain relationships. Treatment failure is common even where there is access to effective treatments, increasing suicide risk. Knowledge of complex adaptive systems has been increasingly recognized as useful in understanding and developing health care. A complex adaptive system is a collection of interconnected agents with the freedom to act based on their own internalized rules, affecting each other. In a complex health care system, relevant feedback is crucial in enabling continuous learning and improvement on all levels. New technology has potential, but the failure rate of technology projects in health care is high, arguably due to complexity. The Nonadoption, Abandonment, and challenges to Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework and complexity assessment tool (NASSS-CAT) have been developed specifically to help identify and manage complexity in technology-related development projects in health care.
   Objective: This study aimed to use a pilot version of the NASSS-CAT instrument to inform the development and deployment of a point-of-care dashboard supporting schizophrenia care in west Sweden. Specifically, we report on the complexity profile of the project, stakeholders' experiences with using NASSS-CAT, and practical implications.
   Methods: We used complexity assessment to structure data collection and feedback sessions with stakeholders, thereby informing an emergent approach to the development and deployment of the point-of-care dashboard. We also performed a thematic analysis, drawing on observations and documents related to stakeholders' use of the NASSS-CAT to describe their views on its usefulness.
   Results: Application of the NASSS framework revealed different types of complexity across multiple domains, including the condition, technology, value proposition, organizational tasks and pathways, and wider system. Stakeholders perceived the NASSS-CAT tool as useful in gaining perspective and new insights, covering areas that might otherwise have been neglected. Practical implications derived from feedback sessions with managers and developers are described.
   Conclusions: This case study shows how stakeholders can identify and plan to address complexities during the introduction of a technological solution. Our findings suggest that NASSS-CAT can bring participants a greater understanding of complexities in digitalization projects in general.

TI  - Systems view of future of wicked problems to be addressed by the Common Agricultural Policy
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
AB  - Public policies address societal problems. The problems chased by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) have been persistent. The institutional and political economy reasons for this setting have been discussed widely, but the role of the problems lack robust analysis. This study contributes to an explicit understanding of the CAP problems as a system of wicked problems. Wicked problems escape simple and final solutions and form an interconnected 'jam', where each resolution generates a cascade of new problems and collateral damages.
   The CAP problematics are analysed with the systems dynamics methodology, causal loop diagrams. A system of CAP problems was reconstructed based on the content analysis of survey data for 52 Finnish experts, representing various dimensions of the CAP in a balanced manner. Abstraction and categorisation of the 303 listed problems to be addressed by the CAP in the future resulted in 22 key problems under five domains (socio-environmental, spatial, policy, market, farming). The problems formed three agglomerations with reinforcing causal loops: the subsystems of competitiveness, sustainability, and heterogeneity. The full system of CAP problems comprised 114 causal links across all five domains. The problems also had varying positions in the network regarding connectivity and causation. For example, multidimensional sustainable development qualified as the most networked problem, free trade with divergent farming regulations was the most extensively wired driver problem, and competitiveness and incomes in agriculture was the most extensively connected dependent problem. Extending the time horizon from 2020 to 2040 indicates that the negative impact of climate change on food production capacity and food security would accentuate; otherwise, the CAP policy makers would be stuck with, more or less, path-dependent problematics.
   The results confirm that CAP problems exhibit all ten properties of wicked problems and constitute a tightly wired and evolving complex adaptive system. Solutions to these types of problems should not be chased with a domain-specific approach, as spatial, farming, market, or environmental problems, but rather as networked, driver, dependent, and punctuated problems observing systems dynamics. This problem network status strongly affects the possibilities and feasible means to find better trade-offs between the problems; notably, complete solutions should not be expected due to the systemic and wicked properties of the CAP problems.

TI  - Pioneer oribatid mite communities (Acari, Oribatida) in newly exposed natural (glacier foreland) and anthropogenic (post-industrial dump) habitats
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
AB  - A new habitat for many inhabitants is created as a result of glacier retreating or spoil-heap construction and these sites provide a unique experimental field for studying primary succession. The general aim of the study was to characterize oribatid fauna established in the first stage of successional process - colonization phase - on new land surfaces, e.g. deglaciated areas and post-industrial dumps. Five microhabitats in the front of two outlets (Ni-gardsbreen and Austerdalbreen) of the Jostedal Glacier (SW Norway) and four reclaimed and non-reclaimed post-industrial dumps (Southern Poland) were chosen to study an earliest successional stage.
   Moderately diverse oribatid fauna was developed on glacier forelands or post-industrial dumps within a few years. Pioneer oribatid communities were not initially similar, especially in species composition. The pool of oribatid species, which were capable of performing the role of colonists, was broad. Fifteen species were found as dominants on nine studied plots. Oppiella nova (Oudemans, 1902) and Lauroppia neerlandica (Oudemans, 1900) were associated with the glacier foreland at Nigardsbreen, whereas Oromurcia bicuspidata Thor 1930 and Trichoribates novus (Sellnick, 1928) were typical of the foreland at Austerdalbreen. Colonizer species appearing within the first years of colonization on the non-reclaimed and reclaimed dumps were also different. Small species of weak sclerotization, representatives of the family Brachychtoniidae (e. g. Sellnickochthonius immaculatus Forsslund, 1942 and Liochthonius piluliferus (Forsslund, 1942) dominated on the non-reclaimed dumps, whereas Ctenobelba obsoleta (C.L. Koch, 1841), Scheloribates laevigatus (C.L. Koch, 1836) and Scutovertex sculptus Michael, 1879, bigger species of strong sclerotization, were the most numerous on the reclaimed dumps. Only Tectocepheus velatus (Michael, 1880) occurred as a dominant at most sites. Parthenogenetic species as well as bisexual successfully invaded glacier foreland and post-industrial dumps. The phenomenon of random colonization in the pioneer stages is well proved on glacier forelands and dumps. However, the process is possibly non-random and depends on the characteristics of an individual species. Although oribatids are known as,slow colonizers of new habitats, they were the most numerous group of mites at some sites on glacier forelands and on reclaimed dumps. It is well evidenced that the reclamation measures carried out on post-industrial dumps introduces an element of randomness in the succession of oribatid fauna.

TI  - Models of good practice to enhance infectious disease care cascades among people who inject drugs: a qualitative study of interventions implemented in European settings
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - BackgroundPeople who inject drugs (PWID) in Europe are at an increased risk of HIV/AIDS, chronic viral hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV), and tuberculosis (TB). We aimed to complement the evidence base on interventions optimising their care cascade with evidence from models of good practice (MoGPs) implemented in the EU/EEA and countries from the Eastern European region.MethodsA model of good practice (MoGP) was defined as (a package of) interventions with proven effectiveness in certain settings that are likely to be replicable and sustainable in other settings or countries. Fifteen MoGPs, identified by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) following a call launched in 2020, have been analysed. For the 15 MoGPs, a qualitative content analysis was conducted of (i) intervention characteristics and (ii) enabling factors. Information was extracted and summarised for community-based testing, linkage to care and adherence to treatment.ResultsMoGPs emerged from projects implemented in Belarus, Norway, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, Spain, and the UK alongside the multi-country HepCare project (Ireland, Romania, Spain, the UK) targeting either HCV (6/15) or HIV/AIDS (4/15), alone or combined with HBV, and/or TB (5/15). All MoGPs used packages of interventions, with decentralisation of services (15/15), cooperation among service providers (14/15), integrated services (10/15), peer interventions (12/15), and case management (4/15) reported across all stages of the care cascade. The synthesis of enablers shows that when replicating interventions in other settings, consideration should be given to national (legal) frameworks, characteristics of and proximity between healthcare and service providers, and establishing relations of trust with PWID.ConclusionTo improve the cascade of care for PWID in European settings, care structures and pathways should be simplified, based on cooperation and multidisciplinary. MoGPs can provide implementation-based evidence on interventions alongside evidence from peer-reviewed literature to optimise the care cascade among PWID.

TI  - A Historical Analysis on Interoperability in Estonian Data Exchange Architecture: Perspectives from the Past and for the Future
T2  - 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THEORY AND PRACTICE OF ELECTRONIC GOVERNANCE (ICEGOV 2021)
CP  - 14th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance (ICEGOV)
AB  - The importance of interoperability for enabling e-governance and e-service provision cannot be overstated. In Estonia, the interoperability data exchange platform, X-Road, has been implemented since 2001 and was integrated with the Finnish public sector in 2018. In the context of the EU, it is an exceptional case of a cross-border interoperability platform. However, the Estonian government has proposed next generation government e-services using virtual assistants. This may necessitate potential changes to X-Road if the members from its collectively governed body, Nordic Institute for Interoperable Services (NIIS) decide to do so. Thus, this paper seeks to understand how X-Road developed historically related to European Interoperability Framework principles while also providing an outlook for the future based upon this next generation e-service concept. An exploratory case-study approach was adopted, and six semi-structured interviews were conducted with the architects, developers and public sector officials of the original and current version of X-Road. A thematic analysis was then applied. Based on this analysis, the decision to decentralize the initial X-Road helped create sustainable interoperability supported by legislation written at the time and since then. Future work is presented involving the integration of microservices on an abstract level.

TI  - Stronger disciplinary identities in multidisciplinary research schools
T2  - STUDIES IN CONTINUING EDUCATION
AB  - In this study, two multidisciplinary Social Sciences and Humanities research schools in Sweden have been investigated regarding disciplinary identity-making. This study investigates the meetings between different disciplines around a common thematic area of study for Ph.D. students. The Ph.D. students navigate through a complex social and organisational landscape with obligations and loyalties towards the discipline and the research school, which may be in conflict with each other. The main finding is that a multidisciplinary environment in fact creates strong disciplinary identities, partly in contrast to the purpose with the multidisciplinary research school. Encounters with Ph.D. students from other disciplines give the Ph.D. student something to relate to and to discuss e.g. with the supervisor. Another finding is that multidisciplinary research schools extend the perspectives of students. For some, new methods and theories from neighbouring disciplines were integrated and used, while for others the empirical scope of research was affected.

TI  - Analysis of the occurrence and severity of vehicle-pedestrian conflicts in marked and unmarked crosswalks through naturalistic driving study
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Background: Although many studies have been conducted on the safety of pedestrian crossings, few researches have been focused on drivers' behavior in unmarked crosswalk and marked crosswalk areas. Considering that statistics of pedestrian accidents are not the same in the two types of crossing area, based on the last report of the World Health Organization, it is very critical to evaluate driver yielding behavior to determine the differences in the actions of drivers when encountering pedestrians in the two areas.
   Methods: This study was conducted based on surrogate measures of safety (SMoS) collected through a Naturalistic Driving Study on 52 participants in Iran. The study was carried out from April 2017 to April 2018 using the installation of cameras in the private vehicle of the participants. The analysis of the recorded films showed that 956 conflicts have occurred in unmarked crosswalks and 392 conflicts in marked crosswalks, respectively.
   Results: A model was developed for driver yielding behavior using binary logistic regression, and showed that yielding rates in unmarked crosswalsk were about fifty percent of the yielding rates in marked crosswalks. Based on the model, it is indicated that the aggressive behavior of pedestrians during the crossing, such as running, zigzag and diagonal crossing, as well as the late detection of pedestrians by drivers resulting from high-speed driving in the unmarked crossing areas, will reduce the yielding behavior rate. Also, using the Swedish traffic conflicts technique, the severity of the conflicts was classified into four general categories: encounter, potential, slight, and serious conflict, through 30 different levels on the basis of conflicting speed and time to the accident. The results showed that pedestrians behavior during conflicts of the group "encounter" and drivers' behavior during conflicts of the groups of "potential", "slight" and "serious", were the principal factors in preventing collision through an evasive maneuver. The results showed that increasing the level of conflict severity, which indicates an increase of the conflicting speed and a decrease of the time remaining to point of a possible collision with pedestrian, causes drivers to yield a harsh-maneuver to prevent collision. Soft-maneuvers such as deceleration and acceleration, as well as harsh-maneuvers such as changing the lane/stop during conflicts were most driver yielding behavior during conflict groups of slight and serious. According to the results of the analysis, the behavior of drivers in marked crossing areas is better than in the unmarked crossing area, leading to safer crossing for pedestrians.
   Conclusions: This study suggests that the significant differences in driver yielding behavior in the two areas is due to the late detection of pedestrians by drivers and also the less proper action by them in unmarked crosswalk areas. Thus, the probability of accidents in Unmarked Crossing areas is higher than in marked crossing areas. Consequently, the design of improved advanced driver assistance systems to identify the risk of pedestrian accident may improve the driver yielding behavior and thus increase the safety of pedestrians.

TI  - Forest tree species adaptation to climate across biomes: Building on the legacy of ecological genetics to anticipate responses to climate change
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Intraspecific variation plays a critical role in extant and future forest responses to climate change. Forest tree species with wide climatic niches rely on the intraspecific variation resulting from genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to accommodate spatial and temporal climate variability. A centuries-old legacy of forest ecological genetics and provenance trials has provided a strong foundation upon which to continue building on this knowledge, which is critical to maintain climate-adapted forests. Our overall objective is to understand forest trees intraspecific responses to climate across species and biomes, while our specific objectives are to describe ecological genetics models used to build our foundational knowledge, summarize modeling approaches that have expanded the traditional toolset, and extensively review the literature from 1994 to 2021 to highlight the main contributions of this legacy and the new analyzes of provenance trials. We reviewed 103 studies comprising at least three common gardens, which covered 58 forest tree species, 28 of them with range-wide studies. Although studies using provenance trial data cover mostly commercially important forest tree species from temperate and boreal biomes, this synthesis provides a global overview of forest tree species adaptation to climate. We found that evidence for genetic adaptation to local climate is commonly present in the species studied (79%), being more common in conifers (87.5%) than in broadleaf species (67%). In 57% of the species, clines in fitness-related traits were associated with temperature variables, in 14% of the species with precipitation, and in 25% of the species with both. Evidence of adaptation lags was found in 50% of the species with range-wide studies. We conclude that ecological genetics models and analysis of provenance trial data provide excellent insights on intraspecific genetic variation, whereas the role and limits of phenotypic plasticity, which will likely determine the fate of extant forests, is vastly understudied.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS
AB  - Exotic plants often face different conditions from those experienced where they are native. The general issue of how exotics respond to unfamiliar environments within their new range is not well understood. Phenotypic plasticity has historically been seen as the primary. mechanism enabling exotics to colonize large, environmentally diverse areas. However, new work indicates that exotics can evolve quickly, suggesting that contemporary evolution may be more important in invasion ecology than previously appreciated. To determine the influence of contemporary evolution; phenotypic plasticity, and founder effects in affecting phenotypic variation among introduced plants, we compared the size, fecundity, and leaf area of St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) collected from native European and introduced western and central North American populations in common gardens in Washington, California, Spain, and Sweden. We also determined genetic relationships among these plants by examining variation in amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers.
   There was substantial genetic variation among introduced populations and evidence for multiple introductions of H. perforatum into North America. Across common gardens introduced plants were neither universally larger nor more fecund than natives. However, within common gardens, both introduced and native populations exhibited significant latitudinally based clines in size and fecundity. Clines among introduced populations broadly converged with those among native populations. Introduced and native plants originating from northern latitudes generally outperformed those originating from southern latitudes when grown in northern latitude gardens of Washington and Sweden. Conversely, plants from southern latitudes performed best in southern gardens in Spain and California. Clinal patterns in leaf area, however, did not change between gardens; European and central North American plants from northern latitudes had larger leaves than plants from southern latitudes within these regions in both Washington and California, the two gardens where this trait was measured. Introduced plants did not always occur at similar latitudes as their most closely related native progenitor, indicating that pre-adaptation (i.e., climate matching) is unlikely to be the sole explanation for clinal patterns among introduced populations. Instead, results suggest that introduced plants are evolving adaptations to broad-scale environmental conditions in their introduced range.

TI  - A Remote Mode Master Degree Program in Sustainable Energy Engineering: Student Perception and Future Direction
T2  - TEACHING AND LEARNING IN A DIGITAL WORLD, VOL 1
CP  - 20th International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL)
AB  - Remote mode higher education at postgraduate level is becoming popular among students because of flexible learning opportunity and the accessibility to study programs offered by renowned universities in the world. Fast development of internet facilities and learner management systems along with the development of remote educational pedagogy have been the driving force behind the acceptance and development of distant mode study programs. The success of such a study programs is largely affected by several factors that are unique to the university that offers the study program and the demography of participants as well as infrastructure and the student support available at the receiving end.
   In the present study, the successes and the drawbacks as perceived by the participants of a distant master study program are evaluated. The study program considered was the Sustainable Energy Engineering Worldwide (SEEW) master degree program which was offered by the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden to students in Sri Lanka (Apart from Sri Lanka, SEEW was offered by KTH to some other countries; Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Mauritius). The objective of offering the SEEW master program was to assist the developing nations to build up human resources with expertise in sustainable energy generation and utilization, hence contributing to national development. As such the program also generally contributes to global efforts of alleviating unfavourable environmental impacts connected with power generation and utilization. The SEEW master program consisted of 120 ECTS (ECTS: European Credit Transfer System) and the courses were offered over three semesters followed by a research project of 30 ECTS during the fourth semester. Lectures were delivered synchronous with the parallel KTH on-campus study program in real time through internet with the support of a learner management system. The students were attached to the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL) for providing academic support where necessary and for the supervision of written and online examinations. The first enrolment consisted of 21 students in intake 2008 and the program was conducted with varying student numbers until the intake 2010. A total of 72 students have successfully completed the SEEW program and they are at presently employed in key organizations in the energy sector as well as in national universities in Sri Lanka.
   The paper focusses on eight key areas that the students have identified as vital for success for this type of programs. These key areas are the effectiveness of web tools used, standard of teaching, standard of course content, examination procedures, online assessment, thesis projects, benefit to the students, and benefits to facilitating university. In the study 36 students responded to survey and overall rating of the program successfulness was identified as 72%.

TI  - The changing culture of silviculture
T2  - FORESTRY
AB  - Changing climates are altering the structural and functional components of forest ecosystems at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, we are seeing a diversification of public expectations on the broader sustainable use of forest resources beyond timber production. As a result, the science and art of silviculture needs to adapt to these changing realities. In this piece, we argue that silviculturists are gradually shifting from the application of empirically derived silvicultural scenarios to new sets of approaches, methods and practices, a process that calls for broadening our conception of silviculture as a scientific discipline. We propose a holistic view of silviculture revolving around three key themes: observe, anticipate and adapt. In observe, we present how recent advances in remote sensing now enable silviculturists to observe forest structural, compositional and functional attributes in near-real-time, which in turn facilitates the deployment of efficient, targeted silvicultural measures in practice that are adapted to rapidly changing constraints. In anticipate, we highlight the importance of developing state-of-the-art models designed to take into account the effects of changing environmental conditions on forest growth and dynamics. In adapt, we discuss the need to provide spatially explicit guidance for the implementation of adaptive silvicultural actions that are efficient, cost-effective and socially acceptable. We conclude by presenting key steps towards the development of new tools and practical knowledge that will ensure meeting societal demands in rapidly changing environmental conditions. We classify these actions into three main categories: re-examining existing silvicultural trials to identify key stand attributes associated with the resistance and resilience of forests to multiple stressors, developing technological workflows and infrastructures to allow for continuous forest inventory updating frameworks, and implementing bold, innovative silvicultural trials in consultation with the relevant communities where a range of adaptive silvicultural strategies are tested. In this holistic perspective, silviculture can be defined as the science of observing forest condition and anticipating its development to apply tending and regeneration treatments adapted to a multiplicity of desired outcomes in rapidly changing realities.

TI  - Mapping research activity on mental health disorders in Europe: study protocol for the Mapping_NCD project
T2  - HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS
AB  - Background: Mental health disorders (MHDs) constitute a large and growing disease burden in Europe, although they typically receive less attention and research funding than other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study protocol describes a methodology for the mapping of MHD research in Europe as part of Mapping_NCD, a 2-year project funded by the European Commission which seeks to map European research funding and impact for five NCDs in order to identify potential gaps, overlaps, synergies and opportunities, and to develop evidence-based policies for future research.
   Methods: The project aims to develop a multi-focal view of the MHD research landscape across the 28 European Union Member States, plus Iceland, Norway and Switzerland, through a survey of European funding entities, analysis of research initiatives undertaken in the public, voluntary/not-for-profit and commercial sectors, and expert interviews to contextualize the gathered data. The impact of MHD research will be explored using bibliometric analyses of scientific publications, clinical guidelines and newspaper stories reporting on research initiatives. Finally, these research inputs and outputs will be considered in light of various metrics that have been proposed to inform priorities for the allocation of research funds, including burden of disease, treatment gaps and cost of illness.
   Discussion: Given the growing burden of MHDs, a clear and broad view of the current state of MHD research is needed to ensure that limited resources are directed to evidence-based priority areas. MHDs pose a particular challenge in mapping the research landscape due to their complex nature, high co-morbidity and varying diagnostic criteria. Undertaking such an effort across 31 countries is further challenged by differences in data collection, healthcare systems, reimbursement rates and clinical practices, as well as cultural and socioeconomic diversity. Using multiple methods to explore the spectrum of MHD research funding activity across Europe, this project aims to develop a broad, high-level perspective to inform priority setting for future research.

TI  - Variability of soil enzyme activities and vegetation succession following boreal forest surface soil transfer to an artificial hill
T2  - NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA
AB  - A landfill site in southern Finland was converted into urban green space by covering it with a layer of fresh forest humus transferred from nearby construction sites. The aim was to develop the 70 m high artificial hill into a recreational area with high biodiversity of flora and fauna. Forest humus was used as a source of organic matter, plant roots, seeds, soil fauna and microorganisms in order to enable rapid regeneration of diverse vegetation and soil biological functions. In this study we report the results of three years of monitoring of soil enzyme activity and plant species compositional patterns. Monthly soil samples were taken each year between June and September from four sites on the hill and from two standing reference forests using three replicate plots. Activities of 10 different enzymes, soil organic matter (SOM) content, moisture, pH and temperature of the surface layer were monitored. Abundances of vascular plant species were surveyed on the same four hill sites between late May and early September, three times a season in 2004 and 2005. Although the addition of organic soil considerably increased soil enzyme activities (per dw), the activities at the covered hill sites were far lower than in the reference forests. Temporal changes and differences between sites were analysed in more detail per soil organic matter (SOM) in order to reveal differences in the quality of SOM. All the sites had a characteristic enzyme activity pattern and two hill sites showed clear temporal changes. The enzyme activities in uncovered topsoil increased, whereas the activities at the covered Middle site decreased, when compared with other sites at the same time. The different trend between Middle and North sites in enzyme activities may reflect differences in humus material transferred to these sites, but difference in the succession of vegetation affects enzyme activities strongly. Middle yielded higher beta-sitosterol content in 2004, as an indication of more intense plant impact. All reclaimed sites had characteristic plant species assemblages and parallel temporal changes, reflecting vegetation succession, occurred across all the sites. Rapid growth of vegetation on the covered sites restored the rhizosphere and contributed to the persistence of microbial activity. We suggest that transferring the surface soil humus layer is a useful approach for ensuring the outcome of habitat restoration and complementary habitat creation especially in situations where the source soil areas would otherwise be lost.

TI  - Number and cost of claims linked to minor cervical trauma in Europe: results from the comparative study by CEA, AREDOC and CEREDOC
T2  - EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL
AB  - Comparative epidemiological study of minor cervical spine trauma (frequently referred to as whiplash injury) based on data from the Comite Europeen des Assurances (CEA) gathered in ten European countries. To determine the incidence and expenditure (e.g., for assessment, treatment or claims) for minor cervical spine injury in the participating countries. Controversy still surrounds the basis on which symptoms following minor cervical spine trauma may develop. In particular, there is considerable disagreement with regard to a possible contribution of psychosocial factors in determining outcome. The role of compensation is also a source of constant debate. The method followed here is the comparison of the data from different areas of interest (e.g., incidence of minor cervical spine trauma, percentage of minor cervical spine trauma in relationship to the incidence of bodily trauma, costs for assessment or claims) from ten European countries. Considerable differences exist regarding the incidence of minor cervical spine trauma and related costs in participating countries. France and Finland have the lowest and Great Britain the highest incidence of minor cervical spine trauma. The number of claims following minor cervical spine trauma in Switzerland is around the European average; however, Switzerland has the highest expenditure per claim at an average cost of is an element of 35,000.00 compared to the European average of is an element of 9,000.00. Furthermore, the mandatory accident insurance statistics in Switzerland show very large differences between German-speaking and French- or Italian-speaking parts of the country. In the latter the costs for minor cervical spine trauma expanded more than doubled in the period from 1990 to 2002, whereas in the German-speaking part they rose by a factor of five. All the countries participating in the study have a high standard of medical care. The differences in claims frequency and costs must therefore reflect a social phenomenon based on the different cultural attitudes and medical approach to the problem including diagnosis. In Switzerland, therefore, new ways must be found to try to resolve the problem. The claims treatment model known as "Case Management" represents a new approach in which accelerated social and professional reintegration of the injured party is attempted. The CEA study emphasizes the fundamental role of medicine in that it postulates a clear division between the role of the attending physician and the medical expert. It also draws attention to the need to train medical professionals in the insurance business to the extent that they can interact adequately with insurance professionals. The results of this study indicate that the usefulness of the criterion of so-called typical clinical symptoms, which is at present applied by the courts to determine natural causality and has long been under debate, is inappropriate and should be replaced by objective assessment (e.g. accident and biomechanical analysis). In addition, the legal concept of adequate causality should be interpreted in the same way in both third party liability and social security law, which is currently not the case.

TI  - Colouring the Human Landscapes <i>Lennart Nilsson and the Spectacular World of Scanning Electron Micrographs</i>
T2  - NUNCIUS-JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE
AB  - This article explores the relationship between Swedish photographer Lennart Nilsson's scanning electron micrographs and commercial culture from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s. By retracing how Nilsson's micrographs of the internal structures of the human body were made, circulated, and received, its aim is to investigate three aspects of this relationship. First, it highlights how the complex and sometimes conflicting interplay between the photographer and various actors in science, industry and the media shaped the pictures and their trajectories. Second, it analyses the processes used to colour Nilsson's original black-and-white micrographs in relation to tendencies in the media and the advertising industry during this period. Third, it examines what motivated Nilsson and his collaborators in their use of colour and also the critical debates concerning the spectacular and commercial qualities of his pictures. In the concluding section, the implications of this analysis for the history of the objectivity of scientific images is discussed.

TI  - Distributional success of the marine seaweed Fucus vesiculosus L in the brackish Baltic Sea correlates with osmotic capabilities of Baltic gametes
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - To understand the unique success of the marine seaweed Fucus vesiculosus L. (Phaeophyceae) in the brackish Baltic Sea, the performance of gametes from Baltic [4.1-6.5 parts per thousand S (Salinity)] and marine populations was studied. Sperm from Baltic F. vesiculosus swam with a path velocity of c. 30-110 mu m/s and could fertilize eggs in waters of salinities from 4 to 33 parts per thousand S. In their natural water, Baltic sperm were not negatively phototactic, unlike marine sperm in seawater; this should decrease the sperm:egg concentration at the seafloor and reduce the likelihood of polyspermy. Marine (Iceland, Sweden) sperm in seawater had a path velocity of c. 80-100 mu m/s, but performed poorly and could not fertilize eggs in natural or artificial Baltic water less than or equal to 6 parts per thousand S; therefore, Baltic populations have adapted or acclimated to their brackish habitat. Baltic populations appear better adapted to their natural low salinities because, even after culturing Baltic and marine individuals in water from both the Baltic (6.5 parts per thousand S) and the marine Skagerrak (21 parts per thousand S), Baltic sperm were in both cases still able to swim and fertilize eggs at lower salinities (4 parts per thousand S) than marine sperm; fertilization never occurred between marine gametes at 4-6 parts per thousand S. However, F. vesiculosus acclimates to some salinities, since sperm from Baltic and marine males that had been cultured at 21 parts per thousand S swam better (higher velocity, proportion that were motile and/or linearity) in marine salinities (21-33 parts per thousand S) than when they were cultured at 6.5 parts per thousand S. The effects of salinity on sperm motility and fertilization were osmolar rather than due to specific ionic requirements, over the tested range. The osmolalities (< c. 100 mmol/kg) at which fertilization success of Baltic gametes decreases nearly to zero correspond to the osmolality of Baltic water at the northernmost limit of distribution of F. vesiculosus in the Baltic Sea. Therefore, the present range of F. vesiculosus in the Baltic appears to correspond to the osmotic tolerance of the gametes. Very small natural or anthropogenic increases in ambient osmolality would be likely to cause a substantial expansion of this species into the inner Baltic.

TI  - Landscape variations in stream water SO<sub>4</sub><SUP>2-</SUP> and δ<SUP>34</SUP>S<sub>SO4</sub> in a boreal stream network
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Despite reduced anthropogenic deposition during the last decades, deposition sulphate may still play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of S and many catchments may act as net sources of S that may remain for several decades. The aim of this study is to elucidate the temporal and spatial dynamics of both SO42- and delta S-34(SO4) in stream water from catchments with varying percentage of wetland and forest coverage and to determine their relative importance for catchment losses of S. Stream water samples were collected from 15 subcatchments ranging in size from 3 to 6780 ha, in a boreal stream network, northern Sweden. In forested catchments (<2% wetland cover) S-SO42- concentrations in stream water averaged 1.7 mg L-1 whereas in wetland dominated catchments (>30% wetland cover) the concentrations averaged 0.3 mg L-1. A significant negative relationship was observed between S-SO42- and percentage wetland coverage (r(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001) and the annual export of stream water SO42- and wetland coverage (r(2) = 0.76 p < 0.001). The percentage forest coverage was on the other hand positively related to stream water SO42- concentrations and the annual export of stream water SO42- (r(2) = 0.77 and r(2) = 0.79, respectively). The annual average delta S-34(SO4) value in wetland dominated streams was +7.6%omicron. and in streams of forested catchments +6.7%omicron. At spring flood the delta S-34(SO4) values decreased in all streams by 1%omicron to 5%omicron. The delta S-34(SO4) values in all streams were higher than the delta S-34(SO4) value of +4.7%omicron in precipitation (snow). The export of S ranged from 0.5 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1) (wetland headwater stream) to 3.8 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1) (forested headwater stream). With an average S deposition in open field of 1.3 kg S ha(-1) yr(-1) (2002-2006) the mass balance results in a net export of S from all catchments, except in catchments with >30% wetland. The high temporal and spatial resolution of this study demonstrates that the reducing environments of wetlands play a key role for the biogeochemistry of S in boreal landscapes and are net sinks of S. Forested areas, on the other hand were net sources of S. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Life cycle impacts of three-way ceramic honeycomb catalytic converter in terms of disability adjusted life year
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Catalytic converters in vehicles reduce emissions while the use of platinum group metals (PGMs) in them have negative health impacts both in the PGMs mining stage and at the end-of-life PGM recycling stage. This study was conducted to weigh the production-recycling phase impacts and the use phase benefits of a three-way honeycomb catalytic converter by using the disability adjusted life year (DALY) indicator over its cradle-to-cradle life cycle. We have combined the environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) approach with a method to account the workplace impact on human health, which may be adopted in social LCA. In general, a catalytic converter causes more loss of lives (11 days) then it saves (4.5 days) under the egalitarian value perspectives for the baseline production scenario with 160,000 km functional life. Contrary to that, under the same scenario and service life, the catalytic converter saves lives (5.5 days and approx. 6 days for the hierarchist and individualist perspectives, respectively) than it causes loss (about 1 day and 0.6 days for the hierarchist and individualist perspectives, respectively). The geographical hotspot analysis reveals that, while the catalytic converter save lives in Sweden where it is used; it causes more loss of lives elsewhere in the world, particularly in South Africa and Russia. Overall, the DALY varies between 0.62 days and 11.3 days, mainly due to differences in value perspectives. The study showed that increased use of recycled platinum group metals, extended functional life of the catalytic converter may alter the health balance of the product system. This human health-focused cradle to cradle life cycle case study identified methodological issues that need further attention, like development of occupational DALY characterization factors (CFs) for the countries involved in the production of three-way ceramic honeycomb catalytic converter, and emission DALY CFs for PGEs during the use phase of catalytic converter. From scenario analysis, it is observed that, the rise of electric vehicles may drastically alter the social lives lost impacts of catalytic converter. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Distribution and transport of radionuclides in a boreal mire - assessing past, present and future accumulation of uranium, thorium and radium
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
CP  - International Conference on Radioecology and Environmental Radioactivity (ICRER)
AB  - The spatial distribution of U-238, Ra-226, K-40 and the daughters of Th-232, Ra-228 and Th-228, were measured in a small mire in northern Sweden. High activity concentrations of U-238 and Th-232 (up to 41 Bq U-238 kg(-1)) were observed in parts of the mire with a historical or current inflow of groundwater from the surrounding till soils, but the activities declined rapidly further out in the mire. Near the outlet and in the central parts of the mire the activity concentrations were low, indicating that uranium and thorium are immobilized rapidly upon their entering the peat. The Ra-226 was found to be more mobile with high activity concentrations further out into the mire (up to 24 Bq kg(-1)), although the central parts and the area near the outlet of the mire still had low activity concentrations. Based on the fluxes to and from the mire, it was estimated that approximately 60-70% of the uranium and thorium entering the mire currently is retained within it. The current accumulation rates were found to be consistent with the historical accumulation, but possibly lower. Since much of the accumulation still is concentrated to the edges of the mire and the activities are low compared to other measurements of these radionuclides in peat, there are no indications that the mire will be saturated with respect to radionuclides like uranium, thorium and radium in the foreseen future. On the contrary, normal peat growth rates for the region suggest that the average activity concentrations of the peat currently may be decreasing, since peat growth may be faster than the accumulation of radionuclides. In order to assess the total potential for accumulation of radionuclides more thoroughly it would, however, be necessary to also investigate the behaviour of other organophilic elements like aluminium, which are likely to compete for binding sites on the organic material. Measurements of the redox potential and other redox indicators demonstrate that uranium possibly could be reduced in parts of the mire. The results of the study suggest that this mire currently is, and historically has been, an important sink for radionuclides and that it most likely will continue to be so for a long time to come.

AB  - The paper reports results obtained from an unusual situation in structural monitoring-a "test-to-destruction," measuring strain using a series of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) sensors on a decommissioned concrete Railway Bridge in Ornskiildsvik, Sweden. The study formed part of the EU "Sustainable Bridges" Project. To undertake the study, FBG-based sensors were chosen and embedded in carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) composite rods incorporated into grooves specially created in the concrete structure and interrogated using a compact system based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Throughout the study, the FBG sensors were continuously monitored, allowing the incremental increases in the strain to be seen and through the yield point of the carbon composite reinforcement. The sensors were able to follow the resulting induced changes in strain of over a range in excess of 4000 mu epsilon just prior to failure of the bridge and representing extreme levels of strain for such a mechanical structure. The measurements made with the FBG-based system were found to be in agreement with the changes expected in the structure (together with the embedded reinforcement), produced by the loading applied. The study has demonstrated the successful use of FBG-based technology premounted in "smart" carbon fiber composite reinforcements used in a test of this type on a typical bridge structure of a type found widely across the world.

TI  - The last occupation of Asine in Argolis
T2  - OPUSCULA-ANNUAL OF THE SWEDISH INSTITUTES AT ATHENS AND ROME
AB  - Kastraki Hill on the eastern Argolic Gulf, with visible remains of impressive fortifications, has been identified since the mid-19th century as the position occupied by the acropolis of ancient Asine. The first systematic excavations were carried out by the Swedish Institute in the 1920s and revealed the continuous habitation of the site from the Early Helladic period (3rd millennium BC) up to the late 4th-early 5th century AD. Many additions and repairs on the acropolis were made during the Byzantine period and the 2nd Venetian Occupation of the Peloponnese (16861715). However, the most destructive interventions in the area are the works carried out by the Italians during World War II. Fearing an invasion of the Allies on this side of the Peloponnese, the Italians fortified the acropolis by making additions to the ancient walls and constructing auxiliary buildings, pillboxes, observation posts and trenches around the rocky outcrop using materials from buildings of the Lower Town. Their departure after the war revealed the extent of the destruction of the antiquities. During the past few decades we have seen interest in approaching sites of recent conflict using archaeological methods that could help researchers understand these transformations of matter in a deeper way. Such is the case of Asine, a palimpsest landscape with archaeological and historical remains of human activity extending from prehistoric to modern European times. This article will attempt to reveal this hidden side of contemporary history and offer a glimpse into the lives of the last inhabitants of the ancient city.

TI  - An analytical model for identifying and addressing energy efficiency improvement opportunities in industrial production systems - Model development and testing experiences from Sweden
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Improved energy efficiency is one of the most effective strategies for achieving energy sustainability and independence locally, regionally and globally. Industry accounts for 40% of global energy usage each year, which suggests its potentially significant impact on overall energy use. The rapid development of standards for more efficient equipment and components are pushing manufacturers towards further improvements on a component level. However, it has been shown that the largest efficiency potential is actually found in higher system levels in which components serve, such as production processes, ventilation or hydraulic systems. Even though the importance of increasing energy efficiency at a systemic level has been widely acknowledged in recent years, practical approaches are seldom discussed in the literature. This gap between aspiration and achievement calls for the development of new approaches to foster system efficiency in industrial systems. This paper presents a systems analysis and corresponding model to increase the energy efficiency of industrial processes that involve intensive usage of electric motor systems. The model originates from traditional value stream mapping. Three case studies representing three different industrial processes were conducted to develop and validate the model. In total, 31 energy efficiency measures were identified, 29 of which address actions beyond component levels. Alongside identifications of energy efficiency measures, the model promotes the creation of conditions for cross-functional worker participation. By applying this model, the knowledge and skills gained by industrial personnel working with improved energy efficiency, maintenance and production processes can be used immediately to generate improvement suggestions. The paper concludes that this model, based on a simplified energy-focused value stream mapping, could broaden the scope of energy efficiency actions, engage a larger group of workers within the organisation and increase systems efficiency. This can be further used as a practical tool for finding continuous improvement possibilities that will result in strengthened competitiveness and more cost-effective and sustainable manufacturing.

TI  - ?Winter children?: an ethnographically inspired study of children being-and-becoming well-versed in snow and ice
T2  - SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY
AB  - For many children living in Northern and mountainous regions of the world, playing in snow is enticing and connotes childhood for many adults. Even so, researchers have paid little attention to children?s play in/with snow and ice. This paper aims to contribute to the growing knowledge on children?s competencies and child-nature relationships by exploring how a group of children build their understanding of themselves and their environment during playful explorations in demanding winter landscapes. The study is framed by (1) a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, (2) an analysis of selected evocative empirical examples of ways children play in/with winter materials, and (3) perspectives on ?Bildung? as dialectical processes of being-and-becoming. Data were generated through ethnographically inspired fieldwork, including 20 children aged four to six, in a Norwegian Nature Kindergarten, emphasizing children?s self-initiated outdoor play as educationally important. The fieldwork was conducted in 2018 during the coldest time of the year and draws on participant observation, children?s photographs and on-site conversations. The study is inspired by the work of [Ingold, T. (2011). Being alive. Oxon: Routledge], [Merleau-Ponty, M. (2012). Phenomenology of perception. London: Routledge], [Gibson, J. J. (1979). The ecological approach to visual perception. NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates], and the Continental European philosophy of Bildung [Biesta, G. (2002). Bildung and modernity: The future of Bildung in a world of difference. Studies in Philosophy and Education, 21(4?5), 343?351] and applies Ingold?s concepts of ?lines?, ?knots? and ?dwelling?, to explore children?s playful movements and experiences along lines in an ever-evolving meshwork. Three themes are analyzed. First, the ever-transforming qualities of snow and ice are discussed as existential materials and cultural conditions in the children?s dialectical process of being-and-becoming. Second, the kindergarten?s snow-covered playground is seen as attractive and challenging from the children?s perspective. Third, as the children increase their competence in the dynamic winter environment through movement, they embody existential knowledge and skills about the socio-material context of which they are a part. Thus, they familiarize themselves with their environment as being-and-becoming winter children.

TI  - Network design for surface water quality monitoring in a road construction project using Gamma Test theory
T2  - WATER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRY
AB  - Road construction has a negative environmental impact on the surrounding aquatic environment, requiring the continuous monitoring of surface water quality. Here, optimization of the water quality monitoring network (WQMN) is an essential step in supporting the sustainable development of road construction projects. This study introduces Gamma Test theory (GTT) as a practical method for optimizing the WQMN of surface waters during road construction. The water quality index (WQI) was computed in 48 monitoring stations for six monitoring periods from 2017 to 2019; data was acquired from a primary monitoring network over a new highway in southern Norway. Based on the results, it is possible to reduce the number of stations by 23% in comparison with the original empirical network. The proposed method could be useful to design the monitoring networks of projects with limited construction time and budget, as well as projects lacking enough data.

TI  - RETRACTED: Masculinities in the Rural and the Agricultural: A Literature Review (Retracted article. See vol. 52, pg. 145, 2012)
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
AB  - This article provides a summary of social science studies at the nexus of masculinity and the rural, particularly the agricultural. These studies began to emerge in the rural social science literature in 1995, when Berit Brandth pioneered the study of masculinities and farming practices in Norway. The studies reviewed here are particularly important as they begin to focus on men and masculinities in the rural and the agricultural, categories that previously had been the assumed, yet invisible subject of rural studies. The studies also link masculinity to farming practices in a number of ways that clearly have implications for the future of farming in terms of ecological crises across social, economic and environmental rural landscapes. The aim of this article is twofold; to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between masculine identities and farming practices and to identify possible theoretical pathways for future research that might assist us to identify and develop more sustainable ways of farming and rural life.

TI  - Development of composite sheep breeds in the world: A review
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - In the 1850s, breeders established breed societies which maintained flock registries and actively participated in show rings, exhibitions and auctions promoting pure breeds that conformed to the breeders' vision of uniform and distinct morphological characteristics. At that time, the performance of the pure breeds over grade sheep was overwhelming. As a result influential government officials, specialists and scientists had to acknowledge their superiority. The supply of purebred seed-stock that was initially adequate became sparse in the years following the World War 11 because demand arising from the increasing human population exceeded the capacity for production. Thus, stimulated interest in higher productivity for commercial production resulted in the development of multi-breed synthetic populations for specific objectives e.g. reproduction, meat quality, meat and wool combinations, wool for textile, carpet wool, fur, and milk production. Today, as many as 418 sheep breeds that have been documented in nearly 75 countries are combinations of two or more distinct breeds, populations and landraces that have records on pedigree and morphological characteristics, and in some cases, production performance similar to those for long established breeds. The present day methods of forming composite breeds are based on a wealth of knowledge and creative skills passed on from breeder to breeder over the centuries, as well as the application of quantitative genetic principles that had demonstrated tremendous success in the development of hybrid corn. Research findings also suggested that in well-planned efforts to create composite breeds, the genetic background of the foundation breeds should be as broad as possible to achieve increased additive genetic variance and heterozygosity from a large proportion of segregating genes and lower probability for the expression of lethal recessive genes. There was always the possibility of lower performance in the composite breeds compared with specific crosses derived from two or more breeds, because of their inability to fully realise any benefit from individual and maternal heterosis (considered important in the mammalian species). Though unlikely, loss in performance of composite breeds could occur from recombination of non-allelic genes and the migration of undesirable genes. Nevertheless, there is opportunity for accelerating genetic response to selection as well as heterosis retention unless a rise in inbreeding occurs in the early generations causing loss in performance. The real operational advantage of a multi-breed composite population lies in raising a single breed with nearly the same productivity instead of two or more breeds for subsequent crossbreeding. Sheep in the domain of developing countries adapt well to severe climatic conditions and arduous terrains that are often not suitable for cultivation or for raising the larger livestock and are fully exploited for their ability to produce a variety of commodities without disrupting the cultural harmony. Likewise, more breeds were developed in sheep than in other livestock species with the United Kingdom, Russian Federation, Australia, Poland, China, France, the United States of America and New Zealand each having established 15 or more composite breeds that offer real advantages. In North America and worldwide, there is further prospect for complementing established breeds with exotic breeds to achieve potential biological ceiling in reproduction, lean muscle growth, feed efficiency and milk yield of sheep.
   In the future, application of advnces in molecular methodologies could possibly lead to the development of composite breeds for specific objectives from a combination of widely different breeds, populations and landraces, probably, even from unrelated species.

TI  - Soil phosphorus as a control of productivity and openness in temperate interglacial forest ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB  - Aim Observations of long chronosequences in forest ecosystems show that, after some millennia of build-up, biomass declines in relation to the slow depletion of soil phosphorus. Plants that dominate during this period of soil impoverishment have specialized strategies for P acquisition, including ectomycorrhiza or root clusters. We use quantitative, pollen-based reconstructions of regional vegetation in four Quaternary warm stages (Holocene, Eemian, Holsteinian, Harreskovian) to test whether inferred forest cover and productivity changes are consistent with long-term modification of soil nutrient pools.
   Location Southern Scandinavia (Denmark, southern Sweden).
   Methods The REVEALS model was used to estimate regional vegetation abundances of 25 pollen-type-equivalent taxa from pollen records of large sedimentary basins in southernmost Scandinavia. Based on the estimated regional vegetation, we then calculated time-series of Ellenberg indicator values for L (light), R (soil reaction) and N (a productivity proxy). We classified the vegetation records into distinct phases and compared these phases and the samples using hierarchical clustering and ordination.
   Results All three interglacials developed coniferous or mixed forests. However, pure deciduous forests were never reached during the Holsteinian, while pure coniferous forests never developed in the Holocene. Above-ground productivity was inferred to be low initially, peaking in the first third of the warm stages and then slowly declining (except during the Holocene). Dominant trees of the post-peak phases all had ectomycorrhiza as a strategy for P acquisition, indicating that easily accessible P pools had become depleted. Increases in fire regimes may have amplified the inferred final drop in productivity. Mid/late Holocene productivity changes were much influenced by agricultural activities.
   Main conclusions REVEALS vegetation estimates combined with Ellenberg indicator values suggest a consistent pattern in warm stages of initially rising productivity, followed by a long and slow decline. The P-acquisition strategies of dominant trees indicate that the decline reflects increasing P depletion of soils.

TI  - Evolutionary potential of a widespread clonal grass under changing climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - Adaptive responses are probably the most effective long-term responses of populations to climate change, but they require sufficient evolutionary potential upon which selection can act. This requires high genetic variance for the traits under selection and low antagonizing genetic covariances between the different traits. Evolutionary potential estimates are still scarce for long-lived, clonal plants, although these species are predicted to dominate the landscape with climate change. We studied the evolutionary potential of a perennial grass, Festuca rubra, in western Norway, in two controlled environments corresponding to extreme environments in natural populations: cold-dry and warm-wet, the latter being consistent with the climatic predictions for the country. We estimated genetic variances, covariances, selection gradients and response to selection for a wide range of growth, resource acquisition and physiological traits, and compared their estimates between the environments. We showed that the evolutionary potential of F. rubra is high in both environments, and genetic covariances define one main direction along which selection can act with relatively few constraints to selection. The observed response to selection at present is not sufficient to produce genotypes adapted to the predicted climate change under a simple, space for time substitution model. However, the current populations contain genotypes which are pre-adapted to the new climate, especially for growth and resource acquisition traits. Overall, these results suggest that the present populations of the long-lived clonal plant may have sufficient evolutionary potential to withstand long-term climate changes through adaptive responses.

TI  - Spatial variation in vegetation damage relative to primary productivity, small rodent abundance and predation
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
AB  - The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms in shaping community structure is still a highly controversial topic in ecology. Predatory top-down control of herbivores is thought to relax herbivore impact on the vegetation through trophic cascades. However, trophic cascades may be weak in terrestrial systems as the complexity of food webs makes responses harder to predict. Alternatively, top-down control prevails, but the top-level (predator or herbivore) changes according to productivity levels. Here we show how spatial variation in the occurrence of herbivores (lemmings and voles) and their predators (mustelids and foxes) relates with grazing damage in landscapes with different net primary productivity, generating two and three trophic level communities, during the 2007 rodent peak in northern Norway. Lemmings were most abundant on the unproductive high-altitude tundra, where few predators were present and the impact of herbivores on vegetation was strong. Voles were most common on a productive, south facing slope, where numerous predators were present, and the impacts of herbivores on vegetation were weak. The impact of herbivores on the vegetation was strong only when predators were not present, and this cannot be explained by between-habitat differences in the abundance of plant functional groups. We thus conclude that predators influence the plant community via a trophic cascade in a spatial pattern that support the exploitation ecosystems hypothesis. The responses to grazing also differed between plant functional groups, with implications for short and long-term consequences for plant communities.

TI  - Pollen representation in surface samples of the <i>Juniperus</i>, <i>Picea</i> and <i>Juglans</i> forest belts of Kyrgyzstan, central Asia
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - Surface pollen deposition at five sites (Kichikol, Karakol, Nishneye and Verkhneye Ozero, and Bakaly) in four different forest types (Juniperus, Picea, Juglans and mixed forests) in Kyrgyzstan have been investigated to assess the relationship between modern vegetation and pollen composition in order to calibrate the pollen representation. Vegetation surveys with an estimation of the tree-crown cover (%) were made in 10 m X 10 to plots to relate the vegetation to surface pollen of moss polsters. Correlation calculations show a close relationship between vegetation (tree-crown cover) and pollen for the Juniperus site (eg, r(2) = 0.76 between crown cover and arboreal pollen, AP) and the Picea site (r(2) = 0.85), whereas the link-age is weaker at the Juglans site (r(2) = 0.35) and in mixed forests (r(2) = 0.32). The results of the surface samples of moss polsters are compared and discussed with surface samples of lake sediments that were taken at the same locations. We use vegetational maps from around the lakes to discuss the link between vegetation and pollen at extra-local scales (800 m around the sites). These comparisons show that AP underestimates the effective tree cover around all sites, with in extreme cases densely forested areas corresponding to AP values as low as < 60; 30%. We explain this finding by the prevalent background pollen load that derives from the dry lowland and slope steppes (Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae). Our investigation may improve the reconstruction of Quaternary vegetation and climate history of these forest belts in Kyrgyzstan (Central Asia) on the basis of fossil pollen assemblages from mire and lake sediments. It provides new insights into the pollen reflection of forest isles (eg, on humid slopes or mountain tops) that are surrounded by continental steppes; a vegetational situation that may be used as an analogue for the conditions during the full glacial in Eurasia and Northern America.

TI  - Sustainability in Railway Investments, a Study of Early-Phase Analyses and Perceptions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - This article presents a study of sustainability in railway investment projects. The purpose of the study was to analyse how sustainability is interpreted and evaluated in the early phases of major public investment projects. These phases are characterized by potentially very influential decisions being made prior to when precise, detailed knowledge is available. The research uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative information sources and three datasets; 12 interviews, document analyses for 10 railway projects, and a case study. The qualitative data are from semi-structured interviews, while the quantitative data are based on structured document review of planning documents from ten Norwegian railway projects. In addition, a detailed case study of a major rail infrastructure project has been performed. The findings show that several aspects of sustainability are evaluated in the early phase of investment projects, but there are no explicit requirements to do an overall analysis of sustainability. Environmental aspects of sustainability are predominant in the respondents' interpretation of the concept. Still, the structure and requirements of the early phases in the national project model ensures that the economic dimension of sustainability has the most influence in decisions regarding which project concepts that receive financing for further development.

TI  - High emission rates and strong temperature response make boreal wetlands a large source of isoprene and terpenes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
AB  - Wetlands cover only 3 % of the global land surface area, but boreal wetlands are experiencing an unprecedented warming of four times the global average. These wetlands emit isoprene and terpenes (including monoterpenes (MT), sesquiterpenes (SQT), and diterpenes (DT)), which are climate-relevant highly reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) with an exponential dependence on temperature. In this study, we present ecosystem-scale eddy covariance (EC) fluxes of isoprene, MT, SQT, and DT (hereafter referred to together as terpenes) at Siikaneva, a boreal fen in southern Finland, from the start to the peak of the growing season of 2021 (19 May 2021 to 28 June 2021). These are the first EC fluxes reported using the novel state-of-the-art Vocus proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (Vocus-PTR) and the first-ever fluxes reported for DTs from a wetland. Isoprene was the dominant compound emitted by the wetland, followed by MTs, SQTs, and DTs, and they all exhibited a strong exponential temperature dependence. The Q10 values, the factor by which terpene emissions increases for every 10 ? rise in temperature, were up to five times higher than those used in most BVOC models. During the campaign, the air temperature peaked above 31? on 21-22 June 2021, which is abnormally high for boreal environments, and the maximum flux for all terpenes coincided with this period. We observed that terpene emissions were elevated after this abnormally "high-temperature stress period ", indicating that past temperatures alter emissions significantly. The standardized emission factor (EF) of the fen for isoprene (EFiso) was 11.1 +/- 0.3 nmol m(-2) s(-1), which is at least two times higher than in previous studies and as high as the emission factors typical for broadleaf and other forests in the lower latitudes. We observed EFMT of 2.4 +/- 0.1 nmolm(-2) s(-1), EF(SQT )of 1.3 +/- 0.03 nmol m(-2) s(-1), higher than typical for needle leaf and broadleaf tree functional types, and EFDT of 0.011 +/- 0.001 nmol m(-2) s(-1). We also compared the landscape average emissions to the model of emissions of gases and aerosols from nature (MEGAN) v2.1 and found that the emissions were underestimated by over 9 times for isoprene, over 300 times for MTs, and 800 times for SQTs. Our results show that due to very high EFs and high sensitivity to increasing temperatures, these high-latitude ecosystems can be a large source of terpenes to the atmosphere, and anthropogenic global warming could induce much higher BVOC emissions from wetlands in the future.

TI  - eEurope 2002: Quality Criteria for Health related Websites
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: A number of organisations have begun to provide specific tools for searching, rating, and grading this information, while others have set up codes of conduct by which site providers can attest to their high quality services. The aim of such tools is to assist individuals to sift through the mountains of information available so as to be better able to discern valid and reliable messages from those which are misleading or inaccurate.
   Objective: Recognising that European citizens are avid consumers of health related information on the internet and recognising that they are already using the types of rating system described above, the European Council at Feira on June 19-20 2000 supported an initiative within eEurope 2002 to develop a core set of Quality Criteria for Health Related Websites. The specific aim was to draw up a commonly agreed set of simple quality criteria on which Member States, as well as public and private bodies, may draw in the development of quality initiatives for health related websites. These criteria should be applied in addition to relevant Community law.
   Methods: A meeting was held during 2001 which drew together key players from Government departments, International Organisations, non-governmental organisations and industry, to explore current practices and experiments in this field. Some sixty invited participants from all the Member States, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States of America took part in the meeting of June 7-8, 2001: they included delegates from industrial, medical, and patient interest groups, delegates from Member States' governments, and key invited speakers from the field of health information ethics. These individuals, and many others, also took part in the web-based consultation which was open from august to November 2001.
   Results: The broad headings for quality criteria identified include Transparency and Honesty, Authority, Privacy and data protection, Updating of information, Accountability, Responsible partnering, Editorial policy, Accessibility, the latter includes attention to guidelines on physical accessibility as well as general findability, searchability, readability, usability, etc. A metadata labelling system may be used to make health data more findable. Such a system may also be used in conjunction with quality criteria to give higher ranking by search engines to those sites or pages labelled as complying with defined quality criteria.
   Conclusions: The set of quality criteria is based upon a broad consensus among specialists in this field, health authorities, and prospective users. It is now to be expected that national and regional health authorities, relevant professional associations, and private medical website owners will 1) implement the Quality Criteria for Health Related Websites in a manner appropriate to their website and consumers; 2) develop information campaigns to educate site developers and citizens about minimum quality standards for health related websites; 3) draw on the wide range of health information offered across the European Union and localise such information for the benefit of citizens (translation and cultural adaptation); 4) exchange information and experience at European level about how quality standards are being implemented.

TI  - "THE MULTISENSORY SPACE" - A NEW LEARNING ENVIRONMENT
T2  - ICERI2014: 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
CP  - 7th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - In this paper, I describe the experiences of a pedagogical development project at Laurea University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The project is realized by Laurea in co-operation with various learning institutes, municipalities and NGOs. The aim is to develop new methods for using multisensory learning environments for different target groups. In 2011-2014, the project is funded by The European Social Fund.
   The basis of the project is "The Multisensory Space", which means an easily modified space, where visitors can experience landscape, sounds and objects of a different cultural environment. In the Multisensory Space, a visitor can, for a moment, return to his or her past or explore a completely different world. Multisensory environment is used, for example, for collecting local memories and history, for promoting multiculturalism, and as an inspirational learning environment.
   The development of "The Multisensory Space"as a method was started at Laurea with the multicultural work, where the aim is to promote intercultural interaction and the understanding of multicultural issues. Each year since 2008 more than 100 students at Laurea have been involved in the project. According to the students' feedback, the project has provided new insights concerning intercultural communication and working with the concept of identity negotiation.
   For five years, the idea has been applied together with different target groups. Different pilots have shown that the model can be applied to open multisensory learning environments in different contexts, and it can be utilized in the activities of different organizations, such as learning institutions, libraries and museums. It is not only the visitors who benefit from the model and vice versa. Rather, it is more about the empowerment process where people from different backgrounds build and negotiate the environments together.
   At the end of my presentation, I shall discuss how you could apply the method in the teaching at the comprehensive school. It does not merely mean the ready-made learning environment but the students could build the different "multisensory environments"in groups as their learning projects. Building the space together concretizes abstract things, and the method could be used for different subjects, such as teaching languages or history, for the benefit of different learners.

TI  - The population of the hypogeous fungus <i>Tuber aestivum</i> syn. <i>T-uncinatum</i> on the island of Gotland
T2  - MYCORRHIZA
AB  - The aim of our study was to examine the genetic variation within Tuber aestivum on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. Variation in such a limited geographical area should help illuminate the dispersal abilities of T. aestivum. Knowledge of the genetic variation in this northern outpost could also be useful in the selection of inoculum for the establishment of truffle orchards. Genetic structure and homogeneity of the population were studied using principal component and parsimony analyses of randomly amplified polymorphic DNA data. Our inventories showed that T. aestivum is abundantly distributed in suitable habitats on Gotland. The genetic variation observed suggests sexual reproduction and slow dispersal on the island. It is possible that the present population was established from one introduction, which may be due to ability to survive in this habitat rather than to rare colonising events. The T. aestivum population on Gotland may be an ecotype adapted to the climate and soil conditions on the island.

TI  - Competing priorities: how actors and institutions influence adaptation of the German railway system
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
AB  - Large-scale infrastructure networks are vulnerable to climate change. Their operation involves public and private actors under complex legislative and market regulations. We analyze climate adaptation of railway infrastructure, based on an in-depth case study of the German railway system. The case includes a unique set of qualitative interviews with key players of operating and regulative organizations, as well as a document study. Our analysis crucially extends previous technology-oriented research on the railway sector by applying core insights and categories from the actor-centered institutionalism. We trace observed obstacles for a climate resilient railway system and adaptation decisions back to deeper causes, in particular political priorities and values. Moreover, diverging perceptions and the competition among different actors hamper adaptation. On the other hand, single actors who display a great willingness to act are able to make use of unclear responsibilities to integrate adaptation concerns into existing institutions. Our research suggests that changes in technical standards and in economic regulation support adaptation of infrastructure systems.

TI  - On the Road to Affordable and Clean Energy: Assessing the Progress of European Countries Toward Meeting SDG 7
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
AB  - Long term sustainability of energy is a critically important goal of sustainable development globally. In light of new initiatives such as the UN's Agenda 2030 or the Paris Agreement, assessing the progress of EU countries towards reaching ambitious sustainability goals is inevitable. The aim of the paper is to assess the progress of EU countries toward meeting sustainable development goal on affordable and clean energy. The results of the analysis can be described as balanced and stable, although differences between individual countries are significant in cases of some indicators. Each EU country must, however, take a comprehensive view of SDG7 implementation. Sweden, being the first on the list, as well as Luxembourg, being the last one, both have strengths, yet also areas of improvement. Multi-criteria analysis has thrown a spotlight on the Achilles heel of the EU countries disregard of which might cause serious problems in the future.

TI  - Social Implications of Unburied Corpses from Intergroup Conflicts: Postmortem Agency Following the Sandby borg Massacre
T2  - CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
AB  - A massacre took place inside the Sand by borg ringfort, southeast Sweden, at the end of the fifth century. The victims were not buried, but left where they died. In order to understand why the corpses were left unburied, and how they were perceived following the violent event, a theoretical framework is developed and integrated with the results of osteological analysis. I discuss the contemporary normative treatment of the dead, social response to death and postmortem agency with emphasis on intergroup conflict and 'bad death'. The treatment of the dead in Sand by borg deviates from known contemporary practices. I am proposing that leaving the bodies unburied might be viewed as an aggressive social action. The corpses exerted postmortem agency to the benefit of the perpetrators, at the expense of the victims and their sympathizers. The gain for the perpetrators was likely political power through redrawing the victim's biographies, spatial memory and the social and territorial landscape. The denial of a proper death likely led to shame, hindering of regeneration and an eternal state of limbo.

TI  - Fertilization-Effects on deciduous tree growth and browsing by moose
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Knowledge of plant-herbivore interactions is fundamental for understanding foraging patterns of herbivores and their effects on the ecosystem as well as the human use of natural resources. The nutrient resources available for plants may determine not only growth rate, but also the amounts of secondary compounds in the plant tissues. As a consequence, browsing pressure on plant communities by large herbivores can be affected by fertilization and nitrogen deposition. We conducted a field fertilization experiment to test the hypothesis that fertilization leads to increased sapling growth and increased browsing by a large herbivore, the moose (Alces alces). The study was conducted on fertilized and unfertilized plots (50 m x 50 m) in northern Sweden. The plots were located in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands of young succession stages with an intermixture of deciduous species. Fertilization with 600 kg calcium-ammonium-nitrate per ha (=200 kg N ha(-1)), was conducted in spring on one of the plots in each of 25 paired plots. The other plot in each pair was kept as control. The effect of fertilization on plants and browsing pressure was evaluated on five deciduous tree species in June and August the year after fertilization. Both browsing from preceding winter (bites) and current summer (leaf strips and bites) was recorded. Shoot size and other shoot variables increased with fertilization. Fertilization increased winter browsing for most species, but few differences were statistically significant. The late summer recording (August) showed pronounced differences in browsing pressure (leaf strips and bites) between control and treatment. In June, only a trend of increased browsing (leaf strips) was found for all species on fertilized plots. Generally, the pressure of leaf stripping was low in June, probably due to the short time the annual shoots had been exposed to moose browsing. Number of summer bites (recorded in August) was significantly higher on fertilized plots for the Betula spp., and the trend was similar for the other tree species. Within species, there was no difference in strip length between the treatments. The result indicates that fertilization can be used as a habitat improvement for ungulates within wildlife management. But, fertilization is also likely to lead to an increased risk of browsing damage, which is undesirable if forests are being fertilized for increased forest production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Context dependency and stakeholder involvement in EIA: the decisive role of practitioners
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The outcomes of frameworks and practices for stakeholder involvement in environmental impact assessment (EIA) for road planning, under the umbrella of a common EU legal framework, are investigated here in specific national contexts. Data for the two empirical cases examined - Poland and Sweden - are related to the recent ongoing discussion on context dependency for Environmental Assessments (EA). The analysis, informed by practitioner interviews and documentary review, comprises a historical review of the evolution of EIA and stakeholder involvement, and examines more closely the legal frameworks, formal and informal arenas for stakeholder involvement, and norms of stakeholder involvement held by professionals involved in the planning process in the two countries. The results challenge existing assumptions about the relative depth of institutionalisation of stakeholder involvement and environmental concern in a Scandinavian and Central-Eastern European context, and highlight the decisive role of practitioners in the application of EA frameworks in planning practice.

TI  - Evidence for complete denitrification in a benthic foraminifer
T2  - NATURE
AB  - Benthic foraminifera are unicellular eukaryotes found abundantly in many types of marine sediments. Many species survive and possibly reproduce in anoxic habitats(1), but sustainable anaerobic metabolism has not been previously described. Here we demonstrate that the foraminifer Globobulimina pseudospinescens accumulates intracellular nitrate stores and that these can be respired to dinitrogen gas. The amounts of nitrate detected are estimated to be sufficient to support respiration for over a month. In a Swedish fjord sediment where G. pseudospinescens is the dominant foraminifer, the intracellular nitrate pool in this species accounted for 20% of the large, cell-bound, nitrate pool present in an oxygen-free zone. Similarly high nitrate concentrations were also detected in foraminifera Nonionella cf. stella and a Stainforthia species, the two dominant benthic taxa occurring within the oxygen minimum zone of the continental shelf off Chile. Given the high abundance of foraminifera in anoxic marine environments(1-3), these new findings suggest that foraminifera may play an important role in global nitrogen cycling and indicate that our understanding of the complexity of the marine nitrogen cycle is far from complete.

T2  - BMJ OPEN
AB  - IntroductionThe individual, societal and economic benefits of stroke prevention are high. Even though most risk factors can be reduced by changes to lifestyle habits, maintaining new and healthy activity patterns has been shown to be challenging.The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of an interdisciplinary team-based, mHealth-supported prevention intervention on persons at risk for stroke. The intervention is mediated by engaging everyday activities that promote health. An additional aim is to describe a process evaluation that serves to increase knowledge about how the programme leads to potential change by studying the implementation process and mechanisms of impact.IntroductionThe individual, societal and economic benefits of stroke prevention are high.

TI  - Methodologies Developed for EcoCity Related Projects: New Borg El Arab, an Egyptian Case Study
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - The aim of the methodologies described here is to propose measures and procedures for developing concepts and technological solutions, which are adapted to the local conditions, to build sustainable communities in developing countries and emerging economies. These methodologies are linked to the EcoCity framework outlined by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. for sustainable community and neighbourhood regeneration and development. The framework is the result of a long experience in numerous EcoCity related projects, mainly Nordic and European in scope, which has been reformulated in recent years to respond to the local needs in the previously mentioned countries. There is also a particular emphasis on close collaboration with local partners and major stakeholders. In order to illustrate how these methodologies can support EcoCity concept development and implementation, results from a case study in Egypt will be discussed. The referred case study relates to the transformation of New Borg El Arab (NBC), near Alexandria, into an EcoCity. The viability of the idea was explored making use of different methodologies (Roadmap, Feasibility Study, and Residents Energy Survey and Building Consumption Assessment) and considering the Residential, Commercial/Public Facilities, Industrial, Services/Utilities, and Transport sectors.

TI  - Practical metamodel-assisted multi-objective design optimization for improved sustainability and buildability of wind turbine foundations
T2  - STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION
AB  - In this work, we study the potential of using kriging metamodelling to perform multi-objective structural design optimization using finite element analysis software and design standards while keeping the computational efforts low. A method is proposed, which includes sustainability and buildability objectives, and it is applied to a case study of reinforced concrete foundations for wind turbines based on data from a large Swedish wind farm project. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to investigate the influence of the penalty factor applied to unfeasible solutions and the size of the initial sample generated by Latin hypercube sampling. A multi-objective optimization is then performed to obtain the optimum designs for different weight combinations for the four objectives considered. Results show that the kriging-obtained designs from samples of 20 designs outperform the best designs in the samples of 1000 designs. The optimum designs obtained by the proposed method have a sustainability impact 8-15% lower than the designs developed by traditional methods.

TI  - Assessment of risks for adaptation to climate change: the case of land-slides
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
AB  - This paper describes how relatively detailed knowledge about probabilities of natural hazards can be used to make decisions to develop areas and control the risk within hazard zones. The assessment serves two purposes. First, it shows how information can support decisions. Second, decision criteria put leads on what information is required. This is helpful to identify unavailable information. We show by an example from a land-slide prone area in Norway how a relatively reliable estimate of the probability of slides ends up in a rather uncertain estimate of the risk. Uncertainty about the risk represented by natural hazards imply great challenges to the development of adaptation policies to meet climate change, but they are required. We develop a simplified criterion for optimal adaptation, and estimate the added social value required to defend development in hazard prone areas instead of developing a risk-free alternative. The value is estimated between 0 and 0.40 Euros per Euro invested in the case area, depending on type of slide, category of asset and other costs that occur in the wake of slides.

TI  - Long-term effects of liming on the species composition of the herb layer in temperate Central-European forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Upon the occurrence of acidic deposition-driven damage to forests at the beginning of the 1980s, large-scale liming has been applied to acidic forest sites in Germany. Due to possible negative consequences on soil chemistry and on (soil) fauna and flora, this measure was discussed highly controversially right from the beginning and is disputed until today. In investigations of liming effects on the forest understory vegetation, very few studies covered a time period of more than two decades with intermittent releves. We analyzed releves of the herbal understory on limed and control plots in one pine (Pinta sylvestris), one oak (Quercus robur), two European beech (Pagus sylvatica) and five Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands at permanent observation sites in southwestern Germany. These releves had been repeatedly conducted during approximately 25 years.
   The number of herbal plant species was generally low. An increase in the herb layer's plant cover with time was found at six out of the nine study sites and was mainly due to spreading of two grass species (Milium effusum, Deschampsia fiexuosa) and of the subshrub Vaccinium myrtillus, which might have benefitted from continuous nitrogen deposition. Only two species (Agrostis stolonifera, Stellaria media) with a main distribution in open landscapes were found in the years of investigation and their occurrence was restricted to only four sites and some few years.
   Across all sites, the average Ellenberg indicator values of nutrient (nitrogen) supply (N-values) were significantly increased on the limed plots ten years after liming, and at Year 10, the N-values of the limed plots were significantly higher than that of the control, presumably due to increased decomposition rates after liming. At the spruce sites, the average Ellenberg indicator values of soil reaction (R-values) of the limed plots 10 years after liming were significantly higher than at the beginning (Year 0) and at the end of the investigation (2013). We found no significant differences among the Ellenberg indicator values of light condition (L-values).
   In conclusion, liming had a significant, but only transient effect on the composition of the understory species. Therefore, our results do not support arguments against liming of acidic forests that are based on long-term changes in the herbal flora. In managed forests for wood production on acidic soils, liming can continue contributing to buffer the soils against ongoing acidification and accompanying cation leaching caused by anthropogenic deposition of nitrogen.

TI  - Physiological responses to live air transport of red king crab (<i>Paralithodes camtschaticus</i>)
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
AB  - Live transport of red king crab from the fishing grounds to the market is an activity that is increasing and the future sustainability of this practice depends on maintaining optimal animal welfare during transport. The current study evaluated the physiological response of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) to live air transport, mimicking current commercial practices. Specifically, this study assessed stress and osmoregulatory haemolymph metabolite variation, together with free amino acids (FAAs) pool variation in the haemolymph of red king crab. Forty male crabs (2136 +/- 800 g) were caught in the North Cape area in the Barents Sea during April 2019. They were transported by the fishing boat directly to a land-based live holding facility in Honningsvarg, Norway where they were held for < 10 days. They were then divided in two groups: i) the first group of 20 crabs underwent immediate haemolymph sampling, and ii) the second group of 20 crabs was divided in subgroups of 5 crabs, placed in a standard air freight Styrofoam boxes with freezer packs and transported by road and air to the Nofima facility, in Tromso, Norway. The time from the packing until when the haemolymph sampling occurred was 20 h. All samples of haemolymph were taken from the coxa membrane of the third right side walking leg and were analysed for sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), carbon dioxide (CO2), lactate, total protein, and FAAs. The survival of the transported crabs was 100 %, and after transport the measured indicators showed a significantly positive (lactate and total protein) or a negative (Na+, Cl-) variation in relation to the air transport. From the measured FAAs, five, Alanine (Ala), Arginine (Arg), Threonine (Thr), Valine (Val) and Taurine (Tau), were significantly higher for the group after transport when compared to the group before transport. No FAAs were significantly lower as a result of transport. In conclusion, it was apparent that red king crabs exposed to air during a 20 -h transport period exhibited the typical physiological responses associated to hypoxia stress. Moreover, in this study we report for the first time a change in the FAA pool results due to transport where five out of the twenty-one measured FAA where significantly elevated. Specifically, Ala, an important osmolyte during salinity stress. These results bring new insights into how red king crabs cope with live air transport and offer new evidence for the need to assess the crabs' health and welfare during live holding and transport. Moreover, the results obtained from this study can also contribute to the development of an industry friendly methodology to assess the stress and health status of crabs during and after live transport.

AB  - This paper presents the contextualized overview of the CO2 capture technology, with critical evaluation of state-of-art and technological development through patents applications and scientific articles. The scientific research and technological development and innovation of CO2 capture is mapped, providing not only an overview, but also concrete basis to define and optimize research and development (R&D) perspectives. It relates the stage of scientific, technologic and innovation development relate to the actions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to ensure the reduction of the global warming due to anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere. The yearly monitoring of actions is presented, focusing on scientific, technologic and innovation from governments and companies acting within various countries in an attempt to mitigate the effects of global climate change. The mapping of the capture technologies was focused on absorption, adsorption, membranes, cryogenic, enzymatic and hybrid. The capture technologies are also mapped according to the CO2 capture process (post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-combustion). The results are analyzed in terms of priority date, annual evolution of the patents portifolia, technology owners (country, continent, sector of society, companies, (R&D institutions), inventors and their countries, authors of scientific articles, article copyright owners, institutions and countries where the scientific research reported in the articles was performed, patent type (process, method, prototype, product, etc.), patents classification codes showing technologic trends and fields, type of gas source where CO2 is captured, type of processes and type of gas outputs after CO2 capture, details of the components and of the processes for each method capture, among other trends. The results are contextualized in terms of methods of CO2 capture processes, focusing on technology for IPCC, roadmaps, and government programs and strategies for reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. All the capture technologies are growing yearly, both in patent applications and in articles. Absorption and adsorption are the most used capture technologies, post-combustion is the most used capture process, and most of the patents refer to CO2 separation and removal. Most of the copyrights belong to Elsevier and American Physical Society, USA detains 52% of the patent applications and 31% of the articles published. The other patent applications belong mainly to Germany, France, Japan and United Kingdom. The countries with more aggressive appropriation policies are France, Norway, Germany, USA and Netherland. There is a strong correlation between countries of the technology owners and clear CCS government policies. The patent applications refer to over thirty entry gas currents, being focused on combustion and post combustion processes, followed by natural gas specification. New trends like Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC), Chemical Looping Reforming (CLR) are also focused. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Behaviour of 60-year-old trial embankments on peat
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
AB  - The search for low cost solutions for roads on peatlands inspired the construction of four full scale trial em-bankments at two sites in Norway in the early 1960's. The embankments are still accessible and this work was motivated by present day needs to develop environmentally sustainable solutions to such problems. The em-bankments were constructed using locally sourced sand and sawdust and have behaved very well with the sawdust settling beneath the water table as designed and remaining in perfect condition some 60 years later. A detailed characterisation of the distinctly different peat at the two sites is presented and it is shown that the peat properties are as expected from local and international experience. Laboratory work on the sawdust showed that it behaves like a highly compressible fibrous peat. Short-term embankment settlement behaviour was controlled by the level of applied load whereas long-term creep settlements were governed by the peat consolidation properties. Pore water pressures dissipated unexpectedly quickly. Modelling using the Soft Soil Creep model in PLAXIS captured both short-and long-term settlements and the pore pressure dissipation well.

TI  - Withstanding winter vulnerabilities: A way of life in a northern seaside community
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
AB  - This study responds to the dearth of qualitative research on long-term adaptation to winter climate-induced access and safety problems in rural areas in Western welfare societies. Based on qualitative interviews with 19 long-term residents in a thriving fishing village in northern Norway, the paper explores how they have adapted to and coped with roadside avalanches, blizzards, heavy snowfalls, and snowdrifts that have suddenly closed access highways and cut off other lifelines. The study shows that the inhabitants have internalised hazard adaptation and preparedness through safeguarding themselves, family members, their home and community during difficult times. Still, they admitted that local solidarity and coping capacity were changing with the arrival of newcomers who are less accustomed to and experienced with these hazards. Despite high personal and joint adaptation and coping capacities, the study also reveals denial of risk and the prevalence of worry, particularly among women. The inhabitants acknowledged mortality risk while driving on avalanche-exposed winter highways, yet assumed that they would not have a fatal accident.

TI  - Size selection by diamond- and square-mesh codends in multi-species Mediterranean demersal trawl fisheries
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
AB  - Mediterranean demersal trawl fisheries traditionally operate using small diamond-shape meshes in the codend, which tend to retain almost all animals. We investigated the effect of mesh configuration on the size selectivity of nine species (the scaldfish Arnoglossus laterna, the broad-tail shortfin squid Illex coindettii, the European hake Merluccius merluccius, the red mullet Mullus barbatus, the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, the common pandora Pagellus erythrinus, the deepwater rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris, the Mediterranean horse mackerel Trachurus mediterraneus and the poor-cod Trisopterus minutus capelanus) commonly captured in the Mediterranean demersal trawls. Two codends having meshes with the same opening (ca. 38 mm) but different mesh configuration (DM38: diamond-mesh and SM38: square-mesh configuration) were fished daily and alternately on the same trawl. They demonstrated a Substantial improvement in selectivity with square-mesh. Selectivity was Measured using the covered codend technique, the cover being supported by circular hoops.
   The results were analysed taking into account the between-haul variation in selectivity. Two other important external variables Were identified: the trawling depth and the codend catch, which for some species influenced between-haul variation, but there was no evidence of a coherent effect on selectivity parameters.
   The selectivity of 40 mm diamond-mesh codend has been reported to be rather poor because a large proportion of the codend catch is immature and smaller than the Minimum landing size (MLS) or first maturity size. With the exception of the flatfish (A. laterna), the effect of a change of mesh configuration from diamond- to square-mesh on size selectivity positively affected the retention length at 50% (L-50). However, square-meshes were found to be unsuitable for flat and/or deep-bodied fish as these escape more readily from diamond-meshes.
   The Council Regulation (EC) No. 1967/2006, concerning management measures for the Sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean, establishes the MLS of marine organisms. However, the increase in L-50 with square-mesh would not avoid some ofthe existing contradictions in allowing the use of codend mesh which leads to lower L-50 than the MLS. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A study of the techno-economic feasibility of H<sub>2</sub>-based energy storage systems in remote areas
T2  - ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The development of efficient and sustainable energy solutions and the attempt to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are leading to an increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Effective Electrical Energy Storage (EES) solutions need therefore to be developed to deal with the issue of fitting locally available RES and loads. Hydrogen can become an interesting option because of its high energy density, long-term storage capability and modularity. In particular, in isolated micro-grid and off-grid remote areas, intermittent RES integrated with H-2-based storage systems can allow to lower, or even eliminate, the usage of diesel engines and avoid the need for expensive and invasive grid connections. The present study is part of the European REMOTE project, whose main goal is to prove the added value of H-2-based energy storage solutions with respect to alternative technologies in terms of economics, technical and environmental benefits. Four demonstration sites supplied by renewable electricity will be installed in either isolated micro-grids or off-grid remote areas throughout all Europe, from Italy (two sites) and Greece to Norway. The aim of this work is to perform a technoeconomic analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid H-2-battery Power-To-Power (P2P) solution in reducing the usage of external sources (e.g., diesel engines or grid) in a cost-effective way, with different load and environment conditions. The economic viability of the considered scenarios was outlined by computing the Levelized Cost Of Energy (LCOE). For each of the four sites, the innovative renewable configuration was compared with the current/alternative one. The REMOTE project partners provided main input data for the analysis: techno-economic data from the technology suppliers, whereas electricity consumption and RES production values from the end users of the four isolated locations. LCOE values derived using cost inputs both from REMOTE and literature are presented for a comparison. Results from the energy simulations revealed that the need for an external source is significantly reduced thanks to RES together with the hybrid storage system. Moreover, for all the four sites the renewable solution was shown to be more profitable than the current or alternative one, either in the short term or in the longer term.

TI  - An Exact Decomposition Approach for the Real-Time Train Dispatching Problem
T2  - OPERATIONS RESEARCH
AB  - Trains' movements on a railway network are regulated by official timetables. Deviations and delays occur quite often in practice, demanding fast rescheduling and rerouting decisions in order to avoid conflicts and minimize overall delay. This is the real-time train dispatching problem. In contrast with the classic "holistic" approach, we show how to decompose the problem into smaller subproblems associated with the line and the stations. This decomposition is the basis for a master-slave solution algorithm, in which the master problem is associated with the line and the slave problem is associated with the stations. The two subproblems are modeled as mixed integer linear programs, with specific sets of variables and constraints. Similarly to the classical Benders' decomposition approach, slave and master communicate through suitable feasibility cuts in the variables of the master. Extensive tests on real-life instances from single and double-track lines in Italy showed significant improvements over current dispatching performances. A decision support system based on this exact approach has been in operation in Norway since February 2014 and represents one of the first operative applications of mathematical optimization to train dispatching.

TI  - Highly variable species distribution models in a subarctic stream metacommunity: Patterns, mechanisms and implications
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. Metacommunity theory focuses on assembly patterns in ecological communities, originally exemplified through four different, yet non-exclusive, perspectives: patch dynamics, species sorting, source-sink dynamics, and neutral theory. More recently, three exclusive components have been proposed to describe a different metacommunity framework: habitat heterogeneity, species equivalence, and dispersal. Here, we aim at evaluating the insect metacommunity of a subarctic stream network under these two different frameworks.
   2. We first modelled the presence/absence of 47 stream insects in northernmost Finland, using binomial generalised linear models (GLMs). The deviance explained by pure local environmental (E), spatial (S), and climatic variables (C) was then analysed across species using beta regression. In this comparative analysis, site occupancy, as well as taxonomic and biological trait vectors obtained from principal coordinate analysis, were used as predictor variables.
   3. Single-species distributions were better explained by in-stream environmental and spatial factors than by climatic forcing, but in a highly variable fashion. This variability was difficult to relate to the taxonomic relatedness among species or their biological trait similarity. Site occupancy, however, was related to model performance of the binomial GLMs based on spatial effects: as populations are likely to be better connected for common species due to their near ubiquity, spatial factors may also explain better their distributions.
   4. According to the classical four-perspective framework, the observation of both environmental and spatial effects suggests a role for either mass effects or species sorting constrained by dispersal limitation, or both. Taxonomic and biological traits, including the different dispersal capability of species, were scarcely important, which undermines the patch dynamics perspective, based on differences in dispersal ability between species. The highly variable performance of models makes the reliance on an entirely neutral framework unrealistic as well. According to the three-component framework, our results suggest that the stream insect metacommunity is shaped by the effect of habitat heterogeneity (supporting both species-sorting and mass effects), rather than species equivalence or dispersal limitation.
   5. While the relative importance of the source-sink dynamics perspective or the species-sorting paradigm cannot be deciphered with the data at our disposal, we can conclude that habitat heterogeneity is an important driver shaping species distributions and insect assemblages in subarctic stream metacommunities. These results exemplify that the use of the three-component metacommunity framework may be more useful than the classical four perspective paradigm in analysing metacommunities. Our findings also provide support for conservation strategies based on the preservation of heterogeneous habitats in a metacommunity context.

TI  - Long-Term Experiments Reveal Strong Interactions Between Lemmings and Plants in the Fennoscandian Highland Tundra
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Both the theory and the observations suggest that, there are strong links between herbivores and plants in terrestrial ecosystems; although, the effect of herbivores on plant community biomass is often attributed to variations in plant palatability. The existence of a strong link is commonly tested by constructing exclosures that exclude herbivores during a period of time. We here present data from two long-term (9 and 20 years, respectively) herbivore exclosure studies in lemming habitats on arctic tundra in northernmost Norway. The exclusion of all mammalian herbivores triggered strong increases in community level plant biomass and substantial changes in plant community composition. Palatable plants like graminoids and large bryophytes, as well as unpalatable plants like evergreen ericoids, deciduous shrubs, and lichens were all favored by excluding lemmings. These results reveal that a substantial increase in community biomass which occurs only when plant species capable of accumulating biomass are present, and palatability is a poor predictor of long-term responses of plants to excluding herbivores.

TI  - Hotel networks and social capital in destination marketing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SERVICE INDUSTRY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The paper provides insights into destination marketing and the conditions and outcome of competitor co-operation in a local, horizontal hotel network. The specific purpose is to uncover the mechanics of such a network and offer a theory together with recommendations for practice and future research.
   Design/methodology/approach - In contrast with manufactured goods, which are distributed to the market, destination marketing distributes customers to a service production site. This basic prerequisite has effects on marketing strategies and the networking of competitors, and so has the fact that the services are in part delivered in interaction with customers and between customers at a physical place. The paper is based on inductive case study research, and the observations and conclusions from the empirical case data are given precedence over extant theory. The case, the Hotel Group, is a hotel network in the town of Ostersund, Sweden. The case is directed towards certain strategic business-to-business elements of destination marketing.
   Findings - The study shows that the Hotel Group has found a success formula. Among the results are that a drive for action, both planned and improvised, is more decisive for success than plans and expressed intentions; that networking is facilitated when local competitors build social capital through trust and commitment in action; and that competitors have to adhere to certain basic principles, strike a balance between seemingly contradictory strategies, and live by an agreed code of conduct.
   Research limitations/implications - The case study lays bare the need to rethink certain mainstream vantage points used in research. These include departure from the notion of small- and medium-sized businesses as autonomous economic entities and consider them part of networks; recognition of the social context and synergy of a network organization and its code of conduct; and learning to manage a social network by balancing seeming paradoxes and opposites. The study is temporally limited and does not forecast the sustainability and robustness of the network and its success formula over time and under changing conditions.
   Practical implications - The study offers normative and actionable insights about the success of a horizontal tourism network. The network members should adhere to three basic principles: show enthusiasm, give time, and contribute to financing; they have to perform balancing acts between the collective and individual, co-operation and competition, and planning/intention and action; and they have to follow a seven-point code of conduct.
   Originality/value - The paper contributes to a theory of co-operation in marketing networks. It empirically examines network mechanics when local competitors take action to improve their individual situation by improving the collective competitive position on the market, provides insights into destination marketing and the conditions and outcome of competitor co-operation in a local, horizontal hotel network.

TI  - Assessment of carbon dioxide emissions during production, construction and use stages of asphalt pavements
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES
AB  - The carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of flexible asphalt pavements are an important indicator of the sustainability of these infrastructures. The study aims at tentatively quantifying the CO2 released during production, construction and use stages of a road pavement, the analysis is performed adopting a Life Cycle Assessment approach. Each stage is structured based on data retrieved from an extensive literature review. Special focus is given to the use stage, which is usually only partially addressed. The study is achieved employing the "HERMES CO2" spreadsheet tool developed for the purpose and it is publicly available to maximize openness and the interaction with the user. As an illustrative application, the study then quantifies the generation of carbon dioxide for the three major categories of Norwegian highways referring to 1 km as functional unit with lifespan of 50 years. The analysis documents that the overall CO2 amount is approximately equal to 1 million metric tons, which is significantly related to the albedo and rolling resistance of the use stage. Overall, the research establishes a common methodology and analysis frame which is relevant to early planning of road pavements and can be refined further for specific case-studies.

TI  - Variability of the northeast Atlantic sea surface Δ<SUP>14</SUP>C and marine reservoir age and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS
AB  - We compiled new C-14 analyses of mollusc shells (bivalves and gastropods) of known age from the collection of the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris and previously published data to investigate changes in the sea surface Delta C-14 and reservoir age in the northeast Atlantic sector (NEA) between 1823 and 1952 AD. The mollusc shells are mainly located off the Atlantic margin between 45 degrees N and 60 degrees N downstream of the North Atlantic Current (NAC). We show that the temporal variability of the NEA Delta C-14 is independent of the mollusc species, depth habitat, diet and latitudinal distribution. The quasi-null difference between mollusc Delta C-14 and the marine model indicate that the mollusc Delta C-14 reflects the Delta C-14 values of open marine conditions. Between 1823 and 1850 AD, the pre-anthropogenic mean of Delta C-14 is -45 +/- 5 parts per thousand, corresponding to a reservoir age of 380 +/- 60 years and a Delta R value of -7 +/- 50 years, in agreement with previous estimates. The Delta C-14 values show a significant long-term decrease of similar to 12 parts per thousand from 1823 to 1952 AD attributed to changes in C-14 production between 1823 and 1900 AD and the Suess effect between 1900 and 1952 AD.
   Between 1885 and 1950 AD, Delta C-14 fluctuations of similar to 10 parts per thousand up to 18 parts per thousand occurred in the northeast Atlantic, corresponding to reservoir age variations of similar to 90 years up to 170 years. These fluctuations are very similar to changes of Delta C-14 in the southern Norwegian Sea. Spectral analyses of the NEA Delta C-14 exhibit quasi-periodic cycles of about 7.4 years, almost equivalent to the quasi-periodic cycles of the winter index of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with a period around 6.5 years. We find that changes of NEA Delta C-14 cannot be attributed to changes in river runoff or the precipitation/evaporation budget. The Delta C-14 lows (or high reservoir ages) correspond to the more intense phase of the winter NAO, with a time lag of similar to 1-3 years. Such a time lag may reflect the eastward transit time of upstream changes originating in the Labrador Sea, then entrained within the NAC along with the subpolar gyre into the northeast Atlantic sector. During these events, we estimate that about 70% of the total transport in the NAC was due to water originating in the Labrador Sea. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - MAMMALIAN DIVERSITY AND MATSES ETHNOMAMMALOGY IN AMAZONIAN PERU PART 3: MARSUPIALS (DIDELPHIMORPHIA)
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
AB  - This report is the third in our monographic series on mammalian diversity and Matses ethnomammalogy in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial region of northeastern Peru. Based on taxonomic analysis of specimens collected in the region, we document the occurrence of 19 species of marsupials in the genera Caluromys, Glironia, Hyladelphys, Marmosa, Monodelphis, Metachirus, Chironectes, Didelphis, Philander, Gracilinanus, and Marmosops. Our principal taxonomic results include the following: (1) we provide a phylogenetic analysis of previously unpublished mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data for Caluromys that supports the reciprocal monophyly of all currently recognized species in the genus but reveals substantial heterogeneity in one extralimital taxon; (2) we explain why Marmosa constantiae is the correct name for the southwestern Amazonian taxon previously known as Mar. demerarae, and we diagnose Mar. constantiae from Mar. rapposa, a superficially similar species from southern Peru, eastern Bolivia, and central Brazil; (3) we explain why Mar. rutteri is the correct name for one of the Amazonian species currently known as Mar. regina, and we restrict the latter name to the transAndean holotype; (4) we recognize Metachirus myosuros as a species distinct from Met. nudicaudatus based on morphological comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis of new mtDNA sequence data; and (5) we name a new species of Marmosops to honor the late Finnish-Peruvian naturalist Pekka Soini.
   Of the 19 marsupial species known to occur in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve, 16 have been recorded in sympatry at Nuevo San Juan, the Matses village where we based most of our fieldwork from 1995 to 1999. We explain why we believe the marsupial species list from Nuevo San Juan to be complete (or nearly so), and we compare it with a species list obtained by similarly intensive fieldwork at Paracou (French Guiana). Although Nuevo San Juan and Paracou are 2500 km apart on opposite sides of Amazonia, the same opossum genera are present at both sites, the lists differing only in the species represented in each fauna. We briefly discuss current explanations for spatial turnover in species of terrestrial vertebrates across Amazonian landscapes and provide evidence that the upper Amazon is a significant dispersal barrier for marsupials.
   Marsupials are not important to the Matses in any way. In keeping with their cultural inattention to mammals that are inconspicuous, harmless, and too small to be of dietary significance, the Matses lexically distinguish only a few kinds of opossums, and they are not close observers of opossum morphology or behavior.

TI  - The carbon cycle: implications on tectonics and climate changes
T2  - PERIODICO DI MINERALOGIA
AB  - Nowadays a general concern "flies" over the human community regarding the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Although there are authors that suggest anthropogenic influence of such increase after the discovery of agriculture (about 8,000 years ago; e.g., Ruddiman, 2003), it is evident that the industrial revolution the 19(th) century in central Europe, when wood and coal were burned extensively to refine iron, definitely influenced the natural trend of CO, variation. Only in the last thirty years has the input rate of CO, become really fast, and will grow faster and faster in the near future, when developing countries like India and China will reach the standard of life of the western countries, requiring an increasing demand of per capita daily energy need.
   The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide is a well-known phenomenon since the beginning of the 20(th) century when the Swedish chemist Arrhenius discovered this property by studying the transmission of heat in fluid materials. What is not commonly known is that rapid changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are natural events and that, in the past, even in a very recent past, large variations of climatic conditions have been related to sudden carbon dioxide variations in the atmosphere (Petit et al., 1999). It is very likely that mass extinction of dinosaurs and other animal species at the end of the Cretaceous may have been caused by such rapid variations.
   Causes of temperature variation of the atmosphere have been envisaged in both terrestrial and solar (Milankovitch Cycles in Hays et al., 1976) systems, but the quantification of the different natural sources of carbon dioxide, as the main cause of climate changes, is still quite poor. It is however well known that the weathering of silicate minerals (and about 99% of the terrestrial crust is made up of silicates) affects the consumption of CO2 from the atmosphere. Actually, without the discharge of terrestrial carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, plant and animal life would disappear in less than 300,000 years, and the temperature of the atmosphere would drop rapidly to values below 0 degrees C.
   Where is the deep "engine" that provides the continuous re-generation of carbon dioxide and allows its concentration in the atmosphere to be maintained more or less steady (varying roughly from 0.01 to 0.1% by volume)? This engine is not shallow and is located in the Earth's mantle, whose dynamo drives the continental drift as well as the melting of crustal material: volcanic activity continuously supplies carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
   Carbon dioxide, in spite of being a minor component, in both the crust and the atmosphere, really plays a role of paramount importance for both life and climate (through the greenhouse effect). However, our knowledge of the different sources (magmatic, metamorphic, and so forth) is still matter of debate. Experience in Italy has shown that non-magmatic carbon dioxide discharging from hydrothermal systems is an important reservoir of deep-seated carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, inside the carbon cycle the ratio between: i) bicarbonates generated by organic acids in silicate weathering of soils and discharged by rivers into the oceans and ii) the production of volcanic and non volcanic carbon dioxide, remains largely unbalanced, i.e. some deep carbon dioxide is still missing. Where is this carbon dioxide from? Is the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere something that human beings should really care about? The answer cannot be given, yet. The problem could probably be solved in the future, at least when the natural cycle of carbon dioxide and its feedback with solar cycles will be clearer than at present.

TI  - Assessing the Energy and Climate Sustainability of European Union Member States: An MCDM-Based Approach
T2  - SMART CITIES
AB  - Topics related to sustainable economic development are currently important issues in the modern world. However, the implementation of this concept and related operational strategies raises many controversies. On the one hand, it offers hope for ecological, safe, and independent economic development, while on the other hand, it raises public concerns about the costs of such changes. These problems are widely appreciated in the EU, which is the undoubted leader in implementing the concept of sustainable economic development. With regard to this issue, this paper presents the developed methodology for assessing the sustainable energy and climate development of the EU-27 countries. The basis of this assessment is 17 selected indicators characterizing the most important areas related to this development. Their selection was conditioned by the assumptions of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the goals (7 and 13) of the UN Agenda for Sustainable Development 2030. Five widely used methods for multi-criteria analysis supporting management processes (CODAS, EDAS, TOPSIS, VIKOR, and WASPAS) were used for the study. In order to carry out an unambiguous assessment and determine the final ranking of countries in terms of energy and climate sustainability, a methodology was developed to specify the normalized value of the Final Assessment Score (Asfinal). Based on it, the sustainability of individual EU-27 countries in 2010, 2015, and 2020 was assessed, and this assessment formed the basis for dividing these countries into four classes (levels) in terms of sustainability. The results confirmed the high differentiation of the EU-27 countries in terms of sustainability, indicating leaders as well as countries with low levels of sustainability. The countries with the highest and most stable levels of sustainable development of the economy are Sweden and Denmark. The results provide opportunities for their interpretation, both in terms of analyzing changes in individual indicators and in terms of the global assessment of sustainable development in individual countries. These results should be used when developing an energy and climate strategy for the next few years for the EU as a whole and for individual countries.

TI  - Parallel divergence in mate guarding behaviour following colonization of a novel habitat
T2  - JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY
AB  - Ecological factors can have profound effects on mating system and mating behaviour. We investigated the effect of altered ecological conditions, following colonization of a novel habitat, on precopulatory mate guarding in a freshwater isopod (Asellus aquaticus). This isopod occurs in two different ecotypes, which coexist within several different lakes in Sweden but which utilize different habitats. These ecotypes have rapidly (ca. 40 generations) diverged in parallel among lakes in several phenotypic characters, presumably as a response to different predatory pressures. Here, we demonstrate that also mate guarding characteristics have diverged in parallel between the ecotypes in different lakes. This is one of the few studies reporting parallel evolution of mating behaviour. Furthermore, our results also indicate a potential sexual conflict, as the length of mate guarding appears to lower components of female fitness. We discuss how novel environments might have strong and rapid effects on mate guarding dynamics and mating behaviour.

TI  - Assessment of Climate Impact and Costs Comparing Two Railway Embankment Fill Methods
T2  - 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN SOIL MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING, ZM 2022
CP  - 5th International Conference on New Developments in Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ICNDSMGE-ZM)
AB  - Emissions from infrastructure projects and construction projects have a large impact on the environment. Construction activities and materials, including geotechnical engineering works, account for a great share of that impact and the monetary costs of the projects. In railway projects, crushed bedrock is often used as fill material in the embankments, and less suitable soil is excavated and transported to a landfill causing emissions. Despite that, sustainability assessments are rarely made when comparing the crushed bedrock fill method with other alternative methods, when the geotechnical engineer is designing an embankment. This paper, therefore, shows how climate impact and monetary costs can be compared for two fill methods in a railway embankment in Sweden, namely crushed rock fill and fill made of cement-stabilized sandy till. A comparing life cycle assessment (LCA) of climate impact and a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) of monetary costs were made for the two methods. Activities and materials used in the production and construction stages were assessed. The results show that the stabilized sandy till method had both a smaller climate impact and lower life cycle cost (LCC) than the crushed bedrock fill method.

TI  - Loading to failure and 3D nonlinear FE modelling of a strengthened RC bridge
T2  - Structure and Infrastructure Engineering
AB  - A reinforced concrete railway trough bridge in ornskoldsvik, Sweden, was strengthened in bending with rods of carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer and loaded to failure. The aim was to test and calibrate methods developed in the European Research Project 'Sustainable Bridges' regarding assessment and strengthening of existing bridges. A steel beam was placed in the middle of one of the two spans and was pulled downwards. Failure was reached at an applied load of 11.7MN. It was initiated by a bond failure caused by a combined action of shear, torsion as well as bending after yielding in the longitudinal steel reinforcement and the stirrups. The bond failure led to a redistribution of the internal forces from the tensile reinforcement to the stirrups, causing the final failure. The computer models developed to simulate the loading process were improved step by step from linear shell models to more detailed models. The most developed model, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model with discrete reinforcement, gave accurate accounts of the response of the bridge.

T2  - NANO, BIO AND GREEN - TECHNOLOGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS, SGEM 2016, VOL II
CP  - 16th International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference (SGEM 2016)
AB  - Household consumption is the ultimate driver for all production in our economies, and a significant part is direct consumption that takes place within physical boundaries of the household, which we call the home. Important consumption categories include utilities like water, electricity, heating and cooling, but also the food we eat and the clothes we wear. To facilitate sustainable innovation in the built environment, reducing innovation cost and product time to market a co-creation open innovation approach is proposed, which is expected to lower thresholds for new innovation project for all actors, and in particular small to medium enterprises (SME's). In the Habitation Lab academia, public bodies, industry and users come together to form a quadruple helix of innovation. The open innovation process involves multiple stakeholders, and end users take on the role not only as test subjects, but also as active contributors and co-creators of new products and services. A newly built Habitation Lab in Gothenburg, Sweden, containing 29 apartments, a co-creation studio and 2,000 sensors is presented as a case study.

TI  - <i>Gute Policey</i> in Livonia in the Era of Catherine the Great
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
AB  - The policy of the Russian state in the Baltic provinces at the beginning of the reign of Catherine II (1762-1796) has been viewed mostly as a conflict between the czarina's unification policy emanating from enlightened absolutism and the wish of the Baltic German knighthoods and the upper strata of the cities in the Baltic provinces to maintain the status quo. The independent activity of the provincial authorities in administering the province has attracted far less attention. Riga's Governor General George von Browne (1698-1792, of Irish descent) headed that authority and had been appointed to his post during the reign of Peter III already.
   Browne's letters patent have been examined thus far in historical literature as discrete acts in the context of agrarian history, or the history of commerce or education. This article considers the above-mentioned letters patent as typical police ordinances aimed at reglementing all spheres of life in society in as much detail as possible. State reglementation - gute Policey reached its pinnacle with German cameralism. It is difficult to find a sphere of life that was not determined from higher up through laws, ordinances or precepts. Restrictions on luxuries on the one hand and poor relief, detailed market regulations, fire safety regulations, regulations for limiting the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics, instructions for road maintenance, etc. etc. on the other hand regulated daily life. Ordinances belonging to the sphere of gute Policey can also be found in Estonia and Livonia during the period of Swedish rule already and a large proportion of them were repeated in the first decades of Russian rule during the period that the undersigned has characterised as the conditional continuation of the Swedish era. The 1760's brought growth by leaps and bounds in reglementative ordinances.
   The ordinances concerning Livonia's peasantry issued by Governor General Browne in 1765 should also be considered in the context of cameralist letters patent issued with the aim towards gute Policey. At the same time, this was the first ordinance issued by the provincial authorities that encompassed the themes concerning the condition of the peasantry as a whole. The fact that the peasantry was also included in the ideal picture of gute Policey indicated the real interest of the authorities in their situation. We can say the same about all cameralist ordinances. In any case, they proved the will of those who set the norms to establish themselves, even if its actual implementation clearly fell short of the mark. A remarkable amount of ordinances from the beginning of the reign of Catherine II affected the Province of Livonia only and did not extend to the Province of Estonia. It cannot be ruled out that the ordinances of the 18th century gute Policey could have played a part in the head start that Livonia enjoyed compared to Estonia and which manifested itself during the subsequent century.

TI  - Linking modern pollen accumulation rates to biomass: Quantitative vegetation reconstruction in the western Klamath Mountains, NW California, USA
T2  - HOLOCENE
AB  - Quantitative reconstructions of vegetation abundance from sediment-derived pollen systems provide unique insights into past ecological conditions. Recently, the use of pollen accumulation rates (PAR, grains cm(-2) year(-1)) has shown promise as a bioproxy for plant abundance. However, successfully reconstructing region-specific vegetation dynamics using PAR requires that accurate assessments of pollen deposition processes be quantitatively linked to spatially-explicit measures of plant abundance. Our study addressed these methodological challenges. Modern PAR and vegetation data were obtained from seven lakes in the western Klamath Mountains, California. To determine how to best calibrate our PAR-biomass model, we first calculated the spatial area of vegetation where vegetation composition and patterning is recorded by changes in the pollen signal using two metrics. These metrics were an assemblage-level relevant source area of pollen (aRSAP) derived from extended R-value analysis (sensu Sugita, 1993) and a taxon-specific relevant source area of pollen (tRSAP) derived from PAR regression (sensu Jackson, 1990). To the best of our knowledge, aRSAP and tRSAP have not been directly compared. We found that the tRSAP estimated a smaller area for some taxa (e.g. a circular area with a 225 m radius for Pinus) than the aRSAP (a circular area with a 625 m radius). We fit linear models to relate PAR values from modern lake sediments with empirical, distance-weighted estimates of aboveground live biomass (AGL(dw)) for both the aRSAP and tRSAP distances. In both cases, we found that the PARs of major tree taxa - Pseudotsuga, Pinus, Notholithocarpus, and TCT (Taxodiaceae, Cupressaceae, and Taxaceae families) - were statistically significant and reasonably precise estimators of contemporary AGL(dw). However, predictions weighted by the distance defined by aRSAP tended to be more precise. The relative root-mean squared error for the aRSAP biomass estimates was 9% compared to 12% for tRSAP. Our results demonstrate that calibrated PAR-biomass relationships provide a robust method to infer changes in past plant biomass.

TI  - Ethnoichthyology of freshwater fish in Europe: a review of vanishing traditional fisheries and their cultural significance in changing landscapes from the later medieval period with a focus on northern Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
AB  - Background Fishing is probably one of the oldest economic activities in the history of humankind. Lakes, rivers and streams in Europe are important elements in the European landscape with a rich diversity of fish and other aquatic organisms. Artisanal fisheries have therefore been of great importance for the provision of food, but also animal feed, medicine, fertilizer and other needs. These fishermen had a deep knowledge about the waterscape and its biota. However, ethnoichthyology remains a small topic within contemporary ethnobiology in Europe. Our focus lies within northern Europe in the late medieval to modern period, but encompasses the wider area with some reference to earlier periods where informative. Method We have reviewed a large amount of literature mainly on the relationship between man and fish in freshwaters from late medieval times (defined here as the fifteenth century) until the early twenty-first century. The main focus is on freshwater (including anadromous and catadromous) fish in northern Europe, the main area of study for both authors, though examples have been included from elsewhere to indicate the widespread importance of these fisheries. The review includes studies from various fields such as archaeology, ethnography, fish biology, geography, linguistics and osteology to map what has been studied of interest in ethnoichthyology. These data have been analysed and critically reviewed. Results There are archaeozoological studies, studies of specialised fishers as well as artisanal fishing among the peasantry, research of folk taxonomies, fishing methods (including the use of poison) and gear, which are all of great interest for ethnoichthyology. There is also research on traditional preserving methods for fish as food and for other purposes. Of interest is the keeping of fish in wells, ponds and aquaria. However, there is still room for more research within many domains of ethnoichthyology. Conclusion Humans have always utilized fish and other aquatic resources. Nonetheless, few ethnobiologists working within Europe are so far researching human-fish relationships. This paper demonstrates the range of research available, but also points to future studies. It is important to widen ethnobiological research in Europe to include fish.

TI  - Investigation of some factors affecting habitat selection and nest size of Formica rufa
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - The study aimed to assess the habitat preferences and nest volumes of Formica rufa in coniferous stands, taking into account various stand, topographic, and climatic variables. The variables that impact the habitat of F. rufa in the Western Black Sea region were identified through the utilization of climate data, stand map, DEM data, and field data. Ten different variables were analyzed separately for F. rufa nests using the Geographic Information System (GIS). Based on the stand variables, it can be inferred that F. rufa were predominantly preferred as overmature, full canopy cover, medium and poor site class, and productive stands. Based on the analysis of topographical variables, the ants exhibit a preference for areas that have low slopes, high elevations, and shady aspects. Additionally, the investigation of climatic variables revealed a higher incidence of ants in regions with an average temperature below 12 degrees C, and low levels of precipitation. It was determined that nest volumes are larger in high site index, productive stands, young stands, low crown closure stands and high elevation. Based on the findings, it is crucial to monitor the habitat preferences of F. rufa over extended periods and large geographical areas. The protection and enhancement of their habitats are imperative for the sustainability and health of the ecosystem.

TI  - Crown plasticity of five pine species in response to competition along an aridity gradient
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Crown dimensions such as diameter or crown projection area are important indicators for tree vigour, growing stage or production efficiency and can be used as proxies for the assessment of wood quality, leaf area and leaf biomass, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and disturbance risk to forest stability. Crown allometry can vary with site and competition conditions, but variation patterns are not still well understood.
   The main aim of this study was to analyze this allometry variation in the most common pine species along the aridity gradient of the Iberian Peninsula, studying the crown response to aridity and to competition, and determining whether the presence of inter-specific competition modifies crown allometry.
   A set of 40,402 sample trees from 12,283 sample plots, along with the Martonne aridity index as an indicator of climatic conditions, were used to develop allometric models, the parameters of which were generalized by including aridity and competition indicators. The plots were located in monospecific or mixed stands of Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra, Pinus pinaster, Pinus pinea and Pinus halepensis.
   According to our results, both aridity conditions and competition status are important factors modifying the crown allometry of the studied species. Moreover, we found that both size-symmetric competition and size-asymmetric competition should be taken into account when modelling the crown size, both types leading to smaller crown diameter. The crown plasticity of the studied pine species in response to competition presented a low range of variation, the greatest being that of maritime pine, while Scots pine and black pine showed the smallest. The way in which aridity and competition influence crown size differs among the studied species, indicating differences in crown plasticity patterns. Moreover, in humid sites, where competition for light is more important, the crown allometry response to changes in competition is greater, being most evident in P. pinea and P. halepensis.
   The species mixing effects had less influence on pine crown allometry than the total competition effect, although the effect was always significant. The effect of size-symmetric competition from admixed species was positive or neutral, except for the effect of P. sylvestris on P. nigra crowns. Size-asymmetric competition also plays an important role in the species mixing effects, these effects on intermediate or suppressed trees varying depending on the species mixture. The models developed reveal significant species-specific effects on crown allometry, pointing to the ability of pine species to adapt their crowns to different growing conditions.

T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
CP  - 6th International Crustacean Congress (ICC6)
AB  - We review the patterns of recent range expansions and the biology of the invasive Ponto-Caspian predatory onychopod cladocerans: Cercopagis pengoi, Evadne anonyx, Podonevadne trigona, Cornigerius maeoticus and Cornigerius bicornis. Recent invasions of C. pengoi, E. anonyx and C. maeoticus into the Baltic Sea can be attributed to the climate change, facilitating invasibility of the eastern Baltic Sea coastal ecosystems by the warm water Ponto-Caspian species and intensive shipping activities via the Volga-Baltic waterway (European "northern invasion corridor"). All three species can be considered to be established in pelagic communities of the eastern Gulf of Finland. Only one onychopod species, C. pengoi has invaded the North American Great Lakes via an existing invasion corridor between the eastern Baltic and the Great Lakes. Invasive onychopods may possess adaptive life cycles, switching to early gamogenetic reproduction which enables their establishment in recipient ecosystems and further dispersal. Analysis of temperature and salinity ranges of the Ponto-Caspian onychopod species in native and invaded habitats, indicates that they are potentially able to form populations in a wide range of inland and coastal water ecosystems in temperate zones. Ponto-Caspian onychopods can be considered as "high risk" invasive species, in terms of their potential for range expansion and impact on recipient ecosystems.

TI  - Leveraging Northern European population history: novel low-frequency variants for polycystic ovary syndrome
T2  - HUMAN REPRODUCTION
AB  - STUDY QUESTION Can we identify novel variants associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by leveraging the unique population history of Northern Europe? SUMMARY ANSWER We identified three novel genome-wide significant associations with PCOS, with two putative independent causal variants in the checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) gene and a third in myosin X (MYO10). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY PCOS is a common, complex disorder with unknown aetiology. While previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped several loci associated with PCOS, the analysis of populations with unique population history and genetic makeup has the potential to uncover new low-frequency variants with larger effects. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A population-based case-control GWAS was carried out. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS We identified PCOS cases from national registers by ICD codes (ICD-10 E28.2, ICD-9 256.4, or ICD-8 256.90), and all remaining women were considered controls. We then conducted a three-stage case-control GWAS: in the discovery phase, we had a total of 797 cases and 140 558 controls from the FinnGen study. For validation, we used an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, including 2812 cases and 89 230 controls. Finally, we performed a joint meta-analysis of 3609 cases and 229 788 controls from both cohorts. Additionally, we reran the association analyses including BMI as a covariate, with 2169 cases and 160 321 controls from both cohorts. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Two out of the three novel genome-wide significant variants associating with PCOS, rs145598156 (P = 3.6x10(-8), odds ratio (OR) = 3.01 [2.02-4.50] minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.005) and rs182075939 (P = 1.9x10(-16), OR = 1.69 [1.49-1.91], MAF = 0.04), were found to be enriched in the Finnish and Estonian populations and are tightly linked to a deletion c.1100delC (r(2) = 0.95) and a missense I157T (r(2) = 0.83) in CHEK2. The third novel association is a common variant near MYO10 (rs9312937, P = 1.7 x 10(-8), OR = 1.16 [1.10-1.23], MAF = 0.44). We also replicated four previous reported associations near the genes Erb-B2 Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 4 (ERBB4), DENN Domain Containing 1A (DENND1A), FSH Subunit Beta (FSHB) and Zinc Finger And BTB Domain Containing 16 (ZBTB16). When adding BMI as a covariate only one of the novel variants remained genome-wide significant in the meta-analysis (the EstBB lead signal in CHEK2 rs182075939, P = 1.9x10(-16), OR = 1.74 [1.5-2.01]) possibly owing to reduced sample size. LARGE SCALE DATA The age- and BMI-adjusted GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics are available for download from the GWAS Catalog with accession numbers GCST90044902 and GCST90044903. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The main limitation was the low prevalence of PCOS in registers; however, the ones with the diagnosis most likely represent the most severe cases. Also, BMI data were not available for all (63% for FinnGen, 76% for EstBB), and the biobank setting limited the accessibility of PCOS phenotypes and laboratory values. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study encourages the use of isolated populations to perform genetic association studies for the identification of rare variants contributing to the genetic landscape of complex diseases such as PCOS.

TI  - The effect of domestic sheep on forage plants of wild reindeer; a landscape scale experiment
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH
AB  - Domestic herbivores often compete with wildlife for limited resources, and on longer time-scales, grazing may also increase or decrease coverage of important food plants to wildlife affecting the threshold density for when competition can be expected. In Norway, there are growing concerns about the effect of releasing 2.1 million domestic sheep (Ovis aries) for summer grazing into areas hosting wild populations of alpine reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We quantified the effect of sheep grazing (0, 25 and 80 sheep/km(2)) on the development in coverage and abundance of plants known to be important in the diet of reindeer during summer (vascular plants) and winter (lichens) within a fully replicated, landscape scale (2.7 km(2)) experiment. From 2001 to 2005, the sedge, Carex bigelowii, increased while the herb Solidago virgaurea decreased in frequency at high density of sheep relative to controls (both marginally non-significant). There was no marked development in Deschampsia flexuosa, Salix herbacea or Hierarcium alpinum that could be related to sheep grazing intensity. Lichen coverage and height both decreased at high density of sheep from 2002 to 2005. Effects of low grazing intensity were closer to controls than to high grazing intensity. Our study highlights that high sheep grazing intensity induce changes to the plant community that, at the same time, can improve the summer habitat and detriment the winter habitat to reindeer. Many wild reindeer populations are fragmented and may thus be limited by either summer or winter range. The effect of sheep grazing is predicted to vary accordingly. However, currently, we have limited ability to quantify how much this explicitly means in terms of increased or reduced carrying capacity for reindeer.

TI  - Compositional Changes in Foliage Phenolics with Plant Age, a Natural Experiment in Boreal Forests
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY
AB  - The composition of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) extensively impacts ecosystem functioning. It is vital that we understand temporal patterns in the plants' allocation of resources to PSMs, particularly those influenced by human activity. Existing data are insufficient in the long-term perspective of perennial plants (age or ontogeny). We analysed phenolic concentrations in foliage from birch (Betula pubescens Ehr.) considered to be undamaged and growing on 5, 10 and 15 years old clear-cuts in two boreal forest landscapes in Norway, sampled at the peak of the growing season. In sum, low molecular weight phenolic concentrations decreased with age. Apart from one apigenin glycoside, the low molecular weight phenolics co-varied similarly at all ages, suggesting a lack of temporal compound-specific prioritisation of this group. In contrast, the concentration of MeOH-soluble condensed tannins increased with age. The compositional shift fits well with several hypotheses that may provide proximate explanations for age patterns in PSM allocations, including both resource constraints and external pressures. Regardless of these explanations, our study adds an important perennial perspective (plant age) to temporal PSM patterns already well-known in boreal plant phenology (foliage age).

TI  - How to get commuters out of private cars? Exploring the role of perceived social impacts in mode choice in five European countries
T2  - ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Shifting away from private vehicle use in urban areas is a necessary step in the decarbonisation of mobility. A thorough understanding of the determinants of travel mode choice is paramount for developing policies that can effectively nudge people to make this shift. This paper analyses mode choice in commuting and grocery shopping journeys considering attitudes towards mobility, socio-economic factors and journey characteristics. A multinomial logistic regression is performed on survey data from 5028 household in five European countries (Hungary, Italy, Poland, Norway and Spain) to describe the choice between private vehicle, public transport and active modes. Measures for perception of negative transport externalities (that is indirect negative impacts from road transport activity) and support for sustainable mobility transition policies are considered. Results show that commuters more sensitive to negative transport externalities prefer private vehicles to public transport or active travel. This suggests a paradox may exist with respect to the perception of these externalities. Other factors such as journey characteristics, policy intervention support and family size have also a strong influence on mode choice.

TI  - Innovative stabilization techniques for weak crushed rocks used in road unbound layers: A laboratory investigation
T2  - TRANSPORTATION GEOTECHNICS
AB  - The "Ferry-free coastal highway route E39" project includes building several long tunnels along the southwestern Norwegian coast. The tunnelling operations will generate a large quantity of blasted rocks; these could be used in the road unbound layers close to the place of production to provide a sustainable cost-benefit application. The existing design guidelines define strength requirements for road unbound layers in terms of Los Angeles and micro-Deval tests. Even if the major part of the rocks has igneous origin and could potentially fulfil the standard tests, the damage induced by the confined heavy blasting makes the materials fail the check procedures. The research investigates how to enable the use of the "weak" rocks by investigating three possible techniques. The first approach is the mixture between the different types of rocks available in situ. The second approach is additive application; two different non-traditional additive types are examined: one is polymer-based, the other one is lignin-based. The third approach is the attempt to modify the rocks mineralogical structure by overheating. The research test campaign uses both the aforementioned standard tests and repeated triaxial load tests. Rocks mixture and additives application are viable and sustainable methods to improve the mechanical properties of the "weak" crushed metamorphic rocks. Overheating does not turn out to be an effective and convenient procedure.

TI  - Functional biogeography: Stoichiometry and thresholds for interpreting nutrient limitation in aquatic plants
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Atmospheric N pollution may shift nutrient limitations in aquatic autotrophs from N to P or cause an intensification of P limitation in formerly pristine areas. Small changes in nutrient supply in oligotrophic lakes and rivers could lead to large changes in relative plant growth and yield with possible knock on effects on ecosystem carbon cycling through changes in the decomposition rate of their tissue. Previous biogeographical studies have shown inconsistent responses of plant nutrient tissue content and stoichiometry (functional traits) to external nutrient availability. Here we used a single species, Juncus bulbosus, to test the interplay between plant tissue nutrient (content and stoichiornetry) and external environmental factors (local and catchment scale). We developed a comparative approach applicable globally to assess the thresholds for nutrient limitation in aquatic plants in the wild. Phosphorus in Juncus bulbosus tissue was negatively related to sediment organic matter (Fe root plaque limiting P uptake) and catchment vegetation cover (less P leaching to lakes). Our comparative approach revealed that the lack of increase in N plant tissue along the strong gradient in external N concentration may be explained by P limitation and strict plant tissue N:P ratio. Our comparative approach further showed that the nutrient content and stoichiometry ofJuncus bulbosus was similar to other submerged aquatic plants growing in nutrient poor aquatic ecosystems. In southern Norway, mass development of Juncus bulbosus may be primarily triggered by changes in P availability, rather than CO2 or inorganic N, as previously thought, although co-limitations are also possible. If so, the mass development of Juncus bulbosus in oligotrophic aquatic ecosystems could be an early indicator of increasing P fluxes through these ecosystems which are less limited by N due to high atmospheric N deposition.

TI  - Nutrient Budgets in Forests Under Increased Biomass Harvesting Scenarios
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
AB  - A developing bioeconomy and the need for alternate sources of energy are promoting a more intensive procurement and use of forest biomass. While it is a fact that increased biomass harvesting generates greater nutrient losses from forest ecosystems relative to stem-only harvesting,the use of nutrient budget approaches as a decision support tool in managing forests under intensive biomass removal is uncommon. This lack of use can be explained by several factors including: large uncertainties in predicting certain fluxes, the poor representation of nutrient dynamics following harvest in nutrient cycling models,the lack of representation of biological feedback,the lack of appropriate validation,and finally the lack of maps of specific soil properties that would be required to predict nutrient budgets over forest landscapes. This review documents the impact of intensive biomass extraction on nutrient cycling and discusses the gaps in knowledge and the uncertainties associated with nutrient budgets. It identifies research and development issues that need to be resolved for making forest nutrient budgets more reliable and more useful to address the questions regarding the environmental sustainability of intensive biomass harvesting.

TI  - Dispersal and life history strategies in epiphyte metacommunities: alternative solutions to survival in patchy, dynamic landscapes
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Host trees for obligate epiphytes are dynamic patches that emerge, grow and fall, and metacommunity diversity critically depends on efficient dispersal. Even though species that disperse by large asexual diaspores are strongly dispersal limited, asexual dispersal is common. The stronger dispersal limitation of asexually reproducing species compared to species reproducing sexually via small spores may be compensated by higher growth rates, lower sensitivity to habitat conditions, higher competitive ability or younger reproductive age. We compared growth and reproduction of different groups of epiphytic bryophytes with contrasting dispersal (asexual vs. sexual) and life history strategies (colonists, short- and long-lived shuttle species, perennial stayers) in an old-growth forest stand in the boreo-nemoral region in eastern Sweden. No differences were seen in relative growth rates between asexual and sexual species. Long-lived shuttles had lower growth rates than colonists and perennial stayers. Most groups grew best at intermediate bark pH. Interactions with other epiphytes had a small, often positive effect on growth. Neither differences in sensitivity of growth to habitat conditions nor differences in competitive abilities among species groups were found. Habitat conditions, however, influenced the production of sporophytes, but not of asexual diaspores. Presence of sporophytes negatively affected growth, whereas presence of asexual diaspores did not. Sexual species had to reach a certain colony size before starting to reproduce, whereas no such threshold existed for asexual reproduction. The results indicate that the epiphyte metacommunity is structured by two main trade-offs: dispersal distance vs. reproductive age, and dispersal distance vs. sensitivity to habitat quality. There seems to be a trade-off between growth and sexual reproduction, but not asexual. Trade-offs in species traits may be shaped by conflicting selection pressures imposed by habitat turnover and connectivity rather than by species interactions.

TI  - How the coal farmers managed to defeat the Ironworks owner, Bernt Anker - Peasant politics and peasant economy in the Oslo Fjord region in the 18th century
T2  - HISTORISK TIDSSKRIFT
AB  - As far as I can determine, the concept "political culture" has not been much used in analyses of peasant resistance or in conflicts between the common people and the authorities in Norway in periods prior to 1800. In my study of the conflict between the circumference farmers and the ironworks owner, Bernt Anker, on the obligatory deliveries of charcoal, I have not limited my research to controversies, conflicts of interests and power structures. Through a close reading of the extremely rich source materials, I have tried to determine whether there is a pattern of underlying political culture. In defining "political culture" I have attached importance to several factors, most importantly the participants' political "range of action" in conflicts and decision-making. I have paid particular attention to the norms and rituals by means of which different groups or individuals exert influence in decision-making inside and outside bureaucratic channels. The range of action is not a constant factor, but instead is subject to pressures and change. As a result of skilful organization and effective measures the circumference farmers managed to shift the "political limits".
   The conflicts resulting from forcing these farmers to ensure the delivery of charcoal show that the common people had a relatively large political range of action. The farmers could deign to refuse or retard the production and delivery of charcoal without the authorities interpreting their acts as threats to social order or riot. The commission appointed by the Oberbergamt (chief mining office) in 1785 clearly expressed points of view indicating that refusals of delivery were not really considered punishable offences. The commission advised that the farmers should be persuaded rather than forced to make the deliveries, doubting that threats and sanctions would give the desired outcome.
   The central authorities tried, it is true, by legislation to prevent popular assemblies that could lead to riots. There has obviously been a great difference between law and reality. In the conflict between the Moss Ironworks and the circumference farmers, we can see that the authorities allowed the farmers extensive freedom of assembly, and complaints from the popular assemblies, letters of complaints from the local communities and the sending of peasant delegates to defend the farmers' interests, together with sabotage and delays, were not considered illegal actions. These types of action were at least to a certain extent accepted as part of the political culture, even though the owner of the Moss Iron Works considered them illegal.

TI  - EVIDENCE FOR A RELICT GLACIAL LANDSCAPE IN QUEBEC-LABRADOR
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
AB  - Two major glacial landform systems occur in Labrador.  These are the radial lineation and esker swarm reflection Late Wisconsinan decay, and the Ungava Bay lineation and esker swarm reflecting convergent northward flow.  In some sectors the two landform systems give conflicting evidence regarding deglaciation pattern.  We have interpreted the ice sheet dynamics in Labrador from morphological data, using a new inversion model that treats spatial patterns of deglacial meltwater landforms separately from lineation patterns.  In the George River area we have found that the Ungava Bay swarm of deglacial landforms has been overprinted at a right angle by a younger regional meltwater pattern from the last deglaciation.  A similar overprint also exists along the intersection line in west-central Labrador.  These relations show that the previously accepted relative ages of the two landform systems (Hughes, 1964; Boulton and Clark, 1990a,b; Klassen and Thompson, 1993) have to be reversed.  We interpret the Ungava Bay lineation and esker swarm to represent a 0.25 x 10(6) km2 pre-Late Wisconsinan relict landscape, formed during the deglaciation of an older ice sheet and later preserved in a dry-based central zone of the Labrador dome.

TI  - <i>Wolbachia</i> increases the susceptibility of a parasitoid wasp to hyperparasitism
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB  - The success of maternally transmitted endosymbiotic bacteria, such as Wolbachia, is directly linked to their host reproduction but in direct conflict with other parasites that kill the host before it reaches reproductive maturity. Therefore, symbionts that have evolved strategies to increase their host's ability to evade lethal parasites may have high penetrance, while detrimental symbionts would be selected against, leading to lower penetrance or extinction from the host population. In a natural population of the parasitoid wasp Hyposoter horticola in the Aland Islands (Finland), the Wolbachia strain wHho persists at an intermediate prevalence (similar to 50%). Additionally, there is a negative correlation between the prevalence of Wolbachia and a hyperparasitoid wasp, Mesochorus cf. stigmaticus, in the landscape. Using a manipulative field experiment, we addressed the persistence of Wolbachia at this intermediate level, and tested whether the observed negative correlation could be due to Wolbachia inducing either susceptibility or resistance to parasitism. We show that infection with Wolbachia does not influence the ability of the wasp to parasitize its butterfly host, Melitaea cinxia, but that hyperparasitism of the wasp increases in the presence of wHho. Consequently, the symbiont is detrimental, and in order to persist in the host population, must also have a positive effect on fitness that outweighs the costly burden of susceptibility to widespread parasitism.

TI  - Optimal Sustainable Transport Solutions Integrated into a Nordic Municipal Energy System
T2  - 2019 NORDIC WORKSHOP ON POWER AND INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (NORPIE)
CP  - Nordic Workshop on Power and Industrial Electronics (NORPIE)
AB  - In Nordic environments the cold climate, largescale industries, and a high share of electric heating drive energy consumption and create significant peak electricity demand in municipal energy systems. Prospects for decarbonizing the transport sector by electrification escalate these challenges, while availability and sustainability concerns limit biofuel use. Local authorities are committed to contributing to national climate goals, while considering local objectives for economic development, increased energy self-sufficiency and affordable energy costs. This research combines these goals into a multio-bjective optimization problem (MOOP), and solves the MOOP by interfacing the energy systems simulation tool EnergyPLAN with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) implemented in Matlab. In this way, the study generates optimal solutions for integrated electricity, heating and transport sectors and valuable insights are offered to decision makers in local authorities. Pitea (Norrbotten County, Sweden) is a typical Nordic municipality and serves as a case study for this research. Results show that CO2 emissions from the integrated system can be reduced up to 60% without a considerable increase of total annual costs, and that in the same range of emission reductions it is economically more convenient to invest in electric personal vehicles, light trucks and busses.

TI  - Networked business models for current and future road freight transport: taking a truck manufacturer's perspective
T2  - TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB  - Technological development is rapidly having an impact on the road freight transport system. In parallel, there are suggestions for new types of business models to approach the network and complex features of business. In this paper, we raise the question of what this means in the road freight transport business from a truck manufacturer's perspective. The purpose is to analyse the contents of and developments in networked business models for road freight transport in Sweden with the overall aim to contribute to sustainable transport solutions. The paper builds on a qualitative case study methodology of a truck OEM. The results display three forms of networked business models: business models in stable, established and emerging networks. The stable business model is based on the present situation with the truck at the centre. The established business model is partly based on the present and partly on the future with the focus on uptime of the trucks. The emerging business model is future-oriented and contains technological development of connectivity, electrification and automation. Managerial implications regard that coping with the emerging business is necessary but result in great uncertainty regarding how to interact, which resources to invest in and how to coordinate activities.

TI  - Exploring organisational hybridity from a learning perspective
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN ACCOUNTING AND MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore if the application of a framework building on organisational learning focusing on organisational processes can increase our understanding of how hybrid organisation develops over time and why they fail to live up to external expectations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The aim of this study is descriptive and explorative. It is accordingly designed as a qualitatively oriented case study. To capture the process of forming and developing hybrid organisations, the study takes a longitudinal approach. The case chosen for the study is a municipally owned company in Sweden providing waste management services. The study revolves around empirical data gathered in official documents and in face-to-face interviews. All the data concern the time span between 2004 and 2016.
   Findings - The analysis of the case studied provides us with insights into how hybridity manifests itself in mind-set and processes. There is a need for individuals within and around the organisation to be aware of and accept new goals and strategies to change their behaviour accordingly. The result of this study thus shows that contrary to findings in previous research on hybrid organisations, merely changing the structure of the organisation is not sufficient. Instead, learning is key to the development of hybridity and to overcome goal incongruence and conflicts of interest in hybrid organisations. However, this takes time and is likely to be dependent on individuals' willingness to accept and adapt these new strategies and goals.
   Research limitations/implications - The result of this study is based on one single case study in one specific hybrid context. No empirical generalisation is aspired to. Instead, the aim has been to - through an explorative approach - make an analytical contribution to the knowledge about hybrid organisations. Further studies are thus necessary to deepen the understanding of the hybrid context and the situations under which hybrid organisations operate and develop.
   Practical implications - Based on the result from this study, it seems that an organisation needs to learn how to be a hybrid organisation. There are no isolated structural solutions that can create a hybrid organisation other than in a formal sense. New ways to exploit organisational resources and the hybrid context are necessary to find new and innovative ways of how to use the hybrid context in a way that improves service sector delivery.
   Originality/value - Predominately, research on hybrid organisations has until recently been working with the premise that hybrids are not a breed of its own but a mix of two or several ideal types. Consequently, the result from this type of research has often landed in a conclusion regarding the complexity of combining what often is considered contradictory and conflicting goals. In this paper, a different and novel approach is taken. The paper illustrates how hybrid organisations develop over time, and it suggests that hybridity manifests itself in mindset and processes. The main contribution is an exploration and illustration of how organisational learning may be considered as the missing link between the structural orientation of previous explanations of hybrid organisations and the organisational property of hybridity. Hybridity is the result of exposure to, acceptance of and adaptation to new goals and strategies and expresses itself in "hybrid behaviour".

TI  - Reduction in car-bicycle conflict at a road-cycle path intersection: Evidence of road user adaptation?
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR
AB  - The influence that cycle paths have on accident numbers is not clear, probably because the unique contexts into which each path is introduced have not been sufficiently accounted for. This study aims to explore an important addition to the list of variables that can be used to describe these contexts, that of learning and adaptation by those road users regularly encountering the cycle path. A total of 57 h of video registrations were made of yielding and conflict events between cars and bicycles at a Norwegian road-cycle path intersection, at 2 months, 4 years and 10 years following its introduction. A significant decrease in overall conflict levels was found 4 years after path introduction, with a further decrease 10 years after path introduction, although the decrease between 4 and 10 years was not significant. The decrease in conflicts was mirrored by an increase in the number of car-bicycle yielding events not resulting in conflict. The yielding and conflict incidents registered were classified according to eight possible intersection scenarios, and compared over time to the yielding behaviours of drivers and cyclists in each scenario. Those scenarios in which no conflicts occurred in over 28 h of registrations 10 years following path introduction were the very same scenarios in which changes in driver yielding behaviour were apparent between 4 and 10 years following path introduction. Together these results have important implications both for cycle path evaluations and the modelling of road user behaviour at junctions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Climate variability and historical NW European fisheries
T2  - CLIMATE DEVELOPMENT AND HISTORY OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC REALM
CP  - 1st Hanse Conference on Past Climate and Its Significance for Human History in Northwestern Europe
AB  - Climate variability has affected marine ecosystems in NW Europe and their fisheries with concomitant implications for coastal populations. Long-term biological time series are essential for the retrospective analysis of a climate impact on marine ecosystems, however, they are scarce. Fish populations usually provide longer records than other biological components of marine ecosystems because of their economical importance. The dynamics of exploited fish populations are affected by environmental variability and man-made activities (fishing, habitat alteration) and retrospective studies will help to distinguish between the two. Records of the herring fishery off the Swedish coast of Bohuslan, in the Skagerrak, date back to the 10(th) century. This fishery is presented in this review as a case study for a climatically driven fishery the success and failure of which dramatically influenced the economy of an entire region throughout the last thousand years. A study of the climatological/ hydrographic scenario of the Bohuslan fishery periods and those of other European herring and sardine fisheries in Europe showed that they seem to be governed by decadal variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation. A comparison with the long-term dynamics of anchovy and sardine populations throughout the Pacific and in the South Atlantic points to a basin-wide and, perhaps even global, synchrony in fish population dynamics which might be driven by climate variability.

TI  - The Influence of Power and Trust on the Initiation and Duration of Modal Shift Solutions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Modal shift to more energy-efficient alternatives, such as from road to rail or sea, is one path to reduce negative environmental effects. Transport providers and shippers have crucial roles in modal choice decisions, and a better understanding of the influence of interorganisational factors on modal shift is needed. The purpose is to increase the understanding of opportunities for modal shifts by exploring the influence of power and trust at the interface between transport providers and shippers. Aspects of power (coercive, reward, legitimate, expert and referent) and trust (contractual, competence and goodwill) influencing modal shifts were identified from interviews with shippers and transport providers in Sweden. During the initiation phase of modal shift, power appears more important, while trust is shown essential for the duration. By proactively suggesting modal shift, transport providers can use expert power to create rewards and referent power, through recognition of their expertise. Building trust, particularly goodwill trust, such as time invested in understanding the other party, transparency about challenges and jointly seeking solutions, is key to establish long-term modal shifts. This paper contributes to modal shift literature with insights on power balances and trust between transport providers and shippers.

AB  - Background: Social isolation, loneliness and anxiety-depressive states are emerging health conditions in the elderly. Research question: To assess whether a 4-month programme of physical activity in a group improves the emotional, social and quality of life situation in a sample of subjects over 64 years old people. Methods: Multi-centre randomized clinical trial of two groups. Study population: Patients older than 64 years assigned to three primary care teams from different locations. Inclusion criteria: Submit a score <32 on the DUKE-UNC-11 social support scale, or >12 on the Beck Depression Scale, or >10 on the Generalized Anxiety Scale (GAD-7), at the start of the study. The intervention group participated in a group physical activity program for 4-months that consisted of progressively walking sessions two days a week, 60-150 minutes long depending on the physical condition of each participant. Results: Enrolled were 94 patients who met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 74 years (SD 5.18) and 76.6% were women. No significant differences were found at the beginning of the study between the two groups in relation to the outcome of the scales evaluated. Once the intervention was completed, improvement in the quality of life and social support was detected in the intervention group (p<.05). Both groups improved the depression and anxiety clinic but the improvement in the participants of the intervention group was higher. Those with initial depression improved 8.6 points on the scale, compared to the control that improved 3.3 points, with the final average of 17.4. Those who presented initial anxiety improved 8 points (final average: 7.5 points, cut-off point for the diagnosis of anxiety 10), compared to the control that improved 5.1 points. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that the program developed has positive effects on improving the quality of life, social support and depression and anxiety clinic.
   Background: Tourism represents 45% gross domestic product in Balearic Islands. Working as a hotel housekeeper (HH) has been associated with important morbidity, especially musculoskeletal, chronic pain, a significant number of sick leaves, a high consumption of medication, poor psychological well-being and worse quality of life. Research question: Explore perceptions and opinions regarding the HH's work and health problems. Estimate and evaluate HH's health determinants, the exposition to several occupational risk factors, their lifestyles and health problems and their quality of life. Methods: Design: mixed methods: (1) exploratory qualitative study (QS) including 10 semi-structured interviews and six focus groups; (2). descriptive study (DS): individual interviews and clinical medical records. Inclusion criteria: older than 18 years, had worked during the last summer season in the Balearic Islands. Analysis: QS: transcription and content analysis; DS: descriptive statistical analysis. Results: QS: Identified positive aspects of their work: timetables, relationship with co-workers, attending clients. Highlighted negative aspects: working conditions, hard physical workload, stressful duties and insufficiently rewarded. HH associated their health problems with their work; coping strategies: self-medication or visiting their general practitioner. DS: 1.043 HH included. Mean age 43.3 years, mean working years as HH 10.7 years. Mean rooms/day: 18.1 (+/- 6.5); mean beds/day: 44.6 (+/- 20.7). HH reported often pain during the last summer season: 68.2% (IC 95% 65.3-71.0) low back pain; 60.9% (IC 95% 57.8-63.8) wrist and hands; 55.3% (IC 95% 52.2-58.3) cervical. 41.6% and 35.1% self-reported regular and poor health status, respectively. Conclusion: HH perceived hard and stressful working conditions, partly justified by the number of rooms and beds made per day. They also perceived health problems related to their work. HH frequently reported pain during the last summer season. Moreover, they perceive regular or poor health status, weaker than women from the same social class do.
   Background: Gender-based violence (GBV) is a public health and human rights issue, being highly prevalent (12-51%), repetitive and having a severe impact on women's health, with a high sanitary and social cost. Primary care has a key role in detection and management. There is low detection and delay in diagnosis. There is a lack of preparation to recognize abuse, especially in the approach and action after detection. Greater awareness and sensitization is required. Research question: Can a brief specific training intervention in GBV imparted to primary health care professionals in their primary health centre increase knowledge, improve attitudes and skills? Methods: A cluster-randomized clinical trial was carried out in Vigo area primary health centres with at least 20 health care professionals. A basal evaluation was made through a validated inquiry (PREMIS), which they had to retake after three months. In the intervention centres, a clinical session was imparted. pResults: Out of 264 primary health care professionals, 145 participated. There was a 63.5% loss out of 145 professionals. A statistically significant difference was detected in the field of knowledge, increasing an average of two points on a scale from 0 to 5 in these aspects: how to make appropriate questions; connections between GBV and pregnancy; why do not they leave their partners; risk determination and phases of GBV. There was also a decrease in the idea that if the patient does not recognize gender violence, there is very little that can be done. No significant differences were detected in the detection and follow-up. Conclusion: Significant differences were found in the knowledge and attitude sections after performing the intervention to the professionals. The results support the implementation of continuous brief training on GBV in primary care.
   Background: Out-of-hours (OOH) primary care is a topic of great interest in European countries. Reasons for this are similar across borders: to guarantee continuity of care with decreasing numbers of health care workers and to guard equity in OOHcare for all patients. In OOHcare research, valid and accessible research data are needed to fill the knowledge gap. iCAREdata aims to offer valid and immediately available information from OOHcare. Research question: How feasible is it to collect, store and link data of different OOH services in Belgium and to improve data quality registration? How useful are aggregated data to inform stakeholders, to evaluate (the quality of) services in OOH care and the effects of interventions? Methods: As a first achievement, data flows, encryption and encoding were carefully designed and implemented. Solid cooperation with the federal eHealth web services as a trusted third party was crucial. Ethical approval and approval by the data protection authority was obtained. Clear agreements were established concerning access control. A strict code of conduct was agreed upon. A steering committee was established to guard the procedures. Results: First data were collected in 2015. iCAREdata now receives +/- 3000 unique patient contacts per weekend, spread over 14 general practice cooperatives, and covering about a quarter of the Flemish population. Aggregated data, directly processed, are provided weekly on . This portal site offers an overview of, among others, the latest diagnostics, drug prescriptions and workload. iCAREdata project also collects data from emergency departments in hospitals and community pharmacists and link them to evaluate further OOH primary care. Conclusion: Developing a research database on OOHcare is feasible. The iCAREdata project succeeds in an automated output every week, offering insights on the evolution of morbidity, services and effects of interventions. Careful validation and interpretation of the data is a crucial ongoing challenge.
   Background: More than half of decompensations of heart failure are attended in primary care setting. No score that helps to ascertain the short-term prognosis in these patients. Research question: To develop and validate a short-term score (30 days) to predict hospitalizations or death in patients attended in primary care as a consequence of decompensation of heart failure, based on variables easily measurable in primary care setting Methods: Prospective multinational cohort study including patients treated because of a heart failure decompensation in primary care setting. There were a derivation (Spain) and a validation cohort (nine European countries). Results: The derivation cohort included 561 patients, women were 56%, mean age was 82.2 (SD 8.03) years and 31.5% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. In the validation cohort, 238 patients were included, women were 54%, mean age was 79.0 (10.4) years and 26.9% of patients were hospitalized or died in the first month. According to the multivariate models, sex, age, hospital admission due to heart failure the previous year, and a heart rate greater than 100 beats/minute, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, NYHA functional stage III or IV, saturation of oxygen lower than 90% or an increase in the dyspnoea at the consultation with the General practitioner were included in the HEFESTOS-SCORE. The multivariate model including these variables showed a good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.77-0.85). In the validation cohort, the model presented an adequate external validation with good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow p=.35) and discrimination (AUC 0.74, 95% CI 0.67-0.82). Conclusion: The HEFESTOS-SCORE, based on clinical and demographical variables easily measurable in primary care is a useful tool to stratify the short-term hospitalization and mortality in patients attended because of a heart failure decompensation.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To determine facilitators and barriers that explain the variation in implementation of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: A hybrid type I clinical trial: qualitative data to evaluate the implementation outcomes. Three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands, Tarragona-Reus district (Catalonia) and Arnau de Vilanova lliria district (Valencia). Forty stakeholders (GPs) participated in five focus groups; they were selected based on their effectiveness of the intervention results: high (three groups) or low (two groups) and individual interviews to two GP of low efficiency. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) was used to guide collection and analysis of qualitative data. Two researchers evaluated the qualitative data of the focus groups by the Codebook and Rating Rules of CFIR, independently. Results: Of the 31 CFIR constructs assessed, three constructs strongly distinguished between GPs with low versus high success of the intervention (intervention complexity, individual state of change, key stakeholders engaging), seven additional constructs weakly distinguished (adaptability, external policy and incentives, implementation climate, compatibility, relative priority, self-efficacy, formally appointed internal implementation leaders), 10 had insufficient data to assess and 11 were non-related to the success of the intervention. Conclusion: We identified the constructs that explain the variation in the effectiveness of the intervention; this information is relevant to redesign successful implementation strategies focused on these constructs to implement the BENZORED intervention in health services.
   Background: Despite recommendations against long-term benzodiazepine (BZD) use, they are often prescribed during months or years in primary care. Research question: To evaluate the effectiveness of a primary care educational and feedback intervention targeted to general practitioners (GPs) to reduce BZDs prescriptions. Methods: Design: A two-arm parallel cluster randomized clinical trial. Settings: Primary Healthcare centres from three health districts of Spain: Balearic Islands (IbSalut), Catalonia (Institut Catala de la Salut; Tarragona-Reus district) and Community of Valencia (Conselleria de Salut Universal; Arnau de Vilanova lliria district). Participants: All GPs from the health districts included were invited to participate. Ninety percent of the GPs accepted to participate. Intervention: GPs received an educational two hours workshop training about the rationale for prescribing BZDs and deprescribing strategies for long-term BZD users, audit and monthly feedback about their prescription and access to a support web page with information to help them and leaflets to give to the patients. Control group: GPs did not receive any component of the intervention. Outcomes: Defined daily dose (DDD)/1000 inhabitants/year (DHD) of BZDs prescribed by GP at 12 months. Proportion of long-term BZD users (>6 months) and in patients aged 65 or more at 12 months. Statistical analysis: Generalized mixed linear random effect models to account for clustering at the level of healthcare centre and all analyses were based on an intention to treat principle. Results: We included 749 GPs and 49 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up. Adjusted difference between groups in DHD at 12 months was -3.26 (-4.87;-1.65), p<.001. The differences in the proportion of long-term BZD users was -0.39 (-0.58;-0.19), p<.001 and in patients older than 65 was -0.87 (-1.35;-0.26), p=.004. Conclusion: An educational and feedback intervention targeted to GPs is effective to reduce BZD prescription in primary care.
   Background: Patients who might also go to the general practitioner (GP) frequently consult emergency departments (ED). This leads to decreased efficiency, high workload at the ED and additional costs for both government and patient. Research question: The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who enter the ED and are handled by the GP after triage. Secondary outcomes: Referral rate to the ED by the GP, proportion of patients not following the triage advice, compliance of the nurse to the triage-instructions and health insurance expenditures. Furthermore, facilitators and barriers will be studied and an incident analysis will be performed. Methods: This is a randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters. Patients presenting at the ED during OOH are triaged and allocated to either ED or GP by a trained nurse using an extension to the Manchester Triage System (MTS). During control clusters, all patients remain at the ED. Data are collected using a database for OOH care (iCAREdata). Results: So far, 296 out of 2733 (11%) patients were allocated to the GP. Two-thirds (194) of these patients did go to the GP leading to a primary outcome of 7% for 14 intervention weekends. Only eight patients were referred back to the ED. Compliance of the nurse to the extended MTS was 93%, in 6% of the cases the nurse chose ED instead of GPC and in less than one percent GPC instead of ED. The nurses chose higher urgency categories and more discriminators, leading to the GP during intervention clusters. Using an automated system, these results are updated weekly, on our poster, we will show more results that are complete. Conclusion: These first results reveal a low efficiency but a high safety of the intervention. More prolonged data collection combined with a process analysis and cost efficiency study is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
   Background: Low back pain is a multifactorial condition with individual and societal impact. Psychosocial factors play a larger prognostic roll. Therefore, earlier multidisciplinary treatment strategy (physical, psychological and social/occupational) could be applied to search improvement in fear-avoidance beliefs with positive effect in the evolution of low back pain. Research question: Evaluate the effectiveness of a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (physiotherapy, cognitive-behavioural and pharmacological therapy) through the changes in fear-avoidance beliefs (FABs), in working population with sub-acute non-specific LBP, compared to usual clinical care at 3 and 12 months. Methods: A cluster randomised clinical trial, conducted in 39 Primary Health Care Centres (PHCC) in Barcelona. Participants between 18 and 65 years old (n = 369; control group =188, PHCC 26 and intervention group =181, PHCC 13). Control group received usual care, according to guidelines. Intervention group received usual care plus a biopsychosocial multidisciplinary intervention (sessions 10 hours/total). The main outcome was the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs questionnaire (FABQ). Other outcomes: Evolution to chronicity. Assessment at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and analyst blinded. Multiple imputations. Results: Of the 369 enrolled patients with LBP, 421 (84.0%) provided data at the three months of follow-up, and 387 (77.2%) at 12 months. Mean age of study subjects at baseline was 45.1 (SD: 10.4) years-old and 61.2% were women. At baseline, there were no differences. Both groups showed a decrease in FABQ (FAB physical and FAB-work) at three months and twelve months, with a significant difference at long-term. At FAB-physical performance, there was no significant difference over the follow-up time and at FAB-Work, a substantial difference at 12 months between groups. Conclusion: A multidisciplinary biopsychosocial intervention showed a positive effect in FABs by improving fear behaviours and avoidance at work.
   Community participation in primary healthcare is enshrined in international policies since the 1970s and has been re-emphasised since then, most recently in the 2018 WHO Astana Declaration (). The concept comes from a social justice perspective. It emphasises that the participation of communities who experience poverty and social exclusion is essential to the development of primary health care services shaping these services and making them relevant to those with the greatest need. This is important if we are to address the well-documented Inverse Care Law. There is, however, a translational gap between policy and practice. The stability of policies for community participation in primary healthcare is patchy. The implementation of policies into conventional ways of working is patchy. Where implementation has occurred, the coverage of community participation initiatives can be patchy - not all community members are involved. The literature shows a pattern of exclusion whereby so-called 'hard to reach' groups are not adequately involved in primary healthcare decision-making. This is the case for refugees and migrants who arrive to settle and integrate into host countries in Europe. The recent WHO Strategy and Action Plan for Refugee and Migrant Health (2016; ) is a call for action to disrupt this pattern of exclusion and improve the health of refugees and migrants. Drawing on the rich tradition of participatory health research is a valuable way forward because it provides important concepts, tools and techniques for research that is more inclusive and primary care practice. This presentation will describe innovative examples of success in family practice settings from around Europe. These have brought together refugees and migrants with primary care stakeholders and enabled them to work together to introduce and sustain changes in clinical practice. This evidence can be used to guide and strengthen community participation in primary healthcare, for all.
   Background: Community participation is essential for effective implementation of research programmes in primary healthcare (PHC) but also appropriate interpretation of results and optimal delivery of subsequent care. Stakeholder engagement undertaken under defined and evaluated frameworks may be key for the establishment of concrete collaboration and communication between communities and other parties involved in research. This abstract aims to report on community and stakeholder engagement methodologies, plans and activities of European research projects conducted in Crete, Greece. Research question: Could a consensus be reached regarding the methods and tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement in community-oriented PHC research? Methods: Examined programmes included RESTORE (FP7), FRESH AIR (Horizon2020) and VIGOUR (Health Programme). Identified methodologies included Normalisation Process Theory, Participatory Learning and Action, Five Steps of Stakeholders' Engagement, establishment of Stakeholder Engagement Groups under the 9 C's model (commissioners, customers, collaborators, contributors, channels, commentators, consumers, champions, competitors) and Structured Democratic Dialogue. These were implemented to a range of stakeholders, including community members, patients, migrants, Roma populations, healthcare professionals and policy-makers. Qualitative research (focus groups, individual interviews) and Thematic Content Analysis were used for design and analysis of engagement activities. Results: In RESTORE, migrants and other stakeholders selected guidelines and training supporting cross-cultural communication in PHC consultations, based on their own needs and expectations. Community members, healthcare professionals and healthcare authorities were actively involved in FRESH AIR by identifying local priorities and contextual factors for designing project interventions, providing access to communities and supporting dissemination of project achievements. In VIGOUR, multidisciplinary stakeholders were brought together and formulated a joint ambition statement for the future of integrated care in Crete. Conclusion: Various stakeholder engagement methods with documented effects are currently available. Their systematic identification, appraisal, synthesis and consolidation may serve with enhancing community participation in PHC, sustaining research results and translating findings into appropriate actions.
   Background: Screening for prostate cancer remains controversial, implying a trade-off between benefits and harms, and a shared decision-making process has been advocated. Decision aids are evidence-based tools that improve decision quality. For limited-resource countries, translating and making cultural adaptations to high-quality decision aids is a reasonable alternative to developing new ones. Research question: We aimed to translate and culturally adapt an English language patient decision aid addressing prostate cancer screening, so that Portuguese men can use it. Methods: We followed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's (ECDC) five-step, stakeholder-based approach to adapting health communication materials: (1) selection of materials and process coordinators; (2) early review; (3) translation and back translation; (4) comprehension testing with cognitive semi-structured interviews; (5) proofreading. Cognitive interviews were conducted with 15 men, ages 55-69, from the Oporto district local community to refine the decision aid after its translation. Content analysis was performed using Ligre (TM) software. Results: Five main themes are presented: informational content, information comprehension, socio-cultural appropriateness, feelings and primary message, and personal perspective concerning prostate cancer screening. For each theme, illustrative quotes extracted from men's interviews are presented. Most men found the translated version of the decision aid to be clear, comprehensive and appropriate for its target population, albeit some suggested that medical terms could be a barrier. The data collected from men's interviews allowed the researchers to clarify concepts and expand existing content. Conclusion: The final version of the decision aid can be used in the real world clinical setting and our ECDC based approach can be replicated by other workgroups to translate and culturally adapt decision aids.
   What are we talking about when we talk about value? In 2006, Michael Porter and Elizabeth O. Teisberg published; Redefining Health Care, Creating Value-Based Competition on Results, Harvard Business School Press. Affirming that payers and providers, including doctors and nurses, are very concerned in demonstrating that they work a lot, and very little, or nothing, in assessing what their work contributes to the health of people and communities. Michael Porter is famous in the business world for his work on competitiveness based on the value of products and services. He has introduced this concept in the provision of health services, all summarised in a phrase: Health systems should seek to obtain the maximum possible value for the health of people for every dollar they spend. However, to define the value in healthcare, the patient must be introduced into the equation, so, in Porterian terms, the value is the perception that people have about clinical effectiveness and the costs of therapeutic processes. Clinical effectiveness is measurable from epidemiology (to be readmitted to a hospital fewer times or living longer); value, on the other hand, is reflected by people's experience. We need to ask questions such as do patients with advanced diseases want to live longer, or they want to enjoy the highest quality of life possible. Depending on the response, we can develop different delivery models. What is value-based healthcare? According to NEJM Catalyst, Value-based healthcare is a healthcare delivery model in which providers, including hospitals and physicians, are paid based on patient health outcomes (). Under value-based care agreements, providers are rewarded for helping patients improve their health, reduce the effects and incidence of chronic disease, and live healthier lives in an evidence-based way. How to achieve a Value-Based Healthcare Model The following six drivers are the key to make a primary health care system a value-based healthcare model: 1. Prioritising patient-centred care. 2. From clinical pathways to care delivery value chains. 3. Promoting the right care and reducing medical overuse. 4. Turning a fragmented model into another integrated model. 5. Creating the enabling environment for healthcare transformation. 6. Fostering community health. How to develop a Value-Based Community Health Michael Marmot states that if the determinants of health are mostly social, solutions must also be social, so to improve the quality of community life, political systems require economic, housing, education, security and infrastructure programs (Am J Public Health. 2014;104:S517-S519). Nevertheless, the healthcare system must know how to adjust resources according to the social circumstances of each community and to understand how to provide a health-oriented vision of all the social programs. On the other hand, community health is an intervention model that aims to improve the health of a defined community that should operate from primary care services to adjust their actions to the social reality of each territory.
   Background: Geriatric care needs to be increased with growing elderly populations. The Borgholm jurisdiction in the Baltic Island of oland (Kalmar region) has an older than average senior population and had difficulties recruiting primary care physicians (PCPs) resulting in high elderly hospital care consumption. Research question: Could a new model of geriatric care be able to decrease the hospital care needs of Borgholm as compared to the rest of Kalmar region? Methods: A new model of care was developed in Borgholm 2016-2017 where the PCP list was limited to 1000 patients, daily slots for PCP home care visits could be booked by community nurses or ambulance nurses and PCPs had daily anticipatory care planning contacts with Kalmar hospital staff. Results: Between 2014 and 2018, Borgholm home care patients >75 years old increased by 70% vs. a 2% decrease for the rest of Kalmar region. Similarly, Kalmar emergency department visits decreased by 19% in Borgholm vs. 9% increase for the rest of Kalmar. Also, Kalmar hospital care episodes decreased 7% in Borgholm vs. 13% increase for the rest of Kalmar; Kalmar hospital outpatient visits decreased 8% in Borgholm vs. 21% increase for the rest of Kalmar; total care consumption for >75 years old decreased 4% in Borgholm vs. a 10% increase for the rest of Kalmar region. Conclusion: A new geriatric care model consisting of a comprehensive collaboration between strengthened primary care and community care, hospital care and ambulance care was associated with a reduction in total care consumption for senior citizens in a rural Swedish jurisdiction.
   Background: Primary health care, the general practitioner, plays a critical role for early identification and care of patients with dementia. Early diagnosis of dementia allows starting therapy and improving the quality of life of the patients. Research question: To estimate the prevalence and care of patients with dementia in North Macedonia. Methods: Forty-six general practitioners (GPs) surgeries from 20 cities in Macedonia took part in the project. All individuals age over 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia were identified from GP electronic disease registers. Results: Based on the diagnosis, 450 (3.5%) patients were identified from a total population of 12,926 over 65s. The most common dementia was Alzheimer's dementia 294 (65.3%) followed by vascular dementia 27.11%. The average age of respondents in the study was 77.5 +/- 8.2 years, with 50% patients under the age of 79 years, 65.6% were female and 68.4% were with elementary school. In the entire sample, most of the patients diagnosed with dementia 195 (43.3%) said they lived with another family member. The most common risk factor was hypertension (85.1%), followed by stroke/ transitory ischemic attacks (29.3%) and equal percentage, i.e. 26.4% of patients had high levels of cholesterol and diabetes. To 242 (53.8%) acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were prescribed (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine), 77 (17.1%) memantine, while 247 (54.9%) another OTC therapy. 227 (50.4%) reported that they did not receive treatment. An additional analysis of the reasons for not receiving treatment was made on this sample of patients who did not receive treatment. It was found that in the majority of these patients (more than 50%) the reason for not receiving therapy was that it was not prescribed, in 142 (62.6%). Conclusion: This is the first national representative study of dementia prevalence in North Macedonia. Those data can provide information for healthcare needs people with dementia.
   Background: Emotional experience for medical students during clinical internships is often ignored. Yet, its influence on professional skills is certain. Research question: 'What is the emotional experience of second and third-year medical students during their first clinical internship? How do they perceive the management of their experience by their supervisors?' Methods: A qualitative study was conducted with 12 students in their second or third year of medical training at the University of Lille, in France, between 2016 and 2019. Interviews were carried out comprehensively for a total of 17 hours. Following a grounded theory approach, the analysis terminated when data were sufficient to offer a conclusive model. Results: Emotional experience during clinical internship was rich and intense. It was most often ignored and was not taken into account in the development of professional skills. The organized management was deficient. Informal training existed: when a wilful student met a dedicated teacher. Students would have welcomed a possibility to experience intense emotions in a protective environment, and only then in an empowering environment. They expressed the same desire about early exchanges on the experiences of the internship. A modelling of the informants' emotional experiences was realized in the form of three diagrams. Conclusion: Students ask to be challenged to face patients, and then to be listened to about it. Possible interventions are trauma prevention and detection of malaise in the workplace; teaching of humanist values; providing experience and reflexivity through new pedagogical means (such as cinema, theatre, literature, writing), or relational means (such as exchange groups, companionship, solidarity commitment, immersive internships and tutoring); and training supervisors.
   Background: Oral anticoagulants (OAC) reduce the risk for stroke and death from all causes in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Research question: To explore adherence rates to OAC among patients with NVAF and to compare head-to-head adherence rate of different medications in long-term chronic use. Methods: We conducted a population-based cohort study Clalit Health Services, Israel. All patients, 30 years and over, with a diagnosis of NVAF before 2016 and were treated with OAC were included. We included patients that filled at least one prescription per year in the three consecutive years 2016-2018. We analysed all prescriptions that were filled for the medications from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017. We considered purchasing of at least nine monthly prescriptions during 2017 as 'good medication adherence.' Results: Twenty-six thousand and twenty-nine patients with NVAF who were treated with OAC were identified. Ten thousand and two hundred and eighty-four (39.5%) were treated with apixaban, 6321 (24.3%) were treated with warfarin, 6290 (24.1%) were treated with rivaroxaban 3134 (12.0%) were treated with dabigatran. Rates of good medication adherence were 88.9% for rivaroxaban, 84.9% for apixaban, 83.6% for dabigatran and 55.8% for warfarin (p<.0001). Good adherence with OAC was associated with lower LDL cholesterol and glucose levels. Advanced age was associated with higher adherence rates (p<.001). SES was not associated with medication adherence. Conclusion: Adherence rates to DOAC among patients with NVAF are high and are higher than the adherence rate to warfarin. It should be taken into consideration when choosing OAC treatment for NVAF.
   Background: In France, cervical cancer screening by pap-smears should be conducted triennially. Screening statistics are based on the number of cytology examinations of smears reimbursed by the Health Insurance appearing in the claim databases. The percentage of screened women is lower based on these data than on declarative surveys. If surveys are overestimating the number of screened women, it is likely that claim databases underestimate it. Research question: The primary objective was to determine the underestimation of screened women in claim databases. The secondary purpose was to estimate the proportion of female patients not reachable by their GP for a cervical cancer screening in an organized screening trial. Methods: The population was the 6327 female patients aged 30-65 years of the 24 GP investigators of the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial. We compared the lists of their female patients that had no cytology of Pap test reimbursed during the three prior years, extracted from the Health Insurance claim databases in 2015 and 2018. We selected the patients appearing on both lists meaning they had not responded to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the trial. We searched in the GPs' records valid reasons not to be screened (hysterectomy, history of cervical lesion, pregnancy, other conditions making screening irrelevant) or evidence of screening. Results: The total number of 'unscreened' women in 2018 was 2731, 1737 patients appeared on both lists, 1522 could be included for analysing, 65 had been screened, 95 had hysterectomy, three had a history of cervical lesion, nine were pregnant and 10 had other conditions making screening irrelevant, 166 patients were lost to view. Conclusion: Based on GPs' records, health insurance claim databases underestimate the number of screened women by 7.6%. The percentage of patients not responding to the invitation of their GP to be screened in the PaCUDAHL-Ge trial is 24.18%.
   Background: Over the past decade, the amount of digital data created by humans with or without connected tools has grown exponentially. The field of primary care (PC) did not escape this digitization, nor the use of Big Data algorithms. To evaluate the results of Big Data research in PC it seemed useful to identify which algorithms are used. Research question: What are the algorithms used for Big Data research in PC research and how are they described? Methods: Systematic review of the literature according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guide. A search equation using the following MeSH terms 'big data, data mining, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks Natural Language Processing, general practice, electronic health records, health records' has been applied to the PUBMED database. After a selection of the titles and article summaries according to the inclusion criteria, the full versions of the eligible articles were read and analysed. Referenced articles of the sources articles were added to the analysis. The algorithms described in the articles were extracted and analysed. Results: In total, 778 articles were identified, 169 were eligible for full reading and 26 articles were finally selected. The algorithms listed in the articles are poorly described. The description is usually limited to a general explanation about how the algorithm works. Seven articles gave a partial description of the algorithm; a logic diagram was given in four articles and the codes in only two. Actually, only one article fully describes the algorithm with its mathematical description, its code and its logic diagram. Conclusion: Big Data algorithms in PC are not satisfactorily described. The lack of reproducibility is not compatible with a consistent scientific approach. Researchers should provide more information about the way they extract and analyse their data to give their readers more confidence in Big Data.
   Background: As a collaborative project of the Family Practice Depression and Multimorbidity group of European General Practice Research Network, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 (HSCL-25) scale was identified as valid, reproducible, effective and easy to use. Subsequently, it has been translated and adapted to 13 languages, including Castilian. Currently, the scale is being validated in different languages. Research question: What are the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of HSCL-25 (HSCL-25e) for depression detection in Primary Care? Methods: HSCL-25e was administered to outpatients recruited by their physicians in six health centres involved in Spanish EIRA3 study, a trial to promote healthy behaviours in people aged from 45 to 75. Patients complimented HSCL-25 themselves. Sample size was calculated with R package (pROC). Statistical analysis: responsiveness was analysed with missing data and detecting ceiling and floor effects for the items. Principal component analysis (PCA) was done to determine the dimensions of HSCL-25e. Item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha (global and dimensions coefficient) and squared multiple correlation were carried out to calculate internal consistency. Results: Seven hundred and sixty-nine patients out of 806 complimented HSCL-25e, 738 answered to all of the items. No patterns of missing answers were found. No ceiling effects, expected floor effect in item 18. Item 17 was the most consistent one and item 24 was the lower one. All items showed positive discrimination index for both cut-off points (1.55 and 1.75). PCA indicated two factors; 13 items corresponding to depression dimension and the other 12 items corresponding to anxiety subscale. Global Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 (0.88 calculated for depression dimension and 0.84 for anxiety dimension). Conclusion: The HSCL-25e has excellent psychometric properties when applied to Primary Care population. It has two dimensions as the original version, although the items included are not exactly the same. There are more item coincidences with the French version.
   Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the first mortality cause worldwide with 17.5 million death in 2012. Spices (Scaling-up Packages of Interventions for CVD prevention in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) gathered five countries around CVD primary prevention interventions, especially for populations with low access to prevention and health care system. In France, a rural area where people were more deprived and with a low settlement of general practitioners (GPs) fitted with the project. Research question: What are the barriers and the facilitators for cardiovascular primary prevention implementation from caregivers and patients' point of view of a deprived rural area? Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted until theoretical saturation of data. Purposive samplings of GPs, patients, patients' families, nurses and pharmacists were designed. Five interview guides explored cardiovascular prevention, cardiovascular health promotion in the setting, actors of CVD prevention, capacities for CVD prevention, patients' and healthcare professionals' representations, barriers and facilitators in implementing CVD prevention, possible solutions. Guides were adapted concurrently to the analysis. A blinded thematic analysis and a mind-mapping were achieved for each group. Results: Thirteen GPS, 11 pharmacists', 14 nurses, 12 patients' and 12 patients' family members' interviews were achieved. Professionals highlighted a disconnection between them and national prevention programs, lack of time, payment and training for CVD prevention. Countryside was either protective or aggressive regarding CVD risk balancing gardening and space against isolation and lack of structures. GPs had poor connections with the community. Patients described their recklessness and feeling of invulnerability until their CVD appeared. Families could be a barrier to CVD prevention and lifestyle change. Risky behaviours were handed down from one generation to another. Conclusion: Innovative interventions for Spices should focus on these community specificities and individual behavioural strategies in contrast with the six national plans addressing CVD in France. These plans solely concentrate on dissemination of prevention messages and knowledge, which is of little use according to this survey.

TI  - Snow is an important control of plant community functional composition in oroarctic tundra
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - The functional composition of plant communities is a critical modulator of climate change impacts on ecosystems, but it is not a simple function of regional climate. In the Arctic tundra, where climate change is proceeding the most rapidly, communities have not shifted their trait composition as predicted by spatial temperature-trait relationships. Important causal pathways are thus missing from models of trait composition change. Here, we study causes of plant community functional variation in an oroarctic tundra landscape in Kilpisjarvi, Finland. We consider the community-weighted means of plant vegetative height, as well as two traits related to the leaf economic spectrum. Specifically, we model their responses to locally measured summer air temperature, snow conditions, and soil resource levels. For each of the traits, we also quantify the importance of intraspecific trait variation (ITV) for between-community functional differences and trait-environment matching. Our study shows that in a tundra landscape (1) snow is the most influential abiotic variable affecting functional composition, (2) vegetation height is under weak local environmental control, whereas leaf economics is under strong local environmental control, (3) the relative magnitude of ITV differs between traits, and (4) ITV is not very consequential for community-level trait-environment relationships. Our analyses highlight the importance of winter conditions for community functional composition in seasonal areas. We show that winter climate change can either amplify or counter the effects summer warming, depending on the trait.

TI  - Are biological classifications of headwater streams concordant across multiple taxonomic groups?
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1. Studies assessing human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are typically based on a single taxonomic group, often macroinvertebrates or fish. Unfortunately, the degree to which such macroinvertebrate or fish-based surveys can be generalised across other taxonomic groups remains largely unknown. A prerequisite for useful generalisations is that different taxonomic groups exhibit concordant patterns of community structure across sites.
   2. We examined the concordance among fish, benthic macroinvertebrates and bryophytes in 32 streams in a boreal catchment in Finland. Our goal was to test how consistently different taxonomic groups classify stream sites; for example, can site groupings based on macroinvertebrates be used as a surrogate for bryophyte or fish assemblage classification?
   3. Our results show that community classifications in headwater streams are not concordant across taxonomic groups, at least not at the within-river system scale. The lack of concordance reflected the fact that all three groups responded to different environmental factors. Macroinvertebrate community structure was mainly correlated with stream size and pH, whereas bryophytes were related to water colour, nutrient content and in-stream habitat variability. Fish community structure was best described by stream depth, substrate size and water oxygen concentration.
   4. Our results suggest that great care should be taken when typologies based on benthic macroinvertebrates, or any other taxonomic group, are extrapolated to other groups in creating typologies of lotic environments.

TI  - Deep-sea crustacean trawling fisheries in Portugal: quantification of effort and assessment of landings per unit effort using a Vessel Monitoring System (VMS)
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Mapping and quantifying bottom trawling fishing pressure on the seafloor is pivotal to understand its effects on deep-sea benthic habitats. Using data from the Vessel Monitoring System of crustacean trawlers along the Portuguese margin, we have identified the most exploited areas and characterized the most targeted habitats and water depths. We estimated a total trawling effort of 69596, 66766, and 63427 h y(-1) for the years 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively which, considering the total landings estimated for this gear, yield values of 20.76, 21.06, and 19.11 kg of landed fish per trawled hour. The main trawling pressure is exerted in the South and Southwest Portuguese margins, on muddy and muddy-sand bottoms between 200 and 700 m water depths, while in the North and Central-West coasts a minor effort, at shallower waters and across a wider range of habitats, is also applied. The most landed species are crustaceans such as rose shrimp and Norway lobster, although this varies importantly between the different regions of Portugal, being fish and cephalopods the main captures in the Northern ports. We discuss the consequences of trawling for the impacted communities as well as the characteristics of the commercialization of these captures in Portugal.

TI  - Unraveling the role of biofuels in road transport under rapid electrification
T2  - BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR
AB  - Biofuels have been the predominant option for climate change mitigation in road transport for decades, but the recent expansion of electric vehicles may bring into question their key role. In this work we model the energy use and life-cycle emissions of road transport activities until 2050 in Norway, a country with a rapid growth in vehicle fleet electrification, to investigate the role that biofuels can play in climate change mitigation, and assess the implications for air pollution and human health. The mitigation benefits from biofuels peak around 2030 at 3.1 +/- 0.45 MtCO(2)eq. year(-1), approximately 30% of today's road transport emissions. The largest specific emission savings are achieved from biofuels in trucks and vans, for which the penetration of electric vehicles is slower. These results are consistent under different time horizons and climate metrics. The average impacts on human health are also decreased, but the uncertainty ranges for some biofuels options overlap with those of fossil fuels. Complementary and integrated strategies combining high electrification rates of the vehicle fleet with targeted applications of biofuels can increase the mitigation of road transport emissions.

TI  - The habitus, the rule and the moral landscape
T2  - CULTURAL GEOGRAPHIES
AB  - Human interaction with the environment, particularly when the latter is conceived as nature, is often measured against moral standards for 'appropriate behaviour'. Different, and frequently conflicting, ways of being-in-the-world are the theme of moral geographies. This paper seeks to elucidate the relation between morality, landscape and environmental practice by focusing upon a particular Scandinavian case. The Jaeren district on the south-western coast of Norway has become one of the most intensively farmed areas in the country, undergoing radical changes causing contemporary farmers to become subject to moral condemnation from a wide range of bodies and people. The paper argues that in order to understand how the culture - nature relationship reflects and produces moral judgements there is a need to investigate how the production and meaning of a lived landscape becomes a moral landscape. Two questions are addressed: What is the 'nature' of the moral geographies in the area? How do differing 'moral geographies' affect the land and its perception as landscape? Understanding the moral landscape of the Jaeren district allows us to identify the dialectics and contradictions inherent in the production of the landscape, and the ways rules and regulations for appropriate behaviour are the result of these contradictions. By adopting Bourdieu's notion of habitus, we are able to capture how such rules work and how they shape the landscape.

TI  - UNIVERSAL DESIGN: A GUIDE FOR EQUALITY AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION
T2  - TIMARIT UM UPPELDI OG MENNTUN-ICELANDIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION
AB  - Universal design (UD) is a political strategy and a process based on the values of equity and equal opportunities for participation in society. Emphasis is placed on the design of products, programmes, services, and environment to meet human diversity; that is, people with different qualities, abilities, and impairments. This paper's focus is primarily on UD in relation to disability, but the concept has a much broader implication, for example for elderly people with typical mobility and sensory restrictions, parents with strollers, people who have reading difficulties, do not speak the native language or are simply in a hurry. Initially, the emphasis of UD was first and foremost directed at the physical context, especially the built environment. Increasingly, attention has been focused on aspects within the social and cultural environment, such as attitudes, services, policies, and procedures. The effects of barriers in the physical and social environment are often intertwined, as disabled people typically feel unwelcome if the built environment is inaccessible or if it requires an enormous amount of effort, time, or energy to move around and partake in activities that people find important. In the last few years, the literature has placed greater emphasis on the usability of the environment, products and, services; that is, whether or not the environment can be used effectively, efficiently, and in a satisfactory manner. This focus on usability demonstrates the person-environment interaction and the importance that social and psychological aspects have on the experience of disability within a specific context. Still, a higher priority of the usability aspect is needed in the implementation of UD since the experience of accessibility is always personal.
   Recently, a human rights perspective has characterized the discussion of the concept of UD, and with the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), the Icelandic government has indeed affirmed its support for a universal design policy and implementation in Icelandic society. There is considerable agreement between the capabilities approach and the human rights and relations perspectives of disability that characterize CRPD, focusing on the material, economic, social, and institutional barriers that create and recreate disabilities and make it difficult for disabled people to lead good lives. Most of such barriers are man-made and can be removed to better enable people to act in line with their wishes and needs. These and related theoretical aspects are addressed in this paper as they relate to UD. In this regard, we highlight the writings of prominent scholars in the field, such as the Norwegian scholar Inger-Marie Lid. We also stress the importance of UD as a policy and implementation. Although standards and guidelines are important in implementing UD, they are not sufficient as such. Increased knowledge, a change of mindset and a holistic approach is needed, as it is crucial to address attitudes and procedures and to unravel how to establish effective working methods for the implementation of UD. Users' involvement in discussions and decision-making in the UD process is of utmost importance, such as regarding what to do, when, and how, as well as in evaluating the outcomes.
   In this paper, we also draw upon and discuss examples from our own research findings in connection with UD. Those examples are based on: a) the experiences of disabled children and youth, b) the experiences of people with mobility impairments, and c) analysis of policy documents affecting public transportation and buildings in Iceland. The examples show multiple hindrances disabled people encounter in their daily lives, and highlight the inequalities they face when it is impossible for them to partake in society like other people. Many of those issues could be rectified with increased awareness and implementation of UD values.

TI  - Capturing urban diversity through languages: Long-term changes in multilingual residential neighbourhoods in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area
T2  - POPULATION SPACE AND PLACE
AB  - Contemporary cities are becoming highly diverse on an unprecedented scale due to accelerating urbanization, international migration and mobility. Research on urban diversity commonly focuses on ethnicities and countries of origin, disregarding equally informative characteristics, such as information on languages and language use, which might reveal new aspects of urban diversity. In this paper, we analyse the development of urban diversity in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area between 1987 and 2019 using language information retrieved from the Finnish population register and examine the extent to which linguistic diversity captures urban diversity. We focus on two population groups, speakers of Estonian and Somali, to analyse how linguistic diversity and socioeconomic characteristics have changed in their residential neighbourhoods and to estimate to what extent these population groups have integrated into the host society. We measured linguistic diversity using Shannon entropy, performed spatial clustering analyses and used Markov chains to examine the likelihood of changes in linguistic diversity. We found clear spatial patterns and high spatial variability in the development of linguistic diversity, which shows that geographical space is a central component in linguistic diversity. Our results suggest that linguistic diversity is more likely to change in more segregated neighbourhoods and show that linguistic diversity is a suitable proxy for urban diversity. Understanding urban diversity is a key element for supporting social sustainability and cohesion in urban areas now and in the future. Mapping the spatio-temporal and intersectional patterns of urban diversity is crucial for managing its negative effects, but more importantly, in leveraging its positive effects.

TI  - Hydrologic connectivity determines dissolved organic matter biogeochemistry in northern high-latitude lakes
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Northern high-latitude lakes are undergoing climate-induced changes including shifts in their hydrologic connectivity with terrestrial ecosystems. How this will impact dissolved organic matter (DOM) biogeochemistry remains uncertain. We examined the drivers of DOM composition for lakes in the Yukon Flats Basin in Alaska, an arid region of low relief that is characteristic of over one-quarter of circumpolar lake area. Utilizing the vascular plant biomarker lignin, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, we interpreted DOM compositional changes using lake-water stable isotope (delta O-18-H2O) composition as a proxy for lake hydrologic connectivity with the landscape. We observed a relative decrease in CDOM in more hydrologically isolated lakes (enriched delta O-18-H2O) without a corresponding decrease in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. Although DOC and CDOM were weakly correlated, a significant positive relationship between lignin and CDOM (r(2)= 0.67) demonstrates that optical parameters are useful for estimating lignin concentration and thus vascular plant contribution to lake DOM. Indicators of allochthonous DOM, including lignin carbon normalized yields, CDOM aromaticity proxies, and relative abundances of polyphenolic and condensed aromatic compound classes, were negatively correlated with delta O-18-H2O (r(2) > 0.45), suggesting there is little allochthonous DOM supplied to many of these hydrologically isolated lakes. We conclude that decreased lake hydrologic connectivity, driven by ongoing climate change (i.e., decreased precipitation, warming temperatures), will reduce allochthonous DOM contributions and shift lakes toward lower CDOM systems with ecosystem-scale ramifications for heat transfer, photochemical reactions, productivity, and ultimately their biogeochemical function.

TI  - Downed deadwood habitat heterogeneity drives trophic niche diversity of soil-dwelling animals
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is one of the important drivers of biodiversity, but the underlying mechanisms are still vague. Increasing habitat heterogeneity often coincides with greater habitat space and/or greater food availability for organisms, but it is unclear whether and how these components are related to habitat selection. Downed dead wood (i.e., dead wood laying on the ground) is an important but understudied component of dead plant matter that creates spatial habitat heterogeneity for soil fauna on the ground. To unravel the role of dead wood for providing niche dimensionality for soil fauna via variance in resource use, we sampled Collembola communities from moss growing on bark and from bark on the logs of two tree species (pedunculate oak and Norway spruce) and from soil next to the logs. We assessed habitat selection of Collembola species combining abundance data with trophic position data using stable isotope ratios (i.e., delta C-13 and delta N-15). Based on the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, Collembola community composition differed significantly among the three habitats (i.e., moss, bark and soil). Collembola community-weighted mean delta C-13 and delta N-15 values also differed among the three habitats (average delta C-13 values of moss: -25.94 parts per thousand, bark: -25.30 parts per thousand, soil: -25.60 parts per thousand; average delta N-15 values of moss: -4.80 parts per thousand, bark: -3.83 parts per thousand, soil: -5.11 parts per thousand), partly reflecting isotopic differences of the habitats themselves (delta C-13 of moss: -29.83 parts per thousand, bark: -28.26 parts per thousand, soil: -29.04 parts per thousand; delta N-15 of moss: -7.59 parts per thousand, bark: -4.18 parts per thousand, soil: -7.84 parts per thousand). These findings indicate that Collembola depend on food sources derived from the habitats they inhabit at least at the community level. Collembola community-weighted variance of both delta C-13 and delta N-15 values ranked as bark > moss > soil. Species-level data suggested that the bark community included both bark-specific food specialists as well as species which likely use bark only as a temporary habitat based on their morphological traits supporting high mobility. These findings together indicate that the trophic niche variation of the Collembola community is larger in bark than in soil. Our results stress the importance of downed dead wood as a source of habitat heterogeneity, which in turn promotes soil animal diversity, likely via heterogeneity in food sources. Furthermore, the presence of dead wood on the ground could have consequences for organic matter processing by the soil animal community through sustaining a larger trophic niche variation even at a small spatial scale.

TI  - Cormorants have negligible seascape-scale impacts on benthic vegetation communities
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
AB  - Great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis populations in the Baltic Sea have rapidly expanded since the 1990s, raising concerns about their ecosystem impacts. Nutrient runoff from colonies, as well as cormorant predation on fish, can affect surrounding producer communities. Past studies have found cormorant impacts on producers in the immediate vicinity of colonies, but the importance of cormorants over a larger spatial scale is unknown, especially compared to other environmental variables. We used an extensive underwater vegetation inventory dataset (similar to 18 000 data points along the Finnish coast) to determine the effects of cormorant colonies on macroalgae and plants. We compared community structure and species abundance/occurrence in near-colony (< 5 km from a colony) and control (> 10 km from a colony) points, and determined the importance of cormorant influence (using an index incorporating colony size and distance from the colony) in near-colony sites. We found no significant differences in community structure between near-colony and control points in most habitats, and adding the cormorant index only infinitesimally improved statistical models after incorporating other environmental factors. However, the abundance of several species did differ; in particular, the foundation species bladder-wrack Fucus vesiculosus and eelgrass Zostera marina were either less likely to occur in near-colony points or were negatively correlated with cormorant index, possibly due to the effects of nutrient enrichment from colonies. Our findings confirm that cormorants can have effects on some producer species, but highlight that these effects are negligible when taking into account the scale and magnitude of other bottom-up and top-down processes occurring in the Baltic Sea.

TI  - Models for prediction of soil precompression stress from readily available soil properties
T2  - GEODERMA
AB  - Compaction of the subsoil is an almost irreversible damage to the soil resource. Modern machinery exerts high mechanical stresses to the subsoil, and a range of studies report significant effects on soil functions. There is an urgent need for quantitative knowledge of soil strength in order to evaluate sustainability of current field traffic. The aim of this study was to identify the most important drivers of soil precompression stress, sigma(pc), and to develop pedotransfer functions for prediction of sigma(pc). We revisited previously published data on sigma(pc) for a silty clay loam soil at a range of soil matric potentials. sigma(pc) was estimated from the original stress-strain curves by a novel, numerical method for estimating the stress at maximum curvature, assumingly partitioning the curve into elastic and plastic sections. Multiple regression was used to identify the drivers best describing the variation in sigma(pc) data. For the plough layer, sigma(pc) increased with bulk density (BD), which explained 77% of the variation. For the subsoil layer just beneath the ploughing depth, the model best describing sigma(pc) data included the drivers BD and pF, with pF defined as the log to the negative matric potential. The model was strongly significant with R-2 = 0.90. The same trend was found for three subsoil layers from 0.35-0.95 m depth, but the model accounted for only 16% of the variation in sigma(pc). A model involving samples from all soil layers and including BD, pF and soil clay content accounted for 38% of the variation. This model predicted sigma(pc) to be constant at pF similar to 2 across soil clay contents for a given soil BD. For pF < 2, sigma(pc) was predicted to be higher for sandy soils than for soils rich in clay. In contrast, sigma(pc) increased with clay content for dryer conditions (pF > 2). Model predictions correlated well with measured data in two independent data sets from the literature. However, the predictions were approximately double those of one of the data sets. This may relate to the longer stress application used in laboratory compression tests for these data compared to the other calibration data set and to the procedure used in this study. We encourage further studies of the effect of stress application procedures in compression tests. The prediction equations established in this investigation have to be verified based on measurements of sigma(pc) for a range of soil types, soil horizons and soil moisture conditions.

TI  - Oslo Ministerial Declaration - global health: a pressing foreign policy issue of our time
T2  - LANCET
AB  - Under their initiative on Global Health and Foreign Policy, launched in September, 2006, in New York, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Brazil, France, Indonesia, Norway, Senegal, South Africa, and Thailand issued the following statement in Oslo on March 20, 2007-In today's era of globalisation and interdependence there is an urgent need to broaden the scope of foreign policy. Together, we face a number of pressing challenges that require concerted responses and collaborative efforts. We must encourage new ideas, seek and develop new partnerships and mechanisms, and create new paradigms of cooperation. We believe that health is one of the most important, yet still broadly neglected, long-term foreign policy issues of our time. Life and health are our most precious assets. There is a growing awareness that investment in health is fundamental to economic growth and development. It is generally acknowledged that threats to health may compromise a country's stability and security. We believe that health as a foreign policy issue needs a stronger strategic focus on the international agenda. We have therefore agreed to make impact on health a point of departure and a defining lens that each of our countries will use to examine key elements of foreign policy and development strategies, and to engage in a dialogue on how to deal with policy options from this perspective. As Ministers of Foreign Affairs, we will work to: increase awareness of our common vulnerability in the face of health threats by bringing health issues more strongly into the arenas of foreign policy discussions and decisions, in order to strengthen our commitment to concerted action at the global level; build bilateral, regional and multilateral cooperation for global health security by strengthening the case for collaboration and brokering broad agreement, accountability, and action; reinforce health as a key element in strategies for development and for fighting poverty, in order to reach the Millennium Development Goals; ensure that a higher priority is given to health in dealing with trade issues and in conforming to the Doha principles, affirming the right of each country to make full use of TRIPS flexibilities in order to ensure universal access to medicines; strengthen the place of health measures in conflict and crisis management and in reconstruction efforts. For this purpose, we have prepared a first set of actionable steps for raising the priority of health in foreign policy in an Agenda for Action. We pledge to pursue these issues in our respective regional settings and in relevant international bodies. We invite Ministers of Foreign Affairs from all regions to join us in further exploring ways and means to achieve our objectives.

TI  - From trench war to dialogue: An action-research study of the assessment of barrier effects in a transport infrastructure project
T2  - CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY
AB  - Transport infrastructure such as railways and motorways create barriers in local street networks, thereby reducing social contacts between people and limiting their access to shops and services. To address these barriers, a fact-based assessment of their effects is required. However, in current planning practice barrier effects are usually assessed through general descriptions and rough estimations. This paper presents an action research based case study of what a newly developed set of barrier effect analyses contributed to the collaboration between the Swedish Transport Administration and the municipal council in a high-speed railway project. Interviews with participants (n = 22) showed that these analyses created a common language and offered concrete support, which increased trust between stakeholders and made it possible to reach a consensus about a planning alternative. Using the analyses entails interaction between practitioners and analysts throughout the work process, as the analyses and the impact assessments they provide support for are closely related. Among other findings, the importance of the street network emerged as the main variable in the analyses. There is a need to acknowledge this role and to create methods for adapting it to different planning alternatives of the infrastructure. Further, there is a need for more case studies on the collaborative processes of barrier effect assessments, as these are important for enabling the transition to more ecologically and socially sustainable transport systems.

TI  - Strategies for less motion sickness on tilting trains
T2  - COMPUTERS IN RAILWAYS XII: COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGN AND OPERATION IN RAILWAYS AND OTHER TRANSIT SYSTEMS
CP  - 12th International Conference on Computer System Design and Operation in the Railway and other Transit Systems
AB  - Many railways have put tilting trains into operation on lines with horizontal curves with small radii. Tilting trains have vehicle bodies that can roll inwards, reducing the lateral acceleration perceived by the passengers. Tilting trains can therefore run through curves at higher speeds. However, excessive tilt motions can cause motion sickness in sensitive passengers. On the other hand, too little tilting will cause discomfort from high lateral acceleration and jerk.
   The present paper presents new tilt algorithms aimed at balancing the conflicting objectives of ride comfort and less motion sickness. An enhanced approach is taken, where the amount of tilt depends on the local track conditions and the train speed. The paper shows how selected tilt algorithms influence certain motion sickness related carbody motions.
   Speed profiles designed to avoid local peaks in the risk of motion sickness are another possibility. The speed profiles for both tilting and non-tilting trains are today set from safety and comfort perspectives only, thus minimizing the running time. The present paper shows how speed profiles could be used to balance the conflicting objectives of running time and less risk of motion sickness. The result is derived from simulations and put in relation to today's tilt algorithms and speed profiles on the Stockholm-Gothenburg main line in Sweden (457 km).

TI  - PROFESSIONALISM OF PRESERVICE EARLY EDUCATION AND CHILDCARE; MULTICULTURAL AND INCLUSIVE TRAINING AS PART OF ESD-DEFINED QUALITY EDUCATION IN JAPAN, SWEDEN, AND THE US. PART 1: JAPAN
T2  - 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2019)
CP  - 12th Annual International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
AB  - Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) has redefined quality education as one that offers creative and critical thinking skills to prepare students for an unknown future. Of the three main pillars of ESD, environment, economy, and social (equity) issues, it is the social pillar that embodies the notion that each child has a right to quality education. This research looks at the situation of newcomer students to Japan, Sweden, and the US, and their prospects for being included in the educational model that will give them the appropriate tools for their futures.
   The first step of a longer project focusses on Japan. Post-war Japanese education has been praised for its meritocracy and boasts a nearly 98 percent high school graduation rate, one of the highest in the world with more than 50 percent of these students continuing on to higher education. But students who are not citizens, even though they may be permanent residents, are not included in these statistics. And their numbers are expected to rise. On December 9, 2018, the Japanese Diet enacted a partial amendment to the Immigration Control Act (ICA) which establishes two types of resident statuses, increasing the possibilities for foreigners of various skill levels to work in Japan.
   It is expected that approximately 350,000 foreigners will be entering Japan from April 2019. The expansion of the bracket of types permitted to work will increase the numbers of foreign children attending school in Japan. At this time, Japan looks abroad to countries that have had ample experience addressing multicultural and inclusive issues and how this affects the preservice early education teacher.
   As Japan prepares for this new influx, much can be learned from lessons of past ICA implementations, in particular, from the first program started thirty years ago. Because Japan is a gakureki-shakai or school-credential society, school success correlates closely with future economic and social success (White, 2002). The failed efforts of the yutori kyoiku (relaxed curriculum) years did little but to reinforce a value on the test-driven curriculum (and hence another question regarding the implementation of ESD-directed "quality education" in general). The lesson of the past ICA is that those who are not endorsed by the gakureki model, either by choice or by failure to get through it, face an uncertain road in a risk-averse culture. Without a solid policy, growing numbers of non-national students entering the educational system without proper school guidance or parental support risk being left on the fringes of society with limited possibilities for future careers and greatly circumscribed life-choices. Although at this writing, the non-national population is barely two percent of the national total, its presence adds to the challenges faced by Japan's post-bubble society, a society in which many of its own citizens are at increasing risk of becoming marginalized individuals living on the fringes

TI  - Surviving the Winter in Northern Forests: an Experimental Study of Fuelwood Consumption and Living Space in a Sami Tent Hut
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
AB  - Subsistence in northern regions with cold climate and long winters relies to a large extent on fuelwood access and logistics. The preferred sources of fuelwood in pre-industrial times in northern Scandinavia were dead standing Scots pine trees. To assess historical impacts of Sami settlement sites on surrounding forests, and effects of burning wood on living conditions inside their huts, we burned pine wood in a Sami tent hut during winter, as realistically as possible, then analyzed fuelwood consumption, temperatures, and CO levels inside it. Hourly wood consumption rates ranged from 5.0 to 7.4 kg, corresponding to an estimated average annual consumption of ca. 22,000 kg or 42 m(3) per hut. The smoke created by the fire and the low indoor temperature at the periphery of the hut limited the comfortable living space to approximately a third of the total space. We estimate that areas up to 300 m from settlements were used for fuelwood collection, but deliberate, recurring tree girdling to produce snags suitable for fuelwood might have reduced this area. Overall, the landscape impact of settlements was low, affecting less than 2.2% of the utilized lands. We conclude that experimental simulations of historical resource uses can provide valuable quantitative data for verifying or challenging qualitative interpretations and thoroughly modeling human effects on ecosystems over time.

TI  - Seed dormancy in Carex canescens: Regional differences and ecological consequences
T2  - OIKOS
AB  - We compared the germination of seeds of Carex canescens from populations in four regions: northern and southern Sweden, and northern and southern Germany. Germination behaviour was expected to differ between regions owing to adaptations to the local climates. We compared three or four populations from each region in 31 germination experiments (different pre-treatments, different temperature regimes, light vs darkness). In a parallel experiment, we recorded seedling emergence under outdoor conditions from seeds sown in the late summer in northern Germany. Although there were differences in the level of dormancy between the 13 populations and four regions, we were unable to detect geographic patterns which could be explained in terms of differential adaptation to the local climates. Our data did not support a proposed hypothesis that populations experiencing more severe winter conditions would require a longer cold-stratification period. We compared the results from the outdoor experiment with germination data from the laboratory experiments. The latter could not be used to predict differences in the timing of seedling emergence, the time-span during which seedlings emerged, or the number of seedlings emerging. We conclude that the relevance of detected differences in dormancy level among species or populations must be interpreted with great care. First, the detection of geographical patterns requires extensive sampling, second, the ecological consequences of such differences should be established.

TI  - ENERGY CROPS AND SUSTAINABILITY - DEVELOPMENT OF AN EVALUATION MODEL
T2  - Nordic View to Sustainable Rural Development
CP  - 25th NJF Congress on Nordic View to Sustainable Rural Development
AB  - Demand for bioenergy crops from arable land is likely to increase in the future, and there is a need to verify, their sustainability. In sustainability assessment many different factors must be considered, including social, economic and ecological/environmental aspects. We have developed a model to evaluate the sustainability of bioenergy crop cultivation. The focus of this study was to illustrate and evaluate the model's usefulness. The model was therefore developed only to a limited extent where a few criteria are selected and only willow cultivation in Gotaland northern plains in Sweden is evaluated. The model is aimed for local authorities, to function as decision support. The model evaluates the greenhouse gas emissions, energy balance, nitrogen leaching together and the impact on the landscape. For the impact on the landscape a scoring system was developed to make it quantifiable and thus possible to evaluate along with the other criteria. The model was tested in a case study on a willow cultivation, with winter wheat and ley as reference crops. The model proved to be a good basis for evaluation of sustainability in the cultivation of energy crops. The graphical presentation of the model result clearly showed how the different crops perform in the included criteria. We however conclude that the model needs to be extended and refined before it can function as a basis for choice between different crops or location sites.

TI  - Bridging the Functional and Territorial RationalesProposing an Integrating Framework for Regional Dynamics
T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
AB  - In identifying and enacting roads to sustainable development in welfare states, several divides fragment the research community as well as the public policies being practised. First there is a major gap between what might be addressed as a functional and a territorial rationale. The former is supported by those who in the name of national development propose a concentration of efforts to advanced and boundary-spanning innovation systems, staged as resourceful coalitions between private business, policy-makers and the universities as major knowledge-creators. A territorial rationale in contrast withholds that the power of development is nested into the local community, its committed member firms and other stakeholders as a collective. The outcome of an analytical inquiry into the construction of these contradictory discourses is integrated into a three-dimensional model. These dimensions are: the dominant life-setting in the territory (place), the general outlook of the people in the locality/region and the critical competence needed to materialize ideas that emerge in the context. Based on our earlier research we then frame theoretically and illustrate empirically the argumentation in two Swedish territories, the industrial district (Gnosjo) and an urban area (Gothenburg). Finally we propose that the very bridging of these rationales or rationales both analytically and in practice build a dynamic foundation for territorial development. This suggests the need for upholding an ongoing dialogue between contrasted rationales along each proposed dimension. The paper concludes with the implications of this view for public policy concerning localized business activity.

TI  - Optimized locations of landings in forest operations
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - In recent years, increasing attention has been drawn to improving productivity in logging passages while reducing negative impact on soil and water. The position of landings and extraction routes is crucial in these efforts, as it has a huge impact on efficient and sustainable forwarder passages. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach to identify the best possible landing locations integrated with log extraction route design. The first phase identifies potential landing zones adjacent to forest roads. It considers practical restrictions such as slopes, stoniness, and closeness to infrastructure. The second phase uses an optimization model to evaluate the potential impact of each zone and aggregate zones, selecting one or two complete landings. This model is a relaxation of a formulation for an extraction route design; it is used to minimize a weighted objective of the total driving distance, avoid steep terrains and impact on soil and water. The proposed approach has been tested on a set of harvest areas in southern Sweden. The results not only show the potential to identify feasible landing zones but also identify a shorter driving distance and hence lower contractual cost with optimized positioning. The possibility to increase efficiency in forest operations by performing scenario analysis and thus forwarding distances with different landing sites is among the results.

TI  - What policies should be implemented to develop a gaseous transport industry in Ireland?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB  - Gaseous transport has been successful in European countries such as Germany, Italy and Sweden. However, the majority of European countries have seen little market penetration of gas-powered vehicles. The utilisation of gaseous transport fuels in Ireland, like in many countries, is currently overlooked as a sustainable option to satisfying the European Union renewable transport target of 10% by 2020. A blend of Compressed Natural Gas and its renewable form biomethane (bio-CNG) presents a sustainable alternative which can diversify Ireland's transport energy portfolio. With transport fossil fuel prices at an all-time high; this paper focuses on analysing the bio-CNG policies that can best influence the Irish transport sector through strategic penetration in the captive fleet market. This paper identifies the main barriers to bio-CNG development in Ireland and proposes an aligned strategic solution to deliver a gaseous transport market. A bio-CNG roadmap is devised which provides Ireland with a platform to assist satisfying renewable transport targets through captive fleets. The findings of this paper highlight that bio-CNG has the potential to offer fleet operators a 22% financial savings versus diesel. Finally, the bio-CNG roadmap can meet 1% of Ireland's renewable transport target by fuelling 14,000 commercial gaseous vehicles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - When Internal Collaboration Is Bad for Your Company
T2  - HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW
AB  - Without question, internal collaboration can produce benefits for an organization. This doesn't mean, however, that the more your employees collaborate, the better off the company will be. It may, in fact, be worse off.
   The author, a professor at UC Berkeley and at Insead, offers a simple method for determining when collaborating on a project makes sense. He calls it calculating the collaboration premium - what's left after you subtract opportunity costs and collaboration costs from a project's expected financial return. The opportunity cost is what's lost by devoting resources to the collaboration project rather than to something else - particularly something that doesn't require collaboration. Collaboration costs arise from the challenges - conflict over goals and budgets, competing objectives, logistical roadblocks - involved in working across organizational boundaries. Sometimes those costs are so high that the project results in a collaboration penalty.
   The Norwegian company Det Norske Veritas (DNV) would have done well to apply Hansen's calculation before it launched a food-safety initiative combining the expertise, resources, and customer bases of two business units: standards certification and risk-management consulting. According to initial projections, from 2004 to 2008 the joint effort would quadruple the growth to be realized if the two units operated separately. Unfortunately, DNV hadn't formally evaluated food safety's potential relative to other promising sectors; the consulting unit might have more profitably pursued IT risk management on its own. Meanwhile, mistrust and quarreling between the two units scotched efforts to cross-sell, while conflicting goals and incentives pulled individual team members in opposing directions. Two years after launching the initiative, DNV abandoned it.
   The challenge is to cultivate not more collaboration but the right collaboration. Hansen's formula can get you started.

TI  - Conflict of Imperial and Regional Interests on the Introduction of Duty-free Trade Regime in the Mouths of Siberian Rivers during the First World War
T2  - BYLYE GODY
AB  - The article deals with the conflict of imperial and regional interests on the issue of the introduction of a duty-free trade regime in the mouths of Siberian rivers. The study is based on archival and published documents, materials of the Siberian pre-revolutionary periodicals. The authors claim that imperial power was based on the tasks of integrating the Siberian region into the all-Russian economic space. The proof of which is the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway, projects for the development of the transport network, which united Siberian rivers. However, the implementation of such projects often did not take into account the interests of the local bourgeoisie, which sought to act as an independent player on the Siberian market. The establishment of a duty-free trade regime in the mouths of Siberian rivers promoted the growth of its competitiveness and would allow it to enter world markets, bypassing its intermediaries from central Russia. But the government for a long time in this matter took the side of large financial and industrial circles in the central part of the country. And only under the influence of the events of the First World War, part of the royal bureaucracy came to understand the development of navigation along the Northern Sea Route as one of the necessary conditions for national security. However, the initiative in this matter has already been seized by foreigners in the person of J. Lida, behind whom stood Norwegian, English and American capital, who viewed Siberia as a platform for strengthening in Central and East Asia.

TI  - Do Pied Flycatchers Use Personal or Social Information for Replacement Clutch Decisions? A Field Experiment
T2  - ETHOLOGY
AB  - Life is a continuous stream of decisions: organisms are repeatedly confronted with multiple options from which to choose. To make the best decisions and maximise their fitness, individuals need to collect information: from direct interactions with the environment (personal information) or from observing other individuals interacting with the environment (social information). Yet, very little is known about the details of decision-making by animals in their natural environments, including the sources of information they use in the process. We set out to determine the relative importance of social and personal information in breeding habitat decisions in the migratory pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca. In a field experiment in Finland, we manipulated flycatcher breeding success and then allowed individuals to choose among breeding sites labelled with artificial cues (arbitrary symbols) associated with their own (manipulated) and neighbour's reproductive success, respectively, for laying a replacement clutch. Birds did not appear to distinguish among the symbols representing their own, their neighbour's or a neutral symbol, indicating that they did not use either information source when deciding about a replacement clutch. Also, the choice did not influence subsequent investment into breeding (clutch size). This may suggest that pied flycatchers utilise other cues (e.g. breeding success or predation risk on larger scales) when having to make a decision about replacement clutches. We discuss our results in light of constraints imposed by a short breeding season of migratory birds.

TI  - Urban landscapes of adolescent substance use
T2  - ACTA SOCIOLOGICA
AB  - Cities are increasingly organised according to socio-spatial divisions in which groups with similar characteristics live in the same areas. This social polarisation is associated with differences in living conditions, health, morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, areas of disadvantage' have also been associated with increased risk of harmful substance use. However, some recent studies suggest that areas of affluence' may socialise adolescents into high levels of alcohol consumption. Using a combination of city district-level socio-economic data and surveys of adolescents, we investigated patterns of substance use in different city districts of Oslo, Norway, with the aim to shed more light on these conflicting previous findings. We found that adolescents in the affluent parts of Oslo West reported the highest levels of recreational smoking, snus use and alcohol use. Those in the poorer Oslo Central East reported the highest levels of daily smoking, alcohol problems and cannabis use. After controlling for individual- and family-based risk factors, significant area differences remained, except with regard to alcohol problems and cannabis use. We conclude that adolescents living in affluent areas report the highest use of several psychoactive substances, but in a manner that is usually compatible with a rather health-oriented lifestyle. By contrast, those from socio-economically disadvantaged districts near the city centre use substances in a manner that may have greater potential for social marginalisation, morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Inferring Human Behaviors from Isotopic Analyses of Rat Diet: a Critical Review and Historical Application
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY
AB  - Rat (Rattus spp.) bone collagen stable isotope values are often assumed to reflect an average of food stuffs that were available to archaeological populations. This paper considers the feasibility of using stable isotope evidence from rat remains as a source of proxy information for human food-related social, economic, and sensorial behaviors. First, a literature review of archaeological and modern ecological rat isotope work reveals that, while rat dietary signatures are often a reasonable proxy for human food waste, they will not always record an unbiased average of foods which are available in a given environment. Second, an overview of ethological, biological, and environmental factors that can influence rat diets is given from the perspective of archaeological bone chemistry, to help identify factors that require explicit and critical consideration when rat stable isotope data is taken as a proxy for human food-related behaviors. Finally, rat stable isotope values are considered to provide new evidence about the social and economic responses of an important historical English fishing community at Ferryland (CgAf-02) to conflict and political turmoil at the turn of the eighteenth century. These results also highlight how information on rat diets can provide a counterpoint to other common faunal isotope approaches that focus on dogs and pigs as a proxy for human dietary behaviors.

TI  - NUMERICAL STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF A SUBMERGED BREAKWATER SEAWARD OF AN EXISTING BREAKWATER FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 37TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON OCEAN, OFFSHORE AND ARCTIC ENGINEERING, 2018, VOL 7A
CP  - 37th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering
AB  - In coastal areas, climate change is causing mean sea level rise and more frequent storm surge events. This means the breakwaters are expected to withstand the action of more severe incident waves and larger overtopping rates than they were designed for. Therefore, these impacts may have a negative effect on the functionality such as overtopping above the acceptable limits, in addition to stability of these structures. A breakwater which has been partly damaged by a storm stronger than the design storm has weak spots that can easily be damaged further. One way of protecting these breakwaters subjected to climate change is to build a submerged breakwater on the seaward side.
   This study focuses on the use of numerical model for optimal dimension of a submerged breakwater to be used as a protective measure for an existing structure. Comparisons are made between transmission coefficient predicted in the numerical model and those calculated from different formulae in literature. The variation in transmission coefficient due to different relative submergence and relative width parameters for waves with different steepness is studied and curves showing the dependence of these parameters on wave transmission are made. These results are then used for a test case in Kiberg, Norway where a submerged breakwater is proposed in front of a existing damaged rubble mound breakwater. The optimal geometry generated on the basis of curves is then implemented in the local-scale finite element wave prediction model, CGWAVE.

TI  - Analysis of central place foraging behaviour of wolves using hidden Markov models
T2  - ETHOLOGY
AB  - The foraging movement behaviour of grey wolves (Canis lupus) is unique in summer, when the focus of breeding wolves is on taking care of new-born offspring. In this study, we analysed the movement tracks of nine radio-collared wolves during their pup-rearing season. The wolves lived in the boreal zone in Finland. Our interest was in analysing the foraging trips of wolves from the den site, which serves as the central place of the pack in summer. Based on the information on spatial relocations and time of the day, the movement tracks of the collared wolves were split into segments using hidden Markov models (HMM). Those segments were considered to be produced by different movement behaviour modes that were not observed. We first split the movement tracks of the wolves into separate foraging trips using a two-state HMM and further extracted the different movement modes with a four-state HMM. The modes were interpreted as rest, moderate activity, homing to the den site and fast movement for other purposes, such as leaving the den. Our analysis showed that, for most of the individuals, the movement during homing was fastest and most persistent. This research highlights the foraging behaviour of wolves during the pup-rearing season, which has gained less attention than the nomadic behaviour outside of this season. Our study showed how cyclic foraging trips can be divided into behavioural phases using HMMs, and how these behaviours appear in different times of the day. These results have potential uses, for instance, when studying the habitat requirements and usage or assessing the risk of human-wildlife conflicts.

TI  - Sustainable digital transformation in small and medium enterprises (SMEs): A review on performance
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are responsible for 90% of all business and 50% of employment globally, mostly female jobs. Therefore, measuring SMEs' performance under the digital transformation (DT) through methods that encompass sustainability represents an essential tool for reducing poverty and gender inequality (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals). We aimed to describe and analyze the state-of-art performance evaluations of digital transformation in SMEs, mainly focusing on performance measurement. Also, we aimed to determine whether the tools encompass the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic). Through a systematic literature review (SLR), a search on Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus resulted in the acceptance of 74 peer-reviewed papers published until December 2021. Additionally, a bibliometrics investigation was executed. Although there was no time restriction, the oldest paper was published in 2016, indicating that DT is a new research topic with increasing interest. Italy, China, and Finland are the countries that have the most published on the theme. Based on the results, a conceptual framework is proposed. Also, two future research directions are presented and discussed, one for theoretical and another for practical research. Among the theoretical development, it is essential to work on a widely accepted SME definition. Among the practical research, nine directions are identified-e.g., applying big data, sectorial and regional prioritization, cross-temporal investigations etc. Researchers can follow the presented avenues and roads to guide their researchers toward the most relevant topics with the most urgent necessity of investigation.

TI  - Synthesis of habitat restoration impacts on young-of-the-year salmonids in boreal rivers
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES
AB  - River restoration offers the potential to enhance biological integrity, often measured as fish population changes. We used a meta-analytical approach to synthesize density responses to in-stream habitat restoration by young-of-the year (YOY) brown trout and Atlantic salmon in 28 rivers (overall 32 restoration projects) in Finland. We also examined which local and watershed-scale factors most influenced restoration success. Finally, we conducted an expert survey to obtain an independent estimate of a sufficient density enhancement for restoration to be considered successful. Despite strong context-dependency, habitat restoration had an overall positive effect on YOY salmonid density. When compared to target levels derived from the expert survey, density responses mainly reached the minimum expected success rate, but remained short of the level considered to reflect distinct success. Variability in restoration responses of trout was linked mainly to river size, predominant geology, water quality and potential interspecific competition (trout vs. European bullhead). Fishing mortality tended to obscure positive effects of restoration and stocking by YOY fish affected negatively trout's response to restoration, supporting a shift towards self-sustainable schemes in fisheries management. These results imply that habitat restoration is a useful approach for improving the ecological and conservational status of salmonid populations in boreal rivers. To further improve the success rate, and thereby public acceptance, of restorations they need to be complemented by other management measures that enhance the potential for the recovery of threatened salmonid populations.

TI  - Benthic-pelagic coupling and trophic relationships in northern Baltic Sea food webs
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
AB  - Understanding marine ecosystem structure and functioning is crucial in supporting sustainable management of natural resources and monitoring the health of marine ecosystems. The current study utilized stable isotope (SI) mixing models and trophic position models to examine energy flow, trophic relationships, and benthic-pelagic coupling between food web components. Roughly 1900 samples from different trophic levels in the food web, collected during 2001-2010 from four northern and central sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, were analyzed for SI ratios of carbon and nitrogen. Trophic structure of the food webs among the sub-basins was consistent, but there were differences between the proportions of energy in different trophic levels that had originated from the benthic habitat. Mysids and amphipods served as important links between the benthic and pelagic ecosystems. Much (35-65%) of their energy originated from the benthic zone but was transferred to higher trophic levels in the pelagic food web by consumption by herring (Clupea harengus). One percent to twenty-four percent of the energy consumption of apex seal predators (Halichoerus grypus and Pusa hispida) and predatory fish (Salmo salar) was derived from benthic zone. Diets of mysids and amphipods differed, although some overlap in their dietary niches was observed. The food web in the Gulf of Finland was more influenced by the benthic subsystem than food webs in the other sub-basins. The baseline levels of delta C-13 and delta N-15 differed between sub-basins of the Baltic Sea, indicating differences in the input of organic matter and nutrients to each sub-basin.

TI  - Roles of intermediaries in supporting eco-innovation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Eco-innovation is an approach to environmental sustainability. However, the process of eco-innovation can be challenging especially for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus, SMEs might seek external support to tackle some of their challenges in eco-innovation. In this article, we focus on one type of organization providing and also assisting SMEs to access support, intermediaries, i.e. an organization or body that acts as an agent or broker in the innovation process. Intermediaries support firms in the innovation process through various generic and customised activities. To identify such activities and describe the roles intermediaries take in eco-innovation, we conducted interviews and documentation analysis on selected intermediaries in two regions - Scania, Sweden and North Rhine Westphalia, Germany. The identified roles among our cases include: (i) forecasting and road mapping, (ii) information gathering and dissemination, (iii) fostering networking and partnerships, (iv) prototyping and piloting, (v) technical consulting, (vi) resource mobilisation, (vii) commercialisation, and (viii) branding and legitimation. In relation to the specific characteristics of eco-innovations, the intermediary roles such as prototyping and piloting, information gathering and dissemination, and branding were directly targeted at validating the environmental benefits of eco-innovations to tackle their "double externality" challenge. However, we found little intermediation activities from our cases directed explicitly at policy change for eco-innovation. For policy makers, our results suggest a complementary use of different types of intermediaries to support eco-innovation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - How May Public Transport Influence the Practice of Everyday Life among Younger and Older People and How May Their Practices Influence Public Transport?
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - This paper examines public transport use through the lens of practice to understand the perspectives of two categories of public transport users: Younger and older people. In taking this approach, we assume that the forms of mobility in a society are dependent on citizens' everyday practices and on the structures of the cities, landscapes, etc. Transport needs and accessibility may vary depending on contexts (i.e., where and how we live) and on the various resources of groups of citizens. Results indicated that younger people are repeatedly referred to public transport to meet their mobility needs, while older people are more often car-dependent. Local variations, among both younger and older people, indicate higher confidence in public transport in big and medium-sized cities and a greater desire for car ownership in small cities. For the transition to sustainable mobility, e.g., public transport, transport associations and local governments should be responsive to the practice of everyday life among citizens: e.g., younger people's leisure activities in afternoons and weekends, and older people's wish for accessible transport service outside the dominant flow of passengers and their daily commuting practice. The data come from Sweden, specifically from focus groups with teenagers aged 14-16 years and retired people aged 63-97 years.

TI  - Transition towards a circular economy at a regional level: A case study on closing biological loops
T2  - RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
AB  - The transition towards a circular economy requires a systemic change, where regions play a vital role. In Finland's Paijat-Hame region, European and national targets for a circular economy were implemented on a regional level. The regional development programme and strategy of the area emphasises a circular economy as a key feature. In practice, a circular economy strategy was set up through a road map process involving stakeholders from local government, industry and academia. The strategy aims to strengthen circular economy implementation in real-world systems through five identified goals. The goals focus on closing both technical and biological loops, as well as promoting sustainable energy technologies, new consumption models and demonstration sites. This paper illustrates how a move towards a circular economy is supported through regional strategy implementation. Furthermore, opportunities and challenges related to the transition towards the circular economy are presented via a case analysis of a local bio-based industrial symbiosis where biogas and fertiliser are produced from biowaste streams and sewage sludge. New technologies such as these create more business opportunities at the interface of material and energy cycles even where their implementation faces financing challenges. Regulations need to support the implementation of effective symbioses emerging from new solutions, but are also needed to safeguard the environment and human health when closing biological loops. The regional circular economy strategy described and the case of bio-based industrial symbiosis are both recognised as transferable good practices at the European level. A stakeholder-based approach is shown to be crucial to continuous development towards a circular economy society.

TI  - Intraguild predation and competition impacts on a subordinate predator
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - Intraguild (IG) predation and interspecific competition may affect the settlement and success of species in their habitats. Using data on forest-dwelling hawks from Finland, we addressed the impact of an IG predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis (goshawk), on the breeding of an IG prey, the common buzzard Buteo buteo. We hypothesized that the subordinate common buzzard avoids breeding in the proximity of goshawks and that interspecific competitors, mainly Strix owls, may also disturb common buzzards by competing for nests and food. Our results show that common buzzards more frequently occupied territories with a low IG predation threat and with no interspecific competitors. We also observed that common buzzards avoided territories with high levels of grouse, the main food of goshawks, possibly due to a risk of IG predation since abundant grouse can attract goshawks. High levels of small rodents attracted interspecific competitors to common buzzard territories and created a situation where there was not only an abundance of food but also an abundance of competitors for the food. These results suggest interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes which influence the interactions between avian predator species. We conclude that the common buzzard needs to balance the risks of IG predation and interference competition with the availability of its own resources. The presence of other predators associated with high food levels may impede a subordinate predator taking full advantage of the available food. Based on our results, it appears that interspecific interactions with dominant predators have the potential to influence the distribution pattern of subordinate predators.

TI  - Mobbing of the top predator: a correlation between avian community richness and the number of mobbing species
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
AB  - Mobbing is an anti-predator strategy initiated by one or more members of prey species aiming at driving away a predator that is not undertaking an attack. Because of a continuous dispute as to whether mobbing of a top predator may indicate species richness, we tested the correlation between the number of species engaging in mobbing and avian community richness. In the boreal forest of central Norway, we conducted a series of 83 bird census trials in 2014 and 2015. Each census trial consisted of two 5-min phases. In the first phase an ordinary point count was performed as a control; in the immediately following second phase either a stuffed Eagle Owl or Capercaillie female decoy was presented to study mobbing of a top avian predator and non-predatory species. Mobbing was more likely to occur, and the number of species that engaged in mobbing was higher, in habitats richer of bird species. Our study showed that the cumulative effects of being mobbed increase with richness of the local avian community. We did not find any support for the notion that mobbing is triggered by mobbing activity of the two most active and abundant species. No support was provided for an assertion that using an owl decoy would result in higher number of detected species during a census. Our study urges the need for identification and quantification of costs of mobbing for an avian predator. ZusammenfassungMobbing des Top-Pradators: eine Korrelation zwischen der Vielfalt der Vogelgemeinschaft und der Anzahl der mobbenden Arten.Mobbing ist eine Strategie gegen Pradatoren, die durch ein oder mehrere Angehorige einer Beuteart initiiert wird, mit dem Ziel, einen Pradator zu vertreiben, der selbst nicht angreift. Aufgrund einer anhaltenden Diskussion daruber, ob das Mobbing eines Top-Pradators Artenreichtum anzeigt, haben wir den Zusammenhang zwischen der Anzahl an Arten, welche Mobbing ausuben, und der Vielfalt der Vogelgemeinschaft untersucht. In den borealen Waldern Zentralnorwegens fuhrten wir in 2014 und 2015 insgesamt 83 Begehungen zur Erfassung des Vogelbestands durch. Jede Begehung bestand aus zwei 5-Minuten-Phasen. In der ersten Phase wurde ein einfaches Punktzahlverfahren als Kontrolle durchgefuhrt. In der direkt darauf folgenden zweiten Phase wurde entweder ein ausgestopfter Uhu oder ein weibliches Auerhuhn als Lockvogel aufgestellt, um das Mobbing eines Top-Pradators bzw. eines Nichtpradators zu untersuchen. In Habitaten mit gro ss erem Vogelartenreichtum trat Mobbing mit hoherer Wahrscheinlichkeit und einer hoheren Anzahl an mobbenden Arten auf. Unsere Studie zeigte, dass die kumulativen Auswirkungen des Gemobbt-Werdens mit der Vielfalt der lokalen Vogelgemeinschaft anstiegen. Wir konnten keinen Hinweis dafur finden, dass Mobbing durch die Mobbing-Aktivitat der zwei aktivsten und haufigsten Arten ausgelost wurde. Die bestehende These, dass die Nutzung eines Eulen-Lockvogels moglicherweise zu einer hoheren Anzahl an festgestellten Arten wahrend einer Bestandserfassung fuhrte, konnte nicht unterstutzt werden. Unsere Studie unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit, die durch Mobbing verursachten Kosten fur den Pradator zu identifizieren und zu quantifizieren.

TI  - Resistant calcification responses of<i> Arctica</i><i> islandica</i> clams under ocean acidification conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) directly impacts marine calcifying organisms including ecologically and commercially important shellfish species such as Arctica islandica (A. islandica). To test whether documented growth resilience of A. islandica to OA is a general response across ages and populations or a function of adaptation to local habitat, we cultured juvenile and adult clams collected from an environment with little pH variation under four pH levels (7.5, 7.7, 7.9, and 8.1) for three months and integrated our understanding with relevant literature. The average shell growth over the experiment among all (69) individuals was 57 +/- 55 ism, and there were no statistically significant differences in growth among pH treatments, including the control treatment, despite the general growth rate differences between juveniles and adults. Our results show that A. islandica can maintain its shell growth even in aragonite undersaturated (omega < 1) conditions (0.65 and 0.83 for pH 7.5 and 7.7 treatments, respectively), supporting the hypothesis that resistance to OA conditions is likely a generalized response across populations. Although the present results show A. islandica can maintain their shell growth under short-term OA, long-term impacts of OA on A. islandica shell growth and other physical parameters including shell density and microstructure are still needed to better assess the sustainability of A. islandica in a more acidified future and to provide guidance on managing this important shellfish stock.

TI  - Politically Engaged Mindset of Everyday Coping in Relation to Nursing Values: A Phenomenological-Hermeneutic Study of District Nurses' Experiences
T2  - SAGE OPEN NURSING
AB  - IntroductionTo accommodate challenges threatening the healthcare sector's sustainability, district nursing in Norway implemented the rehabilitative and health promoting mindset of everyday coping. When implementing new ideas and practices in nursing care, understanding the significance of this mindset on patient care and whether it corresponds to nursing values are important to ensure healthcare quality. ObjectiveThis study aimed to understand how nurses practice care where everyday coping is implemented in district nursing and their experience of everyday coping as a mindset in relation to nursing values. MethodsA qualitative study was conducted including 19 observations and 19 narrative interviews with 10 district nurses, during two data collection periods. Data were analyzed using a phenomenological-hermeneutic method. The analysis process consisted of three steps: naive reading, structural analysis, and comprehensive understanding. ResultsThe following two main themes and four sub-themes emerged from the data analyses: (i) Understanding individual patient situations; "Creating a nurse-patient relationship to understand the patient landscape" and "providing care based on individual patient needs," (ii) knowing when and how to motivate or help patients; "distinction between motivating patients and causing stress" and "realistic and desirable demands to motivate patients to perform tasks." ConclusionParticipants determined how to provide care to patients based on their values, professional knowledge, and individual patient situations. The patient landscape is diverse and everyday coping is unable to capture the diversity of patient groups. Thus, everyday coping is not expressed as an overall mindset in nursing practice.

TI  - The economic performance of marine stock enhancement projects
T2  - BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
CP  - International Symposium in Fisheries Ecology
AB  - I reviewed nine marine stocking programs for which biological or economic measures of success were available. Only one, the Japanese chum salmon program, appears to be a clear economic success. Programs for pink salmon in Alaska, chinook and coho salmon in the U.S. and Canada, lobster in the U.K. and France, cod in Norway, and Kemp's ridley sea turtle are clear economic failures. No economic data were available for striped mullet in Hawaii or red drum in Texas. Incomplete and conflicting economic data for flounder in Japan provide no clear evidence. Marking was successfully used in a number of projects to establish that the stocked individuals survived, but it was far more difficult to establish that stocking effected a net increase in population size. Marking should be standard procedure for establishment of survival; control areas should be the method for determination of net increase in abundance. I suggest that stocking programs be made subject to peer review by scientists without a vested interest in the success of marine enhancement. The economics of stocking should be compared with that of alternatives such as habitat protection, fishery regulation, and stricter enforcement. Density-dependent processes in the ocean pose difficult obstacles for marine stocking programs, and none of the projects reviewed showed clear evidence of increasing total abundance. It appears that a coalition of vested interests including politicians, users, and technology advocates has little desire for critical evaluation and that many stocking programs will continue to receive substantial public funds even if shown to be uneconomical.

TI  - Estimating determinants of public acceptance of hydrogen vehicles and refuelling stations in greater Stavanger
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB  - Utilising a structural equation modelling methodology, an examination of the complex relationships existing among hydrogen knowledge, environmental attitude and acceptance of hydrogen vehicles and the refuelling stations was conducted based on an empirical survey data collected in spring 2009 from Greater Stavanger, Norway (n = 1000). The primary aim of this study is to provide a better research method for explaining unobservable factors particularly knowledge and attitude likely to relate to the public's acceptance of hydrogen energy's implementation in the road transport sector. The existing study found that age, education duration and gender influence the likelihood to accept hydrogen vehicles and refuelling stations as well as willingness to pay for hydrogen fuel. The estimated models also present differences of estimated relationships between the Back Yard model (individuals living very close to the refuelling stations) and the Greater Stavanger model (those living beyond the stations' site). The results indicate that greater knowledge about hydrogen vehicles and refuelling stations can imply lower support for hydrogen vehicles and refuelling stations (the direct effect for model A: 0.18, p < 0.001). However, the higher the knowledge, the higher the attitude to support sustainable environment and hydrogen energy, which may consistently imply greater support for the applications of hydrogen vehicles and refuelling stations (the total effect for model A: 0.58).

TI  - Inequities in Health Care Services Caused by the Adoption of Digital Health Technologies: Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Digital health technologies (ie, the integration of digital technology and health information) aim to increase the efficiency of health care delivery; they are rapidly adapting to health care contexts to provide improved medical services for citizens. However, contrary to expectations, their rapid adoption appears to have led to health inequities, with differences in health conditions or inequality in the distribution of health care resources among different populations.
   Objective: This scoping review aims to identify and describe the inequities of health care services brought about by the adoption of digital health technologies. The factors influencing such inequities, as well as the corresponding countermeasures to ensure health equity among different groups of citizens, were also studied.
   Methods: Primary studies and literature, including articles and reviews, published in English between 1990 and 2020 were retrieved using appropriate search strategies across the following three electronic databases: Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus. Data management was performed by two authors (RY and WZ) using Thomson Endnote (Clarivate Analytics, Inc), by systematically screening and identifying eligible articles for this study. Any conflicts of opinion were resolved through discussions with the corresponding author. A qualitative descriptive synthesis was performed to determine the outcomes of this scoping review.
   Results: A total of 2325 studies were collected during the search process, of which 41 (1.76%) papers were identified for further analysis. The quantity of literature increased until 2016, with a peak in 2020. The United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway ranked among the top 3 countries for publication output. Health inequities caused by the adoption of digital health technologies in health care services can be reflected in the following two dimensions: the inability of citizens to obtain and adopt technology and the different disease outcomes found among citizens under technical intervention measures. The factors that influenced inequities included age, race, region, economy, and education level, together with health conditions and eHealth literacy. Finally, action can be taken to alleviate inequities in the future by government agencies and medical institutions (eg, establishing national health insurance), digital health technology providers (eg, designing high-quality tools), and health care service recipients (eg, developing skills to access digital technologies).
   Conclusions: The application of digital health technologies in health care services has caused inequities to some extent. However, existing research has certain limitations. The findings provide a comprehensive starting point for future research, allowing for further investigation into how digital health technologies may influence the unequal distribution of health care services. The interaction between individual subjective factors as well as social support and influencing factors should be included in future studies. Specifically, access to and availability of digital health technologies for socially disadvantaged groups should be of paramount importance.

TI  - Relationship between the weathering of clay minerals and the nitrification rate: a rapid tree species effect
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
CP  - 4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions
AB  - We compared the properties of the clay mineral fraction and the composition of soil solutions in a Fagus sylvatica coppice (native forest) and four adjacent plantations of Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus nigra, Picea abies and Quercus sessiliflora planted in 1976. The results revealed changes of clay fraction properties due to tree species effect. Clay samples from Douglas fir and pine stands differ when compared to other species. Twenty-eight years after planting, we observed the following changes: a more pronounced swelling after citrate extraction and ethylene glycol solvation, a higher CEC and a smaller poorly crystallised aluminium content. All these changes affecting the clay fraction agreed well with soil solution analyses which revealed high NO3 (-), H+ and Al concentrations under Douglas fir and pine. These changes were explained by a strong net nitrification under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared with other tree species. The higher NO3 (-) concentrations in soil solutions should be linked to the presence, type and activity of ammonia-oxiding bacteria which are likely influenced by tree species. The production of NO3 (-) in excess of biological demand leads to a net production of hydrogen ion and enhances the dissolution of poorly crystallised Al-minerals. Secondary Al-bearing minerals constituted the principal acid-consuming system in these soils. As a consequence, the depletion of interlayer spaces of hydroxyinterlayered minerals increases the number of sites for exchangeable cation fixation and increases CEC of the clay fraction. The dissolution of Al oxy-hydroxides explain the increase in Al concentrations of soil solutions under Douglas fir and pine stands when compared to other species. Nitrate and dissolved aluminium were conjointly leached in the soil solutions. A change in environmental conditions, like an introduction of tree species, enough modifies soil processes to induce significant changes in the soil mineralogical composition even over a period of time as short as some tens of years. Generally, mineral weathering has been considered to be very slow and unlikely to change over tens of years, resulting in few studies capable of detecting changes in mineralogy. This study appears to have detected changes in clay mineralogy during a period of 28 years after the planting of forest species. Our study represents a single location with a limited block design, but causes us to conclude that the observed changes could be widely representative. Where available, archived samples should be utilized and long-term experiments set up so that similar changes can be tested for and detected using more robust designs. The plausible hypothesis we present to explain apparent changes in clay mineralogy has strong relevance to the sustainable management of land.

TI  - Evaluating quantitative pollen representation of vegetation in the tropics: A case study on the Hainan Island, tropical China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - Complex pollen-vegetation relationships in tropical environments have long been a challenge for the interpretation of pollen spectra in terms of vegetation cover. Here, we test the application of the widely-used Extended R-Value (ERV) model in the tropical secondary and planted woodlands of the Hainan Island (China) to estimate relative pollen productivities (RPPs) for common plant taxa occurring as pollen in surface and fossil samples of the region. We collected pollen (soil samples) and related vegetation data within 1500 m radius at 23 random distributed sites within an area of 50 km x 100 km. We found a large difference between the modern pollen assemblages and the related vegetation composition in terms of number and dominance of taxa. We tested the three existing ERV sub-models and three methods to distance-weight vegetation cover, i.e. 1/d, the Prentice's model (using a Gaussian Plume dispersal model, GPM), and the Lagrangian stochastic dispersal model (LSM). The LSM appears to be inappropriate for our dataset. The combination of ERV sub-model 2 and Prentice's model using nine anemophilous and zoophilous (or with "messy" pollination syndrome) taxa was found to provide the best results. The relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) of the soil samples was estimated to ca. 1000-1500 m. The ranking of RPPs is as follows: Castanopsis-Lithocarpus (19.44 +/- 0.17) Asteraceae (8.74 +/- 0.05) > Moraceae (6.52 +/- 0.08) > Euphorbiaceae (5.22 +/- 0.1) > Papilionaceae (2.66 +/- 0.05) > Mallotus-Macaranga (2.21 +/- 0.08) > Anacardiaceae (1.77 +/- 0.04) > Rubiaceae (1.29 +/- 0.02) > Poaceae (=1). Violation of the ERV model assumptions of anemophily and stationarity of vegetation composition influenced the performance of the ERV analysis in this study and implied careful evaluation of the results. Nevertheless, the obtained RPPs are considered reliable and will allow to quantify the relative cover of the nine plant taxa in the past. Further studies of this kind will be worthwhile to obtain additional RPP values for a larger number of tropical taxa, even though quantification of past plant cover in the tropics will remain a challenge. The numerous zoophilous taxa may either be absent of the pollen record, or exhibit pollen-vegetation relationships for which the ERV-model is not successful in estimating RPPs. These plant taxa will require other approaches for their quantification in the past.

TI  - DESIGN THINKING MINDSET APPLIED TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING
T2  - INTED2017: 11TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONFERENCE
CP  - 11th International Conference on Technology, Education and Development (INTED)
AB  - The competitiveness of economies is increasingly dependent on the availability of a qualified and entrepreneurial workforce. Transversal skills such as the critical thinking, initiative, problem solving, and collaborative work will prepare individuals for today's varied and unpredictable career paths.
   Attention also needs to be given to entrepreneurial skills as they not only contribute to new businesses creation but also for the employability of young people. European Higher Education (HE) and training systems continue to fall short in providing these right skills for employability (Rethinking Education,EU, 2012).
   HE and Vocational Education Training (VET) Institutions need to keep the efforts to reposition themselves in the emerging learning landscape and to experiment new formats and strategies for learning and teaching to be able to offer relevant, effective, and high quality learning experiences in the future(Redecker, C. et al., 2011).
   There is a consensus on the need for comprehensive changes to curricula and learning methods and for the inclusion of transversal and transferable skills in the curricula's that should be "T-shaped" rooted in the specific academic discipline while at the same time interacting and cooperating with other disciplines/sectors.
   For the modernisation of the institutions is recognised the need to: promote and nurture an institutional culture to innovation that enhances creativity, stimulates openness, and minimises resistance to change; develop and monitor curricula, drawing on new methods of teaching and learning so that students acquire relevant skills for employability; introduce and promote cross/trans and interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning.
   Design thinking (DT) is a mindset and a holistic concept to design cognition and design learning that enables students to work successfully in multi-disciplinary teams and enact positive, design-led change in the world.
   DT proved already to be a tool capable of delivering "new skills", many of the new skills - social intelligence, novel & adaptive thinking, cross cultural competences, transdisciplinarity, design mind-set & virtual collaboration - employers and organizations seek. The need to prepare the present and future workers for an increasingly dynamic society has long been a concern at different political, educational, and organisational levels.
   This scenario offers an important challenge to the education and training sector. Therefore, a consortium of partners from 6 different countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Finland, Belgium, and Poland) is developing an innovative approach to promote a wider use of DT as a transversal tool, in HEI and VET, by developing and making available an innovative digital course supported on mobile learning for education professionals and professional trainers.
   The work being developed includes also the development of a toolkit on DT applied to education & training; the promotion of the renew of learning approaches and methodologies to fit to the new challenges; and fostering the cooperation between higher education institutions and the labour market, allowing for the development of people better prepared to respond to the challenges of the labour market.

TI  - Boundaries and Boundary Markers of Landholdings in the 13<SUP>th</SUP>-19<SUP>th</SUP> Centuries
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
AB  - The most important factor in shaping borders in earlier times in Estonian territory has been nature, which has limited the area of human activity with deep forests, extensive swamps and bodies of water. The gradual replacement of the former zone or belt boundaries with linear boundaries began in association with the new power and ownership relationships that developed in the 13(th) century, and the growth in settlement density. As lands were enfeoffed, boundaries began to be determined ever more exactly and unambiguously. Thus, the former organic boundaries started being replaced by artificial boundaries that already had a clearly divisional and defensive function. This was accompanied by the adoption of artificial border markings as well. Rocks and trees marked with the sign of the cross were the two types of boundary markers that most easily enabled the marking of the kind of boundary that did not depend on natural conditions alone but rather on the will of people. Parts of civilised landscapes (roads, bridges, places of cult significance for pagans) were used to mark boundaries because they had an important part in local social-economic and cultural life and fostered the establishment of boundaries in the memory of local residents. Regardless of the growing importance of artificial boundary markers, the use of natural markers also continued alongside elements of the civilised landscape in marking boundaries due to the fact that linear parts of boundaries alternated with parts of boundaries that were not so exactly marked.
   A large number of dissimilar boundary markers were in use until the end of the 17(th) century from elements of the natural and civilised landscape to holes dug especially for marking boundaries, heaps of rocks, ditches, and marked rocks and trees. The use of trees as boundary markers was natural because they had already acquired landmark status in the landscape as well as in people's memories from time immemorial. Large trees have been important landmarks that made the work of land surveyors easier and made it possible to mark out boundary points without requiring any great effort. While the use of trees was common in the period when linear boundaries were evolving, the more exact and important linear boundaries of estates became, the less trees met the needs of marking this kind of boundary. Swedish authorities began bringing order to the marking of property boundaries at the end of the 17(th) century. Only boundary stones and posts planted upright in heaps of stones or soil were permitted for use as boundary markers and it was recommended to avoid using trees to mark boundaries because trees grow and their shape changes over time. There are few reports in folklore collections concerning trees as boundary markers because the use of trees as boundary markers began dying out in the 17(th) century already.
   The replacement of the former belt or zone boundaries with linear boundaries took centuries in Estonian territory. Exact linear boundaries did not become predominant until the end of the 17(th) century and not properly until the 18(th) and 19(th) centuries in swamp and forest areas. Boundary space became the boundary line, for which reason the formerly common natural boundary markers were abandoned and only boundary posts planted upright in heaps of stones or soil and boundary stones marked with crosses were used to mark boundaries. The evolution of boundaries and boundary markers is associated with more general demographic, economic and social evolution, whereas the standardisation of the marking of boundaries also demonstrates the regulation of ownership relationships and the consolidation of power.

TI  - FORMATION OF A CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STRATEGY OF COMPANIES IN EU COUNTRIES
T2  - BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB  - Business cannot act in isolation from society since it itself is a part of society. The fact that corporate social responsibility (hereinafter - CSR) has become a global business concept that defines key ideas and a modern format for entrepreneurship is no longer questionable. Every year, more and more companies are joining the initiative of non-financial reporting, which acts as a "business card of a social image." The presence of social and ethical business standards greatly contributes to the formation of a positive business image and increases corporate competitiveness. At the same time, the growth of social, environmental, and economic problems of a global scale raises public expectations and, therefore, requirements for socially responsible activities of companies, inducing them to continuously improve the quality of CSR practices, finding innovative approaches to solving socially important problems, which is reflected in the global development trends of socially responsible business. The formation of models of state regulation of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developed countries took place over several decades and, at the present stage, they are characterized by a high degree of development. The author aims to study the genesis of development of models of state regulation of corporate social responsibility, analyse principles of the formation of social responsibility strategy, and propose areas for improving CSR for companies operating in the European business space at the modern development stage in view of implementing the concept of sustainable development. After analysing the national models of CSR state regulation, we note that in the research of scientists, there from three (American, European, Asian) to seven models: American (US), European (Continental), British, Scandinavian, Asian (Japanese), African, model of BRICS countries or more. But, of course, the US model of CSR, formed in the specific conditions of the free market, is the largest. Key conclusions of the involvement of European companies in the implementation of the CSR strategy are as follows: involvement depends on the size of the company (CSR policy is applied by 48% of small and 65% of medium-sized companies); the implementation of the CSR policy does not depend on the company's field, but there was a geographical discrepancy (for example, 33% of the SME in France and 83% in Finland); among all companies, 50% use the CSR strategy; only 8% of the EU company receive privileges or subsidies from the state for implementing the CSR policy; more than 75% of SME representatives among respondents can determine the benefits of corporate social responsibility. In the majority of the EU countries, state programs of support and stimulation of the abovementioned processes, in which the state defines socially responsible behaviour for business, engages private and public sector companies in the joint fulfilment of socially important tasks, stimulates business to socially responsible activity, are developed and operate. On the basis of determining the factors influencing the formation of social responsibility strategy and matrix of the appropriateness of SRB introduction, areas for improving strategic management based on social responsibility standards were formed.

TI  - SeeMe at the crosswalk: Before-after study of a pedestrian crosswalk warning system
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR
AB  - SeeMe is a pedestrian crosswalk warning system with automatic pedestrian detection that is mounted on crosswalk signs. Amber flashing lights are activated when pedestrians are approaching or crossing the crosswalk. The aim is to attract motorists' attention, to improve yielding behavior and to reduce conflicts. A before-after study with a matched comparison group has been conducted in the Norwegian municipality of Trondheim. Video observations were made at eight crosswalks (four of which were equipped with SeeMe in the after period) of 1825 pedestrian-motorist interactions. On average, yielding rates at SeeMe equipped crosswalks increased by 14% (statistically significant) when changes at the comparison sites are taken into account. However, the results are inconsistent between crosswalks. At two of the crosswalks with SeeMe in the after period, yielding rates increased by 39% (statistically significant), while they decreased by 4% at the other two crosswalks (not statistically significant). There were several differences between crosswalks with increased and unchanged yielding rates: Initial yielding rates (below vs. above 80%), placement of crosswalk signs (immediately at vs. at some distance from the crosswalk) and false alarm rates (30% vs. 57% on average). These factors may have affected the effect of SeeMe on yielding rates, but the number of crosswalks included in the study is too small to generalize the differences between different types of crosswalks. The results do not indicate that SeeMe has negatively affected pedestrian behavior or provoked conflicts. It is concluded that SeeMe may be effective in increasing motorist yielding rates at crosswalks with similar characteristics as in the present study - two-lane roads in residential areas with moderate motor vehicle volumes and speed limits of 50 kph or below - and that high initial yielding rates and high rates of false alarms may limit its effectiveness.

TI  - Linking debris-flow hazard assessments with geomorphology
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
CP  - IAG Symposium on the Relationships Between Man and the Mountain Environment in Terms of Geomorphological Hazards and Human Impact in Europe
AB  - Debris-flow hazard assessment schemes are commonly based on empirical, physical, or numerical methods and techniques. Inherent in all methods is generally the assumption of unlimited sediment supply. This study compares model inputs of sediment requirements for debris flows with estimated sediment reproduction from both solifluction and rockwall retreat. The analysis is carried out in Bildudalur, a community in the Westfjords of Iceland. Geomorphic techniques are applied to determine the set of natural processes acting in this landscape to estimate spatial distribution of relevant processes, to approximate level of processes activity, and to provide information for scenario modeling. Debris-flow volumes are determined by coupling rainfall magnitudes and catchment sizes with average sediment contents. Rockwall retreat and solifluction rates are based on literature reviews.
   For a rainstorm with a 10-year return period, debris-flow volumes are calculated for 12 different creeks. Rates are assumed for solifluction with a velocity of 0.25 m/yr at an average depth of 0.5 in and for rockwall retreat with 2 mm/yr. Comparing sediment requirements with estimated sediment reproduction leads to a factor of deficit ranging between 6.2 and 8.5. Thus, the sediment storage is not refilled as fast as the next potential triggering rainfall occurs. Consequently, if a debris flow has occurred in the past, all sediment is removed, and the following rainstorm event is 'just' causing a flood, which is by far less destructive than a debris-flow event. The challenge of future debris-flow hazard-assessment schemes is to include geomorphic analysis to be able to obtain more sustainable results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Innovation in diabetes prevention research: The 36-year legacy of China Da Qing diabetes prevention study
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
AB  - Prediabetes, also known as impaired glucose regulation (IGR), is an intermediate stage between normal glycemia and diabetes. It includes people with elevated, but sub-diabetic fasting glucose levels, called impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and postprandial glucose intolerance, called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). In some diagnostic criteria, individuals with HbA1c 5.7%-6.4% are regarded as prediabetes as well. Around 5%-10% of individuals with prediabetes become diabetic annually, and up to 70% progress to diabetes within their lifetime. As one of the top five chronic diseases in healthcare globally, diabetes incurs an average medical expenditure of nearly one trillion dollars per year. China is the country with the highest number of diabetes cases and diabetes-related death worldwide, urgent action is needed to address diabetes in China. The China Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study (CDQDPS), a randomized controlled trial started in 1986, demonstrated the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Along with the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS), the CDQDPS has been regarded as the landmark study for primary prevention of T2DM by lifestyle intervention, but with the longest duration of intervention and follow-up since 1986. Due to long-term follow-up of up to 30 years, the CDQDPS remains the only trial to date that reported the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and death caused by T2DM among individuals with IGT.
   The global epidemic of T2DM has prompted numerous studies and public health efforts to reduce its development. A crucial challenge is associated with the ununified diagnostic criteria of prediabetes by various international professional organizations, for instance, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) defines IFG as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level above 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L), whereas the World Health Organization (WHO) sets the threshold at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L). Furthermore, the diagnosis of prediabetes based on different measurements: FPG, 2-hour plasma glucose, and HbA1c has different insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and risk of developing T2DM and incident CVD events. Therefore, it's important to investigate whether there is a difference in the efficacy of lifestyle intervention to prevent T2DM among individuals with prediabetes defined by different diagnostic criteria, such as isolated IFG (i-IFG), and elevated HbA1c.
   Additionally, with the advent of the internet as a resource base for research and the need to bridge the know-do gap, further research is required to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of digital intervention on lifestyle management in preventing T2DM, and it's necessary to identify barriers and facilitators to implement lifestyle intervention and evaluate the acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, implementation costs, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability of interventions.
   All in all, this review summarizes the background, study design, main results, and contributions of the CDQDPS, and help inform future studies in diabetes prevention and public health efforts to address the epidemic of T2DM.

TI  - USE OF SHM IN DESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF BRIDGES
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURE HEALTH MONITORING & INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE: STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING & INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Structural Health Monitoring of Intelligent Infrastructure
AB  - This paper present a fall-scale test on a strengthen railway concrete trough bridge. A unique opportunity came up. The existing railway line was going to be replaced with a new one and the bridge became obsolete. The purpose of the project was o investigate the shear capacity of the bridge. To avoid an uninteresting bending failure, the bottom beam were strengthened with Near Surface Mounted Reinforcement (NSMR) consisting of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRP). The project was a part of the European funded research project Sustainable Bridges (www.sustainblebridges.net). The bride tested is a 50 year old two-span concrete bridge located in Ornskoldsvik in northern Sweden. The bridge was tested to failure to demonstrate and test new and refined methods developed in the project regarding procedures for condition assessment and inspection, load carrying capacity, measurement and strengthening. The bridge was built in 1955.It: has two spans of 12 m. In one of the spans a loading beam made of steel was placed in the centre of the span. The loading beam was then pulled down with cables injected to the bedrock beneath the bridge. Usually models for the load carrying capacity are tested in the laboratory in reduced scale. There are very few other concrete bridges which have been tested to failure in order to check their ultimate behaviour and this project demonstrate the use of SHM in full scale testing. The strengthening was successful and the results from the tests shows that the used design and FE-models underestimate the shear capacity considerably.

TI  - Potential for using guest attendance forecasting in Swedish public catering to reduce overcatering
T2  - SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION
AB  - Food waste is a significant problem within public catering establishments, caused mainly by serving waste arising from overcatering. Overcatering means that public catering establishments rarely run out of food but surplus ends up as food waste. The challenge is to find a solution that minimizes food waste while ensuring that sufficient food can be provided. A key element in this balancing act is to forecast accurately the number of meals needed and cook that amount. This study examined conventional forecasting methods (last-value forecasting, moving-average models) and more complex models (prophet model, neural network model) and calculated associated margins for all models. The best-performing model for each catering establishment was then used to evaluate the optimal number of portions based on stochastic inventory theory. Data used in the forecasting models are number of portions registered at 21 schools in the period 2010-2019. The past year was used for testing the models against real observations. The current business as usual scenario results in a mean average percentage error of 20-40%, whereas the best forecasting case around 2-3%. Irrespective of forecasting method, meal planning needed some safety margin in place for days when demand exceeded the forecast level. Conventional forecasting methods were simple to use and provided the best results in seven cases, but the neural network model performed best for 11 out of 21 kitchens studied. Forecasting can be one option on the road to achieve a more sustainable public catering sector. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI  - Analysing gap dynamics in forest canopies with landscape metrics based on multi-temporal airborne laser scanning surveys - A pilot study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
AB  - For a long time gaps or openings in the forest canopy have been of considerable interest to forest ecologists and to forest managers. In the context of disturbances induced by climate change, canopy gap dynamics are of particular interest, since they can indicate imminent damage to forest resources and irreversible trends such as forest decline. Here, statistical significance is crucial for establishing whether any imminent large-scale threat to the sustainability of forest resources exists. In order to be able to assess significance, we applied the Boolean model, a null or reference model from random set statistics. The Boolean model served as a theoretical benchmark for testing the significance of the observed trends in forest canopy gap dynamics. As a pilot study we analysed airborne laser scan (ALS) data collected in the Krycklan catchment area (Northern Sweden) in 2006 and 2015. The data were analysed using eight different landscape metrics. Despite the moderate resolution of our ALS data the landscape metrics have proved to be useful tools for monitoring canopy gap dynamics of forest ecosystems. The Boolean model has been successful in ascertaining statistical significance and the model parameters indi-cated important trends. In the Krycklan catchment area, there was no significant trend of canopy gap dynamics indicating any harmful development between 2006 and 2015. On the contrary, we found evidence for gaps closing in and gap locations becoming more random whilst the canopy cover increased between the two survey years.

TI  - An Investigation of Railway Fastener Detection Using Image Processing and Augmented Deep Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The rail fastening system forms an indispensable part of the rail tracks and needs to be periodically inspected to ensure safe, reliable and sustainable rail operations. Automated visual inspection has gained significant importance for fastener inspection in recent years. Position accuracy, robustness, and practical limitations due to the complex environment are some of the major concerns associated with this method. This study investigates the combined use of image processing and deep learning algorithms for detecting missing clamps within a rail fastening system. The images used for this study was acquired during field inspections carried out along the Borlange-Avesta line in Sweden. The image processing techniques proposed in this study enabled the improvement of the fastener position and removal of redundant information from the fastener images. In addition, image augmentation was carried out to enhance the data set, ensure experimental reliability and replicate practical challenges associated with such visual inspection. Convolutional neural network and ResNet-50 algorithms are used for classification purposes, and both the algorithms achieved over 98% accuracy during training and validation and over 94% accuracy during the test stage. Both the algorithms also maintained a good balance between the precision and recall scores during the test stage. CNN and ResNet-50 algorithms were also tested to analyse their performances when the clamp areas were covered. CNN was able to accurately predict the fastener state up to 70% of clamp area occlusion, and ResNet-50 was able to achieve accurate predictions up to 75% of clamp area occlusion.

TI  - A User-Centric Design Approach to Understand International Education in the Contemporary World: Motivations and Gender Preferences for Studying in Europe
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION
AB  - Education holds promise as a vehicle for sustainable global development and human capacity development, as reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations. International education has become a prominent feature in contemporary times on the educational landscape as students become increasingly mobile in pursuit of their right to education. This study investigates the key factors that motivate international students to undertake better quality education at higher education (university) level, particularly in Europe, and the underlying gender preferences for study destinations within the framework of push-pull factors. The study collected responses of 288 individuals from 84 countries who had undertaken some form of education in Europe through the European Commission-funded Erasmus Mundus (EM) Scholarship. Responses were collected through an online platform, Survey Monkey. Outcomes of the study revealed that Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden, Netherlands, and Spain are the most popular destinations for pursuing higher education in Europe. The United Kingdom is the most preferred destination for female students while Germany is the most preferred destination for male students, with slight changes for other countries. Key motivating factors for international education were found to be scholarship opportunity, better quality of education, and availability of the relevant study program. The least influencing factors were found to be the commonality of language, suitable environment (eg climate, temperature), geographical proximity, the scope of migration, and social cost.

TI  - Variation in symbiotic N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates among <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Biological nitrogen (N) fixation is an important process supporting primary production in ecosystems, especially in those where N availability is limiting growth, such as peatlands and boreal forests. In many peatlands, peat mosses (genus Sphagnum) are the prime ecosystem engineers, and like feather mosses in boreal forests, they are associated with a diverse community of diazotrophs (N-2-fixing microorganisms) that live in and on their tissue. The large variation in N-2 fixation rates reported in literature remains, however, to be explained. To assess the potential roles of habitat (including nutrient concentration) and species traits (in particular litter decomposability and photosynthetic capacity) on the variability in N-2 fixation rates, we compared rates associated with various Sphagnum moss species in a bog, the surrounding forest and a fen in Sweden. We found appreciable variation in N-2 fixation rates among moss species and habitats, and showed that both species and habitat conditions strongly influenced N-2 fixation. We here show that higher decomposition rates, as explained by lower levels of decomposition-inhibiting compounds, and higher phosphorous (P) levels, are related with higher diazotrophic activity. Combining our findings with those of other studies, we propose a conceptual model in which both species-specific traits of mosses (as related to the trade-off between rapid photosynthesis and resistance to decomposition) and P availability, explain N-2 fixation rates. This is expected to result in a tight coupling between P and N cycling in peatlands.

TI  - Genetic signatures of natural selection in response to air pollution in red spruce (<i>Picea rubens</i>, Pinaceae)
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - One of the most important drivers of local adaptation for forest trees is climate. Coupled to these patterns, however, are human-induced disturbances through habitat modification and pollution. The confounded effects of climate and disturbance have rarely been investigated with regard to selective pressure on forest trees. Here, we have developed and used a population genetic approach to search for signals of selection within a set of 36 candidate genes chosen for their putative effects on adaptation to climate and human-induced air pollution within five populations of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), distributed across its natural range and air pollution gradient in eastern North America. Specifically, we used F-ST outlier and environmental correlation analyses to highlight a set of seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were overly correlated with climate and levels of sulphate pollution after correcting for the confounding effects of population history. Use of three age cohorts within each population allowed the effects of climate and pollution to be separated temporally, as climate-related SNPs (n=7) showed the strongest signals in the oldest cohort, while pollution-related SNPs (n=3) showed the strongest signals in the youngest cohorts. These results highlight the usefulness of population genetic scans for the identification of putatively nonneutral evolution within genomes of nonmodel forest tree species, but also highlight the need for the development and application of robust methodologies to deal with the inherent multivariate nature of the genetic and ecological data used in these types of analyses.

TI  - Development of a wood damage monitoring system for mechanized harvesting
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
AB  - Cut-to-length harvesting is a cost-efficient method of the wood supply chain. However, it risks causing stem damage in the mechanized process of thinning forest stands, thereby reducing the growth and technical quality of the remaining trees, which would then be exposed on the increased vulnerability to fungal diseases. For these reasons, it is critical to support quality monitoring of harvesting machines. One way to support quality monitoring is through the application of machine vision solutions. In this study, the damaged stems were photographed systematically from a strip road. The success of the stem-damage detection was analyzed to determine the relationships between successful detection, stand condition, and the image-processing technique. Statistically meaningful relationships were identified via logistic regression analysis, which can be used in selection of tailored image processing technique. The study indicated that the quality-monitoring system of mechanized harvesting could be improved by an increased focus on developing the multi-view photogrammetry of stem damages according to different stand conditions. Further, refining the machine learning system would support the need to determine accurate image-processing thresholds of the texture of stem damages. Then, the overall proportion of successful stem-damage detections will be 89%. These improvements of the quality monitoring system will provide the efficient thinning process in the sustainable wood supply from forests to forest industry. The implementation of such a system could be much broader, initially under Nordic conditions and then in other countries as well, given that its development takes into considerations the significant calibration factors of local conditions.

TI  - The foraging ecology of invasive black rats (<i>Rattus rattus</i>) differs in two nearby islands in a dry tropical archipelago in Brazil
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB  - Invasive predators on islands impact organisms they consume and lead to cascading effects that disrupt ecosystem functioning. Black rats (Rattus rattus) are a prevalent threat on tropical islands. Here, we used stable isotopes to reveal patterns in the foraging ecology of black rats (n =43) on two tropical islands in the Abrolhos archipelago, southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Contrary to our predictions, rats from the smaller island (3 ha), with greater seabird density, relied more on terrestrial resources than rats from the larger (31 ha) island, which were highly dependent (similar to 50% of diet) on seabird resources. We attribute this finding to varying levels of spatial segregation among habitats between the islands. On the smaller island, only rats sampled inside the colony had a high contribution from seabirds, while those sampled outside the colony had their foraging apparently constrained within the small patch of grassland habitat. On the larger island, however, individuals consumed seabird resources regardless of the sampling area, although the sampling locations were farer apart, suggesting lower spatial segregation. A greater foraging segregation in the smaller island could be related to a higher population density of rats, increasing competition and territoriality. Rats inside seabird colonies were larger and heavier than in grassland areas, likely by having access to marine-derived resources, suggesting these individuals could defend their prime foraging territory against others. Our results highlight the capacity of black rats to rely either on marine or terrestrial resources on tropical islands, providing population resilience for this island invader.

TI  - Impact of excess NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from diesel cars on air quality, public health and eutrophication in Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB  - Diesel cars have been emitting four to seven times more NOx in on-road driving than in type approval tests. These 'excess emissions' are a consequence of deliberate design of the vehicle's after-treatment system, as investigations during the 'Dieselgate' scandal have revealed. Here we calculate health and environmental impacts of these excess NOx emissions in all European countries for the year 2013. We use national emissions reported officially under the UNECE Convention for Long-range Transport of Atmospheric Pollutants and employ the EMEP MSC-W Chemistry Transport Model and the GAINS Integrated AssessmentModel to determine atmospheric concentrations and resulting impacts. We compare with impacts from hypothetical emissions where light duty diesel vehicles are assumed to emit only as much as their respective type approval limit value or as little as petrol cars of the same age. Excess NO2 concentrations can also have direct health impacts, but these overlap with the impacts from particulate matter ( PM) and are not included here. We estimate that almost 10 000 premature deaths from PM2.5 and ozone in the adult population (age>30 years) can be attributed to the NOx emissions from diesel cars and light commercial vehicles in EU28 plus Norway and Switzerland in 2013. About 50% of these could have been avoided if diesel limits had been achieved also in on-road driving; and had diesel cars emitted as little NOx as petrol cars, 80% of these premature deaths could have been avoided. Ecosystem eutrophication impacts (critical load exceedances) from the same diesel vehicles would also have been reduced at similar rates as for the health effects.

TI  - Adaptation to local climate in multi-trait space: evidence from silver fir (<i>Abies</i> <i>alba</i> Mill.) populations across a heterogeneous environment
T2  - HEREDITY
AB  - Heterogeneous environments, such as mountainous landscapes, create spatially varying selection pressure that potentially affects several traits simultaneously across different life stages, yet little is known about the general patterns and drivers of adaptation in such complex settings. We studied silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) populations across Switzerland and characterized its mountainous landscape using downscaled historical climate data. We sampled 387 trees from 19 populations and genotyped them at 374 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to estimate their demographic distances. Seedling morphology, growth and phenology traits were recorded in a common garden, and a proxy for water use efficiency was estimated for adult trees. We tested whether populations have more strongly diverged at quantitative traits than expected based on genetic drift alone in a multi-trait framework, and identified potential environmental drivers of selection. We found two main responses to selection: (i) populations from warmer and more thermally stable locations have evolved towards a taller stature, and (ii) the growth timing of populations evolved towards two extreme strategies, 'start early and grow slowly' or 'start late and grow fast', driven by precipitation seasonality. Populations following the 'start early and grow slowly' strategy had higher water use efficiency and came from inner Alpine valleys characterized by pronounced summer droughts. Our results suggest that contrasting adaptive life-history strategies exist in silver fir across different life stages (seedling to adult), and that some of the characterized populations may provide suitable seed sources for tree growth under future climatic conditions.

TI  - Which Are the Best Site and Stand Conditions for Silver Fir (<i>Abies alba</i> Mill.) Located in the Carpathian Mountains?
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
AB  - Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is one of the most valuable and productive tree species across European mountains, that accomplish multiple economic, protective and ecologic functions. Alongside spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir is a characteristic species for the Romanian Carpathians. Although silver fir tree is recommended for the diversification of forests in order to increase the resistance to climate change, it is very sensitive to climatic excesses, especially those that proceed rapidly. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate both the environmental conditions and stand characteristics of fir from five mountain ranges of the Romanian Carpathians. The study is based on data recorded over a period of 10 years (1990-2000). As such, a total of 77,251 stands that occupy 211,954 hectares have been investigated in regard to silver fir behaviour. MATLAB scripts were used for analysing consistent data volumes as well as the impact of eight factors on the silver fir productivity (altitude, field aspect, field slope, soil type, participation percentage, road distance, structure and consistency). Our analysis has revealed that higher silver fir productivity is found at altitudes of up to 1200 m, on mid and upper slopes, on NW field aspects, on eutric cambisols and dystric cambisols, with a 10-20% participation in stand composition and in relatively-even aged stands with a full consistency. This study offers valuable insights for forest managers that require comprehensive information in adopting effective strategies to enhance forest resilience under climate change.

TI  - Status assessment of Eurasian lynx in Latvia linking genetics and demography-a growing population or a source-sink process?
T2  - MAMMAL RESEARCH
AB  - The Eurasian lynx is managed as a game species in Latvia. A variety of demographic parameters were used to assess the current status of the Latvian lynx population and recruitment after annual harvest. Population age-gender structure and female prenatal fecundity were determined in 530 legally hunted animals over a 9-year period. Average prenatal fecundity was 3.2 +/- 0.1, and evidence of reproduction was found in 87 % of the examined adult females. We found a disproportionally low number of 1- and 2-year-old lynx in the hunting bags and therefore constructed an age-gender pyramid, adjusting the survival curves to the proportions of the remaining age classes. Two hundred and eighty-eight tissue samples were analysed using 12 autosomal microsatellite loci. Groups of related individuals were identified using a group approach and supported by pairwise relationship analysis. Thirteen potential maternal-offspring relationship groups and 30 related groups of lynx individuals based on potential full-sib and half-sib relationships between the individuals within the research period were identified. Evidence from this study shows that the population is not only stable but also likely growing and that there currently appear to be no barriers preventing gene flow. We can conclude that, in general, the lynx population was sustainably maintained. The previous harvest intensity has not obstructed the conservation aim for lynx in Latvia, which is to maintain the population as stable or growing. Combining demographic and molecular analyses, this study reveals relevant reference indices that can be used in future monitoring of the lynx population in Latvia.

TI  - Demographic consequences of harvesting: a case study from a small and isolated moose population
T2  - CLIMATE RESEARCH
AB  - Harvesting can have a substantial impact on population dynamics and individual performance in wild populations. While the direct consequences of harvest on individual survival and population growth rate are often apparent, harvesting can also have indirect and more subtle demographic consequences. Disentangling these consequences, however, requires in-depth knowledge of individual life histories of both females and males in the population. Here, we summarise demographic research on a population where such data exist: the Vega moose population in northern Norway. In this population, vital rates vary considerably among both females and males, and harvesting increases this variation by generating positive covariation between reproductive performance and survival. The skewed age and sex structure, which is typical of many harvested populations, also has demographic consequences: it reduces the ratio of effective to total population size and influences variation in vital rates in males and females. The moose harvest at Vega is structured by age- and sex-specific quotas, but it is not intentionally selective regarding size or other phenotypic characteristics. Still, harvest selection for earlier birth rates and larger calves was apparent, likely due to habitat-performance relationships and habitat-specific harvest mortality. Together, the bulk of research on this population shows that harvesting impacts population demography through many different pathways, with some being more subtle than others. These complex pathways influence the demographic variance and affect stochastic processes such as population growth, genetic drift, and rates of evolutionary change, and they must therefore be acknowledged in management plans to achieve sustainable harvesting.

TI  - Shallow-Water Habitat Mapping using Underwater Hyperspectral Imaging from an Unmanned Surface Vehicle: A Pilot Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
AB  - The impacts of human activity on coastal ecosystems are becoming increasingly evident across the world. Consequently, there is a growing need to map, monitor, and manage these regions in a sustainable manner. In this pilot study, we present what we believe to be a novel mapping technique for shallow-water seafloor habitats: Underwater hyperspectral imaging (UHI) from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV). A USV-based UHI survey was carried out in a sheltered bay close to Trondheim, Norway. In the survey, an area of 176 m(2) was covered, and the depth of the surveyed area was approximately 1.5 m. UHI data were initially recorded at a 1-nm spectral resolution within the range of 380-800 nm, but this was reduced to 86 spectral bands between 400-700 nm (3.5-nm spectral resolution) during post-processing. The hyperspectral image acquisition was synchronized with navigation data from the USV, which permitted georeferencing and mosaicking of the imagery at a 0.5-cm spatial resolution. Six spectral classes, including coralline algae, the wrack Fucus serratus, green algal films, and invertebrates, were identified in the georeferenced imagery, and chosen as targets for support vector machine (SVM) classification. Based on confusion matrix analyses, the overall classification accuracy was estimated to be 89%-91%, which suggests that USV-based UHI may serve as a useful tool for high-resolution mapping of shallow-water habitats in the future.

TI  - Overruled by nature: A plastic response to environmental change disconnects a gene and its trait
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
AB  - In Atlantic salmon, age at maturation is a life history trait governed by a sex-specific trade-off between reproductive success and survival. Following environmental changes across large areas of the Northeast Atlantic, many populations currently display smaller size at age and higher age at maturation. However, whether these changes reflect rapid evolution or plasticity is unknown. Approximately 1500 historical and contemporary salmon from the river Etne in Western Norway, genotyped at 50,000 SNPs, revealed three loci associated with age at maturation. These included vgll3 and six6 which collectively explained 36%-50% of the age at maturation variation in the 1983-1984 period. These two loci also displayed sex-specific epistasis, as the effect of six6 was only detected in males bearing two copies of the late maturation allele for vgll3. Strikingly, despite allelic frequencies at vgll3 remaining unchanged, the combined influence of these genes was nearly absent in all samples from 2013 to 2016, and genome-wide heritability strongly declined between the two time-points. The difference in age at maturation between males and females was upheld in the population despite the loss of effect from the candidate loci, which strongly points towards additional causative mechanisms resolving the sexual conflict. Finally, because admixture with farmed escaped salmon was excluded as the origin of the observed disconnection between gene(s) and maturation age, we conclude that the environmental changes observed in the North Atlantic during the past decades have led to bypassing of the influence of vgll3 and six6 on maturation through growth-driven plasticity.

TI  - Climate change and perishable food hoards of an avian predator: Is the freezer still working?
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
AB  - Changing climate can modify predator-prey interactions and induce declines or local extinctions of species due to reductions in food availability. Species hoarding perishable food for overwinter survival, like predators, are predicted to be particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures. We analysed the influence of autumn and winter weather, and abundance of main prey (voles), on the food-hoarding behaviour of a generalist predator, the Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), across 16 years in Finland. Fewer freeze-thaw events in early autumn delayed the initiation of food hoarding. Pygmy owls consumed more hoarded food with more frequent freeze-thaw events and deeper snow cover in autumn and in winter, and lower precipitation in winter. In autumn, the rotting of food hoards increased with precipitation. Hoards already present in early autumn were much more likely to rot than the ones initiated in late autumn. Rotten food hoards were used more in years of low food abundance than in years of high food abundance. Having rotten food hoards in autumn resulted in a lower future recapture probability of female owls. These results indicate that pygmy owls might be partly able to adapt to climate change by delaying food hoarding, but changes in the snow cover, precipitation and frequency of freeze-thaw events might impair their foraging and ultimately decrease local overwinter survival. Long-term trends and future predictions, therefore, suggest that impacts of climate change on wintering food-hoarding species could be substantial, because their 'freezers' may no longer work properly. Altered usability and poorer quality of hoarded food may further modify the foraging needs of food-hoarding predators and thus their overall predation pressure on prey species. This raises concerns about the impacts of climate change on boreal food webs, in which ecological interactions have evolved under cold winter conditions.

TI  - One way or another: predictors of wolf poaching in a legally harvested wolf population
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Poaching is a major threat to large predator populations, but the predictors of poaching are poorly mapped in developed countries where illegal killing is motivated by social reasons. Poaching can be common although the species is legally hunted, such as in the case of the wolf (Canis lupus). Our goal was to identify crucial motives of poaching to find possible solutions to the ongoing wolf conflict. We studied predictors of poaching on two spatial scales - countrywide (76 wolves) and territory [30 Global Positioning System (GPS)-wolves] - during 2001-2016 in Finland. The countrywide factors predicting illegal kill were as follows: (1) lifestage, with adult wolves showing a remarkably high probability of being illegally killed in comparison with juveniles; (2) the number of wolves killed legally in the local scale, that is, licensed wolf hunting at the local scale decreased the likelihood of illegal killing, as did the total number of legally hunted wolves; (3) total legal bag in the whole country; and (4) density of the local human population, that is, low human density increased the probability of illegal kill. For breeding adult GPS-collared wolves at the territory level, there was a positive relationship between the tendency to cross roads and likelihood of being illegally killed. Our results provided evidence that poaching is a matter of local intolerance toward wolves and that the problem is mainly related to wolf hunting. Legal hunting might decrease poaching, but seems inefficient as a long-term solution. To maintain a viable wolf population, the poaching risk of breeding adults should be decreased. Predicted poaching probabilities could be used to tackle poaching in a preventive manner by involving both decision makers and local residents in anti-poaching actions.

TI  - Interstanding the industrial district:: contrasting conceptual images as a road to insight
T2  - ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT
AB  - In this paper we offer an approach to learning about the unique features of industrial districts as a socio-economic phenomenon that is based on differences. Instead of searching for one generic theory that may explain the unique construction of an industrial district or one universal way of getting under the skin of its subjects we propose 'interstanding' as a road to insight. The title alludes to different relationships: between theoretical frameworks and empirical approaches, between writing and reflecting on the one hand, creating conversations, talking and listening on the other, between teacher and student, between the academic and business communities. In the paper this 'interstanding' perspective of knowledging is demonstrated in the context of an annual international doctoral course on SMEs in economic and regional development. The participating doctoral students are organized into research teams, each furnished with a specific theoretical perspective on localized economic development, and subsequently jointly brought to the industrial district of Gnosjo in Sweden in order to meet with owner-managers and further local stakeholders. The student groups report on their field experiences, thereby creating maps as diverse as the different theoretical frameworks being used. These contrasting images of the district's generic features and sustainability are used as an input to a conclusive polylogue seminar that offers an 'interstanding' that, on the one hand, reminds the participants that any, including scientifically investigated, reality is socially constructed, and, on the other, communicates that tensions between alternative conceptual constructs, especially if substantiated in empirical research, offer an inspiring road to knowledge.

TI  - Hunting promotes sexual conflict in brown bears
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
AB  - 1. The removal of individuals through hunting can destabilize social structure, potentially affecting population dynamics. Although previous studies have shown that hunting can indirectly reduce juvenile survival through increased sexually selected infanticide (SSI), very little is known about the spatiotemporal effects of male hunting on juvenile survival.
   2. Using detailed individual monitoring of a hunted population of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Sweden (1991-2011), we assessed the spatiotemporal effect of male removal on cub survival.
   3. We modelled cub survival before, during and after the mating season. We used three proxies to evaluate spatial and temporal variation in male turnover; distance and timing of the closest male killed and number of males that died around a female's home range centre.
   4. Male removal decreased cub survival only during the mating season, as expected in seasonal breeders with SSI. Cub survival increased with distance to the closest male killed within the previous 1.5 years, and it was lower when the closest male killed was removed 1.5 instead of 0.5 year earlier. We did not detect an effect of the number of males killed.
   5. Our results support the hypothesis that social restructuring due to hunting can reduce recruitment and suggest that the distribution of the male deaths might be more important than the overall number of males that die. As the removal of individuals through hunting is typically not homogenously distributed across the landscape, spatial heterogeneity in hunting pressure may cause source-sink dynamics, with lower recruitment in areas of high human-induced mortality.

TI  - Intraspecific variation influences performance of moss transplants along microclimate gradients
T2  - ECOLOGY
AB  - Identifying the environmental drivers of population dynamics is crucial to predict changes in species abundances and distributions under climate change. Populations of the same species might differ in their responses as a result of intraspecific variation. Yet the importance of such differences remains largely unexplored. We examined the responses of latitudinally distant populations of the forest moss Hylocomiastrum umbratum along microclimate gradients in Sweden. We transplanted moss mats from southern and northern populations to 30 sites with contrasting microclimates (i.e., replicated field common gardens) within a forest landscape, and recorded growth and survival of individual shoots over 3 yr. To evaluate the importance of intraspecific variation in responses to environmental factors, we assessed effects of the interactions between population origin and microclimate drivers on growth and survival. Effects on overall performance of transplanted populations were estimated using the product of survival and growth. We found differences between southern and northern populations in the response to summer temperature and snowmelt date in one of three yearly transitions. In this year, southern populations performed better in warm, southern-like conditions than in cold, northern-like conditions; and the reverse pattern was true for northern populations. Survival of all populations decreased with evaporation, consistent with the high hydric demands and poikilohydric nature of mosses. Our results are consistent with population adaptation to local climate, and suggest that intraspecific variation among populations can have important effects on the response of species to microclimate drivers. These findings highlight the need to account for differential responses in predictions of species abundance and distribution under climate change.

TI  - Do headwater lakes moderate downstream temperature response to forest harvesting? Illustrating opportunities and obstacles associated with virtual experiments
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
AB  - There are concerns that environmental changes, such as climate variability and forest harvesting, are altering stream thermal regimes and impacting aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies have suggested that the abundant headwater lakes found in northern landscapes may moderate downstream temperature response to forest harvesting. We investigated this hypothesis using a virtual experimental approach based on detailed field measurements made at boreal catchments in northern Sweden coupled with a process-based stream temperature model. We simulated streamside harvesting for stream reaches with and without a headwater lake. Mean daily summer stream temperature response to harvesting was generally between 0.5 and 1.5 degrees C higher for the stream without a lake than for the stream with a lake. However, during rain events the stream with the lake showed a greater stream temperature response than the stream without a lake. Headwater lakes typically store and delay runoff from rain events, augment baseflow, and have elevated outflow temperatures. These differences in upstream boundary conditions, in terms of flow and water temperature, were the key drivers for the contrasting harvest responses between streams with and without headwater lakes. These findings were generally consistent across different harvesting scenarios; however, uncertainty in the hyporheic term and post-harvest microclimate conditions influenced the simulated magnitude of post-harvest stream temperature response. Our study highlights the utility of virtual experiments for gaining insight on systems understanding but caution is needed when using models for predictions outside the conditions for which models are calibrated.

TI  - Linking species, traits and habitat characteristics of Collembola at European scale
T2  - SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Although much work has been done on factors which influence the patterning of species and species trait assemblages in a variety of groups such as plants, vertebrates and invertebrates, few studies have been realized at a broad geographic scale. We analyzed patterns of relationships between species, species trait distribution/assembly, and environmental variables from the west of Europe to Slovakia, Poland and Sweden. We created a database by compiling traits and occurrence data of European collembolan species, using literature and personal field studies embracing a large range of environmental gradients (vertical stratification, habitat closure, humus form, soil acidity and moisture, temperature, rainfall, altitude) over which Collembola are supposed to be distributed. Occurrences of the 58 best-documented species, environmental variables and species traits allowed us to (i) show which environmental variables impact the distribution of the 58 species at broad scale and (ii) document to what extent environmental variables and species trait assemblages are related and which trends could be found in trait/environment relationships. The impact of vertical stratification, habitat closure, humus form, soil acidity, soil moisture, temperature, and to a lesser extent rainfall and altitude on species distribution, firstly revealed by indirect gradient analysis (correspondence analysis, CA), was further shown to be significant by direct gradient analysis (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA). RLQ analyses were performed to find linear combination of variables of table R (environmental variables) and linear combinations of the variables of table Q (species traits) of maximum covariance weighted by species occurrence data contained in table L. RLQ followed by permutation tests showed that all tested environmental variables apparently contributed significantly to the assemblages of the twelve species traits studied. A convergence was observed between traits related to vertical stratification and those related to habitat closure/aperture. Well-developed locomotory organs (furcula, legs), presence of sensorial organs sensitive to air movements and light (e.g. trichobothria and eye spots), spherical body, large body size, pigmentation (UV protection and signaling) and sexual reproduction largely occur in epigeic and open habitats, while most of woodland and edaphic habitats are characterized by short locomotory appendages, small body size, high number of defense organs (pseudocelli), presence of post-antennal organs and parthenogenesis. Climate and especially temperature exert an effect on the assemblage of traits that are mostly present above-ground and in open habitats. The contribution of combinations of some environmental variables to the occurrence of each species trait was tested by linear, logistic or multinomial regression (Generalized Linear Models). Vertical stratification, followed by temperature, played a dominant role in the variation of the twelve studied traits. Relationships between traits and environment tested here shows that it is possible to use some traits as proxies to identify potential ecological preferences or tolerances of invertebrate species. However, a significant part of species distribution remained unexplained, probably partly because some traits, like ecophysiological ones, or traits involved in biotic interactions (e.g. competition) were unavailable. The present work is thus a first step towards the creation of models predicting changes in collembolan communities.
   Further studies are required to inform ecophysiological traits, in order to complete such models. Moreover the niche width of species will have to be determined. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Phylogeography, historical demography and postglacial colonization routes of two amphi-Atlantic distributed amphipods
T2  - SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY
AB  - To evaluate the influence of the ice ages on patterns of genetic diversity and to test generally accepted perspectives related to glacial refugia and proposed post-glacial colonization pathways in the North Atlantic area, we sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of two amphi-Atlantic distributed amphipods, Gammarus duebeni (n = 418) and Gammarus oceanicus (n = 242). Both species showed several populations with a combination of highly reduced levels of genetic diversity and significant demographic expansion in previously glaciated sites, consistent with an expected extinction and recolonization scenario. Within G. oceanicus, two reciprocally monophyletic clades were found. One clade consisted of the specimens from populations of the American St. Lawrence River and two populations south of it. The other clade included specimens from populations of Europe, Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard, as well as from the Hudson Bay. For G. duebeni, we found no private American haplotypes, and post-glacial colonization from two founder populations is likely. A fixed genetic discontinuity was observed in both species between Iceland and Greenland on the one hand and Europe on the other hand. Our data hence indicate that the proposed postglacial colonization of America from Europe via the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland could be more complex than previously thought and that parts of the North Atlantic region were not colonized from the Eastern Atlantic coasts. Unlike other studies, we speculate that there must be a Nordic glacial refugium for both species, which could be located in Greenland. The Greenlandic populations of both species exhibited private haplotypes, but signals of demographic expansion, conflicting with our theory. It is possible that the refugial character of the Greenlandic populations was erased by the LGM. Furthermore, we found evidence for glacial refugia along the Norwegian coast, the English Channel (G. duebeni) and on the Faroe Islands (G. oceanicus).

TI  - Research on multimorbidity in primary care. Selected abstracts from the EGPRN meeting in Tampere, Finland, 9-12 May 2019 All abstracts of the conference can be found at the EGPRN website: www.egprn.org/page/conference-abstracts
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
AB  - Current primary care in Finland is based on the Primary Health Care Act (1972), which addressed numerous new tasks to all municipalities. All of them had to find a new health centre organization, which provides a wide range of health services, including prevention and public health promotion. Multiple tasks require multiprofessional staff, and thus, the Finnish health centre personnel consisted not only of GPs but of public health nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, psychologists, social workers, dentists, etc. During the next decade, there have been some changes but the idea of multiprofessional structure has remained. According to the QUALICOPC study (2012) Finnish GPs are still co-located with several other healthcare professionals compared to most of the European countries; even compared to other Nordic countries which otherwise have many similarities in their primary healthcare. During the last 10 or 15 years, healthcare providers and researchers have recognized a new challenge: our current systems do not meet the needs of patients with multiple health and social problems-and the proportion of these patients is increasing all the time as the population is getting older. One could suppose that preconditions of handling multimorbidity would be excellent in multiprofessional surroundings like ours, but actually, a person with multiple problems is a challenge there, too. Multiprofessional organization in primary care does not guarantee proper care of patients with multiple diseases, if we do not acknowledge the challenge and revise our systems. We have to develop new ways of collaboration and new models of integrated care. The problematic part is secondary care, which is organized with logic of one medical speciality per visit. In Tampere University Hospital district, we have created a care pathway model, which defines the roles of primary healthcare and secondary care. Nationwide, we have recently started to prepare national guidelines for the care of patients with multimorbidity. What we need more in the future is more research on new practices and models.
   Background: Most patients with antihypertensive medication do not achieve their blood pressure (BP) target. Several barriers to successful hypertension treatment are well identified but we need novel ways of addressing them. Research question: Can using a checklist improve the quality of care in the initiation of new antihypertensive medication? Methods: This non-blinded, cluster-randomized, controlled study was conducted in eight primary care study centres in central Finland, randomized to function as either intervention (n = 4) or control sites (n = 4). We included patients aged 30-75 years who were prescribed antihypertensive medication for the first time. Initiation of medication in the intervention group was carried out with a nine-item checklist, filled in together by the treating physician and the patient. The treating physician managed hypertension treatment in the control group without a study-specific protocol. Results: In total, 119 patients were included in the study, of which 118 were included in the analysis (n = 59 in the control group, n = 59 in the intervention group). When initiating medication, an adequate BP target was set for 19% of the patients in the control group and for 68% in the intervention group. Shortly after the appointment, only 14% of the patients in the control group were able to remember the adequate BP target, compared with 32% in the intervention group. The use of the checklist was also related to more regular agreement on the next follow-up appointment (64% in the control group vs 95% in the intervention group). Conclusion: Even highly motivated new hypertensive patients in Finnish primary care have significant gaps in their treatment-related skills. The use of a checklist for initiation of antihypertensive medication was related to substantial improvement in these skills. Based on our findings, the use of a checklist might be a practical tool for clinicians initiating new antihypertensive medications.
   Background: Immediate feedback is underused in the French medical education curriculum, specifically with video-recorded consultation. Research question: The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the interest in this teaching method as a training and assessment tool in the learning process of general practitioner (GP) trainees. Methods: During the period November 2017 to October 2018, trainees in ambulatory training courses collected quantitative data about recording consultations with a video camera: numbers of recordings, feedback, patients' participation refusals, and information about the learning process and competencies. The trainees' level of satisfaction was measured by means of a questionnaire at the end of their traineeship. Results: Sixty-seven trainees were recruited and 44 of them 65.7% actively participated in the study; 607 video recordings and 243 feedback with trainers were performed. Few patients (18.5%) refused the video-recording. Most trainees considered video recording with immediate feedback to be a relevant learning tool. It made it possible for the participants to observe their difficulties and their achievements. 'Relation, communication, patient-centred care' was the most built competency, non-verbal communication, in particular. Time was the main limiting factor of this teaching method. Most trainees were in favour of its generalization in their university course. Conclusion: Video recording with immediate feedback in real-time consultation needs to be adapted to training areas and depends on time and logistics. This teaching method seems to be useful in the development of communication skills. It could lift the barriers of the trainer's physical presence near GP trainees during immediate feedback in real-time consultation. It could help trainees to build their competencies while enhancing the place of immediate feedback in the general practice curriculum. It could also constitute an additional tool for the certification of GP trainees.
   Background: Perinatal depression has been associated with psychiatric morbidity in mothers and their offspring. This study assessed the prevalence of perinatal depressive symptoms in a large population of women and investigated associations of these symptoms with demographic and clinical factors. Research question: Which factors (including sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test) are associated with perinatal depression? Methods: All members of Maccabi Health Services who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) during 2015-2016 were included in the study. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for associations of sociodemographic, medical, lifestyle, and laboratory test factors with perinatal depressive symptoms, according to a score >10 on the EPDS. Results: Of 27 912 women who filled the EPDS, 2029 (7.3%) were classified as having peripartum depression. In a logistic regression analysis, the use of antidepressant medications, particularly for a period greater than three months, Arab background, current or past smoking, a diagnosis of chronic diabetes and age under 25 years were all associated with increased ORs for perinatal depression; while Orthodox Jewish affiliation, residence in the periphery and higher haemoglobin level were associated with lower ORs. Incidences of depression were 17.4% in women with a history of antidepressant medication, 16% among women with diabetes, and 11.8% among current smokers. Conclusion: Several demographic, medical, and lifetime factors were found to be substantially more prevalent among women with symptoms of perinatal depression than those without. Encouraging women to complete the EPDS during and following pregnancy may help identify women in need of support.
   Background: Regulating the quality and effectiveness of the work of general practitioners is essential for a sound healthcare system. In the Republic of Macedonia this is regulated by the Health Insurance Fund through a system of penalties/sanctions. Research question: The goal of this study is to evaluate the types and effectiveness of the sanctions used on primary care practitioners. Methods: This is a quantitative research study for which we used an anonymous survey with 18 questions. This survey was distributed to 443 randomly selected general practitioners from different parts of Macedonia and 438 of them responded. For the quantitative data, we used the Pearson's chi-squared test, correlation and descriptive statistics. Part of the survey is qualitative, consisting of comments and opinions of the general practitioners. Results: From the participants, 336 were female and 102 were male. The doctors' gender was not associated with sanctioning. Most general practitioners were in the age categories of 30-39 and 40-49 years. The participants' age had a significant influence on sanctioning-older doctors were sanctioned more frequently. Out of 438 participants, 33.3% were specialists in family medicine and 66.7% general practitioners. Specialists in family medicine were sanctioned significantly more frequently than general practitioners. Doctors that worked in the hospital or 19 km from the nearest hospital were significantly more frequently sanctioned. The three most common reasons for sanctions were financial consumption of prescriptions and referrals above the agreed amount, higher rate of sick leaves and/or justification of sick leaves and unrealized preventative goals or education. 'Financial sanction by scale' was the most common type of sanction: 49.8% of participants. Doctors who followed the guidelines, but who were exposed to violence were sanctioned significantly more frequently. Conclusion: We can observe that age, speciality, the distance of the workplace from the nearest hospital and violence influence sanctioning.
   Background: Biases are major barriers to external validity of studies, reducing evidence. Among these biases, the definition and the reality of the Hawthorne effect (HE) (or observation bias) remains controversial. According to McCambridge in a review from 2013, the Hawthorne effect is a behaviour change occurring when the subject is being observed during a scientific study. This effect would be multifactorial, and he suggests the term 'effects of research participation.' However, the reviewed studies were conflicting and evidence is sparse. Research question: We updated McCambridge's review to actualize the definition of the HE. Methods: McCambridge's most recent article dated back to January 3, 2012. We focused on the articles published between January 1, 2012 and August 10, 2018 searching Medline. We used the sole keyword 'Hawthorne Effect.' The search was filtered based on the dates, the availability of an abstract and the languages English and French. We included articles defining or evaluating the HE. Articles citing the effect without defining it or irrelevant to the topic were excluded. Two independent readers searched and analysed the articles. Discrepancies were solved by consensus. Results: Out of 106 articles, 42 articles were included. All the articles acknowledged an observation bias, considered as significant or not, depending on the population (education, literacy), the methods and the variable of interest. It was a psychological change, limited in time. The HE was defined as a change of behaviour related to direct or indirect observation of the subjects or the investigators, to their previous selection and commitment in the study (written agreement) and to social desirability. Despite observations, articles were conflicting. Some do confirm the existence of the HE, others deny it. Meta-analysis is ongoing. Conclusion: No formal consensus regarding the definition of the effect has been reached so far. However, the authors agree on its implication as an experimental artefact.
   Background: Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are on the rise. Consequently, general practitioners (GPs) treat an increasing number of multimorbid patients with polypharmacy. To limit negative health outcomes, GPs should search for inappropriate medication intake in such patients. However, systematic medication reviews are time-consuming. Recent eHealth tools, such as the 'systematic tool to reduce inappropriate prescribing' (STRIP) assistant, provide an opportunity for GPs to get support when conducting such medication reviews. Research question: Can the STRIP assistant as electronic decision support help GPs to optimize medication appropriateness in older, multimorbid patients with polypharmacy? Methods: This cluster randomized controlled trial is conducted in 40 Swiss GP practices, each recruiting 8-10 patients aged >= 65 years, with >= 3 chronic conditions and >= 5 chronic medications (320 patients in total). We compare the effectiveness of using the STRIP assistant for optimizing medication appropriateness to usual care. The STRIP assistant is based on the STOPP/START criteria (version 2) and, for this trial, it is implemented in the Swiss eHealth setting where some GPs already share routine medical data from their electronic medical records in a research database (FIRE). Patients are followed-up for 12 months and the change in medication appropriateness is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are the numbers of falls and fractures, quality of life, health economic parameters, patients' willingness to deprescribe as well as implementation barriers and enablers for GPs when using the STRIP assistant. Results: Patient recruitment started in December 2018. This presentation focuses on the study protocol and the challenges faced when testing this new software in Swiss primary care. Conclusion: Finding out whether the STRIP assistant is an effective tool and beneficial for older and multimorbid patients, who are usually excluded from trials, will have an impact on the coordination of chronic care for multimorbid patients in Swiss primary care in this new eHealth environment.
   Background: Workplace violence (WPV) towards healthcare staff is becoming a common problem in different healthcare settings worldwide. Moreover, the prevalence is 16 times higher than in other professions. How often it happened towards young doctors working as general practitioners (GPs) at the beginning of their careers has been rarely studied. Research question: To investigate the frequency and forms of WPV, experienced by the young Croatian GPs from their patients, and violence reporting pattern to the competent institutions. Methods: The cross-sectional study was carried out on 74 GP residents, during their postgraduate study in family medicine in May 2018. A specially designed anonymous questionnaire, developed by Association of Family Physicians of South Eastern Europe, was used to investigate the prevalence and forms of WPV, the narrative description of the traumatic event itself and the process of reporting it. Results: The response rate was 91.9%, female 87%, the median of years working as a GP was 3.5 years. Most of the residents were working in an urban practice (63%), others in the rural and the suburban once (27%, 10%). All GP residents experienced patients' and caregivers' violent behaviour directed towards them. High-intensity violence (e.g. physical violence, sexual harassment) was experienced by 44%, middle intensity (e.g. intimidation, visual sexual harassment) by 84% while all residents experienced verbal violence. Only 13.2% residents reported WPV to the competent institutions. Most of GP residents reported the appearance of the new form of violence: the one over the internet. Conclusion: The high prevalence of all types of violence towards young Croatian doctors is worrisome, as is the fact that violent acts are seldom reported to the competent institutions. Those alarming facts could become a threat to GPs career choosing.
   Background: About 50% of patients adhere to chronic therapy in France. Improving adherence should improve their care. Identifying the patient's difficulties in taking medication is complex for the physician, because there is no gold standard for measuring adherence to medications. How can the general practitioner in his/her practice identify patient compliance? Research question: Analyse studies that develop or validate scales used to estimate adherence in primary care. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from PubMed, the Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases. The search terms used were the MeSH terms (or adapted to the database's vocabulary): questionnaire, compliance and primary care. All articles were retained whatever the language of writing. Selection criteria were: assessment of the development, validation or reliability of one or more compliance scales; taking place in primary care. One reviewer screened titles, which included the term adherence then abstracts and full text. Only articles evaluating the development, validity or reliability of a primary care adherence rating scale were included in analysis. Results: In total 1022 articles were selected and 18 articles were included. Seventeen adherence scales were identified in primary care, most of which targeted a single pathology, especially hypertension. The most cited scale is the MMAS Morisky medication adherence scale. Three scales were developed for patients with multiple chronic diseases. One scale was developed for patients older than 65 years-the Strathclyde compliance risk assessment tool (SCRAT)-and two scales were developed for adult patients whatever their age-the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al., and the DAMS, diagnostic adherence to medication scale. Conclusion: Two scales have been developed and validated in primary care to assess patient adherence with multiple chronic diseases: the DAMS and the instrument developed by Sidorkiewicz et al. A simple, reliable, reproducible primary care scale would assess the impact of actions developed to improve adherence: motivational interviewing, patient therapeutic education, and the ASALeE protocol.
   Background: Multimorbidity prevalence increases with age while declining quality of life (QoL) is one of its major consequences. Research question: The study aims to: (1) Assess the relationship between increasing number of diseases and QoL. (2) Identify the most frequently occurring patterns of diseases and how they relate to QoL. (3) Observe how these associations differ across different European countries and regions. Methods: Cross-sectional data analysis performed on wave six of the population-based survey of health, ageing and retirement in Europe (SHARE) (n = 68 231). Data were collected in 2015 among population 50+ years old in 17 European countries and Israel. Multimorbidity is defined as the co-occurrence of two or more chronic conditions. Conditions were self-declared and identified through an open-end questionnaire containing 17 prelisted conditions plus conditions added by participants. Control, autonomy, self-realization and pleasure questionnaire (CASP-12v) was used to evaluate QoL. Association between increasing number of diseases and QoL was assessed with linear regression. Factor analysis is being conducted to identify patterns of diseases to evaluate their impact on QoL further. Multilevel analysis will take into account differences between countries and regions. Confounding was searched with directed acyclic graph (DAG) method and included age, sex, education, socio-economic status, behavioural habits, social support and healthcare parameters. Results: Participants (49.09%) had two or more diseases. Maximum number of diseases per person was 13, mean number was 1.9. Unadjusted preliminary analysis showed that on average QoL decreases by -1.27 (95%CI: -1.29, -1.24) with each added new condition across Europe. The decline appears to be the steepest in Spain, -1.61 (95%CI: -1.71, -1.51), and the least so in Israel, -0.67 (95%CI: -0.82, -0.52). Conclusion: Ongoing analysis will identify disease patterns, which may have the highest impact on QoL, as well as to elucidate the role of confounders in the relationship between increasing number of diseases and disease patterns with QoL.
   Background: The burden and preventive potential of disease is typically estimated for each non-communicable disease (NCD) separately but NCDs often co-occur, which hampers reliable quantification of their overall burden and joint preventive potential in the population. Research questions: What is the lifetime risk of developing any NCD? Which multimorbidity clusters of NCDs cause the greatest burden? To what extent do three key shared risk factors, namely smoking, hypertension and being overweight, influence this risk, life-expectancy and NCD-multimorbidity? Methods: Between 1990 and 2012 we followed NCD-free participants aged >= 45 years at baseline from the Dutch prospective Rotterdam study for incidents of stroke, heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. We quantified (co-)occurrence and remaining lifetime risk of NCDs in a competing risk framework, and studied the effects of smoking, hypertension, and being overweight on lifetime risk and life expectancy. Results: During follow-up of 9061 participants, 814 participants were diagnosed with stroke, 1571 with heart disease, 625 with diabetes, 1004 with chronic respiratory disease, 1538 with cancer, and 1065 with neurodegenerative disease. Among those, 1563 participants (33.7%) were diagnosed with multiple diseases. The lifetime risk of any NCD from the age of 45 onwards was 94.0% (95%CI: 92.9-95.1) for men and 92.8% (95%CI: 91.8-93.8) for women. Absence of shared risk factors was associated with a 9.0-year delay (95%CI: 6.3-11.6) in the age at onset of any NCD. Furthermore, overall life expectancy for participants without risk factors was 6.0 years (95%CI: 5.7-7.9) longer than those with these risk factors. Participants without these risk factors spent 21.6% of their remaining lifetime with NCDs, compared to 31.8% for those with risk factors. Conclusion: Nine out of 10 individuals aged 45 years and older will develop at least one NCD during their remaining lifetime. A third was diagnosed with multiple NCDs during follow-up. Absence of three common shared risk factors related to compression of morbidity of NCDs.
   Background: This study examined if using electronic reminders increases the rate of diagnosis recordings in the patient chart system following visits to a general practitioner (GP). The impact of electronic reminders was studied in the primary care of a Finnish city. Research question: How effective is the reminder of the information system in improving the diagnostic level of primary care? Which is better and how: financial incentives or reminders? Methods: This was an observational retrospective study based on a before-and-after design and was carried out by installing an electronic reminder in the computerized patient chart system to improve the recording of diagnoses during GP visits. The quality of the recorded diagnoses was observed before and after the intervention. The effect of this intervention on the recording of diagnoses was also studied. Results: Before intervention, the level of recording diagnoses was about 40% in the primary care units. After four years, the recording rate had risen to 90% (p < 0.001). The rate of change in the recording of diagnoses was highest during the first year of intervention. In the present study, most of the visits concerned mild respiratory infections, elevated blood pressure, low back pain and type II diabetes. Conclusion: An electronic reminder improved the recording of diagnoses during the visits to GPs. The present intervention produced data, which reflects the distribution of diagnoses in real clinical life in primary care and thus provides valid data about the public.
   Background: Child abuse is widespread, occurs in all cultures and communities and remains undiscovered in 90% of the cases. In total, 80% of reported child abuse concerns emotional ill-treatment. In the Netherlands, at least 3% (118 000) of children are victims of child abuse resulting in 50 deaths each year. Only 1-3% of abuse cases are reported by general practitioners (GPs) to the Child Protective Services agency (CPS). To explain this low reporting rate, we examined GPs' experiences with child abuse. Research question: How does the suspicion of child abuse arise in GPs' diagnostic reasoning? How do they act upon their suspicion and what kind of barriers do they experience in their management? Methods: In total 26 GPs (16 female) participated in four focus groups. We used purposive sampling to include GPs with different levels of experience in rural and urban areas spread over the Netherlands. We used NVivo for thematic content analysis. Results: Suspected child abuse arose based on common triggers and a gut feeling that 'something is wrong here'. GPs acted upon their suspicion by gathering more data by history taking and physical examination. They often found it challenging to decide whether a child was abused because parents, despite their good intentions, may lack parenting skills and differ in their norms and values. GPs reported clear signs of sexual abuse and physical violence to CPS. However, in less clear-cut cases they followed-up and built a supporting network around the family. Most GPs highly valued the patient-doctor relationship while recognizing the risk of pushing boundaries. Conclusion: A low child abuse reporting rate by GPs to CPS does not mean a low detection rate. GPs use patients' trust in their doctor to improve a child's situation by involving other professionals.
   Background: The number of people suffering from multiple chronic conditions, multimorbidity, is rising. For society, multimorbidity is known to increase healthcare expenses through more frequent contacts, especially with the primary sector. For the individual, an increasing number of medical conditions are associated with lower quality of life (QoL). However, there is no statistically validated condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for the assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. A validated PROM is essential in order to measure effect in intervention studies for this patient group. Research question: (1) To identify items covering QoL among patients with multimorbidity in a Danish context. (2) To develop and validate a PROM for assessment of QoL among patients with multimorbidity. (3) To utilize the final PROM in a large group of patients with multimorbidity to measure their QoL when living with different combinations and severity of multimorbidity. Methods: Phase 1: qualitative individual and focus group interviews with patients with multimorbidity to identify relevant QoL items. Phase 2: validation of the items through a draft questionnaire sent by email to around 200-400 patients with multimorbidity. Phase 3: psychometric validation of the draft questionnaire securing items with the highest possible measurement quality. Phase 4: assessment of QoL among approximately 2000 patients with multimorbidity from the Danish Lolland-Falster study. Results: There are no results yet. Currently, the interview guide is under development. Conclusion: Despite the rising number of patients with multimorbidity and the known inverse relationship between a patient's number of medical conditions and their quality of life, there is no statistically validated condition-specific PROM for assessment of QoL among this group. Our aim is that this project's developed and validated PROM will be used in future intervention studies as a valid measure of QoL among patients with multimorbidity.
   Background: Through a systematic review of the literature and qualitative research across Europe, the European General Practitioners Research Network (EGPRN) has designed and validated a comprehensive definition of multimorbidity. It is a concept considering all the biopsychosocial conditions of a patient. This concept encompasses more than 50 variables and is consequently difficult to use in primary care. Consideration of adverse outcomes (such as death or acute hospitalization) could help to distinguish which variables could be risk factors of decompensation within the definition of multimorbidity. Research question: Which criteria in the EGPRN concept of multimorbidity could detect outpatients at risk of death or acute hospitalization (i.e. decompensation) in a primary care cohort at 24-months of follow-up? Methods: Primary care outpatients (131) answering to EGPRN's multimorbidity definition were included by GPs, during two periods of inclusion in 2014 and 2015. At 24 months follow-up, the status 'decompensation' or 'nothing to report' was collected. A logistic regression following a Cox model was performed to achieve the survival analysis and to identify potential risk factors. Results: At 24 months follow-up, 120 patients were analysed. Three different clusters were identified. Forty-four patients, representing 36.6% of the population, had either died or been hospitalized more than seven consecutive days. Two variables were significantly associated with decompensation: Number of GPs encounters per year (HR: 1.06; 95%CI: 1.03-1.10, p <0.001), and total number of diseases (HR: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03-1.33; P = 0.039). Conclusion: To prevent death or acute hospitalization in multimorbid outpatients, GPs may be alert to those with high rates of GP encounters or a high number of illnesses. These results are consistent with others in medical literature.
   Background: A study of casual versus causal comorbidity in family medicine in three practice populations from the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia. Research question: (1) What is the observed comorbidity of the 20 most common episodes of care in three countries? (2) How much of the observed comorbidity is likely to be casual versus causal? Methods: Participating family doctors (FDs) in the Netherlands, Malta and Serbia recorded details of all patient contacts in an episode of care structure using electronic medical records based on the International Classification of Primary Care, collecting data on all elements of the doctor-patient encounter, including the diagnostic labels (episode of care labels, EoCs). Comorbidity was measured using the odds ratio of both conditions being incident or rest-prevalent in the same patient in one-year data frames, as against not. Results: Comorbidity in family practice expressed as odds ratios between the 41 most prevalent (joint top 20) episode titles in the three populations. Specific associations were explored in different age groups to observe the changes in odds ratios with increasing age as a surrogate for a temporal or biological gradient. Conclusion: After applying accepted criteria for testing the causality of associations, it is reasonable to conclude that most of the observed primary care comorbidity is casual. It would be incorrect to assume causal relationships between co-occurring diseases in family medicine, even if such a relationship might be plausible or consistent with current conceptualizations of the causation of disease. Most observed comorbidity in primary care is the result of increasing illness diversity.
   Background: The concept of therapeutic alliance emerged in the beginning of the twentieth century and came from psychoanalysis. This notion was then extended to the somatic field and aims to replace the paternalistic model in the doctor-patient relationship. The EGPRN TATA group selected the WAI SR as the most reliable and reproducible scale to assess therapeutic alliance. To use it within Europe, it was necessary to translate it into most European languages. The following study aimed to assess the linguistic homogeneity of five of these translations. Research question: Are the translations of the WAI SR homogeneous between Spain, Poland, Slovenia, France and Italy? Methods: Forward-backward translations were achieved in five participating countries (Spain, Poland, France, Slovenia and Italy). Using a Delphi procedure, a global homogeneity check was then performed by comparing the five backward translations during a physical meeting involving GP teachers/researchers from many European countries; the heterogeneity of the participants' origins was a token of reliability. Results: In the assessment of the five translations, 107 experts participated. A consensus was obtained in one to two Delphi rounds for each. During the 'homogeneity check,' some discrepancies were noted with the original version and were discussed with the local teams. This last stage permitted to highlight cultural discrepancies and real translation issues and to correct if needed. Conclusion: Five homogeneous versions of the WAI SR are now available in five European languages. They will be helpful to evaluate therapeutic alliance at different levels: for GPs in daily practice, for students during the initial and continuous training, and for further research in these five countries.
   Background: The patient enablement instrument (PEI) is an established patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) that reflects the quality of a GP appointment. It is a six-item questionnaire, addressed to the patient immediately after a consultation. Research question: The study aimed to evaluate whether a single-item measure (the Q1), based on the PEI, or a single question extracted from the PEI itself (the Q2) could replace the PEI when measuring patient enablement among Finnish healthcare centre patients. Methods: The study design included (1) a pilot study with brief interviews with the respondents, (2) a questionnaire study before and after a single appointment with a GP, and (3) a telephone interview two weeks after the appointment. The correlations between the measures were examined. The sensitivity, specificity and both positive and negative predictive values for the Q1 and the Q2 were calculated, with different PEI score cut-off points. Results: Altogether 483 patients with completed PEIs were included in the analyses. The correlations between the PEI and the Q1 or the Q2 were 0.48 and 0.84, respectively. Both the Q1 and the Q2 had high sensitivity and negative predictive value in relation to patients with lower enablement scores. The reliability coefficients were 0.24 for the Q1 and 0.76 for the Q2. Conclusion: The Q2 seems to be a valid and reliable way to measure patient enablement. The Q1 seems to be less correlated with the PEI, but it also has high negative predictive value in relation to low enablement scores.
   Multimorbidity challenges existing healthcare organization and research, which remains disease and single-condition focused. Basic science approaches to multimorbidity have the potential to identify important shared mechanisms by which diseases we currently think of as distinct might arise, but there is a pressing need for more applied and health services research to understand better and manage multimorbidity now. There are several recent clinical guidelines, which make recommendations for managing multimorbidity or related issues for patients such as polypharmacy and frailty. However, the evidence base underpinning these recommendations is often weak, and these guidelines, therefore, also help define a research agenda. A key problem for researchers and health services is that multimorbidity is very heterogeneous, in that 'intermittent low back pain plus mild eczema' presents very different challenges to researchers and health services compared to 'active psychosis plus severe heart failure'. Identifying important but tractable research questions is therefore not always straightforward. This presentation will identify important gaps in the evidence, and illustrate how they might be filled. The focus will be on two areas where there is consensus that better evidence is needed to inform care design and delivery: (1) organizational interventions to implement more coordinated and holistic care; and (2) interventions to improve medicines management in people with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. These illustrate both the potential for imaginative research, but also the scale.
   Background: The accumulation of multiple chronic diseases (multimorbidity) and multiple prescribed medications (polypharmacy) over time may influence the extent to which an individual maintains health and well-being in later life. Research question: This research aims to describe the patterns (sequence and timing) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy that accumulate over time among primary healthcare patients in Canada. Methods: Data are derived from the Canadian primary care sentinel surveillance network (CPCSSN) electronic medical record (EMR) database that holds >= 1 million longitudinal, de-identified records. Multimorbidity will be identified with 20 categories, cut-off points of >= 2 and >= 3 chronic conditions and the International Classification of Disease (ICD) classification system. Polypharmacy will be identified using the cut-off points of >= 5 and >= 10 medication classes and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. Analyses will be conducted using Java and Stata 14.2 software. Results: The prevalence of chronic diseases and prescribed medications will be presented, as well as the patterns that are observed among adults and older adults in Canada. The most frequent patterns (combinations and permutations) of multimorbidity and polypharmacy will be presented, stratified by sex and age category. The relationships with other factors, such as the presence of frailty, disability or increased health service use, will be examined. As well, the methodological challenges to identifying the presence and sequence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in national, longitudinal data will be discussed. Conclusion: This research will explore the profiles of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in mid- and late-life using a national, longitudinal database. These findings can be used strategically to inform healthcare delivery and to contribute to the understanding of multimorbidity and polypharmacy in the international literature. Reducing the burden of prescribed medications and the harms of polypharmacy are key tasks within the context of multimorbidity.
   Background: Multimorbidity and polypharmacy have become the norm for general practitioners (GPs). Ideally, GPs search for inappropriate medication and, if necessary, deprescribe. However, it remains challenging to deprescribe given time constraints and little backup from guidelines. Furthermore, barriers and enablers to deprescribing among patients have to be accounted for. Research question: To identify barriers and enablers to deprescribing in older patients with polypharmacy. Methods: We surveyed among patients >70 years with multimorbidity (>2 chronic conditions) and polypharmacy (>4 regular medicines). We invited Swiss GPs to recruit eligible patients, each of whom completed a paper-based survey on demography, medications and chronic conditions. We applied the revised patients' attitudes towards deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire and added 12 additional questions and two open questions to assess barriers and enablers towards deprescribing. Results: We analysed the first 221 responses received so far and full results will be presented at the conference. Participants were 79.3 years in mean (SD 5.8) and 48% female. Thirty-one percent lived alone, and 85% prepared their medication themselves, all others required help. Seventy-six percent of participants took 5-9 regular medicines and 24% took >= 10 up to 22 medicines. Participants (76%) were willing to deprescribe one or more of their medicines and 78% did not have any negative experience with deprescribing. Age and gender were not associated with their willingness to deprescribe. Important barriers to deprescribing were satisfaction with drugs (96%), long-term drugs (56%) and noticing positive effects when taking them (92%). When it comes to deprescribing, 89% of participants wanted as much information as possible on their medicines. Having a good relationship with their GP was a further key factor to them (85%). Conclusion: Most older adults are willing to deprescribe. They would like to be informed about their medicines and want to discuss deprescribing to achieve shared decision-making with the GP they trust.
   Background: With growing populations of patients with multimorbidity, general practitioners need insight into which patients in their practice are most in need for person-centred integrated care ('high-need' patients). Using data from electronic primary care medical records to automatically create a list of possible 'high need' patients could be a quick and easy first step to assist GPs in identifying these patients. Research question: Can 'high need' patients with multimorbidity be identified automatically from their primary care medical records? Methods: Pseudonymized medical records of patients with multimorbidity (>= 2 chronic diseases) were analysed. Data was derived from the Nivel primary care database, a large registry containing data routinely recorded in electronic health records. This includes data on healthcare use, health problems and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to predict outcomes (frequent contact with the general practice, ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions). Predictors were age, sex, healthcare use in the previous year, morbidity and medication use. Results: In total, 245 065 patients with multimorbidity were identified, of which 48% were above the age of 65 and 57% female. More than 42% had five GP contacts in the previous year and 62% used five or more different medications. Frequent contact with the general practice could be reliably predicted using only the number of contacts in the previous year (AUC: 0.82). Adding all other predictors (including specific chronic conditions) only improved the predictive value of the model marginally (AUC: 0.84). Identifying patients with a high risk for ER visits and unplanned hospital admissions proved more difficult (AUC: 0.67 and 0.70, respectively). Conclusion: 'High need' patients with multimorbidity can be automatically selected from primary care medical records using only the number of contacts with the general practice in the previous year. Composing a list of these patients can help GPs to identify those eligible for person-centred integrated care.
   Background: Chronic diseases usually have a long duration and slow progression and, as a result, they tend to aggregate in multimorbidity patterns (MPs) during the life course and/or due to shared underlying pathophysiological pathways. Knowledge of how MPs progress over time is necessary to develop effective prevention management strategies. Research question: What are the most likely MPs over time? Which longitudinal shifts from one pattern to another occur during follow-up? Methods: A prospective longitudinal study based on electronic health records was conducted during 2012-2016 in Catalonia, Spain. For people aged >= 65 years, we extracted data on demographics and diagnostic codes for chronic diseases (ICD-10). Machine-learning techniques were applied for the identification of disease clusters using fuzzy c-means analysis to obtain initial clusters. To estimate longitudinal MPs and their progression for each individual a hidden Markov model was fitted, estimating: (1) the transition probability matrix between clusters; (2) the initial cluster probability; (3) the most likely trajectory for each individual. The prevalence of disease in each cluster, observed/expected ratios (O/E ratios) and disease exclusivity was determined for each MP. Criteria used to designate cluster: O/E ratio >= 2. Results: In total, 916 619 individuals were included. Ten MPs were identified. The cluster including the most prevalent diseases was designated non-specific (42.0% of individuals). The remaining nine clusters included the following anatomical systems: ophthalmologic and mental diseases (19.3%), osteometabolic (7.9%), cardio-circulatory (6.6%), and others. Most patients, minimum 59.2%, remained in the same cluster during the study period. The highest transitions to the mortality state were observed in the cardio-circulatory (37.1%) and nervous (31.8%) MPs. Conclusion: Ten significant longitudinal MPs were found. The application of sophisticated statistical techniques ideally suited the study of the MPs and allowed for characterization over time. This method is useful to establish a probabilistic evolution of MPs.
   Background: Quality of life is an essential theme for quantitative surveys in primary care. Treatments and procedures need to be assessed on whether they change patients' quality of life. This has led to the creation of evaluation scales. The purpose of this study was to determine reproducibility and efficiency of 11 previously selected quality of life scales (selected with a systematic review) for the general population. Research question: What is the best possible reproducible and efficient quality of life scale for the general population? Methods: The search was conducted from November 2017 to April 2018 in PubMed and Cochrane databases, according to the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) protocol. The inclusion criteria were the psychometric qualities for each of the 11 scales studied. Articles dealing with subpopulations or those not written in IMRAD format were excluded. The collected values were reproducibility and efficiency. Results: Out of 206, 46 selected articles were included. Cronbach's alpha by domain and Pearson's coefficient were the most analysed psychometrics. No valid efficiency data was obtained. The internal consistency was over 0.7 for the SF-36, SF12v2 and EQ-5D scales. The Pearson coefficient was over 0.4 for the SF36v2, SF-12 and SF-12v2 scales. The Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.4 to 0.80 for the EQ-5D questionnaire. Conclusion: No scale is fully validated. Reproducibility values were incomplete (Cronbach's alpha and Pearson's most expressed). No efficiency data was found. The most validated scales are the SF family and the EQ-5D. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of these limitations when choosing a quality of life scale. They should return to the scales' designs to choose the one that underlines the type of quality of life they want to assess as no external validity is available.
   Background: Previous studies have shown an increased rate of infection among patients with diabetes; however, it is unclear from these studies if the level of HbA1c is correlated with infection. Research question: This study aimed to examine the association between glycaemic control of type 2 diabetes patients and the incidence of infections. Methods: An HMO database was used to identify all DM patients. The first HbA1c test during the period of the study was selected for each patient; then an infection diagnosis was searched in the 60 days that followed the test. We compared the HbA1c test results that were followed by an infection to those that were not. After applying exclusion criteria: having cancer, receiving immunosuppressive medication, undergoing dialysis treatment, anaemia less than 9 mg%, and G6PD deficiency, there remained 33 637 patients in the cohort. The study period was October 2014 to September 2017. The following information was collected: age, gender, socio-economic index, BMI, use of hypoglycaemic and steroid medication in the 90 days before infection, and comorbid conditions (IHD, PVD, CVA, CCF, asthma, COPD, Parkinson's disease, dementia, CRF). Results: In total, 804 patients had an infection within 60 days following an HbA1c test. For cellulitis, cholecystitis, herpes zoster, pneumonia and sinusitis the HbA1c was higher than those patients that had no infection (for cellulitis 7.603 vs 7.243). When factored into logistic regression analysis, we found that other chronic diseases increased the risk of infection between 29 and 60%. Each increase of a gram of HbA1c increased the risk by 8.5%. Use of steroids in the 90 days before the infection increases the chance of infection by 734%. Conclusion: Increasing HbA1c and comorbidity both increase the risk of infection among type 2 diabetics but use of oral or injectable steroids is a much more significant risk factor.

TI  - Better use of delivery spaces in Oslo
T2  - GREEN CITIES - GREEN LOGISTICS FOR GREENER CITIES
CP  - 1st International Conference on Green Cities - Green Logistics for Greener Cities
AB  - The lack of space in urban areas is an important barrier to efficient freight deliveries. Available space in urban city centres has to be shared between different activities and actors, including public transport operators, private car users, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians in addition to freight operators. The lack of access to appropriate freight delivery spaces increases the time needed for deliveries and the distances truck drivers have to walk between their vehicles and the receivers of goods.
   This lack of space is one of the issues that the ongoing project Green Urban Distribution (GUD) deals with. The project is set to develop environmental friendly and efficient solutions for urban freight distribution in Oslo, the capital of Norway, by (1) better use of road spaces, (2) better use of day and week time and (3) to demonstrate usage of environmentally friendly and energy efficient vehicles for unmanned deliveries.
   One of the tasks in the GUD project has been to study delivery spaces on a street in the centre of Oslo and to analyse whether the delivery spaces could be better utilised. This work included 6 days of observations of vehicles using delivery spaces in two separate locations, as well as interviews with stakeholders, including drivers, shop workers and shop owners. The collected data have been used to analyse potential effects from giving designated vehicles exclusive right to use the delivery spaces at certain times.
   The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it gives an understanding on how delivery spaces intended for freight loading and unloading are used by different actors with different tasks and functions. Secondly, the paper presents alternative prioritization schemes for freight vehicles for these delivery spaces and outlines some of the costs and benefits. The analyses will give decision makers an increased understanding of the potential effects of such access restrictions. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Reaching net-zero carbon emissions in construction supply chains - Analysis of a Swedish road construction project
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Recent estimates suggest that the construction sector accounts for approximately one quarter of global CO2 emissions. This paper assesses the potential for reducing the climate impact of road construction. The study is structured as a participatory integrated assessment with involvement from key stakeholders in the supply chain, supported by energy and material flow mapping, an extensive literature review and a scenario analysis. The results indicate that it is technically possible to halve road construction CO2 emissions with today's best available technologies and practices, to abate more than three quarters of the emissions by 2030 and achieve close to net zero emissions by 2045. Realising the current potential would rely on sufficient availability of sustainably produced second-generation biofuels, indicating a need to speed up the implementation of alternative abatement measures, including optimization of material use and mass handling requirements, increased recycling of steel, asphalt and aggregates and enhanced use of alternative binders in concrete. Policy measures and procurement strategies should be aligned to support these measures with a clear supply chain focus. For deep decarbonization several key opportunities and obstacles for realisation of breakthrough technologies for basic industry are highlighted including electrification and carbon capture for steel and cement, and hybridisation and electrification for heavy transport and construction equipment. There is a clear need to prepare for deeper abatement and associated transformative shifts already now and to carefully consider the pathway of getting there while avoiding pitfalls along the way, such as overreliance on biofuels or cost optimizations which cannot be scaled up to the levels required.

TI  - Density of Wild Prey Modulates Lynx Kill Rates on Free-Ranging Domestic Sheep
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Understanding the factors shaping the dynamics of carnivore-livestock conflicts is vital to facilitate large carnivore conservation in multi-use landscapes. We investigated how the density of their main wild prey, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, modulates individual Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx kill rates on free-ranging domestic sheep Ovis aries across a range of sheep and roe deer densities. Lynx kill rates on free-ranging domestic sheep were collected in south-eastern Norway from 1995 to 2011 along a gradient of different livestock and wild prey densities using VHF and GPS telemetry. We used zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models including lynx sex, sheep density and an index of roe deer density as explanatory variables to model observed kill rates on sheep, and ranked the models based on their AICc values. The model including the effects of lynx sex and sheep density in the zero-inflation model and the effect of lynx sex and roe deer density in the negative binomial part received most support. Irrespective of sheep density and sex, we found the lowest sheep kill rates in areas with high densities of roe deer. As roe deer density decreased, males killed sheep at higher rates, and this pattern held for both high and low sheep densities. Similarly, females killed sheep at higher rates in areas with high densities of sheep and low densities of roe deer. However, when sheep densities were low females rarely killed sheep irrespective of roe deer density. Our quantification of depredation rates can be the first step towards establishing fairer compensation systems based on more accurate and area specific estimation of losses. This study demonstrates how we can use ecological theory to predict where losses of sheep will be greatest, and can be used to identify areas where mitigation measures are most likely to be needed.

TI  - Breeding suppression in free-ranging grey-sided voles under the influence of predator odour
T2  - OECOLOGIA
AB  - The breeding suppression hypothesis predicts that females of certain small mammal species will reduce reproduction as a response to the odour of a specialised mammalian predator. This was tested in a field experiment with grey-sided voles ( Clethrionomys rufocanus) during three summer seasons (1997-1999) in the subalpine tundra of northern Norway, which is a natural habitat of this species. In a first phase free-ranging voles in six unfenced 1-ha plots were monitored by live-trapping from June to August each year. In a second phase from August to September, three of the plots were sprayed with weasel ( Mustela nivalis) odour to simulate increased apparent predation risk, while the remaining three plots served as untreated controls. On all plots voles were individually marked with ear tattoos and were regularly live-trapped during the whole breeding season to follow their performance. On the treatment plots the recruitment rate of juveniles did not increase in late summer as it did on the control plots. The proportion of reproductively non-active adult females was significantly higher on the treatment plots for both old and young females. Our results thus verify the breeding suppression hypothesis for the first time under natural conditions. However, the response in overwintered females is in conflict with the original hypothesis because the assumed fitness benefits from breeding delayed until the next season are inaccessible to them. As an alternative explanation we propose a short-term response of reduced activity and interrupted breeding until the predator has exploited and left the feeding patch. Such a "duck and cover" strategy would increase the fitness of females of all age classes when prey habitats are patchy.

TI  - Thermal habitat segregation among morphotypes of whitefish (<i>Coregonus lavaretus</i>: Salmonidae) and invasive vendace (<i>C-albula</i>): a mechanism for co-existence?
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
AB  - 1.Aquatic invasive species can have a variety of negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in the muscle tissue of aquatic organisms have proved useful for evaluating post-invasion dietary shifts among species. However, oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in fish otoliths have the potential to provide additional data on thermal habitat, diet and metabolism, when investigating interactions among sympatric native and invasive fishes.
   2.We conducted oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis on the otoliths of three morphotypes of native whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and invasive vendace (Coregonus albula) at two sites within the sub-Arctic Pasvik watercourse in northern Norway.
   3.Mean temperature use among morphotypes and species over the course of the growing season ranged from 7.5 degrees C to 11.2 degrees C. Otolith C-13 was significantly positively correlated to fish muscle tissue C-13 (P<0.05, r(2)=0.53). Significant differences in temperature use and C-13 among morphotypes and between species were found in the downstream site but not the upstream site.
   4.Complementary partitioning of thermal and dietary resource use in the downstream site coincides with a higher abundance of whitefish, enabling the coexistence of both species. In contrast, vendace were dominant in the upstream site where no differentiation in resource use among morphotypes and between species was evident.
   5.This study demonstrates the usefulness of stable oxygen and carbon otolith isotopes for characterising resource use and highlights the importance of investigating thermal habitat use as a factor influencing the success of invasive fishes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal ranging behaviour and its relevance to foraging strategies in wide-ranging wolverines
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
AB  - Conservation of carnivores in an increasingly changing environment is greatly helped by understanding the decision-making processes underlying habitat patch choice. Foraging theory may give us insight into spatio-temporal search patterns and consequent foraging decisions that carnivores make in heterogeneous and fluctuating environments. Constraints placed on central-place foragers in particular are likely to influence both foraging decisions and related spatio-temporal movement patterns. We used discrete choice models to investigate the spatio-temporal ranging behaviour of GPS collared female wolverines (Gulo gulo) with dependent cubs in south-central Norway. Activity patterns, home range use and selection for elevation were analyzed in relation to spatial and temporal covariates (daily and seasonal) and related to different foraging behaviours. In spring, wolverines showed restricted movement patterns around rendezvous sites at high elevations by day, whereas during the night animals were active at lower elevations. Over the summer, this daily pattern in intensity of use diminished and their overall selectiveness for elevation decreased as cubs grow more mobile and independent. At the onset of autumn, wolverines showed intensive use of the profitable forest-alpine tundra ecotone. We argue that reproducing wolverines deployed a foraging strategy attuned to altering their movement patterns throughout the summer to address a continuous, but diminishing, trade-off between providing both food and shelter for their offspring. Incorporating spatially and temporally explicit activity patterns and home range use in discrete choice resource selection models thus enhances the understanding of the motives behind wolverine resource utilization in space and time. Such knowledge may provide guidance to managers designing regional-scale zoning, in order to facilitate carnivore recovery and to minimize conflicts with human activities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Comparing Primary and Secondary Growth of Co-Occurring Deciduous and Evergreen Conifers in an Alpine Habitat
T2  - FORESTS
AB  - Investigations on primary and secondary growth in co-occurring species will aid in assessment of the physiological adaptation of species and the prediction of forest stand structure dynamics. To explore the correlation and coordination between primary and secondary growth, we monitored the leaf phenology, shoot elongation, and stem growth of co-occurring Larix principis-rupprechtii Mayr. and Picea meyeri Rehd. et Wils. in an alpine habitat, Luya Mountain (North-Central China), during the growing season of 2014. We measured bud development on terminal branches three days per week by direct observations and intra-annual stem xylem formation at weekly intervals by the microcores method. The onset sequence of three organs was the needle, shoot, and stem, without species-specific differences. Needles appeared one month earlier than stem growth in larch, while it was only one week earlier in spruce. The duration of needle growth was the shortest, followed by the shoot and stem. The timing of primary growth (i.e., onset, end, and maximum growth rate) between the two species was asynchronous, but secondary growth was synchronic with the same date of the maximum growth rate occurrence, potentially indicating species competition for resources. Unlike larch, spruce staggered growth peaks among different organs, which may effectively mitigate trees' internal competition for resources. Soil temperature was positively correlated with both shoot and stem growth in the two species, whereas air temperature and soil water content were positively correlated with needle growth only in larch. Therefore, it can be inferred that the spruce will probably outcompete the larch at cold alpine treeline sites due to its high adaptability to acquiring and allocating resources. These results provide insight into the potential physiological correlation between primary and secondary growth and allow better prediction of future climate change effects on forest ecosystem productivity.

TI  - Spatial Diversification of Sustainable Development Selected European Countries. Hierarchy and Classification
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
AB  - The aim of the article was to determine the level of diversification for selected European countries in terms of sustainable development level and the pace of changes taking place in the area of its main components: economy, environment and society. In the research proceedings, the selected method from the group of so-called statistical multidimensional analysis was used to measure the complex phenomena. As a result, each object has a synthetic index of sustainable development level, constituting the basis for further international analyses and comparisons. On the basis of the estimated synthetic measure, the hierarchy of countries was carried out in terms of sustainable development level achieved, and then the classification in five relatively homogeneous groups of countries, in terms of sustainable development level. The analysis covered 29 European countries (EU 28 and Norway). Eurostat were the main data source and published indicators of sustainable development monitoring. Time dimension of the study were years 2000-2015.
   The obtained results confirmed the existing diversification between European countries in terms of the synthetic indicator of sustainable development in the years 2000-2015, as well as in terms of rate and direction of changes in the area of its individual components: economy, environment, society. The strongest differentiation in 2000 was observed in the social component area, smaller disparities occurred in the economic and environmental sphere. In 2015 in comparison to 2000 the process of diminishing development disparities was observed between countries in all components of sustainable development. A negative phenomenon of lowering the average sustainable development level estimated for all the examined European countries was also observed, caused by the global financial crisis which occurred from 2008 to 2015. Over the past dozen or so years, in European countries a slow process of diminishing disparities has been observed. The effectiveness of adopted European policies on the growth path of social and economic cohesion should be assessed positively.

TI  - Potential of stock enhancement for decapod crustaceans
T2  - REVIEWS IN FISHERIES SCIENCE
CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Stock Enhancement and Sea Ranching
AB  - To evaluate the potential of stock enhancement for decapod crustaceans, we analyzed stock enhancement programs for 4 species: the penaeid prawns (Penaeus japonicus) in Japan and (Penaeus chinensis) China, the European lobster (Homarus gammarus) in Norway, and the mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) in Japan, for which stocking effectiveness has been intensively examined. For each species, we summarized the life cycle, fishery, and stocking programs and then comparatively analyzed the recapture rates, the yield from the released individuals (YPR), and the economic efficiency. Scylla paramamosain had some advantages in stock enhancement, including restricted living areas such as bays and estuaries, a large body size, and high values of the ratio of price per landed individual to the cost per released juvenile. These characteristics promised higher values of YPR and economic efficiency, even at lower recapture rates. Therefore, hatchery releases affect areas with small stocks of S. paramamosain. This scenario might also be inferred for H. gammarus, which had the highest YPR and does not generally migrate from the release site, although the economic efficiency was low due to the high cost of juvenile production. On the other hand, fishery productions of the penaeid prawns, which had a lower YPR, could not be augmented without a huge number of released juveniles and the maintenance of nursery habitats. The restocking is a more cost-effective measure for sustainable fishery production than only a sea ranching (put and take) operation. Therefore, hatchery releases for decapod crustaceans should be applied to rebuild wild stocks (restocking) with appropriate fishing regulations and habitat restoration. In the future, selection of target species for stock enhancement programs should take into account the necessity for restocking and their life history characteristics.

TI  - Early springs and breeding performance in two sympatric duck species with different migration strategies
T2  - IBIS
AB  - The capacity of migratory species to adapt to climate change may depend on their migratory and reproductive strategies. For example, reproductive output is likely to be influenced by how well migration and nesting are timed to temporal patterns of food abundance, or by temperature variations during the brood rearing phase. Based on two decades (1988-2009) of waterfowl counts from a boreal catchment in southern Finland we assessed how variation in ice break-up date affected nesting phenology and breeding success in two sympatric duck species, Mallard Anas platyrhynchos and Eurasian Teal Anas crecca. In Fennoscandia these species have similar breeding habitat requirements but differ in migration distance; Teal migrate roughly seven times as far as do Mallard. Annual ice break-up date was used as a proxy of spring earliness' to test the potential effect of climate change on hatching timing and breeding performance. Both species were capable of adapting their nesting phenology, and bred earlier in years when spring was early. However, the interval from ice break-up to hatching tended to be longer in early springs in both species, so that broods hatched relatively later than in late springs. Ice break-up date did not appear to influence annual number of broods per pair or annual mean brood size in either species. Our study therefore does not suggest that breeding performance in Teal and Mallard is negatively affected by advancement of ice break-up at the population level. However, both species showed a within-season decline in brood size with increasing interval between ice break-up and hatching. Our study therefore highlights a disparity between individuals in their capacity to adjust to ice break-up date, late breeders having a lower breeding success than early breeders. We speculate that breeding success of both species may therefore decline should a consistent trend towards earlier springs occur.

TI  - "I'm a Mother Who Always Tries to Give My Children Hope"-Refugee Women's Experiences of Their Children's Mental Health
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Background: The prevalence of mental health problems is high among refugee children. Childhood mental health problems have long-term negative consequences and costs both for the individual child and society. The present study aimed to explore refugee parents' experiences of their children's mental health. Methodology: A qualitative explorative study was conducted. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with nine refugee mothers who have been in Sweden less than 5 years and with at least one child in the ages 8-14 years. Data were analyzed inductively using thematic network analysis. Results: The global theme that emerged from the analysis was Navigating the moving landscape of forced migration, which described the refugee mothers' experiences of the previous adversity the family went through, the ongoing transition in the new context, and, lastly, the pathways to promote their children's mental health. Two organizing themes described mothers' and children's navigation of the forced migration: Previous adverse events and new suffering and Promoting children's well-being. Mothers described aggression and frequent conflicts, or refusal to play or eat, in their children related to living conditions at asylum centres and social isolation. This improved when children started school and possibilities of social relations increased. Mothers' own mental health and lack of language skills could also have a negative impact on the children. To focus on the present and have hope of the future was helpful to the children. Encouragement and social support from parents, teachers, and friends promoted children's well-being. Conclusion: The role of the host country in the promotion of the mental health of refugee children is emphasized. Interventions aimed to improve peer relations and reduce discrimination are needed, and these point to the school as a potential arena for positive change. Parental support groups were also mentioned as helpful in understanding the children's need for support.

TI  - The use of information and communication technologies to support working carers of older people - a qualitative secondary analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OLDER PEOPLE NURSING
AB  - BackgroundFamily care support services have mainly focused on older spousal carers of older people and have largely overlooked working carers, whom combine paid work with informal/family care responsibilities. Recently, however, information and communication technology (ICT) systems have been identified as a potentially flexible way of supporting working carers.
   AimThe aim of this study was to describe nursing and support staff's experiences of using ICT for information, e-learning and support of working carers of older people.
   DesignThe study employed a descriptive, qualitative approach conducting a qualitative secondary analysis of two original data sets. In total, seventeen professional staff members from two municipal family carer support units in Sweden that had implemented ICTs were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide consisting of open-ended questions.
   MethodTwo data sets were merged using latent qualitative content analysis.
   FindingsSecondary analysis produced three subthemes and an overall theme, a virtual road as a carriageway for the support of working carers, consisting of both enabling and hindering aspects in family support. This theme provides access points in both directions and is based on caring instruments that enable nursing staff's support role. The staff's sustainability and ability to support is influenced by caring opportunities and barriers.
   ConclusionsThe findings suggest the ICTs to be flexible structures that provided nursing staff with a means and method to support working carers of older people. To overcome barriers to its use, measures to optimise support for working carers and the older person are needed.
   Implications for practiceThe use of ICTs provides nurses with a means to offer support to working carers of older people and enables carers to be informed, to learn and to share their burdens with others when caring for an older family member.

TI  - Resolving the Drivers of Algal Nutrient Limitation from Boreal to Arctic Lakes and Streams
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
AB  - Nutrient inputs to northern freshwaters are changing, potentially altering aquatic ecosystem functioning through effects on primary producers. Yet, while primary producer growth is sensitive to nutrient supply, it is also constrained by a suite of other factors, including light and temperature, which may play varying roles across stream and lake habitats. Here, we use bioassay results from 89 lakes and streams spanning northern boreal to Arctic Sweden to test for differences in nutrient limitation status of algal biomass along gradients in colored dissolved organic carbon (DOC), water temperature, and nutrient concentrations, and to ask whether there are distinct patterns and drivers between habitats. Single nitrogen (N) limitation or primary N-limitation with secondary phosphorus (P) limitation of algal biomass was the most common condition for streams and lakes. Average response to N-addition was a doubling in biomass; however, the degree of limitation was modulated by the distinct physical and chemical conditions in lakes versus streams and across boreal to Arctic regions. Overall, algal responses to N-addition were strongest at sites with low background concentrations of dissolved inorganic N. Low temperatures constrained biomass responses to added nutrients in lakes but had weaker effects on responses in streams. Further, DOC mediated the response of algal biomass to nutrient addition differently among lakes and streams. Stream responses were dampened at higher DOC, whereas lake responses to nutrient addition increased from low to moderate DOC but were depressed at high DOC. Our results suggest that future changes in nutrient availability, particularly N, will exert strong effects on the trophic state of northern freshwaters. However, we highlight important differences in the physical and chemical factors that shape algal responses to nutrient availability in different parts of aquatic networks, which will ultimately affect the integrated response of northern aquatic systems to ongoing environmental changes.

TI  - THE BIOMETHANE INJECTION INTO THE NATURAL GAS NETWORKS: THE EU'S GAS SYNERGY PATH
T2  - LATVIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
AB  - Biomethane is one of the most promising renewable gases (hereafter - RG) - a flexible and easily storable fuel, and, when used along with the natural gas in any mixing proportion, no adjustments on equipment designed to use natural gas are required. In regions where natural gas grids already exist, there is a system suitable for distribution of the biomethane as well. Moreover, improving energy efficiency and sustainability of the gas infrastructure, it can be used as total substitute for natural gas. Since it has the same chemical properties as natural gas, with methane content level greater than 96 %, biomethane is suitable both for heat and electricity generation, and the use in transport.
   Biomethane is injected into the natural gas networks of many Member States of the European Union (hereafter - the EU) on a regular basis for more than a decade, with the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden and France being among pioneers in this field. In most early cases, permission to inject biomethane into the natural gas grids came as part of a policy to decarbonize the road transport sector and was granted on a case-by-case basis. The intention to legally frame and standardise the EU's biomethane injection into the natural gas networks came much later and was fulfilled in the second half of the present decade.
   This paper addresses the biomethane injection into the natural gas grids in some EU countries, highlights a few crucial aspects in this process, including but not limited to trends in standardisation and legal framework, injection conditions and pressure levels, as well as centralised biogas feedstock collection points and the biomethane injection facilities. In a wider context, the paper deals with the role of biomethane in the EU energy transition and further use of the existing natural gas networks.

TI  - Carbon dynamics at frost-patterned tundra driven by long-term vegetation change rather than by short-term non-growing season warming
T2  - BIOGEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Frost-patterned grounds, such as mostly barren frost boils surrounded by denser vegetation, are typical habitat mosaics in tundra. Plant and microbial processes in these habitats may be susceptible to short-term warming outside the growing season, while the areal cover of barren frost boils has decreased during the past decades due to climate warming-induced shrub expansion. The relative importance of such short-term and long-term climate impacts on carbon (C) dynamics remains unknown. We measured ecosystem CO2 uptake and release (in the field), microbial respiration (in the laboratory), as well as microbial biomass N and soil extractable N in frost boils and the directly adjacent heath in late spring and late summer. These habitats had been experimentally warmed with insulating fleeces from late September until late May for three consecutive years, which allowed us to investigate the direct short-term effects of warming and longer-term, indirect climate effects via vegetation establishment into frost boils. Non-growing season warming increased C uptake at the frost boils in late spring and decreased it in late summer, while the timing and direction of responses was opposite for the heath. Experimental warming had no effects on microbial or ecosystem C release or soil N at either of the habitats. However, C cycling was manifold higher at the heath compared to the frost boils, likely because of a higher SOM stock in the soil. Short-term climate change can thus directly alter ecosystem C uptake at frost-patterned grounds but will most likely not affect microbial C release. We conclude that the C dynamics at frost-patterned grounds under a changing climate depend most strongly on the potential of vegetation to encroach into frost boils in the long-term.

TI  - CO<sub>2</sub> emissions mitigation potential of buyer consolidation and rail-based intermodal transport in the China-Europe container supply chains
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB  - Freight transport is an increasingly important contributor to global warming. With the projected development of international trade, finding the most energy efficient ways of service intercontinental trades is a key challenge. China-Europe containerized trades are among the most important in this setting. The typical structure of the supply chains associated with this trade is that containers are stuffed in China and then cargos are subsequently cross-docked at major European logistics hubs or distribution centers in the destination countries for further road transport to the final retailing points. This solution may not be optimal from an environmental perspective. To pursue an increasingly sustainable supply chain solution, early movers in the market have adopted an alternative solution that is characterized by upstream buyer consolidation and downstream rail-based intermodal transport. This paper develops a set of mathematical models for analyzing the environmental saving potential of such alternative solutions, encompassing relevant energy use and energy mix data of all the legs and nodes in the supply chains. The empirical analysis is based on a case obtained from a Swedish retailer with a chain of retailing points in Scandinavia and Poland. From an activity-based approach, our findings suggest that upstream buyer consolidation may facilitate the integration of rail and road transport in the destination country, increase container utilization, replace 20-foot containers by 40-foot containers and eliminate the extra de-/re-consolidation activity in the traditional solution, thereby reducing CO2 emissions of the supply chain. This, more efficient supply chain solution, may facilitate a modal shift in the downstream part of the supply chains, which may be attractive to logistics providers, retailers and customers in search of ways of curbing CO2 emissions. The models and analytical framework developed may also be used by practitioners and researchers for analyzing other alternative supply chain designs. (C) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The emissions of Cs-137 into the environment from the nuclear accidents in Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011 led to the need to decontaminate large areas to avert radiation doses to the population in the affected areas. To be able to perform cost-effective and sustainable remediation, knowledge is needed about how radiation doses can be minimized through optimized interventions such that the greatest possible reduction in radiation dose is obtained with the smallest possible negative impact on the area. Theoretical calculations have been performed to determine how radiation doses in single family houses in a typical Swedish residential suburb arise from a hypothetical Cs-137 deposition on the ground. The intention was to highlight how remediation of different parts of the surroundings affects the radiation dose to the residents in a particular property. A Monte Carlo model of the houses and the environment in a suburban area was set up to allow calculations of the dose contributions from different contaminated ground areas such as their own property, neighbouring properties, streets and surrounding recreational areas. Calculations were performed for eleven observation points inside different rooms of the house and one observation point in the garden outside the house, for four houses in the neighbourhood, and for two types of building construction material. The influence of the time spent in different rooms of the house and the contamination of areas surrounding the house was studied. The results show that in general the main dose contribution originates from their own property, but that a significant part (30-80%, depending on the observation point) can come from other areas, showing the importance of considering the surroundings in remediation actions. More detailed analysis of the results showed that the dose contribution from a source region is in general highly dependent on the position of windows in a brick house, whereas for a wooden house the distance to the source region is also of relevance.
