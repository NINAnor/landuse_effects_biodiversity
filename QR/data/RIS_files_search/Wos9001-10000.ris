AB  - Aim: We use lake phytoplankton community data to quantify the spatio-temporal and scale-dependent impacts of eutrophication, land-use and climate change on species niches and community assembly processes while accounting for species traits and phylogenetic constraints. Location: Finland. Time period: 1977-2017. Major taxa: Phytoplankton. Methods: We use hierarchical modelling of species communities (HMSC) to model metacommunity trajectories at 853 lakes over four decades of environmental change, including a hierarchical spatial structure to account for scale-dependent processes. Using a "region of common profile " approach, we evaluate compositional changes of species communities and trait profiles and investigate their temporal development. Results: We demonstrate the emergence of novel and widespread community composition clusters in previously more compositionally homogeneous communities, with cluster-specific community trait profiles, indicating functional differences. A strong phylogenetic signal of species responses to the environment implies similar responses among closely related taxa. Community cluster-specific species prevalence indicates lower taxonomic dispersion within the current dominant clusters compared with the historically dominant cluster and an overall higher prevalence of smaller species sizes within communities. Our findings denote profound spatio-temporal structuring of species co-occurrence patterns and highlight functional differences of lake phytoplankton communities. Main conclusions: Diverging community trajectories have led to a nationwide reshuffling of lake phytoplankton communities. At regional and national scales, lakes are not single entities but metacommunity hubs in an interconnected waterscape. The assembly mechanisms of phytoplankton communities are strongly structured by spatio-temporal dynamics, which have led to novel community types, but only a minor part of this reshuffling could be linked to temporal environmental change.

AB  - The global economic development is, to a great extent, dependent on access to large amounts of cheap energy sources. The growing social awareness of ecology and the enormous damage to the Earth's ecosystem due to the production of energy from conventional sources have forced fundamental changes in the energy sector. Renewable energy is considered to be an opportunity for such changes. The current state of the art allows such changes to be made without restricting economic development. Therefore, activities related to the energy transition are being taken all over the world. The European Union has definitely managed to achieve the most tangible effects in this regard. This article presents the findings of the research aimed at presenting the current state of renewable energy in the European Union and analyzing the changes reported in this sector in the last decade. The research was carried out using a selected set of 11 indicators characterizing renewable energy in individual countries. These indicators were selected on the basis of literature review and own studies of the state of renewable energy and its development prospects. Based on these indicators, changes in the energy structure of individual European Union countries between 2008-2018 were determined. The study is divided into two main stages. The principal components analysis (PCA) was used for the first analysis. In turn, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was adopted to assess the level of renewable energy development in the European Union countries. Both these methods and the extended statistical analysis were applied to determine the state of renewable energy development in the European Union countries in the studied period and to divide the Member States into classes with different levels of development. The results of the study showed that the EU countries are characterized by significant differences in the development of RES during the period in question. The unquestionable leaders in this respect are Sweden, Austria, Finland, and Latvia. Based on the findings, it is possible to evaluate the effects of activities related to renewable energy development and to prepare assumptions for future activities. Additionally, both the research and its findings broaden the knowledge of the directions of renewable energy development in individual European Union countries. This is particularly important in the context of changes related to the need to reduce harmful substance emissions and the implementation of the European Green Deal idea.

AB  - Seabird movements outside the breeding season are generally poorly known, but can cover thousands of square km and a multitude of habitats, feeding conditions and potential threats. During the last decades, many seabird species in the North Atlantic have experienced large reductions in population size and breeding success, probably caused by reduced prey abundance caused by climate alterations and overfishing. One of these seabird species is the common guillemot. We used global location sensors (geolocators) to identify inter-breeding movements of 10 individuals breeding at Sklinna, a colony off the coast of Central Norway during July 2009-July 2010. All individuals moved northwards after breeding, and eight of them (80 %) entered the Barents Sea where they probably completed their moult. Three individuals moved southwards before the winter, but in total, half of the individuals stayed in the Barents Sea during winter. The other half wintered off the coast of Central Norway-Lofoten. The fact that all individuals moved northwards to winter was surprising as ringing recoveries suggest they also moves southwards (to the Skagerrak area) to winter. This suggests variation (individual or annual) in wintering movements and calls for a multi-year geolocator study at a number of colonies. Much of the area in the Barents Sea-Lofoten area is classified as vulnerable with respect to specific environmental pressures such as oil pollution and other anthropogenic factors, and the importance of the Barents Sea as a major wintering area for common guillemots from central Norway certainly has implications for the management authorities.

AB  - This dataset contains the material volumes, masses, and intensities for a total of 45 residential building cohorts in Finland from the 1940s to the 2010s. The specific building types included are one dwelling houses and blocks of flats. The data were drawn from representative case buildings and their derivatives. The data are primarily based on construction drawings, complemented by other documents such as bills of materials. The source material was mainly obtained from the archives of the building inspection authority of the city of Vantaa, Finland. Material volumes were derived from the construction drawings either directly from annotations or, when needed, by further measurements made based on the same material. For minor lacks of information in the original documents, documents of similar buildings and literature were consulted. A total of 26 buildings were inventoried directly. For each included combination of building type, construction decade, and bearing material these were the ones with the most common facade material. In addition, 19 buildings with the second most common facade material were formed based on these to represent the 45 cohorts. Material masses, and by extension intensities, were calculated based on the recorded volumes and typical densities of construction materials used in Finland. The material volumes, masses, and intensities per material and in total are presented as three spreadsheet tables, along with a description sheet, on three corresponding hierarchical levels of aggregation: per representative building, per vertical building level (foundations, basement, first storey, etc.), and per building part (floor, exterior walls, interior walls, etc.). Furthermore, they are distinguished between the building structure and complementary building components (windows and doors). The data can be used in academic, policy related, and practical investigations of the building stock, such as in evaluating the material consumption consequences of different spatial planning strategies on various levels or estimating the materials embedded in the built environment and their potential for capitalisation in the circular economy.

AB  - Scandinavian countries, in particular northern Scandinavia, have developed unique sociolinguistic frameworks which aim to preserve local indigenous languages. These models have acted to protect the cultural heritages of these ethnicities. As such, these models of preservation have offered a framework to be applied to other contexts, and hence in regions where language and cultural preservation and revitalization have become a salient factor.
   This current study presents an evaluation of the Norwegian State Action Plan for the preservation of indigenous languages in the region of tribal northern Scandinavia. The study produces the several recommendations as a comparative framework between northern Scandinavia and ASEAN countries.
   With respect to education, the study suggests establishing kindergartens for tribal children led by tribal communities, developing teacher training programs for indigenous instructors, developing educational materials and curricular guides in the local languages, establishing networks of distance learning, arranging language and cultural learning summer camps for tribal children and youth, and mapping mother tongue illiteracy among adults so as to assist in the action planning of these projects.
   With respect to the daily use of languages, the study suggests a development of interpreter training programs, the implementation procedures for translation of official documents, the development of minority language proficiency in the health services and judicial system, incorporating indigenous language in digital technologies and likewise promoting digital literacy, developing dictionaries for minority languages, and instigating the promotion of place names in local languages.
   The study employs a literature analysis, and a comparison of contexts, to determine the appropriation and effectiveness of the application of the Scandinavian preservation system to ASEAN. The study contributes to thought in Linguistic Anthropology, in that it suggests that, despite the uniqueness of sociolinguistic practices, preservation methods and government mandates may, at least in part, offer transferability.

AB  - Establishing sustainable plantations with genetic diversity equivalent to that of natural populations is vital for successful reforestation efforts. In this study, we present an innovative approach for selecting populations suitable for reforestation, taking into account their genetic uniqueness using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSR) markers. Our investigation focused on six populations of Picea obovata Ledeb and six populations of Larix sibirica Ledeb, collected from the Northern and Middle Urals. We found that the indicators of genetic diversity were significantly higher in L. sibirica compared to P. obovata, while the number of rare alleles was greater in Siberian spruce (R = 19). Among the P. obovata populations, the Cherdyn's forestry exhibited notably high genetic diversity, and for L. sibirica, the Gainy's forestry stood out in this regard. Moreover, the genetic subdivision of the six P. obovata populations (G(ST) = 0.331) was higher than that of the six L. sibirica populations (G(ST) = 0.177). To ensure optimal seed selection considering the genetic originality coefficient (GOC) and population differentiation, we recommend utilizing the P. obovata population from Gainy's forestry with a GOC of 0.554 and the L. sibirica population from Cherdyn's forestry with a GOC of 0.372. These populations harbor typical alleles characteristic of the research region, making them ideal candidates for seed selection. Furthermore, the specific alleles identified can serve as valuable markers for determining the geographic origin of P. obovata and L. sibirica wood, aiding in efforts to trace the sources of these species in forestry and trade practices.

AB  - BackgroundThe population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), also known as Northeast Arctic cod, migrating Atlantic cod, or simply skrei, lives mainly in the Barents Sea and Svalbard waters and migrates in annual cycles to the Norwegian coast in order to spawn eggs during late winter. It is the world's largest population of Atlantic cod, and the population is distinct from the Norwegian coastal cod (or fjord cod). Despite the biological, economic, and cultural importance of migrating Atlantic cod, current knowledge on the associated microbiota is very limited. Using shotgun metagenomics and metaproteomics approaches, we present here the gut microbiota, metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of the most abundant bacterial species, DNA-based functional profile, and the metaproteome of Atlantic cod specimens caught at a spawning area in an open ocean outside of TromsO, Norway.ResultsOur analyses identified 268 bacterial families in DNA isolated from feces of 6 individual migrating Atlantic cod. The most abundant family was Vibrionaceae (52%; 83% if unclassified reads are excluded), with Photobacterium (genus) representing the vast majority. The recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes provided further details and suggests that several closely related Photobacterium strains from the Photobacterium phosphoreum clade are the most abundant. A genomic-based functional profiling showed that the most abundant functional subsystems are Carbohydrates; Amino Acids and Derivatives; Protein Metabolism; Cofactors, Vitamins, Prosthetic, Groups, and Pigments; and DNA Metabolism, which is in agreement with other studies of gut microbiomes of marine organisms. Finally, the MS-based metaproteomic dataset revealed that the functional category Protein Metabolism is highly overrepresented (3x) when compared to the genome-based functional profile, which shows that ribosomal proteins are rich in the bacterial cytosol.ConclusionWe present here the first study of bacterial diversity of the gut of migrating Atlantic cod using shotgun sequencing and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). The most abundant bacteria belong to the Photobacterium genus (Vibrionaceae family). We also constructed functional profiles of the gut microbiome. These may be used in future studies as a platform for mining of commercially interesting cold-active enzymes.

KW  - ENVIRONMENT
AB  - Permafrost characterizes ground conditions in most of the Arctic and is increasingly thawing. While environmental consequences of permafrost thaw are under intense scrutiny by natural and life sciences, social sciences' studies on local communities' perceptions of change is thus far limited. This hinders the development of targeted adaptation and mitigation measures. We present the results of a survey on communities' perceptions of permafrost thaw, with a focus on subsistence activities, carried out between 2019 and 2020 in Aklavik (Northwest Territories, Canada), Longyearbyen (Svalbard, Norway), and Qeqertarsuaq (Qeqertalik Municipality, Greenland). Results show that the majority of the 237 participants are well aware of the consequences of permafrost thaw on the landscape as well as the connection between increased air temperature and permafrost thaw. The majority perceive permafrost thaw negatively although they do not perceive it as a challenge in all life domains. Permafrost thaw is perceived as a major cause for challenges in subsistence activities, infrastructure, and the physical environment. Different perceptions within the three study communities suggests that perceptions of thaw are not solely determined by physical changes but also influenced by factors related to the societal context, including discourses of climate change, cultural background, and land use.

AB  - There is now a strong consensus that during the 20th century, and especially during recent decades, the earth has experienced a significant warming trend with projections suggesting additional further warming during the 21st century. Associated with this warming trend are changes in climate that are expected to show substantial spatial variability across the earth's surface. Globally, fish production has continued to increase during recent years at a rate exceeding that of human population growth. However, the contribution from capture fisheries has remained largely static since the late 1980s with the increase in production being accounted for by dramatic growth in the aquaculture sector. In this study, the distribution of vulnerability of aquaculture-related livelihoods to climate change was assessed at the global scale based on the concept of vulnerability as a function of sensitivity to climate change, exposure to climate change and adaptive capacity. Use was made of national-level statistics along with gridded climate and population data. Climate change scenarios were supplied using the MAGICC/SCENGEN climate modelling tools. Analysis was conducted for aquaculture in freshwater, brackish and marine environments with outputs represented as a series of raster images. A number of Asian countries (Vietnam, Bangladesh, Laos and China) were indicated as most vulnerable to impacts on freshwater production. Vietnam, Thailand, Egypt and Ecuador stood out in terms of brackish water production. Norway and Chile were considered most vulnerable to impacts on marine production while a number of Asian countries (China, Vietnam and the Philippines) also ranked highly.

AB  - Tackling climate change requires both policy and individual action. Mobilizing such action can be made more optimal with knowledge about how the public views climate change solutions and what they think needs to be done in the face of climate change. Yet most public opinion research to date uses either closed questions about agreement with various pre-determined statements (such as views on science, worry, and support for given policy options) or use open-ended questions eliciting generic associations with climate change. This article uses an open-ended survey question in a probability-based Internet survey panel in Norway, analyzing 4634 textual responses to the question of "what should be done" about climate change. Using structural topic modeling (STM), we induce seven topics: Transportation, energy transition, attribution of climate change, emission reduction, the international dimension, lifestyle/consumption and government measures. We find that Norwegians strongly emphasize mitigation over adaptation, as few responses mention the latter topic. Also, men seem to externalize the solutions to climate change, emphasizing energy policies, the international dimension, and discussions about the causes of climate change, while women to a larger extent understand climate action as an issue involving individual behavior, calling for better public transportation and lifestyle changes. Overall, our results suggest a willingness to accept stronger mitigation action, but also that central and local governments need to facilitate low-carbon choices, bridging policy and individual action to mitigate climate change.

AB  - Climate warming sets higher requirements for sustainability in ship industry, which fuels the introduction of stricter power restrictions and new types of ship hull design. The new designs invite us to reconsider the principles in model scale testing in ice, which is the state-of-the-art method to predict vessel's ice performance prior to its construction. Ice model testing principles were originally developed for the evaluation of performance in level ice at slow speed, but currently those principles are widely applied for ice model testing in other ice conditions as well. The forces forming the vessel resistance in a brash ice channel are different compared to forces forming the vessel resistance in level ice. In consequence, the current model scale testing principles are suboptimal when predicting vessel's performance in an old, frequently operated brash ice channel, as our earlier research indicates that the prediction is conservative especially for modern merchant ship bow shapes with high stem angles. An old brash ice channel is especially interesting, as it is the determining ice condition in Finnish-Swedish Ice Class Rules ice class granting process. This paper addresses the problem by introducing a new similitude number - a Channel number - to be applied alongside the currently applied Froude and Cauchy similitudes. The Channel number aims to realistically scale the dominating forces that form the resistance of the vessel in an old brash ice channel by developing further the modelling of the resistance component induced by displacing the ice fragments. This necessitates considering the brash ice fragment interaction and inertia forces. The new scaling principle, which supplements the currently applied Froude-Cauchy scaling principle by the Channel number, is considered more accurate for brash ice conditions. It is designed to predict fairly and uniformly the ship resistance for all bow shapes avoiding potential overpowering of the modern bow types with a high stem angle. This would contribute to providing a good harmonization of ships' expected ice performance with ice classes, and, further, improve the fleet schedule predictability that the logistic chains demand from the transportation.

AB  - A small set of samples from Gullmar Fjord, on the west coast of Sweden, together with published data, has allowed the investigation of the 'Anthropocene' within the fjord. The dinoflagellate cyst record and its statistical analysis fails to show any marked changes within the assemblages either across the proposed boundary or indeed within the youngest sediments at the top of the sequence. However there are some small scale differences in the youngest assemblages that are of interest. In particular these include quantitative shifts in the numbers of some of the species especially Pentapharsodinium dalei, which may be indicative of somewhat cooler environments linked to the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and extra availability of nutrients from Ekman pumping. These small scale shifts in the assemblages point to clear dynamism within the phytoplankton populations reacting to both anthropogenic and natural environmental change; evidence of the complexity of the system. The proven utility of dinoflagellate cysts in charting climate change throughout both the Pleistocene and Holocene within Gullmar Fjord, and elsewhere along the west coast of Sweden is in marked contrast to the little change at the 'Anthropocene' boundary. Nonetheless the geographical position of the fjords along the Skagerrak are ideal to monitor environmental change within the North Sea basin and perhaps further afield in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean; especially since further climate change threatens regime change within the marine environment affecting tourism, industry and mariculture along the coast.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE

KW  - SIZE
AB  - Material consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are rising in building stocks. At the same time, the floor area of residential buildings per capita has been increasing. New houses can be very energy efficient but are often built from energy and emission-intensive materials. We investigated the potential of tiny homes for reducing material use, energy consumption, and associated emissions, as well as land use. For this study, comparative life cycle assessments and energy simulations were conducted on tiny homes, detached houses, and apartments in the context of Finland, Northern Europe. The results allow comparison between different building types. The studied tiny homes had lower energy consumption and carbon footprints than the reference buildings when comparing these indicators per capita or per building. However, when using floor area as a unit of comparison, the tiny homes perform worse. When looking at land use efficiency, tiny homes and apartment blocks performed better than detached houses. We conclude that, as tiny homes are strongly related to individual lifestyles, their overall relevance for lowering environmental impacts should be compared in relation to consumption habits and use of public services. Furthermore, the environmental benefits of tiny homes need to be interpreted in a broader sustainability context, especially in relation to indicators of social and economic sustainability.

TI  - Long-term changes in the content of mineral phosphorus in the Barents and Norwegian Seas and in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - In this study, we used the data on the phosphate contents in the southern area of the Barents Sea, in the Norwegian Sea, and in other areas of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from the materials of the expeditionary studies of the Polar Scientific Research Institute of Fishery and Oceanography together with published data. It is proved that, in the 1960s to 1990s, in the areas mentioned, long-term changes in the content of mineral phosphorus proceeded quasi-synchronously. On the whole, a general increase in the content of mineral phosphorus from the 1970s to the early 1980s was observed. There is some evidence for the fact that the phosphorus content in the Barents Sea distinctly tends to grow under a temperature fall and a decrease in the advection of the waters coming from the Atlantic, but this evidence is not completely compatible with the results of the statistical analysis. The possibility of the effect of the fluxes of phosphorus of an anthropogenic origin and of other kinds of anthropogenic attacks on the changes in the concentrations of mineral phosphorus in the open part of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and in the Barents Sea was studied.

AB  - Actions for increasing the renewable share in the energy supply and improving both production and end use energy efficiency are often built into the regional level sustainability targets. Because of this, many local stakeholders such as local governments, energy producers and distributors, industry, and public and private sector operators require information on the current state and development aspects of the regional energy efficiency. The drawback is that an overall view on the focal energy system operators, their energy interests, and future energy service needs in the region is often not available for the stake-holders. To support the local energy planning and management of the regional energy services, an approach for increasing the regional energy efficiency is being introduced. The presented approach can be seen as a solid framework for gathering the required data for energy efficiency analysis and also evaluating the energy system development, planned improvement actions, and the required energy services at the region. This study defines the theoretical structure of the energy efficiency approach and the required steps for revealing such energy system improvement actions that support the regional energy plan. To demonstrate the use of the approach, a case study of a Finnish small-town of Lohja is presented. In the case example, possible actions linked to the regional energy targets were evaluated with energy efficiency analysis. The results of the case example are system specific, but the conducted study can be seen as a justified example of generating easily attainable and transparent information on the impacts of different improvement actions on the regional energy system.

AB  - Major nuclear accidents are typically low-probability high-consequence events. This paper focuses on weather and sea-level events that might affect the safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs). Flooding risks at Finnish NPP sites have been re-evaluated based on investigations of long-term changes and short-term variations in sea level, which has led to improvements in the protection against extremely high sea water level. Climate change projections indicated that 1000-year return levels of high enthalpy of the air would increase by 13-27% by 2100. However, no clear future trends were projected for the all-year-round probabilities of freezing rain at the NPP sites. Simulations of the spread of hypothetical radioactive releases during two sea-breeze cases, using weather input data at a remarkably high spatial resolution, demonstrated the impacts of coastal meteorological phenomena on atmospheric dispersion. Overviews of various single and combined weather and marine events that could possibly affect normal NPP operation highlighted the need to broaden the scope of future research. Special attention was focused on various aspects of uncertainty. According to the results, a more extreme weather or marine event corresponded to a larger uncertainty in its probability of occurrence in the changing climate. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Risks associated with climate change can have an injurious impact on the economy as well as the financial system as a whole. There is a possibility that certain risks, such as losses to financial intermediaries and disruptions in the functioning of financial markets, can aggravate vulnerabilities in the financial system under certain conditions, including sudden increases in the prices of large asset classes. Using the dataset for Norway between 1995 and 2018, this study investigates how financial stability affects environmental degradation in Norway while controlling openness in trade, ecological clean energy, and economic growth. Findings from the results demonstrate that (i) financial stability causes a reduction in environmental degradation; (ii) growth causes carbon emissions to climb significantly; and (iii) renewable energy has been favorable for emissions in Norway. Lastly, surprisingly, trade openness causes a decline in carbon emissions. The study recommends that since financial stability in Norway reduces environmental degradation by incorporating climate-related risks into the financial stability monitoring framework, it can contribute to lowering carbon emissions to a greater extent. Norway's policymakers should conduct detailed analyses of the role of global emissions in long-term petroleum policy and the economic viability of selected climate policy scenarios before implementing such a policy. Moreover, policymakers should be updated on the financial system's vulnerabilities, considering climate-related shocks are likely to affect all financial systems. In addition, policymakers should encourage the use of sustainable energy to raise the availability of reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy to everyone.

AB  - In the present paper, thermal simulation software (IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, developed by EQUA, Sweden) was employed in order to evaluate the effect of different street canyon geometries and orientations on building cooling loads in a dry environment - Sede-Boqer, located in the Negev desert, Israel. A residential building was monitored from January to August 2006 to calibrate the thermal and energy simulations in summer. using diverse solar geometries and axis orientations as input data. Simulations were carried out using the local TMY, taking into account different aspect ratios (H/W): 0.33, 0.66, 1 and 2 and street axis orientations: east-west, north-south, northwest-southeast (parallel to prevailing wind) and northeast-southwest (perpendicular to prevailing wind). Results are shown in terms of energy consumption for cooling for each canyon configuration.

AB  - Educational institutions have a responsibility to ensure that all children receive care and equal possibilities for development, independent of their linguistic and cultural background. However, there is little knowledge about how kindergartens ensure a welcoming and inspiring place for both transnational migrants, Indigenous children, and children from the majority population. Through a semiotic landscape analysis from two kindergartens in Northern Norway, this article contributes to this knowledge gap. Our starting point is that educational spaces are social, cultural, and political places. Applying a Bakhtinian perspective on semiotic landscapes as dialogues, the analysis focuses on two discourses. The first concerns diversity as an individual or shared value, and the second concerns balancing the ordinary and the exotic. We find that diversity related to transnational migration seems to be more integrated into the semiotic landscape, while the minoritised Indigenous Sami people is stereotypically represented in kindergartens.

AB  - To better understand the effect of winter tourism and public recreation on wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), we compared reindeer response distances after direct provocations by skiers and snowmobiles during 3 winters in Setesdal-Ryfylke, Southern Norway. Reindeer being provoked by a snow-mobile discovered the observer at longer distances than reindeer being provoked by a skier (370 [skier] vs. 534 [snowmobile] m; P = 0.002), while total flight (756 vs. 570 m; P = 0.037) and total distance moved (970 vs. 660 m; P = 0.008) by reindeer were shorter for snowmobile than skier provocation. The fright (328 [skier] vs. 328 [snowmobile] m), flight (281 vs. 264 m), and escape (543 vs. 486 m) distances due to skier or snowmobile provocation were not different (P > 0.05). For pooled data, fright distances of reindeer were affected by 2 other independent variables. Fright distance was longer when the animals were provoked from below rather than from above (P = 0.046), while their escape distances were longer when the animals were lying rather than when grazing prior to being provoked (P< 0.05). Based on maximum and minimum distance moved for all provocations pooled, daily estimated energy expenditure of reindeer increased between 31 and 590 kJ, representing 0.2 and 2.9% of their estimated total daily energy expenditure. Overall, provocations by skiers or snowmobiles revealed similar behavioral responses. An estimated maximum rate of 3 daily encounters between reindeer and skiers or snowmobiles during winter vacation and Easter would result in moderate energy costs that should be easily compensated for and thus have no demographic consequences. Increasing snowmobile use will, however, significantly expand the area where humans are in contact with reindeer during winter and spring, a period of negative energy balance for reindeer.

AB  - Many deer populations in Europe and North America have increased in abundance over the last decades. The increasing populations potentially entail both ecological and economic challenges and opportunities, but in practice we still know little about the extent to which these opportunities are being exploited in different management systems. The Norwegian red deer population has increased in density and expanded rapidly since the 1950s. Traditionally, red deer hunting has been undertaken by the local landowner and his relatives and friends. The present large population raises the question whether attracting other hunters could provide a higher economic return for the landowners and, if so, if they are interested in providing such hunting opportunities. We designed a survey to learn more about the landowners, both with respect to the present level of hunting income as well as economic costs of, for example, forest and agricultural damage; we also sought to understand their interest in increasing their income from red deer hunting and potential obstacles to realizing such an increased economic benefit. The results indicate that landowners on average think that red deer populations on their land result in higher costs than income but are nevertheless satisfied with the way things are. This highlights that increased numbers of deer need not automatically lead to more income for landowners and that the potential for income may be hindered by cultural factors such as reluctance to allow access to non-local hunters.

AB  - Two Life-Cycle Assessments (LCAs) were conducted to evaluate the environmental performances of selected novel eco-intensification innovations for the treatment and valorisation of sludge and fish mortalities from finfish aquaculture. The first innovation is based on a new process for filtering and drying particles from the reject water from a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS), with end-of-life recovery of nutrients and biomass to be reused as organic fertiliser or as energy source. The second process is based on a new device for drying fish mortalities and reusing the end-product as ingredient in the pet food industry or as energy source. Innovations refer to a functional unit of 1 ton of farmed fish and of fish mortalities, respectively, and were tested with a RAS for smolt production within the physical system boundary of a Norwegian facility. A set of standard indicators was selected for the Life-Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). The results indicate that the new processes compare well with the established ones, showing a marked decrease in most impact categories: indicators decrease by-12% through to-67% when sludge treatment innovations are applied, and by more than-86% after novel changes about fish mortality, with water consumption instead increasing by +7% and up to +50%, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis provided insights which could lead to improve their environmental performances.

AB  - Prescribed burning can be used to restore forest ecosystems degraded by anthropogenic pressures. However, some species such as epiphytic lichens may be vulnerable to fire. We studied the effects of fire on epiphytic lichens on living and dead Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) by surveying lichens up to two meters on the trunks 21 years after experimental and replicated prescribed burnings in pine-dominated boreal forests in Finland. We investigated three types of stands that had faced different levels of fire severity: 1) unburned semi-natural mature stands (i.e., control sites), 2) burned semi-natural mature stands, and 3) burned retention groups on clearcut sites. In the semi-natural mature stands, the fires were low-severity surface fires and induced negligible mortality in P. sylvestris. In the retention groups, the fires induced high tree mortality and made fresh deadwood the dominant substrate type. Low-severity fires reduced the occurrence of several species, but usually did not eliminate them. High-severity fires eliminated some species, but the abundant deadwood frequently hosted some species that were absent or infrequent on the unburned sites. Thus, the fires had only small effects on total species richness. However, fires substantially changed species composition: they reduced the occurrence of species associated with late-successional habitats, while increasing the occurrence of early-successional species. We also found fires to decrease the occurrence of microlichens and increase that of macrolichens. The magnitude of the compositional changes increased with fire severity. Our findings indicate that the high quantities of fresh deadwood in post-disturbance forests provide habitat only to a limited portion of deadwood-associated lichens. Fire can increase landscape-scale variation in epiphytic lichen communities, but we observed negative effects, which increased with fire severity, on lichen flora of conservation concern. Thus, we recommend prescribed burning to be applied primarily in sites with a history of intensive management. Fire should be avoided in sites with substrates that are fire-sensitive and important to lichen diversity.

AB  - This study compared use of byproduct-based concentrates and a control feed based on cereal grains and soybean meal in dairy cow diets and evaluated effects on the environment and feed costs. To achieve a nutrient-dense feed ration to dairy cows byproducts are commonly combined with cereal grains and protein-rich feeds such as soybean meal. The present analysis was based on experimental data for high-yielding dairy cows showing that feeding concentrate based on byproducts gives similar milk yield as feeding concentrate based on cereal grains and soybean meal. Evaluation of the different concentrates using life cycle assessment showed that using byproducts required less cropland (-35%), reduced carbon footprint (-20%) and lowered eutrophication potential (-20%) compared with the control. Energy use was higher (+30%), due to the need for drying wet byproducts. Feed costs per kg energy-corrected milk did not differ between the feeds, which is beneficial from a sustainability perspective.

AB  - This study aimed at analysing how colonization of forest plants is affected by source population size and seed dispersal type in recent oak plantations with different degrees of isolation. Colonization was studied in 40 oak plantations on former arable fields in the Torup-Skabersjo area, southern Sweden. Twenty-two oak stands in ancient woodland were used as reference areas. Species richness increased linearly with stand age in plantations adjacent to ancient woodland. The oldest adjacent plantations (70-80 years) approached a species richness similar to that of the ancient woodlands. The results indicate that interspecific differences in colonization rates within contiguous forest landscapes are largely determined by the size of local source population. Species richness of plantations decreased with increasing distance from ancient woodlands. There was no increase of species richness between stands of age 40-80 years in isolated plantations. Species that regularly colonized isolated plantations often had adhesive seeds or were ferns with wind-dispersed spores. In landscapes with highly fragmented forest patches, interspecific differences in ability of long-distance disperal seem to control colonization patterns to a large extent.

AB  - A pit lake arises as a consequence of anthropogenic activities in opencast mining areas. These water bodies may be enriched in hazardous stable contaminants and/or in naturally occurring radionuclides depending on the local geological conditions. Mining legacy in Sweden produced hundreds of these pit lakes and most of them are used for recreational purposes in the southern part of the country. In this paper, one pit lake was selected for having enhanced levels of natural radionuclides. Physico-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen and depth), elemental composition (via Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) and radiometric characterization (via alpha spectrometry of Ra-226, Po-210 and Pb-210) were carried along the depth of a 60 m depth pit lake, with the main aim to describe how natural radionuclides and elements behaves with depth in a non-uraniferous pit lake.
   Based on observed changes in physico-chemical parameters, a thermocline and a chemocline region were identified at around 10 and 30 m depth respectively. Concerning radionuclides, Ra-226 ranged from 75 +/- 3 up to 360 +/- 12 mBq/kg while Po-210 ranged from 11 +/- 1 up to 71 +/- 3 mBq/kg. Pb-210 distribution with depth was also determined via secular equilibrium with Po-210 after 2 years and also stable Pb was measured. Disequilibrium Ra-226-Pb-210 was found and the residence time of Pb-210 in the water column was assessed. Additionally, different vertical distributions between Pb-210 and Pb were found which points out different sources for different lead isotopes in the water body.

AB  - The article and the document publication are dedicated to an episode of the Russian expeditionary Lower corps stay in the provinces of Iran annexed to Russia as a result of the Persian campaign of Peter I (1722 1723). The 1728 document is stored in the Archive of Foreign Policy of the Russian Empire of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation; it is the testament of major general Johann Sternshants. Former Swedish officer, Sternshants entered into Russian service and served as commandant of the Astara province in 1727-1728. His testament describes a large-scale experiment in management and exploitation of the lands, quite different in their natural conditions, lifestyle, and culture inhabitants; specifics of relations between the Russian military administration and local residents; local tradition of offering gifts when seeking a solution of some problem; income and expenses of a Russian officer in Iran - that is, details rarely reflected in official documents. Other documents, also introduced by the author into scientific use, are from the Central State Archive of the Republic of Dagestan and the Russian State Military History Archive; these also contain information on the management of overseas territories. They show that the Russian troops were scattered over considerable space, they faced antagonism of the population in a country that had strong traditions of statehood and could hardly maintain order in the occupied provinces. In Iran, soldiers and officers of the Lower corps suffered heavy losses from disease; Peter I's plan to create a large commercial city-port in the mouth of the Kura failed, as local conditions and climate proved unsuitable. The military command appointed locals to administrative positions, but could not guarantee their loyalty; khans and sultans were afraid of Russian soldiers and their commanders, but often defected and ran to the Turks. The young Empire was not yet ready to develop and manage its remote overseas provinces.

AB  - Encouraging positive public behaviour change has been touted as a pathway for mitigating the climate impacts of air travel. There is, however, growing evidence that two gaps, one between attitudes and behaviour, and the other between practices of "home" and "away", pose significant barriers to changing discretionary air travel behaviour. This paper uses both modern sociological theory on tourism as liminoid space, and postmodern theory that views identities as contextual, to provide a deeper understanding of why these gaps occur in the context of tourism spaces. Based on 50 in-depth consumer interviews in Australia, Norway and the United Kingdom, our findings confirm that tourism spaces are often subject to lower levels of environmental concern than daily domestic contexts. The majority of participants reduced, suppressed or abandoned their climate concern when in tourism spaces, and rationalised their resulting behavioural contradictions. Only a minority held there was no difference between the environmental sustainability of their practices in domestic situations versus those on holiday. These findings suggest that scope for voluntary positive behaviour change in the air travel context is limited and will not come without stronger intervention, which is a key finding for policy makers seeking reductions in air travel's climate impacts.

AB  - Melting glaciers and snow fields have become one of the strongest symbols of global climate change, instigating last-chance tourism and rallying cries for climate action from activists. In this sense, retreating glaciers act as charismatic entities, appealing to the public's feelings and imaginations. The melting cryosphere is also a subject for scientific enquiry, providing the knowledge needed to establish the rates at which glaciers are declining and how they interlink and interact with other natural and human systems. Here, by applying a relational ontology rooted in human geography and science and technology studies, we show how melting glaciers and snow fields serve as charismatic boundary objects that enable tourism actors to raise awareness about climate change and push for action. Specifically, we conducted interviews and surveys with mountain guides and other actors involved in glacier tourism in local communities surrounding two of the major ice caps in Norway, Jostedalsbreen and Folgefonna, and found that the melting glaciers serve to reconcile different knowledge systems, allowing for the coexistence of affect, imaginaries, and scientific rationality. Thus, with mountain guides as the catalysts, melting glaciers contribute to a shift from a discourse of fear to one of care.

AB  - The sustainable utilisation of natural resources requires a new focus on optimal material cycles and material efficiency. Recycling and sustainable industrial development through improved process design are therefore key in this context. In this study, we assessed the potential barriers within the Finnish legal framework regarding the development of novel residue-based industrial symbiosis products. A review is also made of the UK based Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and Finnish MOTIVA initiatives both of which aim at promoting sustainable and efficient use of materials focussing on the examination of End of Waste (EoW) approaches and quality protocols that guide residue recovery. The research approach was based on both legal review and analysis of relevant policy instruments. The research material includes interviews of actors in both operations and environmental management in various process industry companies in Finland. An industrial symbiosis case study is presented based on previous research and close collaboration between the metals and forest products process industry. The main research question is "does EU policy and the legal framework at the national level create barriers to the development of innovative residue based symbiosis products despite the fact that achievement of the stated goals of 'recycling society' and 'sustainable industry' require sustainable use of natural resources and high level of material efficiency such as enhanced waste utilisation and prevention?" The results suggest that an innovative approach to environmental permitting and a comprehensive approach to recycling, encompassing new quality and environmental compliance criteria for certain recycled materials, should receive more focus in future decision-making. Material and energy efficiency, as well as life-cycle and systems thinking are all found to be essential elements of this new approach to inter-industrial residues streams. We find that the institutional status of one of our case study products in particular (a fertiliser product, based on multiple residue stream derived raw materials), should be clarified. This paper focuses on Finnish domestic framework issues. It is continuation of the article Watkins et al. (2013) Overcoming institutional barriers in the development of novel process industry residue based novel symbiosis products - case study at the EU level. However, it can be read as an individual research paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a strong political desire to reduce the use of fossil fuels in road transport. In this paper, the use of e-bikes (of the pedelec type) in Sweden is analysed by focusing on changes in travel behaviour and their corresponding effects on CO2 emissions. The aim is to analyse the effect on CO2 emissions due to the use of e-bikes. The analysis is carried out on the possible differences in changed travel behaviour between areas dominated by either urban or rural environments. It is based on a combination of responses to a questionnaire distributed to e-bike users and a survey of local transport planners in Swedish municipalities. The results indicate that there are large gains to be made from e-bike usage in terms of decreased CO2 emissions through a reduction in car mileage. Furthermore, the results indicate that the potential for e-bikes to replace car trips is as great in rural areas as it is in urban areas. At the same time, the results indicate that the Swedish municipalities carrying out e-bike campaigns target trips in both urban and rural areas, therefore representing an effective promotion strategy to achieve the full CO2 emissions reducing potential of e-bike use. This study also shows that, depending on the type of errand being carried out, more respondents living in urban areas than in rural areas replace their conventional bicycle trips with e-bike trips. Thus, the use of e-bikes produces some less than desirable effects, such as reduced physical activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lined permeable pavements (LPPs) are types of sustainable urban stormwater systems (SUDs) that are suitable for locations with low infiltration capacity or shallow groundwater levels. This study evaluated the hydrological performance of an LPP system in Norway using common detention indicators and flow duration curves (FDCs). Two hydrological models, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)-LID module and a reservoir model, were applied to simulate continuous outflows from the LPP system to plot the FDCs. The sensitivity of the parameters of the SWMM-LID module was assessed using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology. The LPP system was found to detain the flow effectively based on the median values of the detention indicators (peak reduction = 89%, peak delay = 40 min, centroid delay = 45 min, T50-delay = 86 min). However, these indicators are found to be sensitive to the amount of precipitation and initial conditions. The reservoir model developed in this study was found to yield more accurate simulations (higher NSE) than the SWMM-LID module, and it can be considered a suitable design tool for LPP systems. The FDC offers an informative method to demonstrate the hydrological performance of LPP systems for stormwater engineers and decision-makers.

AB  - This paper reviews the provisions and efforts to implement the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and the 1980 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). It illustrates progress and continuing challenges to stopping the overexploitation of living resources in high seas areas beyond national jurisdictions. Progress includes recognition that living organisms interact with each other and the environment in complex ways and that single-species management to attain maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fails to account for these interactions. Continuing challenges include data limitations that allow differing views concerning the adequacy and interpretation of the available data, and decision-making that allows a minority of the decision-makers to block adoption of regulatory measures that the majority believe necessary to meet the intent and provisions of the regulatory agreements. The provisions and continuing challenges to meeting the objectives of these two conventions should be considered in the formulation of future international high seas regulatory agreements such as the regime to govern fisheries in the central Artic Ocean as envisioned in the 16 year ban on commercial fishing there agreed in October 2018 by Canada, Denmark (for Greenland), Iceland, Russia, Norway, the United States, the European Union, Japan, China, and South Korea.

AB  - Drainage is an essential prerequisite in peatland forest management, which generally, but not always, increases stand growth. Growth response depends on weather conditions, stand and site characteristics, management and biogeochemical processes. We constructed a SUSI-simulator (SUoSImulaattori, in Finnish), which describes hydrology, stand growth and nutrient availability under different management, site types and weather conditions. In the model development and sensitivity analysis, we used water table (WT) and stand growth data from 11 Scots pine stands. The simulator was validated against a larger dataset collected from boreal drained peatlands in Finland. In validation, SUSI was shown to predict WT and stand growth well. Stand growth was mainly limited by inadequate potassium supply, and in Sphagnum peats by low oxygen availability. Model application was demonstrated for ditch network maintenance (DNM) by comparing stand growth with shallow (-0.3 m) and deep ditches (-0.9 m): The growth responses varied between 0.5 and 3.5 m(3) ha(-1) in five years, which is comparable to experimental results. SUSI can promote sustainable peatland management and help in avoiding unnecessary drainage operations and associated environmental effects, such as increased carbon emissions, peat subsidence, and nutrient leaching. The source code is publicly available, and the modular structure allows model extension to cost-benefit analyses and nutrient export to water courses.

AB  - Increased demand of fish in combination with overexploitation of the fish stocks of the oceans has led to an increased production of fish through aquaculture. Today, fishmeal is the main protein source in fish feed for most aquaculture species. However, fishmeal is soon expected to fall short of demand as its production is associated with environmental problems. This shortage must therefore be met by sustainable alternative protein sources. Protein-rich microorganisms (i.e. Single cell protein) is an interesting option as a fishmeal substitute in fish feed which, in addition, can be produced as an important co-product in wood-based biorefineries. In the current study, four different microorganisms were cultivated on five different residual streams from Swedish wood-based biorefineries. Screening experiments were carried out in shake flasks, optimization experiments in benchtop bioreactors, and scale-up experiments were performed in a 50-litre pilot bioreactor. In addition, a demo-scale experiment was carried out in the Swedish Biorefinery Demo Plant. Microbial biomass from the scale-up experiments was collected and used for production of different fish feed formulations which, in turn, were used in feeding trials of the freshwater fish Tilapia. Fishes fed with feed, in which part of the fishmeal had been substituted with Single cell protein, showed similar or better growth than fishes fed with a fishmeal-based control feed.

AB  - The aim of this exploratory study is to provide empirical insight into how mussel farmers perceive and manage risks. The results show that future price, demand for mussels, and changes in public regulation are the high-ranked perceived risks. Bad weather; oxygen depletion, harmful algal blooms (HABs), E. coli, change in governmental regulation, and public views towards mussel culture are also considered important risk factors in mussel farming. On the other hand, production at the lowest possible cost, cooperative marketing, good relations with government, liquidity adaptation of new technology, and experience sharing are perceived as the most important risk management strategies. When developing and changing policies for farmers' satisfaction and for the long-term sustainability of mussel aquaculture, policymakers should consider these risks and risk management strategies emphasized by the farmers.

AB  - A key challenge for wildlife management is to handle competing goals. High ungulate densities may be desirable from hunting and recreational perspectives, but may come in conflict with needs to limit or reduce browsing damage. Since browsing intensity is negatively related to forage availability it may be possible to mitigate damage on forest by increasing forage availability within the landscape. A commonly used method to increase the attractiveness of a localized part of the landscape is to establish food plots. In a multiyear setup using enclosures, wildlife observations, field surveys, and controlled biomass removal, we studied food plots to document forage production, utilization by ungulates, and browsing on adjacent forests in southern Sweden. The fenced parts of the food plots produced on average 2230 to 5810 kg ha. 1 marrow-stem kale, second-year clover mix or early-sown rapeseed. The biomass of target crops was generally higher within ungrazed (exclosures) compared to grazed (controls) quadrats on the food plots, which demonstrates that the crops were used as forage by ungulates. Browsing on deciduous trees in the adjacent forest was higher within 70-135 m from the food plots compared to areas further away. For wildlife management, our study shows that establishment of food plots provides substantial amounts of forage both during growing season and at the onset of the dormant season, and that a large share of this food is consumed. Finally, our study documents that forage availability for ungulates at the onset of the often-limiting dormant season can be increased by fencing food plots throughout the growing season.

AB  - This paper analyzes the environmental conflict concerning the construction of a permanent link, between Malmo, Sweden and the Danish capital, Copenhagen. The conflict is approached as both a discursive and institutional struggle, in which representations of nature and the environment are used not only to legitimize, but also to question institutional policies and development plans. The analysis focuses primarily on three of the counter-discourses that have emerged in conflict with the hegemonic, institutional discourse, and also indicates how spatial representations have become important constituents of the discourses.

AB  - The development of the dairy farming is important for environmental aspects, as well as social and economic development of the countryside in Sweden. When aiming at a sustainable dairy production it is crucial to include these issues, but animal health and welfare should also be considered. The overall aim of this study was to describe future scenarios for dairy farm production in Sweden, and to analyse sustainability of theses scenarios, using a method previously developed. Based on the construction of goal visions two scenarios for future dairy farms were constructed; Specialised Dairy Farming (SDF) with high production intensity and Mixed Dairy Farming (MDF) with increased crop rotations and large share of pasture. Based on the qualitative descriptions and the design of buildings, the farming systems were quantified. When quantification was performed the scenarios were evaluated concerning economics, environmental effects and animal welfare, including health. Cost of production was in scenario SDF 3.02 SEK/kg milk, in MDF 4.34 SEK/kg milk, and in the present Swedish dairy production 2.87 SEK/kg milk. Life Cycle Assessment included analyses of eutrophication, global warming potential, acidification and usage of pesticides. The contribution to eutrophication per litre milk was lower for scenario SDF, but MDF contributed less to eutrophication per land area used. Comparing the scenarios, MDF had more positive impact on the environment than SDF, based on our analysis. Cows in SDF were found to have an increased risk of lameness, mastitis, ketosis and abomasal displacement compared to cows in the MDF scenario. No scenario was superior in all aspects and the goal for developing Sustainable dairy farm production must be guided by analysis of values. However, the mainly positive environmental results for scenario MDF must be considered as rather strong, since the assumed milk yield is rather low. No system is the sole solution and choices has to be made, and studies of this kind make it possible to survey which choices that can be made and what the consequences are.

AB  - Understanding the effects of different agricultural practices on the mycorrhizal symbiosis is important for agricultural production and the sustainable use of soil. We investigated the composition and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in soils from fields under different agricultural practices (conventional and organic cereal fields, leys and permanent pastures) in southern Sweden. The diversity of AMF was found to be greatest in permanent pastures, corroborating evidence that agricultural practices such as tillage impair AMF diversity. Neither geographical location nor soil type nor any of the major soil characteristics we measured impacted AMF diversity or community composition. AMF community composition was significantly affected by the different agricultural practices, particularly conventional management, which reduced AMF diversity. Of the cereal fields sampled, those under organic management held the greatest AMF diversity, and in a glasshouse experiment this greater diversity was positively related to barley phosphorus uptake and grain biomass production. Our results demonstrate the impact of different agricultural practices on AMF communities. In particular, we demonstrate the ability of organic farming to sustain greater AMF diversity relative to conventional farming, and the potential importance of this increased diversity for sustainable cereal production.

AB  - Background: Eldercare and care of people with functional impairments is organized by the municipalities in Sweden. Improving care in these areas is complex, with multiple stakeholders and organizations. Appropriate strategies to develop capability for continuing organizational improvement and learning (COIL) are needed. The purpose of our study was to develop and pilot-test a flexible, multilevel approach for COIL capability building and to identify what it takes to achieve changes in key actors' approaches to COIL. The approach, named "Sustainable Improvement and Development through Strategic and Systematic Approaches" (SIDSSA), was applied through an action-research and action-learning intervention.
   Methods: The SIDSSA approach was tested in a regional research and development (R&D) unit, and in two municipalities handling care of the elderly and people with functional impairments. Our approach included a multilevel strategy, development loops of five flexible phases, and an action-learning loop. The approach was designed to support systems understanding, strategic focus, methodological practices, and change process knowledge-all of which required double-loop learning. Multiple qualitative methods, i.e., repeated interviews, process diaries, and documents, provided data for conventional content analyses.
   Results: The new approach was successfully tested on all cases and adopted and sustained by the R&D unit. Participants reported new insights and skills. The development loop facilitated a sense of coherence and control during uncertainty, improved planning and problem analysis, enhanced mapping of context and conditions, and supported problem-solving at both the individual and unit levels. The systems-level view and structured approach helped participants to explain, motivate, and implement change initiatives, especially after working more systematically with mapping, analyses, and goal setting.
   Conclusions: An easily understood and generalizable model internalized by key organizational actors is an important step before more complex development models can be implemented. SIDSSA facilitated individual and group learning through action-learning and supported systems-level views and structured approaches across multiple organizational levels. Active involvement of diverse organizational functions and levels in the learning process was facilitated. However, the time frame was too short to fully test all aspects of the approach, specifically in reaching beyond the involved managers to front-line staff and patients.

AB  - A significant increase in the content of natural organic matter (NOM) has been observed in several surface water sources in Norway during the past 10-12 years. Similar observations are reported also from test sites in Europe and North America. Water works in the southern part of Norway have experienced a doubling and in some cases even a tripling of source water color levels during the last decade. Other important characteristics of NOM, e.g. the specific UV absorption (SUVA), have changed as well. The change in raw water quality increases the required NOM removal capacity in water treatment, and significantly affects treatment process selection, design and operation. However, the operational impacts on water treatment processes are poorly quantified. This paper addresses the observed NOM increase in parts of Europe and North America. Although the reasons are not fully understood or identified, possible causes are presented and discussed. Factors like climate change or variability, especially alteration in precipitation patterns and land-use, as well as reductions in anthropogenic sulfur loadings seem relevant. From pilot testing on relevant raw waters, major operational impacts of increasing NOM and SUVA levels on coagulation-contact filtration processes are identified and quantified. As an illustration, an increase in raw water color from 20 to 35 mg Pt L-1 increased the required coagulant dose, sludge production, number of backwashes per day and residual TOC by 64%, 64%, 87%, and 26%, respectively. In addition, hydraulic capacity and filter run time decreased by 10% and 47%, respectively.

AB  - The introduction of 200 n.m. exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the late 1970s required increased collaboration among neighbouring coastal states to manage transboundary and straddling fish stocks. The established agreements ranged from bilateral to multilateral, including high-seas components, as appropriate. However, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea does not specify how quotas of stocks crossing EEZs should be allocated, nor was it written for topical scenarios, such as climate change with poleward distribution shifts that differ across species. The productive Northeast Atlantic is a hot spot for such shifts, implying that scientific knowledge about zonal distribution is crucial in quota negotiations. This diverges from earlier, although still valid, agreements that were predominately based on political decisions or historical distribution of catches. The bilateral allocations for Barents Sea and North Sea cod remain robust after 40 years, but the management situation for widely distributed stocks, as Northeast Atlantic mackerel and Norwegian spring-spawning herring, appears challenging, with no recent overall agreements. Contrarily, quotas of Northern hake are, so far, unilaterally set by the EU despite the stock's expansion beyond EU waters into the northern North Sea. Negotiations following the introduction of EEZs were undertaken at the end of the lastcoolerAtlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) period, that is, with stock distributions generally in asoutherlymode. Hence, today's lack of management consensus for several widely distributed fish stocks typically relates to morenortherlydistributions attributed to the global anthropogenic signal accelerating the spatial effect of the currentwarmerAMO.

AB  - Building food system resilience enables the system to buffer, adapt and transform in response to changes. Identification of key variables of resilience support actors and policymakers managing the food systems. The objective of this study was to identify the most important variables to assess food system resilience and actors with the best opportunities to take responsibility for preparing for disruptions. We operationalised the key variables of resilience in the Finnish food system and evaluated them using a Delphi expert method. We produced a framework for food system resilience, including three indispensable interacting levels of action and good practices within each supporting resilience building. In the prioritisation of key variables, diversity in production, versatile cooperation between actors based on trust, independence of external inputs, system understanding, and renewable domestic energy were considered the most important. Research and administration play a key role in producing information and implementing actions targeted especially at agriculture, where actions are expected to be the most efficient and impactful. In the whole food system, increasing transparency would help create trust and thus promote co-creation of sustainable practices. Platforms to obtain information about future risks and for co-creating solutions for building food system resilience are needed.

AB  - In connection with the concept of sustainability emphasising the interaction of the economy and nature the material flow accounting (MFA) approach has in recent years obtained new relevance and is presently under vivid development. In this study, the concept of the total material requirement (TMR) of the MFA methodology has been applied to agriculture in Finland. The present level and development trends in use of natural resources since the beginning of the 1970's are described. The objective is to show the feasibility of the approach, to point out the reduction possibilities within the agriculture and to provide tools to set clear quantitative goals for reduction. There appears to be an urgent need to develope new methods, because several of the TMR-based indexes cannot be applied within the agricultural sector as such. Three indexes -Sigma direct material input (DMI)/energy consumption, Sigma DMI/use of commercial fertilisers, Sigma DMI/use of biocides - are suggested to measure the resource efficiency and the tempo of change towards sustainability. Some of the problems are directly related to the lack of adequate and internationally comparable data. The study is part of the national ecoefficiency-project with the overall aim to analyse the dependence of the natural resource use from the structure and growth of the economy, to localise the strategic targets of dematerialisation of the economy and to create a coherent and internationally comparable database to be used in developing environmental indicators.

AB  - Infiltration and inflow (I/I) of unwanted water in separate urban sewer networks are critical issues for sustainable urban water management. Accurate quantification of unwanted water I/I from individual sources into a sewer system is an essential task for assessing the status of the sewer network and conducting rehabilitation measures. The study aim was to quantify extraneous water I/I into a sanitary sewer network by a temperature-based method, i.e., fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS), which was applied for the first time in a separate sewer network of a catchment in Trondheim, Norway. The DTS technology is a relatively new technology for sewer monitoring, developed over the past decade. It is based on continual temperature measurement along a fiber-optic cable installed in the sewer network. The feasibility of this method has been tested in both experimental discharges and for the rainfall-derived I/I. The results achieved from the monitoring campaign established the promising applicability of the DTS technique in the quantification analysis. Furthermore, the application of this method in quantifying real-life, rainfall-derived I/I into the sewer system was demonstrated and verified during wet weather conditions.

AB  - The sources, concentration levels and potential effects of isoprene and the monoterpenes on local atmospheric chemistry were studied in urban background air in Helsinki, Finland. Ambient air concentration measurements were conducted using an in-situ gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer at an urban background station during different seasons in 2011.
   The highest concentrations of isoprene and monoterpenes were measured in summer (990 ng m(-3)), but concentrations were also clearly above the detection limit in winter (230 ng m(-3)). The concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons were higher during all seasons, but when viewed in terms of reactivity-scaled concentrations the data showed that also isoprene and monoterpenes have a strong influence on local atmospheric chemistry in urban air. While they explain 71% of the potential hydroxyl radical reactivity of air masses in summer, they still explain 32% of the reactivity also in winter.
   In winter and spring the urban background concentrations were higher than at a forested site in Finland, indicating anthropogenic sources of isoprene and monoterpenes. Source estimates obtained with the Unmix multivariate receptor model showed that traffic and wood combustion are the main local contributors to the measured concentration levels in winter, spring and November, but in July and October biogenic sources are dominant.

AB  - A vast array of trends and innovations, such as drones and person-to-person trust solutions, have been proposed to revolutionize the task of recording land and property rights. There is, however, a gap in current research regarding how to approach systematically the future(s) of cadastral systems. This paper introduces socio-technical transitions theory and multi-level perspective (MLP) framework in particular as a way to structure potential pathways for cadastral systems. The approach emphasizes the role of institutional rules of the game - the regulative, normative and cognitive institutional elements - in socio-technical transition processes. Using the Finnish cadastral system as a case study, we illustrate the approach by forming three alternative transition pathways: (1) a cadastral system under digital transformation, (2) differentiating urban and rural cadastral systems, and (3) a cadastral system facing new data management challenges. After describing each transition pathway with a narrative storyline, we reflect them in light of previous discourses of the cadastral domain. Thereby, the study provides new insights into discussions about the future of cadastral systems and land administration in general.

AB  - Sustainable forest management systems require operational measures to preserve the functional design of forest roads. Frequent road data collection and analysis are essential to support target-oriented and efficient maintenance planning and operations. This study demonstrates an automated solution for monitoring forest road surface deterioration using consumer-grade optical sensors. A YOLOv5 model with StrongSORT tracking was adapted and trained to detect and track potholes in the videos captured by vehicle-mounted cameras. For model training, datasets recorded in diverse geographical regions under different weather conditions were used. The model shows a detection and tracking performance of up to a precision and recall level of 0.79 and 0.58, respectively, with 0.70 mean average precision at an intersection over union (IoU) of at least 0.5. We applied the trained model to a forest road in southern Norway, recorded with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-fitted dashcam. GNSS-delivered geographical coordinates at 10 Hz rate were used to geolocate the detected potholes. The geolocation performance over this exemple road stretch of 1 km exhibited a root mean square deviation of about 9.7 m compared to OpenStreetMap. Finally, an exemple road deterioration map was compiled, which can be used for scheduling road maintenance operations.

AB  - The great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) has been a persistent source of human-wildlife conflicts in the Baltic Sea area. Fishers have perceived cormorants as competitors for fish resources, while conservationists have resisted mass hunting of the birds. In this paper, we analyse the cormorant conflict in Finland, with a special focus on its factual dimensions and the previous attempts to address the conflict at the national and regional levels. We also present the results from a knowledge co-production process, structured as a joint fact-finding process to address the contested knowledge claims concerning cormorant-fishing interactions. The results suggest that the factual controversy about the cormorant effect on fishing livelihood is essentially a frame conflict resulting from different scales of analysis. Our findings support the assumption that knowledge co-production processes have the potential to address science-intensive environmental conflicts and create practically useful and contextually appropriate knowledge, which integrate scientific knowledge with place- and practice-based knowledge. The process developed a shared understanding of the fishers' practical wildlife-induced problems and several other questions, including cormorant impacts on migratory fish in Finland. A key to generating shared information was that the participants had control over information used in the process. Furthermore, third-party facilitation was important to ensure effective dialogue. While interpersonal conflicts have not been the original source of the impasse, they have become an important part of it and prevented efforts to constructively address the conflict.

AB  - Cities have for a long time been key actors in sustainable urban development, and in recent times, also for the sharing economy, as they provide a fertile breeding ground for various sharing initiatives. While some of these initiatives build on existing practices and infrastructures such as public libraries and repair workshops, others require the involvement of private companies, as in the case of car sharing. The sharing economy might therefore require a significant reinterpretation of the role of local governments, businesses and citizens, which in turn might imply a complex re-organisation of governing. This article will explore what potential roles cities might have in governing the sharing economy. Four Swedish cities serve as case studies for this purpose: Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmo and Umea. City data was collected primarily through qualitative means of investigation, including workshops, interviews and desk research. In Malmo, additional participatory observations were conducted on the testbed Sege Park. Results were analysed with a framework developed for understanding the various governing roles for cities in the sharing economy. Three dominant modes of governing were identified and discussed: governing by provision and authority; governing by partnership and enabling; and governing through volunteering. The four cities made use of all three governing modes, although with a primary focus on governing by authority and governing through partnership. When characterised by governing through volunteering, projects were always initiated by the city, but then run formally by an NGO. While all governing modes may have a role and a purpose in the sharing economy, it is still important that cities reflect upon what are their actual implications. Risks include a collaborative governing mode out-competing some businesses, for example, and a self-governing mode reducing the action space of the volunteer sector.

AB  - This article explores how placemaking took place in architectural and design studios working with migrant and displaced communities at universities in three countries. Placemaking is a dimension of architectural and urban design practice that is emulated in architectural design studios - and often takes the form of a top-down and expert-driven exercise. In contrast, bottom-up placemaking is constituted through spontaneous and everyday practices in a given locality. The studios engaged with social scientists with a particular focus on displaced and immigrant communities. In Delhi, a multi-disciplinary social design studio at Ambedkar University applied community engagement and a service design approach to sustainable social interventions with a physical design component. At the University of Brighton, UK, an architectural design/build studio aimed at actual construction and transgressed the studio boundary to work closely with a charity supporting young refugees. In Norway, architecture students in an urbanism studio at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design surveyed an immigrant-dominated modernist housing district and proposed architectural and urban space interventions. Across the studios, student projects ranged from visualising futures to physical and social interventions. Learning outcomes varied, including design and planning skills, community engagement methods, co-design approaches and training in reflexivity. Venturing beyond the studio entailed engaging in sociocultural learning practices, engaging urban complexities and challenging expert authority and epistemologies in architecture and design education.

AB  - The number of science publications is growing exponentially, thus increasing the need for understanding the knowledge base of various research streams and their emerging branches. From a social science perspective, the literature on the mining sector the industrial sector that extracts ores and minerals from the ground has also witnessed steady growth. However, this literature is rather fragmented in regards to the thematic topics and the geographical focus. To respond to this, this paper offers a systematic literature review of the social science research on the mining sector. The publication database of this review includes a set of 483 systemically selected papers from 976 authors, covering empirical research conducted in 73 countries from 5 continents: Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia and America. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we provide an analysis of the geography of the research in terms of both authorship and empirical focus. In terms of the geographical coverage of the empirical cases, Australia appears as the most studied country in the field, followed by countries in other regions such as Asia (China, India, Russia and Turkey), Africa (Ghana, South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), North America (the USA and Canada), Latin America (Brazil and Chile) and Europe (Poland, Spain and Sweden). However, this dispersion is not reflected in the geographical coverage of the affiliations of the authors. Secondly, we identify the most popular social science research topics on the mining sector. Our results show that the social science research on the mining sector shifted from the traditional research streams (e.g., industrialisation and growth, colonialization, technological and economic development, and the resource curse) to the new streams of research on social, environmental and economical sustainability (e.g., the social license to operate, corporate social responsibility, criticality of the rare earth elements, material flow analysis and environmental impacts). Overall, our study serves as an entry point for researches who are interested in social science research on the mining sector.

AB  - Fossil fuel consumption is predicted to dominate energy needs until at least 2040. To make up for reduced production from maturing fields, oil and gas exploration activities on the Norwegian continental shelf have greatly increased over the past several years. Strict emission controls have resulted in a substantial reduction in the release of hazardous chemicals. However, because of the increased exploration the discharges of water-based drill cuttings and muds have increased substantially, temporarily increasing water column sediment loads. The stony coral Lophelia pertusa is the most widely distributed and well-studied of the structure forming cold water corals (CWC) and it thrives in Norwegian waters where many reefs are located in the vicinity of oil platforms or exploration areas. This species provides habitat for a diverse and abundant assemblage of invertebrates and fishes, including commercially valuable species. High sediment loads are known to negatively affect adult corals, but impacts on the early life history stages are unknown. We investigated the effects of a range of drill cutting concentrations (0.5-640 ppm) on larvae of L. pertusa at ages five days and 15-20 days. One set of experiments was conducted in static experimental chambers that exposed larvae to decreasing concentrations over time, and the other maintained continuous drill cutting concentrations for the duration of the experiment (24 h). Increased sediment load for a duration of 24 h caused significant larval mortality, but there was an age-dependent difference in sensitivity of larvae. Younger larvae were significantly more susceptible to lower concentrations of drill cuttings than older larvae, while the older larvae were significantly more affected at higher concentrations. Five day old larvae were affected at treatment concentration 40 ppm. The larval cilia became clogged, preventing the larvae from swimming actively and ultimately causing mortality. Larvae of many species use cilia for swimming and feeding, so negative impacts of increased sediment may not be limited to corals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The approach to sustainable transportation issues in the United States was examined in light of findings from a study of sustainable transportation planning in Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, and Scotland. In the European countries, reducing greenhouse gases has been the initial motivation for most sustainable transportation initiatives, but broader social, economic, and environmental concerns now figure into the idea of sustainability. In the United States, barriers to greenhouse gas reduction and planning for sustainability include uncertainty about the problem and the best ways to address it, uncertainties about public support, and the lack of a clear mandate for action. Nevertheless, efforts are under way locally in the United States to promote sustainable development, and transportation plays a central role in these plans. The European organizations visited are using many of the same strategies as are U.S. planners, but supporting their efforts are strong policy commitments, government incentives, and new planning processes emphasizing collaboration and performance measurement. Tracking the comparative success of these efforts would be an important next step.

AB  - Small mammal populations often exhibit large-scale spatial synchrony, which is purportedly caused by stochastic weather-related environmental perturbations, predation or dispersal. To elucidate the relative synchronizing effects of environmental perturbations from those of dispersal movements of small mammalian prey or their predators, we investigated the spatial dynamics of Microtus vole populations in two differently structured landscapes which experience similar patterns of weather and climatic conditions. Vole and predator abundances were monitored for three years on 28 agricultural field sites arranged into two 120-km-long transect lines in western Finland. Sites on one transect were interconnected by continuous agricultural farmland (continuous landscape), while sites on the other were isolated from one another to a varying degree by mainly forests (fragmented landscape). Vole populations exhibited large-scale (> 120 km) spatial synchrony in fluctuations, which did not differ in degree between the landscapes or decline with increasing distance between trapping sites. However, spatial variation in vole population growth rates was higher in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape. Although vole-eating predators were more numerous in the continuous agricultural landscape than in the fragmented, our results suggest that predators do not exert a great influence on the degree of spatial synchrony of vole population fluctuations, but they may contribute to bringing out-of-phase prey patches towards a regional density level. The spatial dynamics of vole populations were similar in both fragmented and continuous landscapes despite inter-landscape differences in both predator abundance and possibilities of vole dispersal. This implies that the primary source of synchronization lies in a common weather-related environment.

AB  - [1] This case study tests the hypothesis that damming leads to a depletion of major elements in river systems. It determines the effect of river dams on the weathering regime, and thus on dissolved silicate (DSi) fluxes from land to the Sea by comparing two headwater areas in northern Sweden. In the pristine River Kalixalven, major dissolved elements are enriched within a few kilometers downstream from a high mountainous provenance, coming from an area low in vegetation and a thin active soil layer to a forested landscape. Also, alkalinity increased from 30 mueq L-1 to 110 mueq L(-)1, compared to 240 mueq L-1 measured at the river mouth. In the headwater of the River Lulealven, regulations led to inundation of the river valley and associated loss in vegetated soils. In reaches between the reservoirs, underground channeling of water and a reduction of water level fluctuations result in further decrease in soil-water contact, and consequently diminishing weathering rates. The ratio of forest area to lentic area in the headwater was reduced dramatically with damming, from 2.65 to 0.84. As a consequence, geochemical variables in the river water show uniformity in space and in time. Alkalinity values at the River Lulealven mouth (155 mueq L-1) remained unchanged from the two main mountainous storage reservoirs (161 mueq L-1 and 166 mueq L-1). These results indicate that loss of vegetated soils through damming in river headwater critically reduces weathering fluxes and also suggest that changes in vegetation coverage in the Quaternary have altered DSi inputs significantly to the global Ocean.

AB  - Due to advective impact few consistent time-series describing the population development of the copepod C. finmarchicus exist. Quantitatively, the spring generation seems to be the most important, and especially in the northern areas one generation per year seems to prevail. A fecundity of 10(2)-10(3) eggs female(-1) and a sex ratio 1:1 then give a maximal reproductive rate of 3.9-6.2 year(-1). This low rate seems to be compensated by low mortality due to effective predator avoidance in terms of diurnal and seasonal vertical migrations. We have calculated that the advective renewal of the habitats of C. finmarchicus in the subpolar gyre and in the Nordic Seas are 0.13 and 0.29 year(-1) respectively while the birth and death rates of C.finmarchicus typically are above 3.9 year(-1). This means that the biological rates are likely to dominate over the advective rates in the two ocean areas, and that the C.finmarchicus development is facilitated by Ic cal production in both areas. Rough calculations for the Nordic Seas indicate that our of a total annual production of 74 mill. tonnes, 3.6 mill. tonnes are lost to adjacent seas by advection. Due to the flow of deep and cold waters southward and the seasonal migration of C. finmarchicus it is likely that the loss of individuals from the Nordic Seas southward to the North Atlantic is dominated by copepodite V, and that a higher proportion of younger life stages are carried in the south-north (Barents Sea) and west-east (Norwegian coast and the North Sea) directions with the warmer, Atlantic Water.

AB  - Strong cultural heritage management relies on a thorough evaluation of the threats faced by heritage sites, both in the present and in the future. In this study, we analysed the changes in the position of Hiorthhamn shoreline (Svalbard), which is affecting coastal cultural heritage sites, for a period of 93 years (1927-2020). Shoreline changes were mapped by using maps, ortophotos, drone images, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and topographic surveys. Also, TLS was used to 3D document the endangered coastal cultural heritage sites. Detailed sedimentological and morphological mapping was made in the field and from the newly acquired drone images in order to understand shoreline-landscape interaction and to depict changes occurring from 2019 to 2020. Short-term (2019-2020) and long-term (1927-2020) shoreline erosion/accretion was made with the help of the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) and prompted a subdivision of three sectors, based on change pattern. Compared to a previous long-term analysis (1927-2019), this year's average erosion rate analysis (expressed by the EPR parameter) for the 93-year period is -0.14 m/yr. This shift in mean development is due to a newly formed spit-bar in Sector 2. Referring strictly to Sector 1, where the protected cultural heritage objects are located, the erosion rate increased from the previous analysis of -0.76 m/yr to -0.77 m/yr. The shoreline forecast analysis highlights that half of the protected cultural heritage objects will likely disappear over the next decade and almost all the cultural heritage objects analysed in this study will disappear in roughly two decades. This shows the great danger the Arctic's cultural heritage sites is in if no mitigation measures are undertaken by the local authorities.

AB  - 1. Nest site choice and reproductive success of lapwings was studied during 1988-90 at a farmland site dominated by cereal crops in central Sweden.
   2. The most important factor causing breeding failures was farming operations, which accounted for 85% of all nest losses. Difference in hatching success between habitats; unsown tillage (9% hatching success), sown tillage (78%), fallow fields (31%) and grassland (67% hatching success) was an effect of different farming practices.
   3. Only 13% of the females were estimated to hatch a first clutch, but a majority (66%) of the females that lost the first clutch was estimated to lay a replacement clutch (67% hatching success), giving an estimated proportion of 55% females hatching a clutch.
   4. Although most failures were caused by farming practices, predation accounted for 14% of nest losses. Predation risk was negatively correlated to the number of close neighbours (R2 = 90%), indicating that the density of nests in the colony was very important.
   5. There was also a general anti-predator effect in large colonies, which was independent of the number of close neighbours, since nests in large colonies (>5 nests) were less likely to be robbed than solitary nests and nests in small colonies (2-5 nests).
   6. Nest survival was higher at sites far (>50 m) from trees or other perches suitable for avian predators than at those situated close to (<50 m) these perches, indicating that birds were important predators of lapwing nests.
   7. Lapwings seemed to minimize the influence of avian predators by breeding in aggregations, 92% of the nests were found in colonies (up to 28 nests), and preferring nest sites far away from perches for avian predators.
   8. Paradoxically, lapwings preferred to breed on tillage, which (when unsown) was the habitat with most nest losses. However, a majority of the failed breeders laid a replacement clutch and 57% of the females is estimated to hatch a clutch in tillage, which is slightly better than in other habitats.

CP  - 8th International Conference on Computer Aided Design, Manufacture and Operation in the Railway and Other Advanced Mass Transit Systems (COMPRAIL)
AB  - The quality-of a transport solution depends on how well the timetable uses the available resources and also depends on the robustness of the timetable. A robust timetable ensures that the availability and service of transport is not unnecessarily compromised when disturbances occur. Also, the work needed to construct the timetable and introduce it in daily operations should be minimised.
   This paper presents a traffic-planning tool that takes a wide grip on timetable management. Apart from constructing timetables, it also introduces the timetable in the daily operations. It uses a train traffic simulator that derives passage times while identifying and solving conflicts. Thereby, the timetable may be optimised in a stepwise manner. By including disturbance patterns in the simulations, robustness of the timetable is considered. Due to the ability of the simulator to generate passage times, a timetable may be constructed with a minimum of input data. The tool introduces the timetable in daily operations through producing printouts and control sequences for use in the traffic control system.
   The tool is used in railway operations of Stockholm Transport, SL, in Sweden. A close integration of traffic planning and traffic control has been accomplished through the automatic regeneration of control sequences when the traffic situation forces a change in the timetable. When a traffic controller requests new control sequences and. a changed timetable, these are delivered within a minute. The control sequences contain the sequence of different control operations utilised by the traffic control system for automatic train dispatching. The integration of the traffic planning and traffic control systems in daily operation has decreased the workload on traffic controllers, thereby improving the efficiency of traffic control operations.

AB  - The investigation of carbonate formation at low temperature during weathering of ultramafic rocks has become increasingly important as it represents an analog study for a cost-efficient carbon disposal strategy. Here we present new insight into carbonate formation under subarctic surface conditions obtained from extensively carbonated chromite mine shafts in the Feragen ultramafic body, E Norway. Carbonation proceeded by formation of mm- to cm-thick carbonate surface coatings on the serpentinized peridotite host rock. The surface coatings consist in most cases of pure lansfordite (MgCO3 center dot 5H(2)O) and sometimes nesquehonite (MgCO3 center dot 5H(2)O). Heavy O- and C-isotopes are strongly enriched in the carbonate coatings relative to drip water samples from the mines and water samples from subaerial ponds. The major element composition of the water samples reveal that infiltrating rainwater reacts rapidly with the peridotite mainly due to brucite dissolution. Within the mines, discharging alkaline water forms thin films on walls and ceilings that evaporate upon circulation of cold, dry air. In mines with only one opening the carbonation is limited to the entrance area. In mines with a more efficient air circulation due to multiple entrances carbonation is found throughout the mine. Evaporation of the mine water results in lansfordite saturation and precipitation and is accompanied by a Rayleigh-type distillation effect causing enrichment of the heavy C- and O-isotopes in the liquid from which the carbonates precipitate. Formation of the carbonate coatings involved fragmentation of the underlying serpentinite substrate. Fragmentation proceeded by subcritical cracking, i.e. by a combination of substrate weakening due to brucite dissolution and stress build-up due to lansfordite precipitation in fractures close to the surface. Reaction-induced fracturing represents a positive feedback mechanism as it creates additional reactive surface area during the carbonation. Mining operations in the area ceased in the mid 1920s indicating that the described carbonation occurs on a time-scale relevant for the disposal of anthropogenic CO2. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A common understanding of sustainable production principles and the identification of sustainable manufacturing practices among practitioners are key starting points in studying how manufacturers are making their operations more sustainable. However, there is a lack of insight in the literature connecting conceptual sustainable production principles, and the practices reflecting these principles. Using semi structured interviews founded on the sustainable production principles posed by the Lowell Center for Sustainable Production, this paper presents an outlook of how companies in different industries carry out manufacturing practices related to the sustainability production principles. Results showed that the majority of sustainable manufacturing practices remain strongly centered on the environmental dimension of sustainability, with the greatest number of practices emanating from principles concerning energy and material conservation, and waste management. Similarly, reactive sustainable manufacturing practices prevailed over proactive sustainable manufacturing practices, as most of the practices aimed to comply with regulatory and market pressures. Quality and environmental management systems were acknowledged as important tools for putting sustainable production principles into practice; while Swedish environmental and social regulations were found to drive sustainable manufacturing practices. This study connects sustainable production principles with sustainable manufacturing practices and opens the way for further studies on a global or sector-specific scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study shows an average yield increase of 415-1,338 kg ha(-1) per unit increase of the Shannon diversity index for feed barley cultivar use. There is a global quest to increase food production sustainably. Therefore, judicious farmer choices such as selection of crop cultivars are increasingly important. Cultivar diversity is limited and, as a consequence, corresponding crop yields are highly impacted by local weather variations and global climate change. Actually, there is little knowledge on the relationships between yields of regional crops and cultivar diversity, that is evenness and richness in cultivar use. Here, we hypothesized that higher cultivar diversity is related to higher regional yield. We also assumed that the diversity-yield relationship depends on weather during the growing season. Our data were based on farm yield surveys of feed and malting barley, Hordeum vulgare L.; spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L.; and spring turnip rape, Brassica rapa L. ssp. oleifera, from 1998 to 2009, representing about 4,500-5,500 farms annually. We modeled the relationships between regional yields and Shannon diversity indices in high-yielding (south-west) and low-yielding (central-east) regions of Finland using linear mixed models. Our results show that an increase of Shannon diversity index increases yield of feed barley. Feed barley had also the greatest cultivar diversity. In contrast, an average yield decrease of 1,052 kg ha(-1) per unit increase in Shannon index was found for spring rape in 2006 and 2008. Our findings show that cultivar diversification has potential to raise mean regional yield of feed barley. Increasing cultivar diversity thus offers a novel, sustainability-favoring means to promote higher yields.

AB  - Questions Near-ground temperatures can vary substantially over relatively short distances, enabling species with different temperature preferences and geographical distributions to co-exist within a small area. In a forest landscape, the near-ground temperatures may change due to management activities that alter forest density. As a result of such management activities, current species distributions and performances might not only be affected by current microclimates, but also by past conditions due to time-lagged responses.Location Sweden.Methods We examined the effects of past and current microclimates on the distributions and performances of two northern, cold-favoured, and two southern, warm-favoured, plant species in 53 managed forest sites. Each pair was represented by one vascular plant and one bryophyte species. We used temperature logger data and predictions from microclimate models based on changes in basal area to relate patterns of occurrence, abundance, and reproduction to current and past microclimate.Results The two northern species were generally favoured by microclimates that were currently cold, characterised by later snowmelt and low accumulated heat over the growing season. In contrast, the two southern species were generally favoured by currently warm microclimates, characterised by high accumulated heat over the growing season. Species generally had higher abundance in sites with a preferred microclimate both in the past and present, and lower abundance than expected from current conditions, if the past microclimate had changed from warm to cold or vice versa, indicating time-lags in abundance patterns of the species.Conclusions Our results show a potential importance of past and present microclimate heterogeneity for the co-existence of species with different temperature preferences in the same landscape and highlight the possibility to manage microclimates to mitigate climate change impacts on forest biodiversity.

AB  - The Common Crane (Grus grus) population has experienced an unprecedented increase across Europe during the last decades. Although cranes feed mostly on invertebrates, amphibians and berries during the breeding season, they can also eat eggs and young of other birds. Therefore, conservationists have raised concerns about the potential predatory effect of cranes on wetland avifauna, but the effects of crane predation on bird numbers have so far not been investigated. We here test the relationship between the crane and peatland bird population' abundances in Finland for five common wader and passerine species, and a set of seven less common waders, using line-transect data spanning from 1987 to 2014. We found that the population densities of two small passerines (Meadow Pipit Anthus pratensis and Western Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava) and one wader species (Wood Sandpiper Tringa glareola) were positively associated with crane numbers, probably related to a protective effect against nest predators. For the two other common species and the set of less common waders, we did not find any significant relationships with crane abundance. None of the species was influenced by the (lagged) effect of crane presence (i.e. years since crane was first observed). Peatland drainage was responsible for most species' negative densities, indicating the need to protect and restore peatlands to mitigate the loss of peatland bird diversity in Finland. In addition, openness, wetness and area size were important peatland characteristics positively influencing most of the studied bird populations. The development in crane and other mire bird numbers in Europe should be monitored regularly to reveal any possible future predatory effects contributing to the shaping of the peatland bird community.

AB  - Plastic pollution has long been identified as one of the biggest challenges of the 21st century. To tackle this problem, governments are setting stringent recycling targets to keep plastics in a closed loop. Yet, knowledge of the stocks and flows of plastic has not been well integrated into policies. This study presents a dynamic probabilistic economy-wide material flow analysis (MFA) of seven plastic polymers (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PS, PVC, EPS, and PET) in Norway from 2000 to 2050. A total of 40 individual product categories aggregated into nine industrial sectors were examined. An estimated 620 +/- 23 kt or 114 kg/capita of these seven plastic polymers was put on the Norwegian market in 2020. Packaging products contributed to the largest share of plastic put on the market (-40%). The accumulated in-use stock in 2020 was about 3400 +/- 56 kt with -60% remaining in buildings and construction sector. In 2020, about 460 +/- 22 kt of plastic waste was generated in Norway, with half originating from packaging. Although -50% of all plastic waste is collected separately from the waste stream, only around 25% is sorted for recycling. Overall, -50% of plastic waste is incinerated, -15% exported, and -10% landfilled. Under a business-as-usual scenario, the plastic put on the market, in-use stock, and waste generation will increase by 65%, 140%, and 90%, respectively by 2050. The outcomes of this work can be used as a guideline for other countries to establish the stocks and flows of plastic polymers from various industrial sectors which is needed for the implementation of necessary regulatory actions and circular strategies. The systematic classification of products suitable for recycling or be made of recyclate will facilitate the safe and sustainable recycling of plastic waste into new products, cap production, lower consumption, and prevent waste generation.

AB  - The ongoing decline of sea ice threatens many Arctic taxa, including the ivory gull. Understanding how ice-edges and ice concentrations influence the distribution of the endangered ivory gulls is a prerequisite to the implementation of adequate conservation strategies. From 2007 to 2013, we used satellite transmitters to monitor the movements of 104 ivory gulls originating from Canada, Greenland, Svalbard-Norway and Russia. Although half of the positions were within 41 km of the ice-edge (75% within 100 km), approximately 80% were on relatively highly concentrated sea ice. Ivory gulls used more concentrated sea ice in summer, when close to their high-Arctic breeding ground, than in winter. The best model to explain the distance of the birds from the ice-edge included the ice concentration within approximately 10 km, the month and the distance to the colony. Given the strong links between ivory gull, ice-edge and ice concentration, its conservation status is unlikely to improve in the current context of sea-ice decline which, in turn, will allow anthropogenic activities to develop in regions that are particularly important for the species.

AB  - We study climate uncertainty and how managers' beliefs about climate change develop and influence their decisions. We develop an approach for updating knowledge and beliefs based on the observation of forest and climate variables and illustrate its application for the adaptive management of an even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) forest in the Black Forest, Germany. We simulated forest development under a range of climate change scenarios and forest management alternatives. Our analysis used Bayesian updating and Dempster's rule of combination to simulate how observations of climate and forest variables may influence a decision maker's beliefs about climate development and thereby management decisions. While forest managers may be inclined to rely on observed forest variables to infer climate change and impacts, we found that observation of climate state, e.g. temperature or precipitation is superior for updating beliefs and supporting decision-making. However, with little conflict among information sources, the strongest evidence would be offered by a combination of at least two informative variables, e.g., temperature and precipitation. The success of adaptive forest management depends on when managers switch to forward-looking management schemes. Thus, robust climate adaptation policies may depend crucially on a better understanding of what factors influence managers' belief in climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of Swedish urban bus drivers report having been exposed to threats or violence. As 50% of drivers have voiced concerns about the occurrences, threats and violence also represent contributing factors to driver stress and fatigue.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore bus drivers' experience of threats and violence; how threats and violence manifests and how the problem is handled by drivers. Gaining understanding of the circumstances is important to reduce the number of threats and violent incidents to provide healthy and attractive working conditions for drivers.
   METHODS: This study is based on in-depth interviews with 12 urban bus drivers in the City of Malmo in Sweden.
   RESULTS: Urban bus drivers experience threats daily from passengers, although physical violence occurs less often. The most common situations resulting in threats involve asking passengers to show valid tickets, denying child carriages onboard and running late to a bus stop. The drivers have not received clear guidelines as to strategic handling of the invalid ticket situation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Recommendations include a clear policy and consensus with regard to handling invalid tickets, providing drivers with guidelines for appropriate procedures for passengers refusing to pay, improving reporting routines and establishing a strategy for the Public Transportation provider and operator to follow with regard to reports, in-vehicle surveillance cameras including informing passengers that they are being video recorded as well as harmonizing the location of alarm buttons on buses.

AB  - Tree hollows are known to harbour a species-rich and specialized beetle fauna, while other invertebrates, such as for instance mites, have been much less studied. The importance of hollows in oak trees (Quercus robur) for local oribatid mite diversity was studied at three sites in south eastern Sweden. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the oribatid mite fauna was studied in hollows of fifteen 240-420 years old oak trees and compared to that in the surrounding soil. A total of 5,530 specimen of adult oribatid mites were determined belonging to 63 taxa. Taxonomic composition and community structure of the tree hollow communities differed markedly from the soil communities. The most dominant and frequent component of the tree hollow communities comprised a Carabodes species new to Sweden that accounted on average for 44 % of all Oribatida. This species, that closely resembles both Carabodes oenipontanus and Carabodes granulatus, was specific to the tree hollows. Dominance patterns in the soil communities were more even, with the most common taxa also occurring in the tree hollows but exhibiting a significant preference for the soil. Overall, there was little taxonomic overlap between the communities, suggesting that tree hollows harbour an independent mite community from the soil and therefore significantly contribute to the overall mite diversity on the landscape level. The present study therefore strongly supports the use of hollow trees as biodiversity indicators and also their conservation, which will preserve specialised invertebrate communities, including mites.

Weaning occurred approximately 39 d (range 36-41 d) after birth at an estimated length of 88.4 cm (SE = 0.65, N = 96) and an estimated weight of 22.1 kg, resulting in an increase in length of 0.64 cm.d-1 and a weight change of 0.43 kg.d-1. Regression of female weight on the number of days after the nominal date of birth for each region indicated that the postpartum female weighed 81.2 kg and lost 0.64 kg.d-1 (95% Cl = +/- 0.20). During lactation, female weight declined by an estimated 32%, with much of the loss occurring from the blubber. Analyses of stomachs indicated that ringed seals supplemented stored energy reserves by feeding during lactation.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of openness to trade and corruption on economic development for a cross-section of 143 countries for the year 2000 by analysing the effects of trade openness and corruption on income, productivity, innovation, and income inequality. Institutional, cultural and geographical factors, and country size are controlled for in the analysis. An instrumental variable approach has been adopted in order to address the endogeneity of corruption and openness to trade. The age of democracy and gravity-based predictors are chosen as the instruments for corruption and openness to trade, respectively. The estimates show that corruption negatively affects income per capita, productivity, and innovation, while it does not significantly impact income inequality (Gini). The control of corruption and the openness to trade affect output per worker through the total factor productivity. Both the control of corruption and openness to trade are statistically significant determinants of the 90/10 income gap. Landlockedness affects Gini Index directly, even after controlling for trade and corruption. These findings have important policy implications. For example, on the basis of the estimates, if Botswana improved its control of corruption to reach the level of Finland, its per capita income would rise by 2.7 times.

AB  - Production and consumption of food is an important driver of environmental damage. In this article, life cycle assessment (LCA) results for Norwegian apples, sweet cherries and plums are presented. At the time of writing this is the first published LCA study of plums. The study is comprehensive, as it includes nursery, orchard infrastructure, orchard full life cycle, product waste through the value chain, and gives result pr kg edible product. Results are presented for the impact categories climate change, eutrophication, acidification, cumulative energy demand, fossil abiotic depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and non-cancer human toxicity. The respective cradle-to-grave global warming impacts of plums, sweet cherries and apples are found to be 0.88, 0.64 and 0.46 kg CO2-eq per kg fruit consumed. For most of the impact categories, plums are found to have higher environmental impacts than sweet cherries, which in turn have higher impacts than apples, and the primary production stage generally gives the highest impact. Food loss/food waste across the value chain is found to contribute 11-13% of the global warming impact. Functional units based on intake of energy, vitamin C and dietary fibre are also investigated. These results enable a comparison of the environmental performance of different food products in light of the nutritional function of food. The use of these units does not fundamentally change the relative overall performance of the three fruit types. It is observed that the development of a weighted cumulative nutrition-based functional unit would allow a more comprehensive assessment. The article reflect fruit production not only in Norway but a large climate zone near the limits of where fruit can grow. If consumers would follow Norwegian dietary recommendations, the consumption of fruit and vegetables would be increased by 50%, which would give a huge increase in environmental impact related to fruit production and consumption. In light of this it is important to know the environmental impact related to fruits. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigate which bedrock-derived soil nutrients are most important for the floristic composition and diversity of alpine, exposed, rocky habitats in North Norway, and whether the widely used pH parameter is a good estimate of soil chemical conditions in the middle alpine belt. Vegetation at 17 sites was recorded using the grid frequency method. Differences in the diversity of vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens on the different substrates were compared using Shannon's diversity index. Local soil consisted of weathered material from one of five bedrock categories: carbonate rocks, calcareous mica schist, noncalcareous mica schist, mafic rocks, and felsic rocks. Particle size, loss on ignition, pH, and levels of calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen were measured in soil samples. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that soil pH and bedrock derived phosphorus in the soil influence the floristic composition. Randomization tests further indicated that the floristic variation explained by bedrock derived phosphorus was not correlated with soil pH. Thus, the pH measure should be used with caution for the characterization of soil conditions. Vegetation growing directly in soil derived from carbonate rocks is distinct from communities on other calcareous Soils. Species at such sites should be referred to as carbonate specialists rather than lime demanding.

AB  - A lot of emphasis has been put on the densification of urban form to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. However, many recent studies have found that central urban dwellers, even though their carbon footprints of daily transportation may be lower, might be responsible for higher total emissions than those that reside in suburban areas. Similarly, as with the urban form, higher environmental concern is often considered as an indicator of lower emissions, but several studies have found that pro-environmental attitude (PEA) does not always correlate with less energy intensive behavior. This study analyzes how urban zones, PEA, and several sociodemographic variables are associated with annual travel emissions and pro-environmental behaviors (PEB), using a dataset collected with a map-based online survey (softGIS) survey, contributed by 841 participants from the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA), Finland. Although PEA can affect PEBs related to household energy consumption ( = 0.282, p < 0.001), clothing ( = 0.447, p < 0.001) and produce purchases ( = 0.449, p < 0.0001), their relationship with emissions from local ( = -0.067), national ( = -0.019) and international ( = -0.016) travel was not significant. Clusters of low emissions from local travel and high international travel emissions were found in pedestrian-oriented urban zones and residents of car-oriented zones were more likely to conserve household energy ( = 0.102, p < 0.05). These results might help broaden the current perspective of city planners, as well as identify opportunities for more effective mitigation policies.

AB  - Anthropogenic particulate matter with sizes smaller than 1 & mu;m (PM1) is a concerning air pollutant that can affect human health. In this study, we present PM1 measurements performed in a small town in northern Finland that is exposed to contrasting sources (residential wood burning, traffic, industrial activities). The study was conducted in winter 2021, with a mobile laboratory equipped with sophisticated on-line aerosol instrumentation. The re-sults showed a significant increase in particulate mass and number concentrations from biomass burning in residential areas and town centre due to the high share of residences using biomass burning. Organics and equivalent black carbon (eBC) clearly dominated the PM1 composition during the highest pollution levels, fol-lowed by inorganics (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium). PAHs and a few elements (e.g. K, Cl, Zn) were as well higher during evening. A source apportionment confirmed the association between high PM1 values and biomass burning, even though the traffic contribution was also important. PM1 measurements at an industrial area showed an increase in sulfate, organics, eBC, and a few elements (e.g. Cl, Na, Fe), and characteristic size dis-tributions. Simultaneous measurements of lung deposited surface area (LDSA) of particles showed the source -specificity of biomass burning, traffic and industrial emissions on LSDA size distributions. Overall, the results enlighten the impact of relevant pollution sources on Nordic towns air quality during the coldest months and show the importance to also consider the chemical composition, particle numbers, and LDSA in future air quality metrics.

AB  - The 1976 Swedish landmark law on workplace democracy, Medbestammandelagen (MBL), has traditionally been regarded as a victory of social democracy over recalcitrant employers. In contrast, this article shows how, in fact, before the law, the Swedish Employers' Confederation (SAF) was the main driver behind Swedish research on work life reform, and the main promoter of employer-union dialogue on the matter. Crucially, in the 1960s, SAF endorsed the internationally pioneering thinking of economist Eric Rhenman, who argued that conflict within the firm between managers and unions was unavoidable, healthy, and could be good for business if framed in a productive manner. Today, this line of management thinking is termed the Scandinavian Cooperative Advantage. However, in the early 1970s, Swedish social democracy radicalized abruptly. The SAF board initially interpreted the new radicalism as a masquerade to appease activists. SAF assumed that, behind the scenes, the Swedish spirit of consensus-oriented labour market dialogue would prevail, as it had since the 1938 Saltsjobaden agreement. And assuredly, the actual effects of the MBL law proved to be considerably less radical than advertised, and broadly compatible with Rhenman's thinking. Still, social democracy's new ideological rhetoric helped prompt SAF's late 1970s shift from cooperation to conflict.

AB  - Deliberative processes are increasingly advocated as means to handle intractable natural resource management (NRM) conflicts. Research shows that disputing actors can deliberate and achieve higher degrees of mutual understanding and working agreements under ideal conditions, but the transferability of these findings to realworld intractable NRM conflicts can be questioned. This paper explores the possibilities of designing and realizing deliberation and its expected outcomes in real-world NRM conflicts. We used recommended design principles to set up deliberative processes in two intractable mining conflicts involving indigenous peoples in Northern Sweden and assessed the actors' communication and outcomes using frame analysis.
   The results show that the recommended design principles are hard, but not impossible, to fully implement in intractable NRM conflicts. Both conflicts proved difficult to deliberate and resolve in the sense of reaching agreements. However, the findings suggest that deliberation, as well as meta-consensus, or structured disagreement, is possible to achieve in settings with favorable conditions, e.g. good and established inter-group relations prior to the conflict. In the absence of these conditions, where relations were hostile and shaped by historical and institutional injustices, deliberation was not achieved. In both cases, polarization among the participants remained, or increased, in spite of the deliberative activities. The study highlights the importance of understanding deliberation as embedded in place specific historical and institutional contexts which shape both process and outcomes in powerful ways. More efforts should focus on alternative, or complementary, ways to handle intractable NRM conflicts, including how contested experiences of history, institutions and Indigenous rights can be addressed.

AB  - Large carnivores elicit strong emotional reactions, which could influence consensus or social conflicts between persons promoting wildlife conservation and people who suffer from its negative consequences. Interventions to prevent carnivore attacks on domestic animals are intended to promote coexistence between people and carnivores, but could fail to mitigate fear and social conflicts if emotions and perspectives of intervention end users are not given careful consideration. We conducted focus group interviews with animal owners in Sweden and applied a framework of the appraisal theory of emotion to gain a nuanced understanding of their appraisal of intervention use. The analysis identified that appraisals occur at two different levels. The first process related to appraisals of carnivore presence and the second process related to appraisals of intervention use. The interventions can provide an opportunity to facilitate the animal owners' coping with carnivore presence and thereby reduce their experienced anxiety of carnivore attacks. However, if animal owners are presented with interventions which they consider irrelevant, that have implications with which they cannot cope, or that are incongruent with the animal owners' norms, then the promotion of interventions can also generate frustration and negative emotions. As such, interventions have the potential to either mitigate or undermine wildlife-related conflicts. In the wider context, taking the perspective of the individual becomes essential, and animal owners' experiences and appraisals of intervention use must be acknowledged to allow development of social trust and empathetic dialog between stakeholders in the future.

AB  - BackgroundRenewable energy, especially wind power, is expanding rapidly in Sweden and elsewhere and has left the "niche" to become part of the mainstream energy socio-technical "regime". However, the social innovation of community-owned wind energy is not expanding alongside. Despite its potential for an inclusive energy transition and for alleviating conflicts, community energy remains a niche phenomenon. In this article, we explore the conditions for community energy to scale up. Upscaling is sometimes regarded as alien to the spirit of community energy, but we argue that it can be positive and, assuming the existence of a "community wind energy trap"-increased market competition and decreased governmental support-even necessary for the long-term survival of community wind energy. We particularly study how two variables relate to upscaling: autonomy and community, the latter divided into communities of interest and place.ResultsA case study on four wind cooperatives and their main partners, municipal energy companies, based in western Sweden is conducted to generate a theory of how autonomy and community are related to their ambitions and capabilities to scale up their operations. The results indicate that for scaling up, autonomy is a more important factor than community, while communities of interest are more likely to scale up than communities of place. A provisional theory on possibilities for community energy to scale up is developed based on the case study results.ConclusionsEven when upscaling is the will and ambition of a community energy initiative, neither autonomy nor community alone is a guarantee for it to happen-yet in combination, the likelihood increases: with autonomy as a prerequisite for action, and community as a motivation for action. Both communities of place and of interest can act as a motivational force and mobilise resources. Yet local rootedness can be difficult to combine with upscaling beyond a certain point, while a community of interest lacks physical borders. If regulators are keen on counteracting the community energy trap, our research suggests that they need to intervene and support these initiatives-yet without intruding on their autonomy.

AB  - This study deals with production and wood quality of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (MIRBEL) FRANCO). The growth of Douglas fir was compared with the growth of Norway spruce under the conditions of the School Forest Enterprise at Kostelec nad Cernymi lesy. The diameter, height, volume of the mean tree and the volume stock per hectare were used as the input for the model growth assessment. Douglas fir achieved considerably higher values than Norway spruce in all the indicators. The volume of the mean tree of Douglas fir was almost three times that of the spruce, and the volume stock of Douglas fir was more than 35 % greater. Wood density, shrinkage, compression strength, bending strength, impact strength and hardness were tested on representative sample trees to evaluate the wood quality. Douglas fir wood quality was comparable to its native habitat. Compared to the native commercial softwoods, Douglas fir wood was similar to that of Norway spruce or Scots pine.

AB  - It is often conceptually suggested that frameworks for the practice of corporate social responsibility (CSR) that take all the needs of a company's stakeholders into consideration can emanate from management systems based on international standards. This study addresses the research question of whether the adoption of established management systems is useful for putting stakeholder management into practice. It takes the form of an in-depth case study of a Swedish mining and metals company and employs an analytical framework based on the ISO 26000 CSR standard. The company in question has well-integrated and implemented work systems regarding both labor practices and the environment. This indicates that certified management systems are effective tools for CSR and can be used rather effectively as a means of stakeholder management in practice. However, analysis also shows that such management systems contribute neither to the use of more renewable energy resources nor to a systematic reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition, important CSR issues, such as fair operating practices and community involvement and development, fall outside the scope of the adopted management system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) are among the main causes of global biodiversity loss. Invasive brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black (R.rattus) rats, in particular, are leading drivers of extinction on islands, especially in the case of seabirds where >50% of all extinctions have been attributed to rat predation. Eradication is the primary form of invasive rat management, yet this strategy has resulted in a similar to 10-38% failure rate on islands globally. Genetic tools can help inform IAS management, but such applications to date have been largely reactive, time-consuming, and costly. Here, we developed a Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel for rapid species identification and population assignment of invasive brown and black rats (RapidRat) in Haida Gwaii, an archipelago comprising similar to 150 islands off the central coast of British Columbia, Canada. We constructed an optimized panel of 443 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using previously generated double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) genotypic data (27,686 SNPs) from brown (n= 295) and black rats (n= 241) sampled throughout Haida Gwaii. The informativeness of this panel for identifying individuals to species and island of origin was validated relative to the ddRAD results; in all comparisons, admixture coefficients and population assignments estimated using RapidRat were consistent. To demonstrate application, 20 individuals from novel invasions of three islands (Agglomerate, Hotspring, Ramsay) were genotyped using RapidRat, all of which were confidently assigned (>98.5% probability) to Faraday and Murchison Islands as putative source populations. These results indicated that a previous eradication on Hotspring Island was conducted at an inappropriate geographic scale; future management should expand the eradication unit to include neighboring islands to prevent re-invasion. Overall, we demonstrated that RapidRat is an effective tool for managing invasive rat populations in Haida Gwaii and provided a clear framework for GT-seq panel development for informing biodiversity conservation in other systems.

AB  - Biomass for energy conversion is usually considered as a local resource. With appropriate logistic systems, access to biomass can be improved over a large geographical area. In this study, life cycle inventory (LCI) has been used as a method to investigate the environmental load of selected bioenergy transport chains. As a case study, chains starting in Sweden and ending in Holland have been investigated. Biomass originates from tree sections or forest residues, the latter upgraded to bales or pellets. The study is concentrated on production of electricity, hot cooling water is considered as a loss. Electricity is, in the case study, produced from solid biomass in the importing country. Electricity can also be produced in the country of origin and exported via the transnational grid as transportation medium. The results show that emissions from long range transportation, 1200 km, performed with ships, is of minor importance compared to emissions from local bioenergy systems in a local market. In bioenergy systems the use of fuels and electricity for operating machines and transportation carriers requires a net energy input which amounts to typically 7-9% of delivered electrical energy from the system. Emissions of key substances such as NOx, CO, S, hydrocarbons, and particles are low in a perspective of sustainability. Emissions of CO2 from bio-combustion are considered to be zero since there is approximately no net contribution of carbon to the biosphere in an energy system based on biomass. The results indicate that biomass for energy can be transported from Scandinavia to Holland without losing its environmental benefits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As a result of air pollution, the content of Hg in fish has significantly increased in a large part of Scandinavia and North America.  In this paper, the occurrence and fluxes of Hg in Swedish forest soils and waters are reviewed and synthesized.  The main objective is to describe and evaluate the present transport of anthropogenic Hg from atmospheric deposition, through the terrestrial compartment and running waters to lake basins and also to comprehend the main factors influencing these fluxes.  The transportation and distribution of Hg in forest soils and waters is closely related to the flow of organic matter.  The content of Hg in humic matter is higher in southern and central areas compared to the north of the country.  Compared to background concentrations, the Hg content has increased in the southern and central part by about a factor of 4-7, while the overall increase in the north is by about a factor of 2 to 3.  The increased content of Hg in forest soils may have an effect on organisms and biological processes in the soil.  Regarding budget calculations for whole catchment areas and for the mor layer of the soil, a reduction of about 80 % from present atmospheric wet deposition must be obtained to reach "critical load" with respect to conditions in Scandinavia.

AB  - Objectives: This study explores pedestrian fall accidents and collisions with other road users in the Swedish road transport system, and sickness absence (SA) in relation to accident type, injury, and occupation. Further, it studies the associations between accident type, occupation, and duration of SA.Methods: Data from several national registers were used that included 15,359 working age pedestrians (20-64 years) receiving healthcare after a fall or collision throughout 2014-2016. Individual characteristics, accident type, injury, and occupation were presented and related to SA. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR), with 95% confidence intervals, for associations between accident type, occupation, and SA duration.Results: About 11,000 pedestrians (72%) were involved in fall accidents in the road traffic environment and well over 4,000 in collisions with another road user; 22% of all injured pedestrians had a new SA. The population had a higher proportion of women and individuals in older age groups (>= 45). Of the falls, 31% were due to snow or ice, and these were associated with a higher OR for both short SA (<90 days) 1.76 (95% CI 1.56-1.98) and long SA (>= 90 days) 1.81 (95% CI 1.51- 2.18), compared to the group slipping, tripping, and stumbling. The working sectors health & social care, and construction had the highest ORs for SA. A higher OR was found for health & social care, short SA 1.58 (95% CI 1.38-1.81), long SA 1.79 (95% CI 1.45-2.20) and for construction, short SA 1.56 (95% CI 1.24-1.96), long SA 1.75 (95% CI 1.26-2.44), compared to the sector finance, communication, & cultural service.Conclusions: The OR for having short and long SA was higher in falls due to snow or ice and differed between occupational sectors. Practical implications: This information contributes to the knowledge base for planning a safe road transport system for pedestrians.

AB  - The generalist tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector for tick-borne pathogens (TBP), including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, in Europe. However, the involvement of other sympatric Ixodes ticks, such as the specialist vole tick I. trianguliceps, in the enzootic circulations of TBP remains unclear. We studied the distribution of I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps in Central Finland and estimated the TBP infection likelihood in the most common rodent host in relation with the abundance of the two tick species. Ixodes trianguliceps was encountered in all 16 study sites whereas I. ricinus was frequently observed only at a quarter of the study sites. The abundance of I. ricinus was positively associated with open water coverage and human population density around the study sites. Borrelia burgdorferi s. l.-infected rodents were found only in sites where I. ricinus was abundant, whereas the occurrence of other TBP was independent of I. ricinus presence. These results suggest that I. trianguliceps is not sufficient, at least alone, in maintaining the circulation of B. burgdorferi s. l. in wild hosts. In addition, anthropogenic factors might affect the distribution of I. ricinus ticks and, hence, their pathogens, thus shaping the landscape of tick-borne disease risk for humans.

AB  - The ability of single lichen species to colonise annual shoots of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) under a variety of microclimatic conditions was assessed. Lichens were found to colonise the annual shoots of conifer saplings relatively slowly. Hypogymnia physodes is almost invariably the first sorediate species to attach to the bark whereas the other sorediate species appear only exceptionally on shoots in their first couple of years. The age of the substrate seems to be less important to pendulous species, however, probably due to their ability to reproduce also by thallus fragmentation and not only by soredia or spores as most other species do. The majority of the species colonise the annual shoots of spruce faster than those of pine, which suggests that bark exfoliation can effectively hinder colonisation. The colonisation rate of most of the species is clearly reduced under open canopy emphasising the importance of diaspore supply from lichens growing on mature trees.

We use a case study approach and focus on one of the greenest municipalities in Europe, Va center dot xjo center dot municipality in Sweden. With empirical results supporting the existence of several phases during the implementation process, our research offers two important contributions. First, it provides additional insight in the set of motives for the use of PMS during different development phases. Main stakeholders, politicians and managers of municipal de-partments and municipality owned companies, have revealed several "layers" of motives, which have shaped the development of the PMS. Second, the research also show that the PMS has a noticeable symbolic importance in promoting and communicating the green strategy to citizens and businesses in the region.

AB  - Adoption of various smart control-compatible heating systems is increasing in the heating market. Simultaneously, smart electricity control, often referred to as demand side management (DSM), has raised interest as a core enabler of future sustainable cities. The technological viability of DSM is increasingly researched, but its profitability for real estate has remained unclear. This study examines the economics and environmental implications of DSM by analyzing an energy model using hourly-level energy consumption data in Finland. Accordingly, this study observes new cash flows generated after a daily 2-hour peak shaving of a ground-source heat pump pool in the Helsinki region. Although, DSM decreased the pool's peak electricity consumption, the economic potential of smartness was only 0.03 euro/sqm/year, equaling 1% of savings in the energy costs. Furthermore, DSM generated surprisingly low (i.e., 0.02%) reduction in carbon emissions. Despite of the current minor benefits for the real estate owners in the Finnish power market, the end-user smart electricity control likely has a crucial role in the future electricity system with large quantities of intermittent renewable production. Thus, engaging real estate owners in DSM through alternative (monetary) incentives, and other strategic benefits, is essential to support the future energy system decarbonization.

AB  - Oil and Gas (O&G) platforms in the North Sea are facing aging problems as many of the installations have matured and are approaching their design lifetime. Flow lines are used to transport oil and gas well stream from the wellhead to the production manifold. They are categorised as one of the most critical components on a production facility. Flow line degradation takes place due to corrosion and erosion. The deterioration of a flowline may increase the risk of leakages, ruptures, etc., which shall lead to serious HSE (health, safety and environmental) and financial consequences. Any such risks have a direct impact on the O&G installation's technical integrity as well as the operator's sustainability concerns. Conventionally, pipelines are designed with safety provisions to provide a theoretical minimum failure rate over the life span. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of failure various techniques are routinely used to monitor the status of pipelines during the operation phase. The existing methods of flowline health monitoring planning requires one to take into consideration the operator's plant strategy, flowline degradation mechanisms, historical data, etc.
   A technical condition report is made based on findings' reports and degradation trends. This report recommends the inspection of a number of points on the flowlines in a certain year using non-destructive evaluation methods such as visual inspection, ultrasonic testing, radiographic testing, etc. Based on the technical condition report, in general for a certain preventive maintenance shutdown, 10 to 15 flowline inspection openings are accommodated as finance, time and resource availability are taken into consideration. However, it is customary to plan to open more locations in a certain inspection package than can be inspected and minimization of such points is at present done on an ad hoc basis. This paper suggests a formal model and a framework to formally minimize the number of visual inspections by executing the plant strategy as well as HSE concerns. The model is derived using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) framework, which is a multi-criteria decision-making approach. The model is developed based on literature, industrial practice, experience as well as real inspection data from a mature offshore O&G installation located on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.

AB  - The growing understanding of the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events due to climate change demands action. Locally, measures to adapt must be taken without knowing exactly what will happen, where it will happen or what the consequences will be. To meet this need, a number of decision support tools have been developed and this article investigates how municipalities can implement Robust Decision support in their urban planning. Interviews with respondents from the municipalities were conducted. After this a series of workshops were held, where an RDM method was used on local situations and follow-up interviews assessed the success and potential of the tool. Results suggest that the process addresses uncertainty, encourages bottom-up approaches and provides a tool for creating adaptive pathways in a clear and concise manner. Despite these promising findings, the success of implementation on a broader scale is seen as limited due to organizational factors.

AB  - We studied depredation rates on free-ranging domestic sheep (Ovis aries) bv Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in 2 areas in Norway to test whether selected individuals or a demographic group within a lynx population kill a disproportionate share of livestock. During 6 grazing seasons from 1994 to 1999, we monitored 34 radiocollared lynx during 641 tracking periods (either all night or during a full 24-hr period). Sixty-three domestic sheep and 3 domestic goats were killed by radiocollared lynx during these periods. All of the radiocollared lynx had access to free-ranging domestic sheep within their annual home ranges. Male lynx killed sheep more frequently than females and were responsible for 12 out of 13 cases of surplus killing. After adjusting for number of nights monitored, sheep-killing rates among males differed slightly, whereas the differences between individual females were correlated with the number of sheep available. There were no indications of any special "problem individuals," but rather a "problem sex." There fore, it seems to be intrinsic in their behavior that males are likely to kill domestic animals more frequently than females. The lack of specific problem individuals in this study might depend on the livestock-herding technique used in Norway, where sheep generally are free-ranging and unattended throughout a lynx's home range. Selective removal of depredating males requires that the gap in the social mosaic either remains unfilled or is filled by an individual that causes less damage to livestock. The effects of such removal on sheep depredation are likely to be only temporary since all adult and yearling male lynx appear to kill sheep.

AB  - To investigate the effects of urbanization on carabid beetles (Carabidae) and ground dwelling spiders (Araneae) a study was completed along a 20 km urban-rural forest gradient in the Helsinki-Espoo area of southern Finland. To study changes in assemblage structure, abundance and species richness, these taxa were collected in the year 2000 using pitfall traps, which had been placed in four forest sites within each of the urban, suburban and rural zones. We expected to find changes in the abundances and species richnesses in the two taxa across the urban-rural gradient, but did not find any. Our second and third hypotheses, stating that generalist species and small-bodied species should gain dominance along the gradient from rural to urban sites, were partly supported as carabid specialists were more characteristic of suburban and rural environments whereas generalists were more likely to be collected from rural areas compared to suburban or urban sites. Furthermore, medium to large-sized carabid individuals were more likely to be collected in the rural sites compared to urban forests. We found no evidence for significant changes in spider abundance or species richness across the urban-rural gradient in relation to body size or habitat specialization. We suggest that urbanization does not have significant effects on the total abundances and species richnesses in these two taxa. However, individual species responded differently to urbanization, and there were significant differences in the specialization and body sizes of carabids across the gradient.

AB  - Simple Summary Horse grazing may benefit biodiversity. This study compared the effect of horses grazing year-round to that of mowing on pasture quality in a forest-grassland landscape in Sweden. Twelve Gotlandsruss stallions were kept in three enclosures (similar to 0.35 horse/hectare) without supplementary feeding for 2.5 years. Each enclosure contained three exclosures where pasture was not grazed, but mown monthly. Horse grazing increased the diversity of pasture nutrient content. Moreover, energy and protein concentrations and grass availability increased in areas grazed by horses, but decreased where grass was mown. This indicates that year-round grazing can be used to increase biodiversity, a suggestion supported by botanical observations. Nutrient content in horses' droppings was found to correlate with nutrient content in pasture, so analysis of droppings may be used to roughly estimate the quality of pasture consumed by horses. Under the conditions studied, pasture protein content was sufficient to meet horse requirements year-round, while energy content and pasture availability may have been limited in winter. Monthly data presented here on the nutritive value of pasture can help guide the management of year-round grazing systems in the Nordic countries. Horse grazing may benefit biodiversity, but the impact of year-round grazing on nutrient dynamics has not been evaluated previously. This study compared pasture quality in a forest-grassland landscape grazed year-round by horses with that in exclosed mown areas. Twelve Gotlandsruss stallions were kept without supplementary feeding in three enclosures (similar to 0.35 horse/ha) outside Uppsala, Sweden, from May 2014 to September 2016. Each enclosure contained three mown exclosures, where grass sward samples were collected monthly and analyzed for chemical composition and vegetation density. Fecal grab samples were collected and analyzed for crude protein (CP) and organic matter (OM) content. There were no differences in exclosure pasture energy or CP content between enclosures (p > 0.05). In grazed areas, there were differences in grass energy and CP content (p > 0.05) between enclosures. During the three summers studied, energy and CP content increased in the enclosures, but decreased in the exclosures. By the end, biomass content/ha was greater in the enclosures than in the exclosures. Fecal OM and CP content showed moderate to strong correlations with pasture nutrient content (r = 0.3-0.8, p < 0.05). Thus, in contrast to monthly mowing, horse grazing diversified pasture chemical composition and increased its nutritive value.

AB  - In Denmark, several political initiatives have been taken to reduce use of pesticides and fertilizer in order to avoid unwanted side effect of the increasing cropping intensification. Based on two nation wide surveys we investigate flora changes and discuss the changes in relation to biodiversity, crop yield, agricultural management and climate. Our assumption is that the surveys are representative for the country. We present frequency analyses of 90 species recorded in 157 fields surveyed in 1987-89, and in 167 fields surveyed in 2001-04. Based on 4910 circular sample plots in unsprayed areas, we studied flora changes in four crops and showed that the frequency of many weed species have increased. Particularly some winter annual species (e.g. Veronica arvensis L. and Viola arvensis Murray), grass weeds (Poa annua L.. Apera spica-venti (L) P. Beauv.) and nitrophileous species (e.g. Capsella bursa-pastoris (L) Medik, Cirsium arvense (L Scop.), Galium aparine L, Fallopia convolvulus (L) A. Lowe, Tripleurospermum inodorum (L) Sch. Bip.) have been favoured. Some weeds have declined in some crops but increased in other crops (e.g. Chenopodiurn album L, Geranium pusillum L), while only a few species declined in one crop without increasing in other crops (e.g. Elytrigia repens (L) Desv. ex Nevski; Sinapis arvensis L). Our data indicate that continuously increasing productivity (increasing yields) seems to be possible simultaneously with enhancing the frequency of the wild flora in arable crops.

AB  - Large-scale plantations were established under the Grain for Green project to improve the ecological environment of the Loess Plateau (LP) of China. However, there are increasing concerns regarding the sustainability of plantation ecosystems under climate change. In this study, we developed tree-ring width chronologies of Pinus tabulaeformis at seven sites along a precipitation gradient from south to north in the LP. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate the climate (temperature, precipitation, self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index)-growth relationship. Moreover, the tree resilience components were computed to study the adaptability of trees to extreme drought during the growth periods. The results showed that the differences in radial growth to climate change along the precipitation gradient and the cluster analysis of the tree ring width index (RWI)-scPDSI correlation coefficient illustrated that the climate-growth response pattern along the LP was divided into southern and northern regions. Tree growth in the southern region is limited by humid environment conditions, while tree growth in the early and middle growing seasons of the northern region is limited by warming-induced drought. As the temperature rising over the past fifty years, the growth was found to be negatively correlated with temperature, especially in the spring and autumn seasons of the northern region. In contrast, the effect of precipitation on tree growth became more negative in the southern region, but more positive in the middle and late growing seasons of the northern region. Moreover, tree resilience analysis showed that the high resistance of Pinus tabulaeformis in the southern region, whereas high recovery in the northern region. It was difficult for the growth of Pinus tabulaeformis to recover from drought in the southern region, but stronger adaptability to extreme drought events in the northern region. Our study illustrated that there are different climate response patterns and limiting factors of Pinus tabulaeformis along the precipitation gradient in the LP; thus, different ecological restoration and regional forestry management strategies should be initiated in the LP.

AB  - Sustainable forest management practices and the increased interest of plantation forestry in species mixtures require an understanding of individual-tree growth in complex and diverse forests. Individual-tree growth has been found to be affected by factors such as species identity and size of the target tree as well as of neighboring trees, neighbor density and abiotic factors. However, most of these studies have been conducted in plantations or mixed forests with a very limited number of species. We conducted our study in a subtropical forest in China, which was very species rich and highly heterogeneous with regard to topography (slope inclination and aspect, elevation) and successional status. Prior to our study the forest was subjected to an exceptional snow break event. We asked whether individual-tree basal area increment (BAI) over three growing seasons following the snow break event was related to local biotic and abiotic conditions. We hypothesized that individual-tree BAI is negatively affected by local neighborhood competition, positively affected by local neighborhood diversity, negatively related to slope inclination, and positively related to aspect to south. Individual-tree BAI of four different species was mainly affected by tree size, local neighborhood competition and species identity. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe significant effects of local neighborhood functional diversity and abiotic conditions. However, we did find a negative effect of plot functional diversity on BAI. This finding may be explained by a negative correlation of plot functional diversity and snow break damage, which was observed in mid-and late-successional stages. The disturbance event did considerably change the competitive local neighborhood interactions by reducing competition, which increased the BAI of target trees in more disturbed/more diverse plots.

AB  - Names constitute a key component of the cultural heritage of any region. Though geographically, culturally and linguistically apart, Estonia and Zambia share some elements and motivations in naming. Zambia's British colonial experience and Estonia's Danish, German, Polish, Swedish and Russian/Soviet influence in the past made significant changes to personal and place names in both regions. Following independence, both states made strides in the indigenisation of names for promoting local heritage and national identity. Zambia predominantly focused on changing the names of some towns, and of the country (from Northern Rhodesia to Zambia). On the other hand, the Estonian onomastic experience has been more comprehensive - regulating both personal and place names, enacting corresponding laws and maintaining the Institute of the Estonian Language to oversee language and name planning, among other responsibilities.

AB  - On September 18-27, 2017, six international, interdisciplinary CEEPUS Summer Schools took place in Gliwice, all focusing on one joint project: "Interdisciplinary Approach in Shaping Sustainable Public Space". One of the fundamental objectives of summer schools, organized in one place and time, was interdisciplinary integration and the development of teamwork in groups consisting of people specialized in different fields of study. Participants from each of the schools had the task to plan and shape public space of the University's campus, each approaching the problem according to one's specialization, also taking into account the needs of other schools. Participants of each of the schools had their own directional classes, but also participated in common lectures and workshops, which gave them the opportunity to broaden their understanding of the project, as well as the necessity of an interdisciplinary and team approach to this type of projects. Another important goal of summer schools was the international integration and developing teamwork skills, while communicating solely in English.
   The schools had a rich program consisting of lectures, project work, tours and workshops, the aim of which was to broaden the knowledge in the fields of: management of critical infrastructure, safety engineering, ergonomics, use of innovative building materials and techniques in creation of urban space, urban-architectural design, manage energy systems and control and broadly understood engineering design.
   Silesian University of Technology was first to propose such an interdisciplinary, novelty form, which gained the recognition of the national Office for CEEPUS Program, PhD students and lecturers. Organizers of the schools hope, that the cooperation established during the event will provide various interesting collaboration opportunities for our institution and befriended young scientists, who will become ambassadors of the Silesian University of Technology in their home countries.
   Participants of this year's schools included over 50 PhD students and academic teachers from Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Poland, Macedonia, as well as lecturers from Spain and Sweden.
   All six schools were led by six tutors who represent different specializations. Tutors' experience have been described in the article: starting from the problematics of interdisciplinary cooperation up to common work on school programme for such a group. Authors anticipate that such approach can be innovative and promising. Authors believe, that conclusions from the experimental summer school will be useful for similar upcoming events.

AB  - Aim. The aim of the research is to identify intergenerational communication problems in tourism and hospitality enterprises and define teaching/learning initiatives and methodologies required to develop employees' competencies to solve intergenerational communication problems.Methods. 12 semi-structured expert interviews with tourism and hospitality business owners and/or top-level management in three countries (Lithuania, Latvia, and Sweden) were conducted to collect information on generational differences in communication and intergenerational communication problems in the company. Qualitative content analysis was applied for data analysis.Results. Nine main groups of intergenerational communication problems have been detected and corresponding teaching/learning initiatives and methodologies that take into account the specific characteristics of each generation are recommen-ded to eliminate each of the problems identified.Conclusion. Generational differences and differences in communication lead to intergenerational communication conflicts in tourism and hospitality enterprises. The suggestions on organising adult learners' teaching/learning process based on generational differences may be applicable in workplace learning and also in edu-cational institutions providing adult education.Cognitive value. The paper focusses on analysing intergenerational aspects in communication processes in tourism and hospitality enterprises and offers the means of solving communication conflicts by employing certain adult teaching/ learning initiatives and methodologies suitable to non-formal and formal adult learning.

AB  - The main objective of the study was to calculate net atmospheric impacts for wood production and utilization in Finnish boreal forest conditions. Net atmospheric impacts were calculated by comparing net CO2 exchanges of the wood production and utilization to the reference management regime. Net CO2 exchanges were simulated with a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool for a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand (MT, Myrtillys-type) in central Finland (Joensuu region, 62A degrees 39 N, 29A degrees 37 E) over two consecutive rotation periods (100 + 100 years/200 years). Net atmospheric impacts were calculated both for sawn timber and pulpwood, and expressed in kgCO(2)m(-3). According to the results, the production of pulp and sawn timber produced emissions of 0.20 and 0.59 kgCO(2)m(-3) over the 200-year period, respectively, when the unmanagement regime was used as the reference management regime. When 50 % of the processing waste of timber was accounted as an instant emission to the atmosphere, the atmospheric impact increased to 0.55 kgCO(2)m(-3) in pulpwood and to 1.27 kgCO(2)m(-3) in sawn timber over the 200 year period. When turnover rates of sawn timber in the technosystem were decreased by 30 % and the share of energy use was decreased to 30 %, the atmospheric impact decreased by 17 % and 4 % for pulpwood and sawn timber, respectively, compared to the default wood degradation and energy use of 50 %. The utilized LCA approach provided an effective tool for approaching net atmospheric impacts originating from the ecosystem carbon (C) flows and variable wood utilization. Taking the ecosystem production and utilization of wood (i.e. degradation of technosystem C stock) into account, in terms of net CO2 exchange, the mitigation possibilities of wood compared to other products can be accounted for more precisely in the future and C sequestration credited more specifically for a certain wood product.

AB  - Paleofire records document fire's response to climate, ecosystem changes, and human-activity, offering insights into climate-fire-human relationships and the potential response of fire to anthropogenic climate change. We present three new lake sediment PAH records and a charcoal record from the Lofoten Islands, Norway to evaluate the Holocene fire history of northern Norway and examine human impacts on fire in this region. All three datasets show an increase in PAH accumulation rate over the past c. 7500 cal years BP, with an increase c. 5000 cal years BP that signals initial human impacts on fire activity. More significant increases c. 3500 cal years BP reach a maximum c. 2000 cal years BP that correlates with the establishment and expansion of agricultural settlements in Lofoten during the Late Bronze Age and Pre-Roman Iron Age. Decreased PAH accumulation rates c. 1500-900 cal years BP reflect less burning during the Late Iron Age and early medieval period. A shift toward higher molecular weight PAHs and increasing PAHs overall from c. 1000 cal years BP to present, reflects intensified human activity. Sedimentary charcoal (>125 and 63-125 & mu;m) in the Lauvdalsvatnet record does not vary until an increase in the last 900 years, showing a proxy insensitivity to human-caused fire. The Late-Holocene increase in fire activity in Lofoten follows trends in regional charcoal records, but exhibits two distinct phases of increased fire that reflect the intensity of burning due to human landscape changes that overwhelm the signal of natural variations in regional fire activity.

AB  - Aim Urbanization can lead to uniformity in urban bird communities, and the general biogeographical patterns found in natural communities may not be found in urban ones. Thus, it is important to know if urbanization might be seen as contributing to a general pattern that modifies the biogeographical processes of wildlife communities.
   Location We studied differences in suburban bird assemblages in France and Finland. Birds in each town included in the study were surveyed using 30 ha suburban study plots located within single-family housing area and apartment block area.
   Methods The wintering birds were surveyed using a single-visit study plot method in January and February 1999. The level of urbanization was measured according to the general structure of the habitat by using the town maps and field notes. In addition, we counted active winter feeding stations during bird surveys.
   Results The average number of species was higher in France than in Finland, both in single-family house areas and in apartment block areas. The most abundant bird species occurred in most of the study sites. The urbanization level affected bird community composition more in northern Finland than in France. In Finland, the number of wintering species and their total biomass were higher in single-house areas than in more urbanized areas. The total density and biomass of birds were higher in France than in Finland in areas of apartment blocks, but not in the areas of single-houses. Urbanization level affected the total bird density only in France, being higher in areas of apartment blocks. In Finland, the total biomass of birds was higher in the single-family house areas than in the areas of apartment blocks. Most of the bird species were more abundant in France than in Finland. The habitat factors associated with the bird community variables in France and in Finland differed from one another. Feeding tables increased the species richness and the abundance of birds in Finland.
   Conclusions The species decrease between France and Finland was mainly because of the large proportion of species in France that are migratory in northern Finland. The abundance of urban birds did not necessarily decrease northwards. Intensive winter feeding in northern latitudes may help birds to overcome natural range limitations. Our results differed from results obtained when studying town centres and they highlight the complexity of the urbanization process across a geographical gradient.

AB  - We investigated the effects of edge structure (i.e. side-canopy openness based on tree, sapling and shrub characteristics, and the composition of tree species) on the understorey vegetation at mesic urban conifer-dominated forest edges in southern Finland. Forest edge structure had an effect on understorey vegetation. and on the spatial extent of the edge effect into the forests. At open edges the edge effect (in terms of the abundances of understorey vegetation) penetrated at least up to 30 m into the forest patches whereas closed edges may prevent these effects. A multilayered canopy with saplings and shrubs at the edge is important to alleviate the effects of the edge. We found that 225-250 m(3) ha(-1) of trees (diameter at breast height (dbh) > 5 cm) is adequate to restrict the edge effect near the edge. However, the number of broad-leaved trees may be high at edges which, in turn, diminishes the abundance of mosses and favours; herb species, thus changing the original natural understorey vegetation composition. Therefore we recommend that conifers be favoured at the edges of mesic conifer-dominated forest patches if the purpose is to restrict the extent of the effects of habitat edges. The appropriate proportion of conifers at these edges should be 80% or more. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates disagreement over how to respond to the establishment of asylum seeker centres in local communities. Building on interviews with individuals in one rural and one urban community in Norway, we analyse experiences and outcomes of the neighbourhood information meetings organized by the Directorate of Immigration before opening the new centres. We demonstrate that such meetings hold a broader social function, and they become arenas to raise concerns and manage disagreement among neighbours. When anti-immigrant opinions expressed at the meetings are published in the media, community members counter the negative place representations that are not aligned with their own self-identification. We identify three strategies of contestation deployed to counter negative media coverage: foreseeing conflict, claiming exceptionalism and mobilization to volunteer. Broader implications involve immigration authorities' management of conflict when establishing such centres; their scope should not be limited to host-guest relations but should include horizontal contestation within the community.

AB  - Road freight transportation is the most common mode of long-distance timber transportation. This study assesses the environmental impacts of the larger and heavier vehicles on emission efficiency for 76 t vehicles using the synchronized calculation method. The method took account of two factors: load mass and the migration of loads to heavier vehicles. The method was successfully tested to calculate emission efficiency after the short-term adaptation process. Calculations were made for four mass limits (60, 64, 68 and 76 t) year after the mass limits were raised. Based on Enterprise Resource Planning data, efficiency of CO2 emissions (measured in relation to trip) increased 15.8% for 76 t vehicles. Respectively, CO2 emissions reduced 6.2% to 42.8 g/tkm. The results show that increase in maximum vehicle mass yields cleaner wood procurement chain in pulp production process. This study confirms that the synchronized calculation method can be used in real-world transport systems and local wood supply chains to determine and solve emission efficiencies of larger and heavier vehicle combinations.

AB  - The drivers of the long-term development of high-mountain woodlands are still unexplored in the central European mountains north of the Alps, where archaeologists and palaeoecologists traditionally report no significant human influences on vegetation before the late Middle Ages. Recent but fragmentary palaeoecological reports are gradually changing this paradigm. We analysed a peat profile from a high-elevation fen on the southern edge of the Western Carpathians, where proximity to warm lowlands may have facilitated prehistoric use of the higher elevations. We found that the formation of the studied fen in the Bronze Age could have been triggered by anthropogenic deforestation. This event is indicated by an extraordinarily high amount of micro- and macro-charcoals and the presence of secondary anthropogenic and open-landscape indicators. Grazing of the summit areas was further evidenced by records of spores of coprophilous fungi (Sporormiella, Sordaria-t. and Podospora-t.). As microcharcoals were present only in the prehistoric period and almost disappeared later (after ad 200), fires were likely used to deforest the range to obtain open land, which was later intensively grazed. Archaeological reports from the area, especially Bronze Age records from foothills and mountain basins, suggest that people settled in the vast area and might have needed to graze the nearby summit range during the summer. The most significant and abrupt transition from woodlands to grasslands coincided with the Mining and Wallachian colonisation waves. These waves altered the original course of the development and composition of mountain forests, highlighting their sensitivity to severe anthropogenic disturbance. In the last two centuries, the exploitation of the woodlands has decreased. Secondary succession, together with commercial planting, has led to the dominance of the Norway spruce. Together with the previous patchy record, our results call for a new paradigm to consider early prehistoric anthropogenic influences like grazing in the Central European high mountains. The history of treeless vegetation at higher altitudes is likely substantially older than has been thought so far.

AB  - Global water scarcity is a severe threat facing humanity today and it is expected to become even more alarming in the future. Agriculture is the biggest user of freshwater and large volumes of embedded virtual water in food products are traded through the global food system annually. Although Finland has vast water resources, it imports large quantities of virtual water-partly from countries suffering from water scarcity. In this article, we present a novel combination of the virtual water study together with an analysis of the potential reallocation of the outsourced production of rice, soybeans and rapeseed, from the water resource-efficiency point of view. To assess how Finland could reduce the outsourced water consumption by these three crops, we evaluated Finland's potential to replace their imports with local comparable products: domestic barley and oats, field peas and faba beans, and rapeseed, respectively. This replacement would both potentially ease the global pressure on already stressed regions and increase the agricultural diversity of the local agricultural systems. We found that by replacing the imports of the selected crops, considering the realistic potential in Finland, up to 16% of the blue water and almost 30% of the green water embedded in crop imports could be reduced. Although Finland is a minor player in the global food markets, our study presents a highly relevant case of how an industrialized country, with a relatively small population, can contribute to the sustainability of food systems globally.

AB  - Citizen science data (CSD) have the potential to be a powerful scientific approach to assess, monitor and predict biodiversity. Here, we ask whether CSD could be used to predict biodiversity of recently constructed man-made habitats. Biodiversity data on adult dragonfly abundance from all kinds of aquatic habitats collected by citizen scientists (volunteers) were retrieved from the Swedish Species Observation System and were compared with dragonfly abundance in man-made stormwater ponds. The abundance data of dragonflies in the stormwater ponds were collected with a scientific, standardized design. Our results showed that the citizen science datasets differed significantly from datasets collected scientifically in stormwater ponds. Hence, we could not predict biodiversity in stormwater ponds from the data collected by citizen scientists. Using CSD from past versus recent years or from small versus large areas surrounding the stormwater ponds did not change the outcome of our tests. However, we found that biodiversity patterns obtained with CSD were similar to those from stormwater ponds when we restricted our analyses to rare species. We also found a higher beta diversity for the CSD compared to the stormwater dataset. Our results suggest that if CSD are to be used for estimating or predicting biodiversity, we need to develop methods that take into account or correct for the under-reporting of common species in CSD.

AB  - Seeking to develop a novel understanding of how climate policy innovation (CPI) emerges and spreads, we conceptualise three types of CPIs - genuinely original, diffusion based, and reframing based - and relate these to the sociotechnical transitions literature, particularly the multi-level perspective (MLP) that explains change through interaction between 'niche', 'regime', and 'landscape' levels. Selected climate-related transport policies in Finland, Sweden, and the UK are used to illustrate five hypotheses that connect these concepts from the MLP to particular types of CPI. 'Original' policy innovation may be uncommon in contexts with major sunk investments such as transport, principally because sociotechnical regimes tend to be resistant to political pressures for change originating at the same level. Nonetheless, the MLP posits that regimes are subject to influence by pressures originating at both niche and landscape levels. Given that policy reframing is relatively common, it may offer a key entry point for CPI in the short to medium term.

AB  - Remediation of groundwater from landfill contamination presents a serious challenge due to the complex mixture of contaminants discharged from landfills. Here, we show the significance of a nature-based solution to a landfill-contaminated aquifer in southeast Norway. Groundwater physicochemical parameters monitored for twenty-eight years were used as a proxy to infer natural remediation. Results show that concentrations of the major chemical variables decreased with time and distance until they tailed off. An exception to this was sulphate, which showed an increase, but apparently, exhibits a stationary phase. The water types were found to be most similar between samples from active landfill and post-closure stages, while samples from the stabilised stage showed a different water type. All the chemical parameters of samples from the stabilised stage were found to be within the Norwegian drinking water standards, except iron and manganese, which were only marginally above the limits, an indication of a possible recovery of this aquifer. The findings highlight the significance of natural attenuation processes in remediating contaminated aquifers and have significant consequences for future contamination management, where natural remediation can be viewed as an alternative worth exploring. This is promising in the wake of calls for sustainable remediation management strategies.

AB  - Several multi-criteria decision support methods have been introduced to sustainable management of natural resources, but different methods suit different planning situations. One way to support decision-making is to apply voting theory. In this study, a multi-criteria decision-support method based on voting theory, called multicriteria approval (MA), is applied to wood supply chain management in a forest area owned by the state of Finland. The area is called Leikko and is located in the rural municipality of Pieksamaki. MA seems to have some promising features in relation to participatory decision support. The most essential advantages are its ease and comprehensibility. MA is also able to deal with ordinal and imprecise information. Since the method does not demand much preference information from interest groups, the inquiries may be conducted using the Internet. In the case study, nine timber-harvesting alternatives were devised for the forest area. The study involved seven interest groups, whose representatives defined seven criteria by which the alternatives were compared. The purpose was to find a consensus or compromise solution for a practical harvesting schedule. Two different versions of MA were tested and compared from the participatory decision-support aspect. Usability and ease of method, the comprehensibility of the inquiries, and the congruence of the results were examined.

AB  - Changes in agriculture and food production are essential in a transition towards sustainable food systems. The challenge is to ensure sufficient, healthy and sustainable nutrition for the growing global population with limited natural resources. Current agricultural policies in Western countries favour specialised large-scale farms that are associated with negative impacts on animal welfare, food safety and the environment. One proposed solution for organising sustainable food systems in the future is cellular agriculture, a food production method based on in vitro cell cultivation techniques. However, the impacts of cellular agriculture on livestock farmers have not been extensively studied. This study explores livestock farmers' perceptions of cellular agriculture, as it will potentially impact farming and rural development in the future. The data consists of 22 semi-structured interviews with livestock farmers in Finland. A grounded theory approach and data-led qualitative analysis were used to construct emerging themes from the farmers' perspectives. The results show that the farmers' perceptions of cellular agriculture are multifaceted and interconnected. In the study, six emerging themes were recognised: i) farmers' outlook on cellular agriculture; ii) the role of farmed animals in cellular agriculture; iii) the market potential of cellular agriculture; iv) relationships between conventional and cellular agriculture; v) rural development and vi) support for farmers. The themes reflected the farmers' future projections, the anticipated uncertainties and potential consequences of cellular agriculture, and the drivers for its development. These novel food technologies were identified as being simultaneously a challenge and an opportunity for conventional livestock farmers and rural areas in the future. However, farmers evaluated the short-term potential of cellular agriculture to be implausible or idealistic due to current food system structures and the early state of cellular agriculture technologies.

AB  - Urban and suburban forests provide important recreational values to the public and can also contain high levels of biodiversity even though management regimes of such forests often include the clearing of bushes, shrubs and small trees to make them more attractive to people. In a field experiment, we studied the importance of bush canopies as foraging sites for insectivorous birds. In suburban forests, the canopies of rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) were net-enclosed for two months at three study sites in SW Sweden. We compared abundance, biomass and body size distributions of arthropods between experimental and control canopies of rowan and alder buckthorn and found the effects to be strong. Biomass of arthropods was generally an order of magnitude higher on canopies protected from bird predation than on controls. Dermaptera contributed most to the biomass estimated in net-enclosed bushes. In certain taxa, however, the biomass was not significantly affected by the experimental treatment, possibly in part due to on-going reproduction during the experimental period. Furthermore, median body size in net-enclosed bushes was 1.3-3.0 times the control, excluding Araneae. The relative difference in arthropod biomass due to the experimental treatment was related to the density of breeding insectivorous birds at each site. We concluded that bush canopies are important foraging sites for birds in suburban forests, although we cannot rule out trait-mediated effects. Management regimes that include clearing of the ground may affect the bird community negatively. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paper has shaped society for centuries and is considered one of humanity's most important inventions. However, pulp and paper products can be damaging to social and natural systems along their lifecycle of material extraction, processing, transportation, and waste handling. The pulp and paper industry is among the top five most energy-intensive industries globally and is the fourth largest industrial energy user. This industry accounts for approximately 6% of global industrial energy use and 2% of direct industrial CO2 emissions. The pulp and paper industry is also the largest user of original or virgin wood, with deleterious impacts on both human health and local flora and fauna, including aquatic ecosystems. This critical and systematic review seeks to identify alternatives for mitigating the climate impacts of pulp and paper processes and products, thus making the pulp and paper industry more environmentally sustainable. This study reviews 466 studies to answer the following questions: what are the main determinants of energy and carbon emissions emerging from the pulp and paper industry? What are the benefits of this industry adopting low-carbon manufacturing processes, and what barriers will need to be tackled to enable such adoption? Using a sociotechnical lens, we answer these questions, identify barriers for the pulp and paper industry's decarbonization, and present promising avenues for future research.

AB  - Understanding the risk of local extinction of a species is vital in conservation biology, especially now when anthropogenic disturbances and global warming are severely changing natural habitats. Local extinction risk depends on species traits, such as its geographical range size, fresh body mass, dispersal ability, length of flying period, life history variation, and how specialized it is regarding its breeding habitat. We used a phylogenetic approach because closely related species are not independent observations in the statistical tests. Our field data contained the local extinction risk of 31 odonate (dragonflies and damselflies) species from Central Finland. Species relatedness (i.e., phylogenetic signal) did not affect local extinction risk, length of flying period, nor the geographical range size of a species. However, we found that closely related species were similar in hind wing length, length of larval period, and habitat of larvae. Both phylogenetically corrected (PGLS) and uncorrected (GLM) analysis indicated that the geographical range size of species was negatively related to local extinction risk. Contrary to expectations, habitat specialist species did not have higher local extinction rates than habitat generalist species nor was it affected by the relatedness of species. As predicted, species' long larval period increased, and long wings decreased the local extinction risk when evolutionary relatedness was controlled. Our results suggest that a relatively narrow geographical range size is an accurate estimate for a local extinction risk of an odonate species, but the species with long life history and large habitat niche width of adults increased local extinction risk. Because the results were so similar between PGLS and GLM methods, it seems that using a phylogenetic approach does not improve predicting local extinctions.

AB  - Purpose This study compared road safety and related factors in the U.S. with those in Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands (which are among the best-performing countries), in order to identify actions most likely to produce casualty reductions in the U.S.
   Method The reviewed topics were basic country statistics, road fatalities and various fatality rates, and selected road-safety issues.
   Results The main differences concerned structural and cultural factors (such as vehicle distance driven), and procedural factors (such as alcohol-impaired driving, exceeding speed limits, and use of seat belts).
   Conclusions The main recommendations for improving road safety in the U.S. are as follows: (1) lower states' BAC limits, and encourage the use of alcohol ignition interlocks (2) reexamine the current speed-limit policies and improve speed enforcement, (3) implement primary seat-belt-wearing laws in each state that would cover both front and rear occupants, and reward vehicle manufacturers for installation of advanced seat-belt reminders, and (4) reconsider road-safety target setting so that the focus is on reducing fatalities and not on reducing fatality rate per distance driven, and (5) consider new strategies to reduce vehicle distance driven.

AB  - Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole, and Norway lobster are main target species for the mixed demersal fisheries of the North Sea, Skagerrak, and eastern Channel. Management by total allowable catch has not been able to constrain exploitation of individual species, so the potential for a fleet-specific effort management system to reach the management objectives established for the stocks is simulated. Relative fleet-specific effort factors are estimated based on the sum of partial fishing mortalities of the species caught, weighted by the stocks at risk of reduced reproductive capacity. The strategy promotes the use of selective gear and levies nonselective gear. The factors were applied in medium-term simulations of the annual decision process in accordance with existing and proposed multi-annual management plans (including for cod recovery). Strict effort reduction would be required for fleets targeting cod, plaice, or sole (specifically large- and medium-mesh trawler fleets, beam trawlers, and gillnetters) for similar to 5 years, reducing the exploitation rates on all stocks substantially. Cod and plaice are predicted to recover by 2010 and cod catches to exceed recent levels continually, with the more selective longliners and some other gear types profiting most. Management objectives for cod dominate annual effort adjustments, resulting in substantial underexploitation of other stocks. However, even a 10% bias caused by non-compliance would largely halt cod recovery and the restoration of other stocks.

AB  - Aim Although running waters are getting recognized as important methane sources, large-scale geographical patterns of microorganisms controlling the net methane balance of streams are still unknown. Here we aim at describing community compositions of methanogenic and methanotrophic microorganisms at large spatial scales and at linking their abundances to potential sediment methane production (PMP) and oxidation rates (PMO).
   Location The study spans across 16 European streams from northern Spain to northern Sweden and from western Ireland to western Bulgaria.
   Taxon Methanogenic archaea and methane-oxidizing microorganisms.
   Methods To provide a geographical overview of both groups in a single approach, microbial communities and abundances were investigated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing, extracting relevant OTUs based on literature; both groups were quantified via quantitative PCR targeting mcrA and pmoA genes and studied in relation to environmental parameters, sediment PMP and PMO, and land use.
   Results Diversity of methanogenic archaea was higher in warmer streams and of methanotrophic communities in southern sampling sites and in larger streams. Anthropogenically altered, warm and oxygen-poor streams were dominated by the highly efficient methanogenic families Methanospirillaceae, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanobacteriaceae, but did not harbour any specific methanotrophic organisms. Contrastingly, sediment communities in colder, oxygen-rich waters with little anthropogenic impact were characterized by methanogenic Methanosaetaceae, Methanocellaceae and Methanoflorentaceae and methanotrophic Methylococcaceae and Cd. Methanoperedens. Representatives of the methanotrophic Crenotrichaceae and Methylococcaceae as well as the methanogenic Methanoregulaceae were characteristic for environments with larger catchment area and higher discharge. PMP increased with increasing abundance of methanogenic archaea, while PMO rates did not show correlations with abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria.
   Main conclusions Methanogenic and methanotrophic communities grouping into three habitat types suggest that future climate- and land use changes may influence the prevailing microbes involved in the large-scale stream-related methane cycle, favouring the growth of highly efficient hydrogenotrophic methane producers. Based on these results, we expect global change effect on PMP rates to especially impact rivers adjacent to anthropogenically disturbed land uses.

AB  - Subarctic and arctic lakes are the focus of many paleolimnological studies, as they are still among the least impacted lakes by humans. Hence they provide an excellent setting for studies on long-term climatic variability without the overriding effects of direct anthropogenic perturbation. On the other hand, these ecosystems are highly vulnerable to even moderate anthropogenic influence like long-distance airborne transport of nutrients and pollutants. The paleolimnological studies conducted in these areas usually include a multitude of different proxies, but so far only few have used the green algal group of Pediastrum Meyen. These algae, however, preserve well in sediments and can be identified to species level, which lends them potential as a paleo-proxy. In this study we analysed the present Pediastrum assemblages from surface-sediments of 16 subarctic lakes in Finnish Lapland as well as bottom samples from the same sediment cores, which are "spot" samples from the recent past. We found a total of 14 Pediastrum taxa, five of which occurred at moderate to high relative abundances. The majority of the taxa showed distinct relationships to environmental variables measured. Of these, pH and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) explained most of the variance in the distribution of Pediastrum and generally summarised the main environmental gradients in our data set well. Five of the studied lakes lacked Pediastrum taxa altogether, and Pediastrum occurred at low abundances in four additional lakes. All of these nine lakes have extremely low nutrient concentrations and generally lowest pH and DOC in the data set and were defined by barren catchment areas and scarce lake macrophyte growth. According to a top-bottom analysis of sediment cores, the Pediastrum assemblages of the study lakes have changed moderately, suggesting changed environmental conditions in the lakes. Although these changes appear to be climate-related, more studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - In the past 30 years, many stand structural attributes (SSAs) have been suggested and structural indices have been developed to describe the complex structure of forests. Most studies, however, have explored the potential and limits of structural measures to quantify forest structures by applying multiple measures to one stand or few measures to several stands. However, the interdependencies of multiple structural attributes across many stands of different forest management types and developmental stages have not yet been explored. Using 20 structural attributes and 124 completely inventoried 1 ha sized stands we tested to what extent structural characteristics reflect different stand types and management intensities, and how these characteristics change over time. We found that single SSAs do not show the clear gradients that they were intended to reflect, suggesting that stand structure should be described by multiple structural attributes, and that these should represent different structural aspects (including vertical, and horizontal heterogeneity, density, and diversity). A principal component analysis showed that combining several SSAs, allowed us to distinguish between stand types. The structure of mature stands remained rather constant over the observed period of about 6 years, while that of young stands changed more rapidly due to ingrowth and mortality. The older the stands, the less the large trees contributed to stand growth relative to their size. We conclude that multiple stand structural attributes are needed to characterise stand types, management effects and to explain stand productivity. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft air Okologie.

AB  - Habitat loss, climate change, and other environmental degradations pose severe challenges to beekeepers. Therefore, this sector needs to rely on updated information so that the intervening actors can deal with the problems. In this context, and assuming that professional training can greatly help those acting in the beekeeping sector, this work intended to investigate the gaps in the updated knowledge of beekeepers and how these can be filled through lifelong learning. The research was conducted in seven European countries (Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and Spain). The data were collected through a questionnaire survey translated into the native languages of all participating countries. The results revealed that the topics of highest interest are apiary health and pest control and the management of the colonies throughout the year. The beekeepers update their knowledge through family, complemented by professional training, with participants preferring in-person courses as well as, in the workplace or in internships. The learning methodologies they consider most useful are project-based learning and learning through gamification. The videos and paper books or manuals are particularly valued as learning materials, and practical exercises are considered the most helpful assessment format. Finally, considering the effect of sociodemographic variables on the learning experiences and preferences of beekeeping actors, it was observed that the country was the most influential of the variables under study. In conclusion, this work revealed valuable information that should be used to design professional training actions to help the professionals in the beekeeping sector enhance their competencies and be better prepared to manage their activities successfully.

AB  - Food production contributes considerably to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Animal products particularly meat from ruminants generally have higher GHG emissions than plant products. Over the last few decades the global per capita consumption of animal products has increased. This has a negative impact on climate change, land and water availability, and human health. We are faced with the two-fold challenge of reducing GHG emissions while still producing enough food for our growing population. Part of the solution could be for consumers to change towards a more sustainable diet. In this paper we take Norway as a case study for estimating optimal taxes and subsidies on different food items which can change consumption patterns in order to reduce the GHG emissions derived from the average Norwegian diet. In the estimate we ensure that the average calorie intake with the new diet remains the same as with the current diet, and factor in other health considerations. Our findings suggest that limited but useful emission reduction targets can be set with only a few changes in diets. The methodology presented in this paper may be used to estimate optimal climate taxes and subsidies under different emission, quantities, taxes, subsidies, and health constraints.

AB  - It is widely agreed that dynamics of building stocks are relatively poorly known even if it is recognized to be an important research topic. Better understanding of building stock dynamics and future development is crucial, e.g., for sustainable management of the built environment as various analyses require long-term projections of building stock development. Recognizing the uncertainty in relation to long-term modeling, we propose a transparent calculation-based QuantiSTOCK model for modeling building stock development. Our approach not only provides a tangible tool for understanding development when selected assumptions are valid but also, most importantly, allows for studying the sensitivity of results to alternative developments of the key variables. Therefore, this relatively simple modeling approach provides fruitful grounds for understanding the impact of different key variables, which is needed to facilitate meaningful debate on different housing, land use, and environment-related policies. The QuantiSTOCK model may be extended in numerous ways and lays the groundwork for modeling the future developments of building stocks. The presented model may be used in a wide range of analyses ranging from assessing housing demand at the regional level to providing input for defining sustainable pathways towards climate targets. Due to the availability of high-quality data, the Finnish building stock provided a great test arena for the model development.

AB  - Characteristics of stormwater in industrial areas are evaluated, specifically based on a biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant with on-site biomass fuel storage. An evaluation method is developed to combine general methodology applied for stormwater characterisation with the on-site features of the biomass-fired CHP plant. Investigations were carried out through on-site monitoring and laboratory experiments with the defined methodology. Recycled wood chips as biomass fuel currently used in Swedish biomass-fired CHP plants have been used as an example for this study. The impacts of outdoor biomass fuel storage have been analysed for both runoff water quantity and quality. The results indicate that the properties of stored biomass fuels will significantly affect the runoff quantity by its water absorption capability. The overall runoff quality is highly depended on precipitation intensity and the runoff volume from the biomass storage piles, which is influenced by the water retention capacity and leaching ability of biomass fuels. The practical data and information presented in this paper can be used to understand the principal issues and the most important factors for internal control of contamination sources in order to achieve sustainable Energy-Water systems for bioenergy conversion in biomass-fired CHP plants.

AB  - In their own view, public transportation companies make a very hospitable offer to commuters: if you are ready to travel with us, we will take you for a reasonable price nearly anywhere, every day and almost at any time of the day, under good conditions of comfort and safety. Please, step onboard. But commuters resist being reduced to the thankful guests of their commuting service providers. Commuting is an experience whose rhythm structures daily lives. It is not an innocuous in-between-doors passage, but a social practice intertwined with the routines bound to the home, workplace,and places of leisure which they commute to and from. Commuting routines are a constitutive part of commuters' lives. Correspondingly, commuters own their commuting space. They do not own it in terms of legal ownership, although they possess a valid ticket; they own it via the degree to which they are at home in their routines and intuitively know through the senses and feelings produced through the normal flow of daily practices, that they are on their own home turf. Home is more than the physical space of the house; it is an embodied perception of a familiar cultural space which is organized in such a way that one has some control and responsibility over. Because commuters grant transportation companies daily access to the intimacy of their homes, they are hosting the companies, not the opposite. Public transportation hospitality is thus a tension-filled drama, co-produced by transportation companies and commuters. In this drama managerial routines meet routines of daily life, legal definitions of ownership meet practice-based ones, and organizational hospitality stands against individual hospitality. Our claim is that the fact that each party considers itself to be the host of the other, the prevailing situation consequently frames the provision and experience of public transportation services as a drama: the drama of hospitality.

AB  - Metal contamination of soils is widespread across Europe and is of great concern as it may impact food production, the supply of drinking water and human health (European Environment Agency, 2014; Panagos et al., 2013). Most re-search to date on soil metal contamination has focussed on agricultural soils (Tith et al., 2016a). Current knowledge of the extent of urban soil metal contamination in Europe, however, is limited, especially for soils in recreational areas, which is particularly concerning as these areas may have a high footfall. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis of metal contamination in European urban soils based on 174 peer-reviewed studies spanning 143 urban sites and 29 European countries. The results show that reporting of data on urban soil metals is highly heterogeneous across the study area. Over half of all studies are from only five countries (Italy, Spain, UK, Poland and Serbia) and no data are available for 14 other European countries. The metals that most commonly exceed national safety thresholds are Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr and Ni. Elevated levels of these metals are usually attributed to anthropogenic sources, primarily traffic and industry. Some 22 % of urban sites studied show anthropogenic enrichment; this phenomenon is most common in Italy, Serbia and Finland. In contrast, 44 % of urban sites studied show geogenic metal enrichment; this is most com-mon in Italy, the UK and Serbia. The dataset is subject to a sample size bias, whereby soil metal enrichment is identified more frequently in regions with more data. Future studies should focus on key knowledge gaps, such as urban soils in locations with current or historical heavy industrialisation and locations in central and eastern Europe. Study methods should be standardised to facilitate comparison of soil metal data from different studies and European safety thresholds should be identified for key elements.

AB  - This paper deals with railway deregulation and related reforms by means of a case study of Sweden, studying the 1988 split of railway infrastructure from operations and the subsequent steps of vertical and horizontal disintegration to a market characterized by decentralization and intra-modal competition. We also analyze the current market situation, in terms of the actors and their roles, and industrial organization measures. This assessment is used to discuss the sustainability of the current regulatory structure, concluding that although it seems more sustainable than in the past, regulators will sooner or later have to deal with some of its inconsistencies.

AB  - Nature-like fishways are designed to imitate the characteristics of natural streams, thereby providing both fish passage and habitat for a variety of aquatic organisms. To date, however, the potential for habitat rehabilitation of nature-like fishways has not been fully realized. To develop the concept of how to design a nature-like fishway, a 500-m long nature-like fishway, termed the biocanal, was constructed at the Eldforsen hydroelectric facility, Sweden. It included four habitat types: riffle, pool, floodplain and braided (i.e. with islands), each replicated three times. The riffle sections were considered controls for typical Swedish nature-like fishways. Thus the biocanal had a more varied in-stream environment than those of conventional fishways. To test the prediction that the biocanal had a positive effect on biodiversity, we compared the physical habitat and benthic fauna composition of the more diverse habitat types in the biocanal to the riffle habitats. We also made comparisons between the biocanal and six natural reference streams in the area. After two years, 63% of the benthic fauna families found in the reference streams had colonized the biocanal. Families present in the reference streams, but not in the biocanal, were predominantly slow colonizers or taxa linked to riparian vegetation, which was scarce and in an early successional stage along the biocanal. In the biocanal, pool and floodplain habitats contained the highest number of families, the highest family diversity (Shannon-Weaver) and the highest densities of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Since these habitats contained more families and had higher diversities than the riffle habitats which are typical of conventional nature-like fishways, we suggest that the construction of biocanals indeed possesses the potential for high biodiversity.

AB  - In Denmark, Finland, and Sweden, the Nordic Total Merit index is used as the breeding selection tool for both organic and conventional dairy farmers based on common economic models for conventional dairy farming. Organic farming is based on the principles of organic agriculture (POA) defined by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. These principles are not set up with an economic point of view, and therefore it may be questionable to use a breeding goal (BG) for organic dairy production based on economic models. In addition to economics and the principles of organic agriculture, it is important to look at farmers' preferences for improving BG traits when setting up a BG for organic farming. The aim of this research was to set up, simulate, and compare long-term effects of different BC for organic and conventional dairy production systems based on economic models, farmers' preferences, and POA, with particular emphasis on disease resistance or on roughage consumption and feed efficiency. The BG based on economic models and on farmers' preferences were taken from previous studies. The other BG were desired gains indices, set up by means of a questionnaire about relatedness between the POA and BC traits. Each BG was simulated in the stochastic simulation program ADAM. The BG based on POA, with particular emphasis on disease resistance or on roughage consumption and feed efficiency, caused favorable genetic gain in all 12 traits included in this study compared with 6 traits for the other BG. The BG based on POA, with particular emphasis on disease resistance or on roughage consumption and feed efficiency, were very different from BG for organic and conventional production based on economic models and farmers' preferences in both simulated genetic change and correlations between BC. The BG that was created based on the principles of organic agriculture could be used as a specific index for organic dairy farming in Denmark, but this index was economically not very sustainable. Hence, an intermediate breeding goal could be developed by breeding companies to address both economics and the principles of organic agriculture.

AB  - Although bottom water hypoxia (O-2 < 2 mg L-1) is presently widespread in the Baltic Sea coastal zone, there is a lack of insight into past changes in bottom water oxygen in these areas on timescales of millennia, and the possible driving factors. Here, we present a sediment-based environmental reconstruction of surface water productivity, salinity and bottom water oxygen for the past 5400 years at GAyensfjarden, a coastal site in SE Sweden. As proxies, we use dinoflagellate cysts, benthic foraminifera, organic carbon (C-org), biogenic silica (BSi), C-org/N-tot, C-org/P-tot, Ti/Al, K/Al and grain size distribution. The chronology of the sediment sequence is well constrained, based on Pb-210, Cs-137 and AMS C-14 dates. Between 3400 and 2100 BCE, isostatic conditions favored enhanced deep water exchange between GAyensfjarden and the open Baltic Sea. At that time, GAyensfjarden was characterized by relatively high productivity and salinity, as well as frequently occurring hypoxic-anoxic bottom water, despite the relatively large connection with the Baltic Sea. The most severe interval of oxygen depletion is recorded between 2400 and 2100 BCE, and appears to coincide with a similar hypoxic event in the Gotland Basin in the open Baltic Sea. As regional climate became wetter and colder between 2100 BCE and 700 BCE, salinity declined and bottom water oxygen conditions improved. Throughout the record, grain size, Ti/Al and K/Al data indicate an evolution towards a more enclosed coastal system, as suggested by reconstructions of the post-glacial shoreline regression. GAyensfjarden shifted to close to modern conditions after 700 BCE, and was characterized by less hypoxia and lower salinity compared with 3400-700 BCE. The timing of the shift corresponds with the Sub-Boreal/Sub-Atlantic transition in Europe. Human-induced erosion in the catchment is observed as early as 600 CE, and is particularly prominent since regional copper mining activity increased around 1700 CE. A sharp increase in sediment C-org concentration is recorded since the 1950s, indicating significant anthropogenic impact on biogeochemical cycles in the coastal zone, as observed elsewhere in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Alien species constitute one of the major threats to global biodiversity. Stopping alien species at an early stage, preferably before establishment, is crucial for the effectiveness of management actions. To enable early detection and prevent future introductions, knowledge of pathways of introduction and their absolute and relative importance is crucial. Based on an exhaustive impact assessment of alien species in Norway (all multicellular neobiota), the relations of taxonomy, lifestyle and ecological impact of alien species to their pathways of introduction are investigated. This taxonomically and ecologically unbiased dataset contains 2267 unique pathways of 1180 alien species. Ecological and taxonomic patterns indicate that terrestrial organisms were predominantly introduced by means of escape (mainly perennial plants escaped from gardens), parasites as contaminants (mainly fungi and insects parasitising plants), freshwater organisms by release (mainly vertebrates) and marine organisms as stowaways (mainly invertebrates and algae). Unaided introductions were most common among insects and marine organisms. Alien species with high ecological impact were mainly introduced along the same pathways as other alien species. In relative terms, high-impact species were overrepresented among released species, even though this pathway was subordinate in absolute terms. The number of pathways and the overall introduction pressure were important predictors of ecological impact, especially of the species' invasion potential, and area of occupancy. Introduction rates of novel alien species have seen recent increases in all taxa and along almost all pathways. This acceleration was especially pronounced for insects and fungi introduced as contaminants and for marine organisms introduced as stowaways. In absolute terms, introduction rates were highest for plant escapes, reaching more than five novel species per year. Synthesis and applications. Introductions of new alien species cannot be prevented by closing one or two introduction pathways, since none can be singled out as the main pathway of high-impact alien species. Yet each pathways closed makes a difference, as this reduces the overall introduction pressure. The highest priorities for management are the pathways that are easiest to address, such as release, and those with the highest volumes, such as plant trade.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this article is to analyze the digital innovations which are being introduced in the HRM field in organizations in the modern business services sector in Finland and Poland. It is also intended to identify the most important factors/trends that influence digital innovations and to identify the challenges they generate for HRM departments. The practical objective is to develop recommendations for organizations executives, policy makers and researchers.Design/methodology/approachThe research was mainly based on a quantitative research approach and a questionnaire survey. Additionally, the authors conducted a semi-structured interview was with the representatives of the HRM departments in the surveyed organizations. The qualitative research of the obtained results allowed to deepen the obtained quantitative data. The purpose of the data triangulation used was to increase the reliability of the data.FindingsNearly 90% of HRM employees declared that the companies they work for have implemented digital innovations. Among the introduced digital innovations, chatbots, dashboards, application software systems, a virtual HRM assistant and digital tools were indicated. The COVID-19 pandemic and the progress of robotization and automation have accelerated the implementation of digital technologies in HR departments in both Poland and Finland. There are however differences between the two countries - it is evident that in Finland digital innovations were already introduced by modern businesses organizations before the pandemic period, while in Poland the innovations were mostly implemented during and after the pandemic period. It is worth emphasizing the differences regarding the two countries in terms of the level of technology advancement.Research limitations/implicationsSimilar to most studies conducted, this study has its limitations and the authors are aware of them. First, future research using the tool which was used in this study should focus on confirming its reliability. Secondly, its scope and scale were limited as it was not possible to obtain an industry-wide sample. It should be noted that the obtained results cannot be generalized to a broader context, although they provide valuable conclusions and recommendations and may be an inspiration for further research. For the future research, it is recommended that the researchers should pay more attention to the challenges and difficulties that accompany digital innovations in HRM departments. One of the aspects is the need to pay attention to the cultural and psychological aspects of the presence of technology in organizational areas, which have only been signaled in this article. A more in-depth study could address the issue of negative attitudes toward the introduction and use of digital technologies. The future research could focus on creating the necessary conditions at each stage of introducing digital innovations and using the potential of these tools - starting with needs analyses, awareness of goals, benefits, dealing with concerns and risks, communication and evaluation and assessment of the technology in question. For future research, it is recommended that researchers pay more attention to the challenges and difficulties that accompany digital innovations in HRM departments. One of the aspects is the need to be aware of the cultural and psychological aspects of the presence of technology in organizational areas, which has only been signaled in this article.
   A more in-depth study could address the issue of negative attitudes toward the introduction and use of digital technologies. The future research could focus on creating the necessary conditions at each stage of introducing digital innovations and using the potential of these tools - starting with needs analyses, awareness of goals, benefits, dealing with concerns and risks, communication and evaluation and assessment of the technology in question.Practical implicationsThe study provides suggestions for practice, providing companies in Finland and Poland with the insight into the impact of the trends on the development of digital innovations in HRM departments and the challenges they generate. The contributions of this study are also the recommendations and guidelines for organizations to effectively implement digital technologies. This will allow not only to better adapt to the present situation, but also to more accurately predict future trends.Social implicationsThe research results can be useful for the development of HRM practices, as traditional practices are increasingly being replaced by new digital modes of leading and managing capital resources in organizations. This development is followed by the need for new competencies in HRM (Mazurchenko, Marsikova, 2019), a new understanding of leadership, thus digital tools may prove particularly supportive in this context (Salojarvi, 2018). Digital innovation research conducted in the modern business services industry can be particularly valuable in the context of the flow of technological innovations, including know-how, implementation of modern organizational solutions; which transfers to other industries (MORR, 2017). Digital innovations can contribute to reducing the complexity of HRM functions, which will accelerate management and personnel decisions. It will improve the quality of analytical data, as well as increase access to employees and opportunities in planning their personal development. As a result, the introduction of digital innovations will contribute to reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of HRM processes.Originality/valueThis study provides a new and timely perspective by examining applied digital innovations and related challenges affecting the implementation of digital innovations by HRM departments in the modern business services sector. This survey provides comprehensive information on how and what can enhance the capacity for digital innovation in Finnish and Polish organizations. This article theoretically analyzes the importance of technological development for HRM departments and reviews the previous research on digital technologies in HRM departments and the factors and challenges of introducing digital innovations. It also characterizes the modern business services sector, which is very active in introducing digital innovations.

AB  - Cereal-based rotations dominate the prime production regions of Finland without any signs of noteworthy shifts towards more diverse systems. To estimate the potential for the future expansion of more diverse crop rotations we used multinomial logistic regression to model the probability that a field parcel would suit for crops other than cereals by acknowledging farmer's preferences in land allocation depending on field parcel characteristics (size, shape, slope, distance to farm center, proximity to waterway, soil type and ownership). This study covered ca. 700,000 field parcels in the prime production region and all the farm types. We identified parcels that were currently used for pure cereal rotations but were also suitable for the cultivation of more diverse crops, especially rapeseed and grain legumes as the most potential ones. There was substantial potential to shift from the current cereal rotations towards more diverse crop sequencing patterns in all farm types, but especially on pig, poultry and cereal farms, where some 18-20% of the cereal monoculture rotations could be shifted towards break crop rotations and 24-41% to diverse rotations. The diversification potential was dependent on the farm size and was higher on large farms with more suitable land for minor crops and with better logistic advantages. Hence, the ongoing increase in farm size and reduction in the number of farms could further support the transition towards more diverse crop sequencing. Diversity in both crop rotation and the agricultural landscape can be achieved simultaneously. Due to the characteristics of field parcels allocated to perennial grasslands and green-fallow rotations they were not suitable for diversifying arable crops. To enhance use of more diverse crop rotations, coherent policies and sufficient incentives are needed to encourage farmers to exploit the existing potential in a timely fashion despite the current socio-economically challenging situation that farmers are facing in Finland.

AB  - To examine site fidelity and potential for ecosystem impacts, 20 escapee cod (Gadus morhua L.) from fjord-based cod farms were tagged with acoustic transmitters, released in the vicinity of the same farm, and their subsequent behaviour and survival monitored using a fixed array of acoustic receivers. Most individuals demonstrated high fidelity to their farm where tagged, and this increased during the polar night. Only five individuals (25%) were occasionally detected at another farm (4 km distance), and only three cod (15%) migrated out of the fjord during the 6-month study period. Vertical movements were consistently greater in the hours around noon than at night, a behaviour inconsistent with that observed for wild fish. A high mortality rate (40%) was observed during the first 4 months post-release, and actual mortality may have been even higher, limiting the potential for negative ecosystem effects from cod escapees. Findings from this study are used to discuss the development of recapture strategies for minimising potential impacts from cod escapees to ensure sustainable farming activity.

AB  - The return of the grey wolf Canis lupus lupus, after a temporary absence, to rural and forest-fringe areas has resulted in more encounters between humans and protected wildlife when wolves prey on farmers' and hunters' living private property. In locations where wolves are considered problematic, permits can be issued for the controlled hunting of individual wolves to protect livestock and companion animals and prevent damage. I examine applications for the targeted removal of problematic wolves in Sweden through lethal control, and authorities' decisions regarding controlled hunting. The empirical basis of the paper is a content analysis of applications for and decisions regarding controlled hunting. The data concern three counties in middle Sweden, with 2002-2010 as the study period. I analyse 1) the applicants' stated reasons for applying for controlled hunting and 2) the authorities' rationales for rejecting or approving these applications. My aim is to identify the aspirations, desires, and motives evident in these texts.
   In investigating controlled hunting applications and decisions, the paper applies anthropological perspectives on ecosystem management, place and landscape, and decision-making, and the results illustrate the underlying framing of the reasons favouring lethal removal. We encounter a layered reflexive communication of intentions and beliefs regarding the goals and interests that should guide state action to manage wolves demonstrating 'transgressive' and 'unnatural' behaviour threatening the local social and cultural environment. Perceptions diverge regarding how best to understand the natural landscape and how such understandings are embodied in applications and decisions regarding the targeted removal of wolves.

AB  - Due to hydropower development, the upstream migration of wild anadromous salmon and brown trout is impaired in many European rivers, causing negative effects on the long-term survival of natural salmonid populations. This study identified problems for Atlantic salmon during upstream migration in a regulated river in northern Sweden, Umealven (mean flow: 430 m(3) s(-1)). Tagging from 1995 to 2005 involved radio tags (n = 503), PIT tags (n = 1574) and Carlin tags (n = 573) to study the spawning migration of salmon from the coast past the regulated section of the river to a fish ladder at the dam/spillway 32 km upriver. The results demonstrate that migration success from the coast to the fish ladder varied between 0% and 47% among years, indicating an average loss of 70% of potential spawners. Discharge from the turbines attracted the salmon away from the bypass route. Echo-sounding in the turbine outlet showed that salmon were normally found at 1-4 m depths. They responded with upstream and/or downstream movements depending on flow changes; increased spill in the bypass channel attracted salmon to the bypass. Once in the bypass channel, salmon could be delayed and had difficulties passing the first rapid at high spills. Additional hindrances to upstream migration were found at rapids and the area of the fish ladder, located further upstream in the regulated river section. The average migration duration was 44 days from the estuary to the top of the fish ladder, with large variation among individuals within years. Modelling the salmon population dynamics showed a potential population increase of 500% in 10 years if the overall migration success could be improved from the current 30% to levels near 75%. Consequently improved migration facilities at the regulated river section should be implemented to achieve a long-term sustainability of these threatened anadromous salmonids.

AB  - In this article, the risk of agricultural farmland abandonment was assessed with the use of a synthetic measure of socioeconomic problems as challenges to the quality of life in rural areas in the European Union. To determine the direction and dynamics of changes in farmland abandonment in the EU countries, variables based on EUROSTAT and FADN data were analyzed using Hellwig's method, and data for 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019 were compared. The EUROSTAT methodology for the agri-environmental indicator "risk of land abandonment" was adapted for the needs of this study. Agricultural land is abandoned for many reasons, including conversion to other uses, but also abandonment of farming. The results of the analysis indicate that the risk of farmland abandonment was highest in countries with difficult farming conditions, such as Greece, Spain, Portugal, Romania, and Finland. In turn, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands, i.e., the most economically developed countries, were most resilient to this risk. An analysis of the factors that contribute to farmland abandonment demonstrated that the likelihood of this risk decreases with a rise in agricultural investments, farm income, population density, prices of agricultural land, road quality, and density. A high proportion of ageing farm owners was the only factor that increased the risk of agricultural land abandonment.

AB  - To cope with present and future challenges, a growing number of water utilities in Sweden, Europe and elsewhere initiate various forms of inter-municipal cooperations creating a new regional level of drinking water governance. In order to reach viable decisions of alternative ways forward, there is an international consensus that sustainability needs to be addressed in water supply planning, design and decision-making. There are, however, few decision aids focusing on assessing the sustainability of inter-municipal cooperations and the intermunicipal policies and interventions that regional decision-makers are faced with. This paper presents a decision support model based on a combination of cost-benefit analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis for assessing the sustainability of regional water supply interventions, including formations of inter-municipal cooperations. The proposed decision support model integrates quantitative and semi-quantitative information on sustainability criteria. It provides a novel way of presenting monetized benefits and costs, capturing utilitarian aspects of alternative interventions, with non-monetized social and environmental effects, capturing aspects based in the deontological theories of moral ethics. The model is based on a probabilistic approach where uncertainties are defined by statistical probability distributions. A case study is used to exemplify and evaluate model application in decision situations regarding regionalization, (de)centralization, source water quality and redundancy. All evaluated alternatives were expected to contribute to a slightly improved social sustainability, whereas the results were more varying in the economic and environmental domains. A structured and transparent treatment of uncertainties facilitates a better understanding of the results as well as communication between decision-makers, stakeholders and the community.

T2  - NORDISK JUDAISTIK-SCANDINAVIAN JEWISH STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - center dot The captivating painting of Helene Schjerfbeck, Fete juive / Lehtimajanjuhla (1883), is considered to this day an exceptional piece of art with significant cultural value. It already carries great value, aside from its artistic quality and how it showcases the Jewish feast of Sukkot. What is not evident from simply looking at the artwork, however, is the intriguing background story to the fate of its models -more specifically, that of its female model, Chava Slavatitsky, and the `scandal ' connected with her story. Her name became known all over Finland, as it gained significant attention from the local press, perhaps mainly as it occurred during the turbulent times of the late nineteenth century when the question of Jewish emancipation in Finland was frequently discussed in society This article aims to briefly introduce the reader to Schjerfbeck's motivation in creating the painting and to its representation of the Sukkot 140 years ago, as well as aiming to tell the extraordinary story of its relatively unknown young sitter, including her abduction and conversion to Christianity. Hence, this contribution aims to provide an addendum to the Jewish history of the country in the late 1800s and to briefly reflect on the nature of Jewish-Christian relations of the era.

AB  - Gender identities are relevant for sustainable transport. By analyzing the synergies between gender inequality (as a problem), and lack of sustainability (another problem), there is a potential to create an understanding of how these problems are linked. Our aim is to better understand how gendered norms find expression in transport policy and planning. Taking a starting point in gender studies we advance four ideal types on masculine and feminine norms and relate them to sustainability in transport. We advance a methodology for studying gender norms in relation to sustainability in terms of how they are expressed in the text. We contribute to a deeper understanding of transportation related to men and masculinity studies, and advance work by masculinity scholars to include sustainability in transportation issues. Through text analysis, we demonstrate empirically how four Swedish municipalities have developed their (sustainable) transport policies 2014-2018. Our results indicate that the level of sustainability, in plans and strategies, are related to the presence of diverse masculine and feminine norms rather than male and female bodies.

AB  - The low-carbon transition requires policies and behaviour changes that affect people's consumption habits. However, the impacts of the transition are likely to be experienced unevenly by consumers. Failing to account for these differences puts at risk the prospects of a just transition. This paper investigates the demand-side aspects of a just low-carbon transition, with a focus on the transport and food sectors in Sweden. It combines footprint analysis and sociodemographic and geographic analysis with an assessment of the distributional impacts of lowcarbon transition policies from the perspectives of wealth, access, and health. The study finds variations in carbon footprint categories between those with higher or lower income and living in higher or lower density areas. It also finds varying degrees of ability to cope with the required shifts in the food and transport sectors. About 40 % of the Swedish population appears to be at higher risk from the adverse impacts on wealth and access related to policies aiming at low-carbon transition, because this cohort depends heavily on cars and is less able to cope with the increased price of carbon-intensive goods that these policies are expected to entail. The study also finds that, collectively, those most at risk of losing are responsible for 41 % of consumption-based emissions. The paper goes on to discuss implications for low-carbon transition policy measures and transitional assistance policy. Overall, it highlights the need for targeted, well-planned policies for emissions reductions and transitional assistance to support a fair low-carbon transition for all.

AB  - Due to the growing threat of climate change, we are challenged to find improved assessment practises to recognize solutions for sustainable urban development. The focus of the study is on the life cycle design of a district energy system for a new residential development in Finland. This study analyses LCC (life cycle costs) and carbon emissions (LCA (life cycle assessment)), i.e., the "viability" of different energy systems through a methodological life cycle framework. By combining LCC and LCA, a LCM (life cycle management) perspective is portrayed to support decision-making on a long-term basis. The comparable energy design options analysed are (1) district heating (reference design), (2) district heating with building integrated photovoltaic panels, (3) ground source heat pump, and (4) ground source heat pump with building-integrated photovoltaic panels. The results show that the design option with the highest initial investment (4) is in fact the most viable from a life cycle perspective. This study further strengthens the connection between cost savings and carbon emissions reduction in a life cycle context. Thus, by implementing LCC and LCA analysis in an early design phase, justified economic and environmental design decisions can be identified to develop more sustainable urban areas.

TI  - Remapping socio-cultural specificity in the American remake of The Bridge
T2  - Continuum-Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
LA  - English
AB  - It is often assumed that the remake of a foreign film is inferior to the original because of tangible obstacles to transnational retrofitting, two notable impediments being resistant cultural narratives and the stylistic tendencies associated with a given culture's idiosyncratic visual exploration of those narratives. In contrast with film remakes, what relative narrative parity between original and remake can be sustained for two hours becomes difficult to sustain for the 10 to 13 episodes of a television series, even more so when the social, cultural and historical character of the transposed landscape is rich and complex. This remapping will redraw the narrative lines of the original, necessitating a gradual shift in focus and guaranteeing the remake, when it is successful, creative independence. The substituted geographical and cultural specificity resists the template of the original, imposing its own logic such that the narrative has to evolve against the source series' grain. One such series is The Bridge (2013-), the American remake of the Danish/Swedish Broen/Bron (2011-). By the last three episodes of the first season, the remake has weaned itself almost entirely from the original's signature narrative. The latter's generic transition from what initially appears to be an examination of universal social scourges to the execution of a personal vendetta is reversed to privilege the remapped series' highlighting of serious social dramas: drug trafficking, the smuggling of migrants, the murder of young women workers in the maquiladoras, police corruption, etc. This essay analyses The Bridge's promotion of the social realities of the US-Mexico border as a compelling competing narrative.

AB  - Use of biomass-based electricity and hydrogen in alternative transport could provide environmentally sustainable transport options with possible improvements in greenhouse gas balance. We perform a life cycle assessment of electric vehicle (EV) and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) powered by bioelectricity and biohydrogen, respectively, derived from Norwegian boreal forest biomass, considering the nonclimate neutrality of biological carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and alteration in surface albedo resulting from biomass harvesting-both with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS)-while benchmarking these options against EVs powered by the average European electricity mix. Results show that with due consideration of the countering effects from global warming potential (GWP) factors for biogenic CO2 emissions and change in radiative forcing of the surface for the studied region, bioenergy-based EVs and FCVs provide reductions of approximately 30%, as compared to the reference EV powered by the average European electricity mix. With CCS coupled to bioenergy production, the biomass-based vehicle transport results in a net global warming impact reduction of approximately 110% to 120% (giving negative GWP and creating a climate-cooling benefit from biomass use). Other environmental impacts vary from -60% to +60%, with freshwater eutrophication showing maximum reductions (40% for the EV case and 60% for the FCV case) and photochemical oxidation showing a maximum increase (60% in the FCV value chain).

KW  - GEOCHEMISTRY
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contaminants of concern under the Arctic Environmental Monitoring Programme (AMAP) due to their carcinogenic potential. The concentration of the different PAH components may be connected to the geochemical background of the sediments, including leakage and erosion of fossil carbon, as well as epigenetic processes such as decaying peat. In other cases there is a human influence connected to petroleum spills or combustion of fossil fuel or other human activities. The overall goal of this study was to identify and analyze existing comparable datasets on PAHs From Norwegian and Russian arctic shelves, and use the concentration and composition of PAH components in the selected datasets to assess baseline concentration of PAH, geographical anomalies and sources and routes of transport, as well as the human impact. PAHs in 330 samples of surface sediment from the Barents and Kara Sea shelves, collected during the period 1991-1998, have been selected for the study.
   In the Southwest Barents Sea the nature of PAHs is formed by a complex sedimentation regime made up of inflowing Atlantic and North Sea water, coastal discharges, coastal abrasion and atmospheric transport. The PAHs basically correspond to background compositions with a low but notable anthropogenic influence. In the Northern Barents Sea both concentration and composition of PAHs are genetically (genesis, conditions and level of transformation) connected with eroded sediment material from the Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land archipelagos. The relative high PAH levels observed off Spitsbergen thus generally may have a non-anthropogenic explanation. In the central part of the Barents Sea the PAH levels in the deep-water bottom sediments are generally low, non-anthropogenic in origin, and determined by endogenous processes. Erosion and re-deposition of Novaya Zemlya strata do not have a significant influence on PAH composition in this part of the Barents Sea. In the Southeast Barents Sea (Pechora Sea) the PAH composition corresponds, in general, well with the PAH allocation in the Barents Sea. However, the terrigenous influence is stronger. The PAH composition exhibits both epigenetic processes (such as the high level of perylene which most probably is derived from decaying peat) and the presence of petrogenic PAH. The latter findings may be due to the influx of rivers draining oil-rich onshore territories. In estuaries and offshore the Kara Sea the PAH composition of bottom sediments reflects the significant influence of river run-off (with the same patterns as in the Pechora Sea), but also atmospheric transport of combustion derived PAHs, most probably from the smelters in Norilsk.

AB  - The community identity facets, respective use of resources and management of community assets are among key ingredients for sustainable local economic development and community economies. Likewise, the use and management of community spaces are at the heart of spatial practice as a concept of social space that determines sustainability or decline of local economic development and utility value of the said social space. The use and appreciation of the value of these spaces also depends on the size of user population and their capacities to increase spaces' economic viabilities. Japan and many countries in the developed world such as Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Spain have been facing a shrinking rural population for decades. A similar scenario of population decline presents itself in the Study area, Tomitsu. In October 2016, the New Urban Agenda recognized shrinking population as an emerging challenge to sustainable urban development that is associated with local development, and also proposed its management where appropriate. Many scholars have argued against the revitalization approach as a first course of action to manage city shrinkage because the approach does not necessarily require increased human population; nature and natural conditions can easily revitalize a region as a great centre of development. Proposed projects for such areas and scholars associated with this argument have however emphasized the importance of public space and activity in driving regeneration. This is why, given the challenges of population decline in the Tomitsu district, this study explored community space and community activity and the opportunities it provides as means to an end - economic stability, which is a vital first step to the regeneration of a shrinking region. The study aims to contribute some insight into the ongoing redevelopment process in Tomitsu through interactive participatory research in the community, and add to the academic knowledge in this field. The main aim of this study to is adapt and apply the theory accordingly.

AB  - Apart from experimental design, the selection of pitfall trap size, collecting fluid and habitat type sampled may also influence the capture efficiency of the method. We combined three field studies from two very different geographic areas, in which the efficiency of pitfall traps, using carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), is evaluated. First, we showed that ethylene-glycol is a more efficient collecting fluid compared to commercial anti-freeze, paraffin and salt water in collecting beetles in a forest patch in South Africa. Second, we showed that larger traps (90 mm mouth diameter) are more efficient in collecting carabids than small traps (65 mm) in a meadow in Finland. We also showed that for these large traps, commercial vinegar was a better collecting fluid than propylene-glycol, but that for small traps, propylene-glycol was superior to vinegar in collecting carabids. Finally, we showed that the trappability of Pterostichus oblongopunctatus and Carabus hortensis differed in enclosures placed into two different habitat types (a forest and a clear-cut in Finland), while trappability did not differ significantly for two other species (Calathus micropterus and Pterostichus niger) in these habitat types. However, for the two Pterostichus species studied, the catches in traps placed in the centre of the enclosures were slightly higher in the clear-cut, compared to the forest, and catches were higher in enclosures with rich field-layer vegetation, compared to enclosures with poor vegetation. The three studies re-emphasise the uncertainties of using pitfall traps in ecological studies. However, with careful planning and standardisation to help avoid erroneous interpretations, pitfall trapping is an invaluable method for the field ecologist.

AB  - It is widely argued that organisational work-life policies do not exist in a vacuum, but need to be adapted to different cultural, political, economic, and social conditions. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) face the unique organisational challenge of defining a global work-life strategy that establishes shared principles and guidelines and also allows for local initiatives and differences. However, although work-life strategies are considered in some areas being investigated by HRM researchers, there is a disproportionate volume of research on the development of international human resource management policy, and a paucity of research involving qualitative case studies of work-life reconciliation in MNE subsidiaries. Work-life researchers continue to call for research that incorporates concepts such as cultural context and work-family policy development in international businesses; and intensive qualitative case studies to counterbalance much of the extant research that relies heavily on quantitative, cross sectional research designs. This paper presents the research design of a study investigating the work-life balance experiences of subsidiary employees in two MNEs with contrasting cultural origins, Japan and Sweden. The paper outlines how grounded theory can be used to contribute an employee perspective to the international HRM and work-life discourse.

AB  - Producing food in an environmentally sustainable way for the growing human population is a challenge to the global food system. Vertical farm (VF) as a part of the solution portfolio is attracting interest since it uses less water, pesticides, and land which are scarce in many parts of the globe. Despite these positive factors, the energy demand for vertical farms is high, and farms often remain separate and excluded from cities where most of the population lives. City-level energy system solutions exist to empower energy efficiency and increase the share of variable renewable energy sources, but their potential has not yet been estimated for an urban energy system that includes large vertical farms. Accordingly, in this study, we simulate an urban energy system that practices vertical farming with large-scale variable renewable energies and flexibility measures. For the first part of the study, we modelled a vertical farm's energy system with demand response control to maximize electricity cost savings. To evaluate the potential of demand response, the analysis is carried out for different crops (lettuce, wheat, and soybean), and different electricity price profiles. The result of demand response control can be a reduction of 5% to 30% in electricity consumption costs. Further, sensitivity analyses highlight the effect of electricity price variations and photoperiod on demand response outcomes. In the second part, the operation of an urban energy system (Helsinki, Finland) with vertical farms was analysed through two different scenarios. These scenarios represent the emission-free Helsinki energy system in 2050 with large-scale wind power implementation. As VFs can use electricity outside the peak demand hours, the inclusion of VF with the right energy system configuration can improve the power consumption within the system by up to 19%. Further, we show that connection to the exogenous power market is important to support vertical farming in the future energy systems. In this study, key points in the integration of VF in urban energy systems are highlighted, including the role of exogenous power markets, the potential for increasing local energy consumption with large wind power, and the importance of crop selection in reducing VF's energy costs through demand response. In a city-level solution with a high wind power share, we thus recommend including a vertical farm side by strong sectoral coupling as part of the future design to maximise local consumption.

AB  - The development of human activities was associated with marine and ocean coastal zone in all the times. Territorial development of economy and trade has been based in the coastal zone since the ancient times. As early as then time, for example, a trade fleet had used harbors and approach channels, like strategic elements of trade, which had been situated in the coastal areas and adjacent waters. Nowadays, coastal zone is one of the most exploited and attractive investment areas in the world economy with a huge pressure on the environment.
   Authors made the comparative evaluation of common international methods of strategic environmental assessment, analysis of their applicability to the coastal zone of the Russian Federation, proposals for the improvement and adaptation of the described methods for the Russian conditions. In this paper was shown that Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) (that is zoning of marine space) tool is one of the ways to sustainable exploration the coastal zone.
   In this stream the comparison of basic Russian and Finnish laws, decrees and other normative acts on ecological and environmental protection as the neighboring and marine countries was made. The elaboration of common principles and approaches will lead to environmental conservation and sustainable environmental and ecological-friendly development of the coastal zone of the Russian Federation.

AB  - The Parents Sea has one of the highest levels of biological production of all the world's oceans, and holds some of the largest fish stocks and concentrations of seabirds, Environmental conditions in the area make it particularly vulnerable to damage from human activities, Given the vulnerability of this ecosystem to the effects of human activity, and the fact that physical factors (e.g. reduced visibility, ice) increase risks due to oil exploitation and shipping activities, environmental authorities will work towards more stringent discharge limits and higher standards for emergency preparedness for both oil exploitation and shipping in the Parents Sea, The Norwegian Pollution Control Authority gives priority to preventive measures that can lower the probability of accidents and particular emphasis will be given to conditions attached to production licences and controls on activities in areas that have not yet been opened for petroleum activities. Within the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (the Rovaniemi-process), Norway has proposed that efforts should be made to improve the protection of Arctic marine areas, and further that a working group including representatives of all the Arctic countries should assess various legal instruments and possible measures, and make recommendations for action, Currently, no special international requirements apply to ships sailing in ice-infested waters, and the recommendations from the working group will therefore be of great importance in protecting the area from damage from shipping.

AB  - Acidification has harmed freshwater ecosystems in Northern Europe since the early 1900s. Stricter regulations aimed at decreasing acidic emissions have improved surface-water chemistry since the late 1980s but the recovery of biotic communities has not been consistent. Generally, the recovery of flora and fauna has been documented only for a few lakes or regions and large-scale assessments of long-term dynamics of biotic communities due to improved water quality are still lacking. This study investigates a large biomonitoring dataset of pelagic and littoral crustacean zooplankton (Cladocera and Copepoda) from 142 acid-sensitive lakes in Norway spanning 24 years (1997-2020). The aims were to assess the changes in zooplankton communities through time, compare patterns of changes across lake types (defined based on calcium and humic content), and identify correlations between abiotic and biological variables. Our results indicate chemical and biological recovery after acidification, as shown by a general increase in pH, acid neutralizing capacity, changes in community composition and increases in the total number of species, number of acid-sensitive species and functional richness through time. However, the zooplankton responses differ across lake types. This indicates that the concentration of calcium (or alkalinity) and total organic carbon (or humic substances) are important factors for the recovery. Therefore, assessment methods and management tools should be adapted to the diverse lake types. Long-term monitoring of freshwater ecosystems is needed to fully comprehend the recovery dynamics of biotic communities from acidification.

AB  - Species distributions can be analysed under two perspectives: the niche-based approach, which focuses on species-environment relationships; and the dispersal-based approach, which focuses on metapopulation dynamics. The degree to which each of these two components affect species distributions may depend on habitat fragmentation, species traits and phylogenetic constraints. We analysed the distributions of 36 stream insect species across 60 stream sites in three drainage basins at high latitudes in Finland. We used binomial generalised linear models (GLMs) in which the predictor variables were environmental factors (E models), within-basin spatial variables as defined by Moran's eigenvector maps (M models), among-basin variability (B models), or a combination of the three (E + M + B models) sets of variables. Based on a comparative analysis, model performance was evaluated across all the species using Gaussian GLMs whereby the deviance accounted for by binomial GLMs was fitted on selected explanatory variables: niche position, niche breadth, site occupancy, biological traits and taxonomic relatedness. For each type of model, a reduced Gaussian GLM was eventually obtained after variable selection (Bayesian information criterion). We found that niche position was the only variable selected in all reduced models, implying that marginal species were better predicted than non-marginal species. The influence of niche position was strongest in models based on environmental variables (E models) or a combination of all types of variables (E + M + B models), and weakest in spatial autocorrelation models (M models). This suggests that species-environment relationships prevail over dispersal processes in determining stream insect distributions at a regional scale. Our findings have clear implications for biodiversity conservation strategies, and they also emphasise the benefits of considering both the niche-based and dispersal-based approaches in species distribution modelling studies.

AB  - Despite a heightened focus on sustainable transport and the increased use of biofuels, few studies have assessed the effects of such changes on a wider range of parameters. The aim of this study was to assess sugar beet transport in Scania, Sweden to determine how a switch to improved European vehicle standards and biodiesel impacts not only CO2 releases, but also the parameters of regional land use and air pollutants. The study estimated lorry travel distances by using a GIS-based proximity analysis. It then calculated fuel use and air emissions from standard diesel fuel for 2003 and for the vehicle standard improvements or biodiesel alternatives. Proximity analysis results revealed that roughly 4.2M km were travelled in moving beets to sugar processing facilities, resulting in the use of 2200 m(3) of diesel and release of 5700 tons CO2. The shift to newer vehicle types improved fuel use efficiency and emissions. The switch to the biodiesel alternatives resulted in general decreases in air emissions, but increased fuel use and NOX emissions. The regional land needed to grow the biodiesel feedstock for beet transport ranged from 270 to 2700 ha, which can be considered an important obstacle when a switch is made by the greater road transport system.

AB  - Wooded hay meadows provide livestock fodder in the form of both foliage from pollarded trees and hay from the understorey, and can be part of an environmentally friendly agroforestry system. However, trees may also have a negative effect on fodder production. Such trade-offs between productivity and sustainability in farming are poorly understood, especially in high-latitude areas. We studied hay production in two sites in the same wooded meadow in western Norway, one restored 6 years earlier than the other, to examine whether there were differences in hay production over a 4-year pollarding cycle. We measured production in transects starting from the trunks of pollarded and non-pollarded (reference) trees and running out into open meadow, and transects entirely in open meadow. We examined whether pollarding influenced hay production, and whether hay production was related to the distance from the tree trunk. Total production differed between the two sites, indicating that both time since restoration and differences in overall tree influence affected hay production. We observed a strong and immediate pollarding effect (increase in hay production) due to reduced tree influence. Trees have a negative influence on production as demonstrated by the increase in hay production with increasing distance from the tree trunk. However, additional dry fodder produced by harvesting leaves from pollarded trees more than compensates for reduction in hay production under pollarded trees. Moreover, the understorey production in the wooded hay meadow is at the same level as fertilized meadows in Norway when we include the fodder consumed by sheep during spring and autumn grazing. A wooded hay meadow is an environmentally friendly production system that does not compromise food production. Its tree component can also play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and supports higher biodiversity than industrial food production systems.

AB  - Afforestation is one of the most invoked practices to compensate for CO2 emission to the atmosphere because of the high capacity of both the biomass and the soil to store C. This is accompanied by changes in the degradation and transformation of soil organic matter (OM). We investigated the changes in humic substances upon afforestation along an age sequence of 18, 29, 64-, 73- and 91-year-old Acea abies (L.) Karst. stands, planted on former agricultural land in Sweden. The forest floor was sampled by separating the Oi, Oe and Oa horizons; the mineral soil was sampled at 0-5 and 5-15 cm depth. Humic acids (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) were extracted and quantified and the changes in HA composition over time were evaluated via characterization of lignin-derived phenols using CuO oxidation, in combination with chemical and spectroscopic analysis. The HA and FA contents in the organic horizons increased progressively with stand age up to 73 years and then remained constant or even decreased at the oldest site. FA progressively dominated over HA with depth, suggesting translocation of the more mobile fraction from the organic horizons to the mineral soil.
   The HA composition changed with stand age. Elemental composition and C-13 nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy suggest an increase in the HA alkyl component with time, because of selective preservation of highly recalcitrant compounds from resins, waxes and other lipids, and resynthesis of aliphatic microbial products. The aromatic component increased up to 64 years, and then decreased in both the organic horizons and the mineral layers, while lignin-derived phenols in the HA increased up to 29 years and then decreased. In the youngest stands, the lignin composition of the HA in the organic horizons was determined from the input of tree-derived OM, while in the mineral soil the HA showed a greater content of syringyl and cinnamyl units, still bearing some characteristics of OM inherited from the former agricultural land use. With stand age, the acid/aldehyde ratio of vanillyl units [(Ac/Al)(v)) increased, indicating progressively greater lignin alteration. This resulted in incorporation of lignin-derived phenols into the humic material and leaching of highly oxidized products from the organic horizons into the mineral soil horizons. The latter likely was responsible for the loss of aromatic C from the HA after 64 years and thus the selective preservation of alkyl structures. The translocation of altered lignin products to the mineral horizons and subsequent stabilization therein by association with mineral phases may account for the increase in C observed in the mineral layers of the oldest stands.

AB  - Shelterwood (SW) cutting is a silvicultural method for establishing natural tree regeneration. It is considered to be less destructive for forest biodiversity than intensive harvest methods. In boreal forests, bryophytes are an important taxonomic group, but are vulnerable to changes caused by intensive forest management. To date, the effect of SW cutting on bryophytes has been insufficiently tested, particularly if the entire cutting cycle and different forest-type groups are included. Bryophyte assemblages and forest structural features were surveyed at the stand scale in 30 dry and fresh boreal study sites to test which factors influence bryophyte species richness and composition in SW cuttings as compared to mature managed forests. Total species richness of bryophytes was generally higher in mature forests (123 species) compared to SW cuttings after the first (96 species) and final (90 species) stages of the cutting rotation, but the mean stand scale richness was similar among SW cuttings and mature stands. Independent of the management, a higher number of deciduous trees favoured richness of mosses and liverworts, the latter also positively influenced by the volume of well-decayed logs. Bryophyte assemblages of the first and completed SW cut sites were similar, but distinct from those of mature forests. This pattern also held if mosses and liverworts were analysed separately or if assemblages of the same substrate type (i.e. live trees, stumps, dead wood) were compared between management treatments. The general impact of SW cutting on bryophytes was mild in dry boreal sites, but destructive for species of conservation concern in fresh boreal sites. Retaining a higher density of coniferous and deciduous trees during the SW rotation, as well as careful retention of dead wood legacies (snags and logs), is critical to support bryophyte assemblages in SW post-cut sites.

AB  - In this article, we assess ecological, economic and social sustainability impacts of four alternative agricultural policy scenarios relevant to the European perspective. The analysed scenarios are: Prolonged Agenda 2000, On-going CAP reform, Integrated rural and environmental policy, and Liberalized Agricultural Trade. An economic agricultural sector model of Finnish agriculture is used in the evaluation of policy impacts up to 2020. Selected indicators representing the three dimensions of sustainability are calculated on the basis of the production variables of the model in each scenario. It is assumed that economic rationality, represented by the sector model, is a driving force directing agricultural production and land use, which, in turn, have a number of ecological, economic and social consequences. Our results show that a partial de-coupling of agricultural support from production and moderate reductions of commodity prices are likely to yield environmental benefits. In addition, there is a clear trade-off between environmental benefits and production volume and intensity. However, full de-coupling and radical price reductions are not likely to bring any additional environmental benefits but will result in a significant down-scaling and regional concentration of remaining agricultural activities. Hence the presented analysis is an interesting platform for discussion for stakeholders when implementing agricultural policy reforms.

KW  - BIODIVERSITY
AB  - Using bird atlas data from south-central Sweden and information on survey effort for the corresponding 5 x 5 km grid squares, we assessed how much time is required to get reliable presence/absence data for forest birds. We restricted the analyses to a suite of 28 species considered common enough and sufficiently generalised in their requirements to be present in all survey squares largely dominated by forest. For a set of 183 squares having more than 2/3 of their area covered by forest, the non-linear relationship between survey duration and the number of species detected showed that a total survey duration of less than ca. 16 h was often insufficient for getting a reliable species list. There was, however, much variation in efficiency for such shorter survey durations. We conclude that a total survey duration of ca. 40-45 h should constitute a fair compromise between maximising survey quality and minimising effort, if the fieldwork is done by a range of birdwatchers of varying competence. However, longer surveys may be required for uncommon or specialised species. These findings have implications for the planning of further atlas work in forested areas and for the use of bird atlas data in various research fields.

AB  - Do natural resources influence political trust? I provide a new answer to this question by articulating a theory of political trust that relates to within-country variation in natural resource extraction rather than the more traditional empirical context of cross-country variation. The distributional consequences of natural resources within countries have a large, positive consequences on political trust. Residents within a mining district may experience disproportionate economic benefits compared to residents living in a non-mining district. These economic benefits, in turn, influence political trust. I test these arguments using Afrobarometer public opinion data in four democratic African states, namely Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Carnivores are re-establishing in many human-populated areas, where their presence is often contentious. Reaching consensus on management decisions is often hampered by a dispute over the size of the local carnivore population. Understanding the reproductive dynamics and individual movements of the carnivores can provide support for management decisions, but individual-level information can be difficult to obtain from elusive, wideranging species. Non-invasive genetic sampling can yield such information, but makes subsequent reconstruction of population history challenging due to incomplete population coverage and error-prone data. Here, we combine a collaborative, volunteer-based sampling scheme with Bayesian pedigree reconstruction to describe the pack dynamics of an establishing grey wolf (Canis lupus) population in south-west Finland, where wolf breeding was recorded in 2006 for the first time in over a century.
   Results: Using DNA extracted mainly from faeces collected since 2008, we identified 81 individual wolves and assigned credible full parentages to 70 of these and partial parentages to a further 9, revealing 7 breeding pairs. Individuals used a range of strategies to obtain breeding opportunities, including dispersal to established or new packs, long-distance migration and inheriting breeding roles. Gene flow occurred between all packs but inbreeding events were rare.
   Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that characterizing ongoing pack dynamics can provide detailed, locally-relevant insight into the ecology of contentious species such as the wolf. Involving various stakeholders in data collection makes these results more likely to be accepted as unbiased and hence reliable grounds for management decisions.

AB  - Risk aversive perceptions and practices among ECEC practitioners and parents have proven to be an important reason for the decline of young children's opportunities for free outdoor play. Yet, there are also cultural differences in the perception of children's risky play. This study aims at examining the factors that ECEC practitioners and parents experience as barriers for children's outdoor play, especially those associated with risk. ECEC practitioners and parents in five different European countries (Greece, Portugal, Estonia, Croatia and Norway) received questionnaires about their perception of children's outdoor play. The sample consists of 32 ECEC practitioners and 184 parents. Results show that parents and ECEC practitioners from Norway are less risk aversive to children's play than those from the southern European countries. Traffic is a barrier for outdoor play among parents from all countries (above 50%), and stranger danger is particularly noticed in parents from Greece (80.6%) and Portugal (62.9%), whereas in Norway this value is only 13.3%. The mean average age from which parents allow their children to play outside is quite different between the participating countries, ranging from 5.8 years in Norway to 11.8 years in Greece. In total, fear of children getting injured and adults' own concern/anxiety are only mentioned as barriers by 9.4% and 3.1% of ECEC practitioners, respectively. Lack of play spaces (74.3%) and poor play facilities (80%) are also considered obstacles to letting children play outside by Greek parents, whereas Portuguese ones emphasized media alerts (61.3%). Our results suggest a differentiated approach between countries to tackle the reported barriers to children's outdoor risky play.

AB  - Transport is associated with high amounts of energy consumed and greenhouse gases emitted. Most transport means operate using fossil fuels, creating the urgent need for a rapid transformation of the sector. In this research, we examine the transport systems of Norway and Canada, two countries with similar shares of greenhouse gas emissions from transport and powerful oil industries operating within their boundaries. Our socio-technical analysis, based on the Sectoral Innovation Systems approach, attempts to identify the elements enabling Norway to become one of the leaders in the diffusion of electric vehicles, as well as the differences pacing down progress in Canada. By utilising the System Failure framework to compare the two systems, bottlenecks hindering the decarbonisation of the two transport systems are identified. Results indicate that the effectiveness of Norway's policy is exaggerated and has led to recent spillover effects towards green shipping. The activity of oil companies, regional and federal legislative disputes in Canada and the lack of sincere efforts from system actors to address challenges lead to non-drastic greenhouse gas emission reductions, despite significant policy efforts from both countries. Insights into the effectiveness of previously implemented policies and the evolution of the two sectoral systems can help draw lessons towards sustainable transport.

AB  - The urgency of the sustainability transition, as emphasized by science, has not yet been fully translated to large-scale, inspired and effective societal action. This article focuses on the transformative potential of science-based information presented through specific sustainability storylines inside larger policy narratives. Sustainability storylines can serve as tools for learning from the past, create representations of the current situation and outline paths toward probable, preferable, or avoidable futures. The focus is on three storylines focusing on bioenergy as a renewable energy solution, green mining providing nonrenewable resources and physically active mobility allowing health and environmental benefits. The empirical focus is on Finland, a forerunner of sustainability policies with a large per capita environmental footprint. The potential of sustainable development goals to simultaneously serve as a globally shared and nationally relevant framework for sustainability storylines is discussed with a rather dismal conclusion but optimistic outlook.

AB  - A particular strand within cultural heritage studies has been developing, known as "dark" heritage. However, its usage does not always point to a clear or universal definition, but rather tacit assumptions over what it might mean. The author and colleagues have contributed to perpetuating the continued "dark heritage" referencing through the ongoing research collective "Lapland's Dark Heritage". Investigating the ongoing impacts of the legacy of the Second World War in Finnish Lapland, the project has shed light on local sentiments towards both tangible and intangible reminders of conflict. It has critiqued the apparent state-sanctioned silencing of some aspects of that past, and analysed the ruptures caused to traditional Northern lifeways in the continued context of colonial frameworks. Yet scholars are not merely innocent observers.
   This paper approaches "dark" heritage on three levels. Firstly, it summarizes Lapland's Dark Heritage and its impact on discussions and actions outside academia, including heritage management policy. Secondly, it problematizes the term and its development through the frameworks of critical heritage - challenging the assumptions inherent in the term concerning what makes its focus either "dark" or "heritage". Finally, it takes a wider view, questioning whether the analyses that scholars make have relevance or interest to the wider society. By so doing, the paper contributes to the broader debate concerning the future directions of heritage studies, including the apparent disconnect between applied heritage management training and methods, and more theoretical critical heritage discourses.

AB  - Grazing is an important management action to conserve biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands but it is important to understand how grazing influences the life-history components and population dynamics of plant species. In this study, we analysed effects of grazing intensity and abandonment on population dynamics of the semi-natural grassland species Knautia arvensis which is an important nectar source for pollinating species and an indicator of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We recorded life-history stage, survival, establishment of seedlings and ramets, number of inflorescences and grazing marks on permanently marked individuals in eight populations in mid-Norway for three consecutive years. Matrix modelling was used to estimate population growth rates and elasticities, and life Table response experiments (LTREs) were used to assess the contribution of different life-history components to the observed variation in population growth rates between different management treatments. Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) were used to investigate the effect of management on vital rates and number of inflorescences as well as damage to K. arvensis individuals. Populations in abandoned grasslands had more inflorescences, a lower proportion of seedlings and a higher proportion of flowering ramets compared to populations in grasslands under high grazing intensity. There were no differences in population growth rates between different grazing intensities. Fecundity however, contributed more to the growth rate in grazed grasslands compared to abandoned grasslands where clonal regeneration contributed the most. Survival of non-flowering rosettes made the largest impact to overall growth rates. Our results indicate that a long life-span and clonal growth buffer the effect of environmental change in abandoned grasslands and that there is a trade-off between fertility and clonal regeneration in K. arvensis populations.

AB  - With an expanding population and changing dynamics in global food markets, it is important to find solutions for more resilient food production methods closer to urban environments. Recently, vertical farming systems have emerged as a potential solution for urban farming. However, although there is an increasing body of literature reviewing the potential of urban and vertical farming systems, only a limited number of studies have reviewed the sustainability of these systems. The aim of this article was to understand the environmental impacts of vertical hydroponic farming in urban environments applied to a case study vertical hydroponic farm in Stockholm, Sweden. This was carried out by evaluating environmental performance using a life cycle perspective to assess the environmental impacts and comparing to potential scenarios for improvement options. The results suggest that important aspects for the vertical hydroponic system include the growing medium, pots, electricity demand, the transportation of raw materials and product deliveries. By replacing plastic pots with paper pots, large reductions in GHG emissions, acidification impacts, and abiotic resource depletion are possible. Replacing conventional gardening soil as the growing medium with coir also leads to large environmental impact reductions. However, in order to further reduce the impacts from the system, more resource-efficient steps will be needed to improve impacts from electricity demand, and there is potential to develop more symbiotic exchanges to employ urban wastes and by-products.

AB  - Bioenergy makes up a significant portion of the global primary energy pie, and its production from modernized technology is foreseen to substantially increase. The climate neutrality of biogenic CO2 emissions from bioenergy grown from sustainably managed biomass resource pools has recently been questioned. The temporary change caused in atmospheric CO2 concentration from biogenic carbon fluxes was found to be largely dependent on the length of biomass rotation period. In this work, we also show the importance of accounting for the unutilized biomass that is left to decompose in the resource pool and how the characterization factor for the climate impact of biogenic CO2 emissions changes whether residues are removed for bioenergy or not. With the case of Norwegian Spruce biomass grown in Norway, we found that significantly more biogenic CO2 emissions should be accounted towards contributing to global warming potential when residues are left in the forest. For a 100-year time horizon, the global warming potential bio factors suggest that between 44 and 62% of carbon-flux, neutral biogenic CO2 emissions at the energy conversion plant should be attributed to causing equivalent climate change potential as fossil-based CO2 emissions. For a given forest residue extraction scenario, the same factor should be applied to the combustion of any combination of stem and forest residues. Life cycle analysis practitioners should take these impacts into account and similar region/species specific factors should be developed.

AB  - Farmers grow crops in specific sequences to lower disease pressure and boost crop productivity, particularly in organic farming where artificial pesticides and chemical fertilisers are prohibited. Knowledge about crop sequences used in organic and conventional farming will aid the development of future farming systems through optimising crop diversity and pre-crop effects for improved resource efficiency. This study aims to investigate crop diversity and patterns in organic and conventional crop sequences in Sweden. Large-scale LPIS field data managed by the European Union (EU) Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) were used to monitor crop sequences on arable land in Sweden over 10 consecutive years (2005-2014). Individual fields (land parcels) could be followed on 40% of Sweden's total arable area (349,891 fields extracted) over the 10 years. The LPIS data was combined with information from a database on which fields were farmed organically. Crop distribution, diversity of crop sequences and pre-crops to the main cereal crops (winter wheat, spring barley) were analysed in organic and conventional farming systems in the five agricultural productivity zones of Sweden. The results showed that in the most productive zone in southernmost Sweden, small-grain cereals (particularly winter wheat) were the most common crops (62%), followed by oilseeds (11%), ley and forage crops (9%) and sugar beet (8%), when excluding permanent grassland. In the least productive zone (at higher altitudes and/or latitudes), ley and forage crops dominated (67%), followed by spring cereals (barley, oats) (23%). Crop diversity was higher in the two more productive zones (mean 4.6 crop types) than in two less productive zones (3.4) and organic farms showed 9% higher crop diversity than conventional farms in the most productive zones. Overall, in all zones, the pre-crop to winter wheat was generally a different crop type (3 out of 5 times) e.g., young ley (1-2 years) or grain legume, while the pre-crop to spring barley was most often (4 out of 5 times) another cereal. For both these crops, pre-crop type was more diverse in organic than conventional systems. These findings demonstrate that LPIS data can offer valuable insights into agronomic trends and on-farm practices regarding crop choice and that analysis of field-level LPIS data on crop sequences at large scale can reveal information about organic and conventional cropping in different productivity zones across countries. This information can be used to understand the practical limitations in the use of crop diversity to maximise pre-crop effects. This could in turn support advisory service and policy makers to facilitate more sustainable, productive and resource efficient crop production.

AB  - The shores of the Bothnian Bay in the northern Baltic Sea are characterised by relatively rapid isostatic land uplift (ca. 6.9 mm year-(1)) continuously exposing virgin land for plants to colonise. Autogenic and allogenic changes in soil and plant communities will eventually make these exposed sites unsuitable for the early colonisers. The course of the primary succession in the waterfront is often delayed and shaped by frequent disturbances by ice scouring, water level movements and suffocation of extant vegetation by floating plant debris. Hence, we hypothesise that disturbances are the key processes underlying the local short-term dynamics of the plant populations of the seashore meadows. We monitored formation, growth, shrinkage and mortality of patches of a critically endangered early successional grass species Arctophila fulva var. pendulina for four consecutive years at the Liminka Bay in Finland. The data allow estimation of quality, magnitude and frequency of the wintertime disturbance and the growth during the summer. We formulated and parameterised a spatially explicit simulation model to predict the fate of the population in the area. Simulations with the fitted parameter estimates predicted that the area of A. fulva population will considerably decrease in the next 30 years. A parameter sensitivity analysis showed the probability of a new patch formation to be the most important factor for the population persistence, whereas changes in the dispersal distance, for example, are less important. The best way to enhance the persistence of the population is to promote the new patch formation. This could be done by transplanting rhizome fragments of the species to the suitable open areas in the shallow water where they are not immediately displaced by the later successional species.

AB  - This introductory paper to the Special Issue "Shared Mobility " aims (1) to present and differentiate the diversity of practices and services that constitute the shared mobility sector; (2) to emphasize the contribution of each published article; and (3) to identify knowledge gaps of knowledge and provide further research avenues. With the contribution from 29 authors affiliated to social sciences and transportation research institutions in seven countries (Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Greece, Belgium, Norway, and Australia), new understandings of the potential, drivers, barriers, and limitations of diverse shared mobility solutions for a more sustainable society are presented. The common message across the special issue is that the shared mobility sector is constantly evolving, while aiming to attain sustainability goals. Several papers have taken a psychological approach to explain the adoption of shared mobility practices (e.g., carsharing), yet these findings may be context-dependent, which future research should further investigate (e.g., differences between platform-based and self-service modes). We also call for researchers to pay attention to how traditional transit services can be combined with newer shared mobility services (e.g., micro-mobility), but also to informal public transport systems, as we identify these as important developing areas.

AB  - International partnerships are a mechanism for supporting the academic development of occupational therapy and promoting cultural competence. This case study describes the factors that have helped to sustain a post-qualifying programme implemented by five higher education institutions in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK since 1999. Data collection methods were documentary analysis and the reflections of a purposive sample of six key informants. Cohort and outcome data, from 193 students from 31 countries who enrolled between 1999 and 2011, are reported. Each cohort comprises students from an average of eight countries to optimize inter-cultural dialogue. Four factors support sustainability. These are 1) supportive professional European networks; 2) timeliness and alignment with European higher education policy; 3) partnership structures and processes that emphasize joint decision making and accountability; and 4) the stimulus and satisfaction associated with internationalization. The main limitations are considering the OT-EuroMaster as an intrinsic case study and using opportunistic data collection that undermines the rigor and transferability of the findings. Future opportunities include doctoral networks, transnational research and sharing our curricula design with other Regions to spread the collaborative, capacity building endeavours more widely.

AB  - Mastitis remains the most expensive disease of dairy cows, and antibiotic dry cow therapy (DCT) at dry-off is an important part of mastitis control. Regardless of the infection status, blanket DCT is administered to all quarters of all cows, which is controversial due to the worldwide problem of antimicrobial resistance. Even though selective DCT of only infected cows is a more sustainable approach, choosing animals for treatment is not always straightforward. Our aim was to evaluate whether the herd-level DCT approach is associated with early lactation udder health problems, taking into account the cow characteristics. The information source was 2015?2017 Dairy Herd Improvement data with 7461 multiparous cows from 241 Finnish dairy herds. Information on the herd-level DCT approach was obtained from farmers? questionnaire responses in 2017, and the three different approaches were selective DCT, blanket DCT, and no DCT. The statistical tool for the data analysis was a generalized linear mixed model with a random herd effect for binary outcomes and a linear mixed model with a random herd effect for a continuous outcome. The two binary outcomes were the odds of having high milk somatic cell count (SCC ? 200 000 cells/mL) on the first test-day within 5?45 days in milk (DIM) and the odds of mastitis treatment in early lactation up to 45 DIM. The third outcome was the mean milk lnSCC (? 1000 cells/ mL) within 120 DIM. Selective DCT was the prevailing treatment practice in our data. Blanket DCT was associated with lower SCC after calving. Cows more likely to have high SCC after calving were older cows, cows with high average SCC during the previous lactation, and cows with high milk yield near dry-off. A mastitis treatment in the early lactation was more likely if, during the previous lactation, the cow had high average SCC, high peak milk production, or high milk yield near dry-off. Our findings indicate that DCT is still effective in mastitis control. Cows with high milk yield, especially near dry-off, and cows with persistently high SCC require attention when considering next lactation udder health.

AB  - To identify the most important environmental drivers of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages in boreal springs at different spatial scales, and to assess how well benthic assemblages correspond to terrestrially derived ecoregions.
   Finland.
   Benthic invertebrates were sampled from 153 springs across four boreal ecoregions of Finland, and these data were used to analyse patterns in assemblage variation in relation to environmental factors. Species data were classified using hierarchical divisive clustering (twinspan) and ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling. The prediction success of the species and environmental data into a priori (ecoregions) and a posteriori (twinspan) groups was compared using discriminant function analysis. Indicator species analysis was used to identify indicator taxa for both a priori and a posteriori assemblage types.
   The main patterns in assemblage clusters were related to large-scale geographical variation in temperature. A secondary gradient in species data reflected variation in local habitat structure, particularly abundance of minerogenic spring brooks. Water chemistry variables were only weakly related to assemblage variation. Several indicator species representing southern faunistic elements in boreal springs were identified. Discriminant function analysis showed poorer success in classifying sites into ecoregions based on environmental than on species data. Similarly, when classifying springs into the twinspan groups, classification based on species data vastly outperformed that based on environmental data.
   A latitudinal zonation pattern of spring assemblages driven by regional thermal conditions is documented, closely paralleling corresponding latitudinal patterns in both terrestrial and freshwater assemblages in Fennoscandia. The importance of local-scale environmental variables increased with decreasing spatial extent. Ecoregions provide an initial stratification scheme for the bioassessment of benthic macroinvertebrates of North European springs. Our results imply that climate warming, landscape disturbance and degradation of spring habitat pose serious threats to spring biodiversity in northern Europe, especially to its already threatened southern faunistic elements.

AB  - Global demand for cobalt is increasing rapidly as we transition to a low-carbon economy. In order to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of this critical metal there is considerable interest in Europe in understanding the availability of cobalt from indigenous resources. This study reviews information on cobalt resources in Europe and evaluates the potential for additional discoveries.
   Based on published information and a survey of national mineral resource agencies, 509 cobalt-bearing deposits and occurrences have been identified in 25 countries in Europe. Harmonised cobalt resources, classified using the United Nations Framework Classification (UNFC), have been estimated for 151 deposits in 12 countries where data are available. The calculated total resource comprises 1 342 649 tonnes of contained cobalt metal. This includes: 114 638 tonnes in commercial projects with current cobalt extraction; 370 409 tonnes in potentially commercial projects; 111 107 tonnes in historic estimates compliant with modern reporting; and 746 495 tonnes in non-compliant historic estimates. Analysis of these data reveals that cobalt resources are widely distributed across Europe in deposits of several different types.
   Global mine production of cobalt is dominated by stratiform sediment-hosted copper deposits, magmatic nickel-copper deposits and nickel laterite deposits, but other deposit types may also be significantly enriched in cobalt. In Europe, current cobalt production is derived from three mines in Finland: the magmatic sulfide deposit at Kevitsa; the Kylylahti deposit of volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) affinity; and the black shale-hosted deposit at Sotkamo (Talvivaara).
   This study has identified 104 deposits in Europe that are currently being explored for cobalt, of which 79 are located in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The Fennoscandian Shield and the Caledonian Belt in these countries are high priority exploration terrains for a variety of cobalt-bearing deposits, notably magmatic Ni-Cu-Co deposits. The Svecofennian, Sveconorwegian and the Caledonian orogenies in Fennoscandia also resulted in the formation of several other cobalt-enriched deposit types. These include chiefly metasedimentand metavolcanichosted Co-Cu-Au, VMS, skarn and polymetallic vein deposits.
   The Kupferschiefer deposits in Poland and Germany are stratiform sediment-hosted Cu deposits with some similarities to the Central African Copperbelt, which is the predominant global producer. However, the cobalt grade in the Kupferschiefer deposits is relatively low (0.005-0.008% Co) and not currently economic to exploit without significant improvement in extraction technology.
   In the Balkans and Turkey cobalt grades and tonnages are known in 27 nickel laterite deposits, with several containing more than 10 000 tonnes of cobalt metal. Only nickel is currently recovered from these deposits, but new processing technologies such as high-pressure acid leaching could enable cobalt recovery in the future.
   Small polymetallic cobalt-bearing vein deposits in several European countries have been historic producers of cobalt. Today most are uneconomic, but new technologies and the drive towards locally-sourced raw materials could make them viable future sources of cobalt.

AB  - Armillaria cepistipes is a common wood-rotting basidiomycete fungus found in most forests in Central Europe. In Switzerland, the habitat of A. cepistipes is fragmented because of the presence of major geographical barriers, in particular the Alps, and past deforestation. We analysed the impact of habitat fragmentation on the current spatial genetic structure of the Swiss A. cepistipes population. A total of 167 isolates were sampled across an area of 41 000 km(2) and genotyped at seven microsatellite and four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. All isolates belonged to different genotypes which, according to the Bayesian clustering algorithm implemented in TESS, originated from a single gene pool. Our analyses indicate that the overall A. cepistipes population shows little, but significant (F-ST = 0.02), genetic differentiation. Such a situation suggests gene flow is strong, possibly due to long-distance dispersal of airborne basidiospores. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that we could not detect a pattern of isolation by distance. Gene flow is partially restricted by the high mountain ranges of the Alps, as indicated by a signal of spatial autocorrelation detected among genotypes separated by less than about 80-130 km. In contrast, past deforestation seems to have no significant effect on the current spatial population structure of A. cepistipes. This might indicate the existence of a time lag between the current spatial genetic structure and the processes that have induced this specific structure. (C) 2012 The British Mycological Society.

AB  - Orestad is Copenhagen's linear new town being built over a 30 year period around stations on an elevated, driverless mini-metro line. Copenhagen Metro's construction was to be financed by the sale to developers of publicly-owned land along the route. The Oresund Bridge from Malmo in Sweden also facilitates substantial international commuting by rail and road to Orestad. This paper briefly assesses Copenhagen's 60 year record of transit-oriented development since its internationally renowned 1947 Finger Plan. It focuses principally on analysing Orestad's progress since the late 1990s in creating transit-oriented development of jobs, housing and retail, education and leisure facilities. The paper finally examines how Orestad is contributing to Copenhagen's economic growth and relieving pressure on Copenhagen's Central Business District. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numerous studies have estimated carbon exchanges at the landatmosphere interface, more recently also including estimates at the freshwateratmosphere interface. Less attention has been paid to lateral carbon fluxes, in particular to the fate of terrestrial carbon during transport from soils via surface waters to the sea. Using extensive datasets on soil, lake and river mouth chemistry of the boreal/hemiboreal region we determined organic carbon (OC) stocks of the O horizon from catchment soils, annual OC transports through more than 700 lakes (OClakeflux) and the total annual OC transport at Sweden's 53 river mouths (OCseaflux). We show here that a minimum of 0.030.87% yr(-1) of the OC soil stocks need to be exported to lakes in order to sustain the annual OClakeflux. Across Sweden we estimated a total OClakeflux of similar to 2.9 Mtonne yr(-1), which corresponds to similar to 10% of Sweden's total terrestrial net ecosystem production, and it is over 50% higher than the total OCseaflux. The OC loss during transport to the sea follows a simple exponential decay with an OC half-life of similar to 12 years. Water colour, a proxy often used for dissolved humic matter, is similarly lost exponentially but about twice as fast as OC. Thus, we found a selective loss of the coloured portion of soil-derived OC during its transport through inland waters, prior to being discharged into the sea. The selective loss is water residence time dependent, resulting in that the faster the water flows through the landscape the less OC and colour is lost. We conclude that increases in runoff will result in less efficient losses of OC, and particularly of colour, if the time for OC transformations in the landscape shortens. Consequently, OC reaching the sea is likely to become more coloured, and less processed, which can have far-reaching effects on biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - In line with the multifunctional agriculture discourse, care farming is highlighted by governments as a promising service?as an additional source of income for farmers and as a current alternative or supplement to ordinary public care services. Based on the rather modest number of care farming services and their often unstable existence, this paper examines critical aspects of the market relation between providers and buyers when it comes to ensuring sustainable and persistent farm-based day care services. Our analysis is based on interviews with farmers as providers of farm-based day care services for people with dementia living in their own homes and with representatives from the municipal health sector as buyers of these services. One of the findings is that the askew, yet harmony-characterised, power structure between the market actors makes professional ordering of care farming services critical to the providers? endurance and wellbeing. The paper concludes that the market relation between providers and buyers could be strengthened, but vulnerabilities related to such a relationship are inevitable.

AB  - The Finnish agri-environmental program (AEP) has been in operation for 20 years with >90 % farmer commitment. This study aimed to establish whether reduced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) use has impacted spring cereal yields and quality based on comprehensive follow-up studies and long-term experiments. We found that the gap between genetic yield potential and attained yield has increased after the AEP was imposed. However, many contemporary changes in agricultural practices, driven by changes in prices and farm subsidies, also including the AEP, were likely reasons, together with reduced N, but not phosphorus use. Such overall changes in crop management coincided with stagnation or decline in yields and adverse changes in quality, but yield-removed N increased and residual N decreased. Further studies are needed to assess whether all the changes are environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable, and acceptable, in the long run. The concept of sustainable intensification is worth considering as a means to develop northern European agricultural systems to combine environmental benefits with productivity.

AB  - Loss of genetic variation is an increasing problem in many natural populations as a result of population fragmentation, inbreeding, and genetic drift, which may lead to inbreeding depression and subsequent "extinction vortices". In such cases, outbreeding offers a potential population saviour from extinction. Here we compare offspring viability between an experimentally founded outbred island population of sand lizards Lacerta agilis, and an inbred mainland source population on the Swedish West coast. We have studied the mainland population for over a decade during which > 4000 offspring from > 500 parents were monitored. We conducted an outbreeding experiment in which lizards from the mainland population with relatively low genetic variation were crossbred with lizards from distant populations that lack gene flow. The resulting 454 offspring were introduced to an otherwise uninhabited island with ideal sand lizard habitat. A survey of the island two decades later showed that offspring produced by females from the experimentally founded population had 13% higher hatching success (99.3% versus 86.4%) and elimination of the malformations occurring in 21% of clutches in the mainland source population. These results co-occur with higher genetic diversity. We conclude that outbreeding improved offspring viability in our island population ca 5-6 generations after the founding event, that is, with sustained viability effects at a time when heterotic effects are expected to have subsided.

AB  - Purpose The article explores what forms of disruption are prioritized by top executives of large manufacturing companies in Finland and what strategies they consider appropriate for the management of disruptive threats and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach The empirical study was based on interviews with top executives in some of Finland's largest manufacturing companies. Findings Based on the data, we identify exploitative and explorative strategies in four dimensions that executives consider important in anticipating and responding to disruptions: internal development efforts, stance on new entrants, ecosystems and institutional change. Due to the presence of multiple potential disruptions, which often generate conflicting demands, executives have to consider them simultaneously and balance between them when making strategic decisions. They therefore do not necessarily have a specific response strategy, but their aim is to develop their companies' capabilities so that they are well-placed to face the future with confidence. Originality/value The findings indicate that the executives envision a disruption landscape that is more complex than typically described in the literature. In addition, it answers the call for a more systematic understanding of incumbents' response strategies by linking different disciplinary views with well-grounded empirical data.

AB  - Modern forestry management should be based on the principle of sustainability. In order to preserve habitat productivity, the amount of nutrients removed from the environment along with forestry products must be taken into consideration. This study shows the exact concentrations of chemical elements in different tree parts of Scots pine, growing on poor soils in north-western Poland. The observed values were compared to the values found in literature. In addition, the relationship between the concentrations of elements and stem diameter or stand density was researched. The highest concentration of chemical elements was observed in the needles (C, N, P, K, Mg, S, Mn, Na, Fe) and the lowest (C, N, P, S, Cu, Na, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe) in the stem wood. Most of the macronutrients (P, K, Ca, Mg and S) reached optimal values, with the exception of N showing a deficiency, especially in the needles. The relationship between the content of elements and DBH or stand density was rather weak, and in both cases, negative.

AB  - Integrated pest management (IPM) was introduced in the 1960s as a response to increasing pesticide use and has since evolved from being understood mainly as an economic issue to also including environmental and human health considerations. The EU has made IPM mandatory for all farmers through the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive (SUD). Using a mixed-methods approach, this paper examines how Norwegian cereal farmers have responded to this requirement. The qualitative results show that most farmers have an understanding of IPM that goes beyond economic considerations only. The quantitative results display that farmers' intrinsic motivation for IPM changed after introduction of the SUD. There is increased emphasis on using methods other than spraying, producing grain without traces of pesticides, and preventing pesticide resistance. Farmers' self-reported knowledge of IPM increased, and 41% of farmers stated that they use IPM to a greater extent than before the SUD was introduced. These results demonstrate that mandatory IPM requirements have been a successful strategy for increasing farmers use of IPM in Norway. Clearer IPM provisions and increased intrinsic motivation for IPM among farmers will, however, be important to reduce the risks from pesticides further.

AB  - Aim: Elevational biodiversity patterns are understudied in high-latitude aquatic systems, even though these systems are important for detecting very early impacts of climatic changes on Earth. The aim of this study was to examine the elevational trends in species richness and local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) of three biofilm microbial groups in freshwater ponds and to identify the key mechanisms underlying these patterns.
   Location: One hundred and forty-six ponds in subarctic Finland and Norway distributed across the tree line along an elevational gradient of 10-1,038 m a.s.l., spanning from forested landscape to barren boulder fields.
   Time period: July-August 2015.
   Major taxa studied: Diatoms, cyanobacteria and non-cyanobacteria.
   Methods: Generalized linear models were used to identify the most important pond variables explaining richness and LCBD. Structural equation models were used to explore the direct and indirect effects of multiscale drivers on richness and LCBD.
   Results: Diatom and cyanobacteria richness showed unimodal elevational patterns, whereas non-cyanobacteria richness decreased with increasing elevation. The LCBD-elevation relationship was U-shaped for all three microbial groups. Diatom and cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were best explained by local pond variables, especially by pH. Non-cyanobacteria richness and LCBD were related to pond variables, elevation as a proxy for climatic conditions, and normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for terrestrial productivity.
   Main conclusions: Aquatic autotrophs were primarily controlled by environmental filtering, whereas heterotrophic bacteria were also affected by terrestrial productivity and elevation. All studied aspects of microbial diversity were directly or indirectly linked to elevation; therefore, climatic changes may greatly alter aquatic microbial assemblages.

AB  - Marine resources exploitation through bottom trawling affects marine ecosystems; thus, management should consider the presence of sensitive species as ecosystem health indicators. Epibenthic organisms such as sea pens are widely used to assess benthic conditions, as their populations are declining where trawling is intense. The Pomo/Jabuka Pits fishing ground in the Adriatic Sea, subject to various management measures over the years, is a nursery for European hake and hosts a small, but dense, population of Norway lobster and a remarkable abundance of pink shrimp. The sea pen Funiculina quadrangularis shares its habitat (sandy-muddy bottoms) with these crustaceans. Through UnderWater TeleVision surveys conducted from 2012 to 2019, F. quadrangularis abundance and distribution were quantified in relation to changes in the spatiotemporal distribution of fishing efforts. The average density (n/m(2)) of colonies was calculated for three periods: BEFORE implementation of measures (before 1 July 2015), during an INTERMEDIATE period in which limitations changed (2 July 2015 to 31 August 2017), and AFTER the implementation of a Fishery Restricted Area (from 1 September 2017). F. quadrangularis revealed an increase in density where fisheries were closed, even after a short period. This showed how management measures can positively influence epibenthic communities and that sea pens can be indicators of impact and/or recovery of habitats.

AB  - By 2050, it is estimated that 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas. This growth in cities creates a demand for fresh produce to ensure a healthy population, produce that often has to travel a long way to reach the consumer, not only losing quality and nutrition along the way, but also requiring a significant fossil fuel cost for transportation and storage. The average plate of food will travel over 2400 km before it reaches your plate. There is potential within District heating (DH) areas to move farming indoors and into the heart of the urban environment. Vertical hydroponic farming (VHF) offers many advantages over conventional farming including more efficient water and land use, and vastly reduced transport costs if it is performed in the urban area. For this model to become economically sustainable however, it must be intelligently integrated into existing urban infrastructure. A mutually beneficial relationship with DH is possible whereby VHFs are integrated to feed back into the DH system, lower the return temperature in line with 4th Generation District Heating guidelines, and reduce CO2 emissions in food and energy production.

AB  - Site productivity is essential information for sustainable forest management and site index (SI) is the most common quantitative measure of it. The SI is usually determined for individual tree species based on tree height and the age of the 100 largest trees per hectare according to stem diameter. The present study aimed to demonstrate and validate a methodology for the determination of SI using remotely sensed data, in particular fused airborne laser scanning (ALS) and airborne hyperspectral data in a forest site in Norway. The applied approach was based on individual tree crown (ITC) delineation: tree species, tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and age were modelled and predicted at ITC level using 10-fold cross validation. Four dominant ITCs per 400 m(2) plot were selected as input to predict SI at plot level for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). We applied an experimental setup with different subsets of dominant ITCs with different combinations of attributes (predicted or field-derived) for SI predictions. The results revealed that the selection of the dominant ITCs based on the largest DBH independent of tree species, predicted the SI with similar accuracy as ITCs matched with field-derived dominant trees (RMSE: 27.6% vs 23.3%). The SI accuracies were at the same level when dominant species were determined from the remotely sensed or field data (RMSE: 27.6% vs 27.8%). However, when the predicted tree age was used the SI accuracy decreased compared to field-derived age (RMSE: 27.6% vs 7.6%). In general, SI was overpredicted for both tree species in the mature forest, while there was an underprediction in the young forest. In conclusion, the proposed approach for SI determination based on ITC delineation and a combination of ALS and hyperspectral data is an efficient and stable procedure, which has the potential to predict SI in forest areas at various spatial scales and additionally to improve existing SI maps in Norway.

AB  - Recent reports of 'road rage' in the British media give the impression that driver aggression is escalating. In order to understand this phenomenon we need to know what it is about driving that provokes motorists to feel anger and then to go on to express that anger in the form of aggression. A postal questionnaire survey of more than 2500 drivers was carried out in three European countries: Britain, Finland and the Netherlands. The study had three main aims: (a) to discover how angry, if at all, a range of situations on the road make drivers, (b) to rind out how many drivers are likely to react aggressively to those situations, and (c) to investigate individual and/or cultural differences in terms of anger and/or aggressive responses among motorists. Results indicate that the same types of behaviour provoke anger and aggression in all three countries, and that traffic density may play a role. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last two decades, forest monitoring and inventory systems have moved from field surveys to remote sensing-based methods. These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data.
   Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km(2) study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification.
   Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The objective of the project presented in this paper has been to develop a new simulator system that can contribute to improved methods for train traffic planning and operation and to create an experimental environment for development of new control support systems and operator user interfaces. The new simulator system is based on a previously developed simulation kernel, SIMON/TTS, which has been used by the Swedish National Rail Administration for off line planning experiments. The SIMON/TTS system has now been redesigned into an interactive, real-time simulator where external control and presentation systems can be connected via a communication module. The simulator system will be used for different purposes. Some of the most important experimental scenarios are to perform experiment with new user interfaces for train traffic control operators, to test the usefulness of decision support systems for train dispatchers, to evaluate alternative strategies for solving conflicts in train traffic control and to provide a simulator environment for education and training of train traffic operators.

AB  - Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) is a thermophilic oak species that is gaining importance in the context of ongoing climate change because of its better resistance to climatic extremes and drier conditions. Therefore, this article focuses on Turkey oak's role and growth properties in the coppice forests of Southern Europe (Italy, Bulgaria) compared to similar site conditions in Central Europe (Slovakia, Czechia). The aims are to evaluate the basic dendrometry indicators, stand biodiversity, growth dynamics, and the effect of climatic factors on tree-ring increment on specific site chronologies. We found that the tree density in coppices of 50-60 years varied between 475 and 775 trees ha(-1), and the stand volume ranged from 141 to 407 m(3) ha(-1). The complex stand diversity of all plots ranged from a monotonous to uniform structure. The size of tree-ring growth was closely related to indicators of stand density. The lowest influence of climatic factors on tree-ring growth was found in sites in Italy and the highest in Slovakia. The primary limiting factor for growth was the lack of precipitation during the growing season, especially in June and July. In contrast, temperature had a marginal effect on radial growth compared to precipitation. The radial growth in research plots in Southern Europe goes through longer 6 to 8-year growth cycles, and in Central European sites, it goes through shorter cycles of 2.4 to 4.8 years, which confirms better growth conditions in this region. The studied coppice stands exhibit a stable reaction to climate change. Yet, regarding cyclical growth, the Central European stands benefit from an advantageous climate and grow better than in Southern Europe. As part of the changing environmental conditions, Turkey oak is becoming an important tree species that can achieve high production potential even in drier habitats due to its regeneration characteristic as coppice and may play a critical role in its northerly introduction in Europe.

AB  - A research project on traditional cultural landscapes in coastal northern Finland provided the opportunity to compare presently managed meadow sites to a series of corresponding abandoned sites. Twenty-two grassland habitats, either grazed or mown. were studied to analyze differences between species compositions The data were classified with TWINSPAN and ordinated with Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The multivariate analysis recognized successfully habitats that are either presently used or differ considerably from the others by their moisture gradient although a few very common generalist species were present in almost every seral stage studied. The studied deviant habitats resemble most of the previously described vegetation types in northern Finland. Results suggest that drought can delay the invasion of tall broad-leaved species. The results also support the idea that abandoned meadows of corresponding moisture gradients begin to resemble each other in later stages of succession. Multivariate methods can be used to determine the succession stages in grassland habitats and thus help to determine the urgency for restoration practices.

AB  - Evidence-based management of natural populations under strong human influence frequently requires not only estimates of survival but also knowledge about how much mortality is due to anthropogenic vs. natural causes. This is the case particularly when individuals vary in their vulnerability to different causes of mortality due to traits, life history stages, or locations. Here, we estimated harvest and background (other cause) mortality of landlocked migratory salmonids over half a century. In doing so, we quantified among-individual variation in vulnerability to cause-specific mortality resulting from differences in body size and spawning location relative to a hydropower dam. We constructed a multistate mark-recapture model to estimate harvest and background mortality hazard rates as functions of a discrete state (spawning location) and an individual time-varying covariate (body size). We further accounted for among-year variation in mortality and migratory behaviour and fit the model to a unique 50-year time series of mark-recapture-recovery data on brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Norway. Harvest mortality was highest for intermediate-sized trout, and outweighed background mortality for most of the observed size range. Background mortality decreased with body size for trout spawning above the dam and increased for those spawning below. All vital rates varied substantially over time, but a trend was evident only in estimates of fishers' reporting rate, which decreased from over 50% to less than 10% throughout the study period. We highlight the importance of body size for cause-specific mortality and demonstrate how this can be estimated using a novel hazard rate parameterization for mark-recapture models. Our approach allows estimating effects of individual traits and environment on cause-specific mortality without confounding, and provides an intuitive way to estimate temporal patterns within and correlation among different mortality sources.

AB  - Spawning habitats of cold-water, European small pelagic fishes have shifted poleward in the last three decades coincident with gradual ocean warming. We predicted present-day, season-specific habitat suitability for spawning by European sardine Sardina pichardus in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean and Black Seas, and projected climate-driven changes in suitable areas from 2050-2099 under the IPCC - RCP 8.5 scenario. Sea surface temperature and distance to the coast had the greater influences in spawning habitats, reflecting the temperature- and coastal-dependent spawning of sardines. Chlorophyll-a was the third most important explanatory variable for spawning in winter to summer. Winds were predominantly important during autumn, whilst sea surface salinity was an important driver during spring and summer. Present-day, "hotspots" for spawning were identified in regions of highly productive, salty waters, where SST was between 6 and 18 degrees C from autumn to spring or 16 and 25 degrees C during summer and favourable winds occurred that would retain eggs and larvae closer to the coast (< 250 km). For future scenarios, forecasts indicate that environmental optima for spawning is projected to be in regions where SST varies between 11 degrees C and 18 degrees C from autumn to spring; and between 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C during summer. However, a negative relationship between phytoplankton productivity and habitat suitability induced by warming is likely to occur in the future. Projections suggest that suitable spawning habitats in all seasons will shift to higher latitudes, with a prominent range expansion along the coast of Norway during winter and autumn (> 83%). The total spawning area, however, was projected to contract in the future during spring (-10.5%) and autumn (-4.1%) due to losses of currently suitable areas along the Atlantic African Coast and Mediterranean Sea. Such regions currently support the greatest sardine stocks but climate-driven warming and decreased plankton productivity are projected to make these areas unsuitable for spawning and likely also for sardine fisheries in future.

AB  - It has previously been concluded that the stable Si isotopes are fractionated during geochemical and biogeochemical elemental transfers, such as weathering and precipitation of clays and biogenic Si, which has opened up the possibility of using Si as a tracer in natural terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, quantification of the biogenic impact on the biogeochemical Si cycle has attracted significant scientific interest since biological control has been suggested. Previous observations of seasonal variations in the dissolved Si isotopic pattern further imply that high-frequency riverine sampling during main hydrological events might provide important information about natural processes governing the fluvial biogeochemical Si cycle. Therefore, temporal variations in the isotopic composition of riverine dissolved Si were investigated for the Kalix River, Northern Sweden, the largest pristine river system in Europe, based on high-frequency sampling during a period of 25 weeks from early April to early October 2006. Temporal variations spanning 0.4 parts per thousand for delta Si-39 and 0.8 parts per thousand for delta Si-35 of dissolved Si in the Kalix River were observed during the period, suggesting that the riverine dissolved Si input to the oceans cannot be considered to have a constant Si isotopic composition on a short time scale.
   The results implicate biogeochemical Si-cycling via formation and dissolution of biogenic silica as processes significantly affecting the dissolved Si transport in boreal systems during April to early October. The Si budget in the river system appeared to be controlled by relative Si enrichment during high discharge events and relative Si depletions in the subarctic mountainous and lake dominated areas. The Si enrichments and depletions were accompanied by decreasing and increasing riverine delta Si-29 and delta Si-30, respectively. These isotope variations can be explained by release of plant derived silica, depleted in heavier Si isotopes, during the spring snowmelt. Further, increased volumetric contribution from the headwater and losses of dissolved Si due to biogenic silica formation by diatoms in the subarctic lakes at a later period are expected to be responsible for the preferential losses of lighter isotopes, as further verified by land cover analysis.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine if an increased use of local land-based snow deposits would be more sustainable than the use of a central snow deposit. The study focused on transport related emissions, costs for transporting the snow, technical attendance, local effects, public acceptance, land use, effects on the recipient environmental control and potential for accidents. General information was obtained from an inventory regarding snow handling that was made in 14, geographically spread, Swedish municipalities during 2001. The comparison of costs for transporting snow and transport-related emissions was based on information gathered from the municipality of Lulea. The study showed that using local land-based snow deposits would decrease traffic-related emissions such as CO2, CO and NOx by 40% annually and would decrease the annual cost for transporting snow by nearly 80%. On the other hand local snow deposits may lead to an increased risk of accidents and to negative local effects such as delayed growing season, flooding and drainage problems. Available land for local snow deposits in the cities is hard to find, and is usually expensive. Therefore a combination of local and central snow deposits is likely to be the most realistic option.

AB  - The burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly, not least in Sub-Saharan Africa, and disadvantaged populations are disproportionally affected. Self-management is a key strategy for people at risk of or with type 2 diabetes, but implementation is a challenge. The objective of this study is to assess the determinants of self-management from an implementation perspective in three settings: two rural districts in Uganda, an urban township in South Africa, and socio-economically disadvantaged suburbs in Sweden. Data collection followed an exploratory multiple-case study design, integrating data from interviews, focus group discussions, and observations. Data collection and analysis were guided by a contextualized version of a transdisciplinary framework for self-management. Findings indicate that people at risk of or with type 2 diabetes are aware of major self-management strategies, but fail to integrate these into their daily lives. Depending on the setting, opportunities to facilitate implementation of self-management include: improving patient-provider interaction, improving health service delivery, and encouraging community initiatives supporting self-management. Modification of the physical environment (e.g. accessibility to healthy food) and the socio-cultural environment (i.e. norms, values, attitudes, and social support) may have an important influence on people's lifestyle. Regarding the study methodology, we learned that this innovative approach can lead to a comprehensive analysis of self-management determinants across different settings. An important barrier was the difficult contextualization of concepts like perceived autonomy and self-efficacy. Intervention studies are needed to confirm whether the pathways suggested by this study are valid and to test the proposed opportunities for change.

AB  - Energy conservation is expected to contribute significantly to climate change mitigation and energy security. Traditionally, energy companies have had strong role in providing Demand Side Management (DSM) measures. However, after energy market liberalization in Europe, energy companies' DSM activities declined. In response, the EU issued Directive (2006/32/EC) on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD) to motivate energy companies to promote energy efficiency and conservation, closely followed by Directive (2012/27/EU) on energy efficiency (EED), requiring the setting up energy efficiency obligation schemes. Despite strong political and economic motivation, energy companies struggle to develop energy efficiency services in liberalised energy markets due to conflicting institutional demands, which arise from contradicting policy requirements and customer relations. The main challenges in developing new innovative energy efficiency services, evidenced by an in-depth case study, were (1) the unbundling of energy company operations, which makes it difficult to develop services when the contribution of several business units is required and (2) the distrust among energy end-users, which renders the business logic of energy saving contract models self-contradictory. On the basis of the research, avenues out of these dilemmas are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose To investigate safety at truck drivers' work outside the cab with a special focus on work environment and equipment maintenance to prevent occupational accidents. Design/methodology/approach Two statistical databases on Finnish occupational accidents for truck drivers are analysed. Firstly, the national accident statistics database is examined to understand the broad context, and secondly a database on fatal accidents is analysed to better understand the root causes of the accidents and their relationship to human factors in maintenance. Based on the root cause analysis, four accident scenarios are created, and risk management measures are prioritized by occupational safety and health specialists (n = 7). Findings The study shows that there are a variety of accidents in truck drivers' work. Most of the accidents occur outside the cab while performing tasks other than driving. Further, in-depth analysis of the fatal accidents increases understanding of the possibilities of different risk management and maintenance actions in preventing such accidents. Research limitations/implications Databases contain different limitations concerning the data. Practical implications Truck drivers' work environments are wide in nature. Efficient safety management requires broad participation from different stakeholders. In addition to safe work activities, work environment and equipment maintenance is highlighted as a key component for safe and fluent delivery transportation. Social implications Road transportation forms a backbone of modern society. Accidents affect the efficiency of transportation and cause manifold costs reaching all the way to the societal level. Originality/value This study adds an important dimension of delivery transportation to a current scientific discussion on human factors and maintenance.

AB  - The aim of the study was to relate the distribution of freshwater snails in 21 semi-isolated bays (within a salinity range of 0.7-7.4 practical salinity units, PSU) to environmental variables of the Aland Islands, SW Finland. Altogether 16 species of freshwater snails were found when the bays were investigated by hand-picking and a rod sieve. Of these, six or seven species may be regarded as almost ubiquitous. The salinity limiting most freshwater snails is approximately 4-5 PSU. The marine snail Hydrobia ventrosa was found in only two of the bays. The highest number of snail species occurred in bays with large catchment areas, especially where there were freshwater lakes in the local area. The number of species increased with decreasing salinity (Spearman's rho = -0.513). The maximum number of species was found in a bay with almost freshwater-like conditions, inferring that tolerance to higher salinities in some species is restricted.

AB  - Gammaherpesvirus infections have been described in cervids worldwide, mainly the generaMacavirusorRhadinovirus. However, little is known about the gammaherpesviruses species infecting cervids in Norway and Fennoscandia. Blood samples from semi-domesticated (n= 39) and wild (n= 35) Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), moose (Alces alces,n= 51), and red deer (Cervus elaphus,n= 41) were tested using a panherpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) PCR. DPOL-PCR-positive samples were subsequently tested for the presence of glycoprotein B (gB) gene. The viral DPOL gene was amplified in 28.2% (11/39) of the semi-domesticated reindeer and in 48.6% (17/35) of the wild reindeer. All moose and red deer tested negative. Additionally, gB gene was amplified in 4 of 11 semi-domesticated and 15 of 17 wild Eurasian reindeer DPOL-PCR-positive samples. All the obtained DPOL and gB sequences were highly similar among them, and corresponded to a novel gammaherpesvirus species, tentatively namedRangiferine gammaherpesvirus 1, that seemed to belong to a genus different fromMacavirusandRhadinovirus.This is the first report of a likely host-specific gammaherpesvirus in semi-domesticated reindeer, an economic and cultural important animal, and in wild tundra reindeer, the lastpopulation in Europe. Future studies are required to clarify the potential impact of this gammaherpesvirus on reindeer health.

AB  - This study investigated the nurseries of seven commercially important demersal species of the northern sector of the Strait of Sicily (central Mediterranean): red mullet. European hake, horned octopus, deep-water rose shrimp, greater forkbeard. Norway lobster and giant red shrimp. An eleven-year series of data collected through experimental trawling in the Strait of Sicily during spring and autumn was analyzed. The spatio-temporal persistence of the high-density aggregations (hot spots) of juvenile individuals in their first year of life was investigated to identify habitats that serve as nurseries. The density of recruits within the persistent nurseries was used as a proxy of the unit area contribution of individuals which recruit to the adult population. The spatial distribution patterns of the recruits of most the species were well defined and very stable in the long term. Persistent and potentially highly productive nurseries of European hake, deep-water rose shrimp and greater forkbeard were identified off the southern coast of Sicily. Persistent areas of recruits concentration were also observed for the other species investigated, but their specific potential contribution of individuals to the adult population was not substantial compared to adjacent grounds. The close or overlapped localization of sites which regularly host vulnerable life stages of different exploited species, revealed an area of great ecological significance which probably plays a major role in the dynamics of the fishery resources in the Strait of Sicily. Appropriate spatial protection measures of this area, including marine protected area designation, could complement conventional management approach for ensuring the long-term sustainability of these fisheries and stocks conservation.

AB  - Regional competitiveness has become a truism for many places today. In line with this "competitive discourse", planners in Umea, Northern Sweden, are seeking to create a "sticky" place where capital and people are attracted by enhancing the cultural sector through the hosting of events. By implementing the bid for the title of European Capital of Culture in 2014 through a positive growth-oriented discourse, it is hoped that a multitude of stakeholders will come together in a network of "co-creation", and enhance an image of the city as a creative and gushing place with endless development possibilities. This paper studies how a development proposal is implemented among the stakeholders by seeking to create positive expectations. With a point of departure in stakeholder theory and interdiscursive analysis, this study explores the role of discourse in stakeholder dynamics and engagement. The results of this study show that implementation is not merely a marketing process, but different opinions will emerge that may contest the "official" discourse, and that the outcomes of the implementation strategy may be hard to control unless the "official" discourse is consciously elaborated to adapt to these counter-discourses.

AB  - A new Swedish capacity manual has been developed based on a major research project called METKAP. This paper is focused on the deterministic methods for calculation of signal timing and traffic performance measures for isolated, fixed time signalized intersections documented in the new manual (STA 2013a) and applied in the CAPCAL 4 software (Linse 2013). The use of the methods is mandatory in projects for the Swedish Transport Administration (STA). Special focus has been devoted to the following issues: 1) Modelling of saturation flow for opposed lanes. 2) Impact of short approach and exit lanes. 3) Iterative signal timing process based on critical conflict identification, intergreen and minimum green times.
   The deterministic methods can also be applied for selection of maximum green time for VA-controlled intersections, and as planning tool for analysis of the traffic performance alternative intersection types, designs. They can also be used to identify "bottleneck intersections" and for determination of minimum cycle time and required green time ratios for coordinated traffic signal systems.
   Micro simulation can be used as an alternative method, e.g. to model complex, signal control strategies and active priority of public transport vehicles. Need for simulation also arises if adjacent traffic facilities influence the studied system, and for animation purposes. However, micro simulation has important short-comings compared to deterministic methods. Simulation models require validated and detailed input data, e.g. regarding vehicle characteristics, arrival distribution, route choice and driver behavior. It is also difficult to estimate saturation flow, capacity and volume-to-capacity ratio since the simulated queue discharge is normally based on car-following models. Determination of optimal intersection design and signal timing requires a very large number of simulation runs and is therefore very time consuming and costly.

AB  - Sustainable access to raw materials has been growing concern for the EU policy from 2008. Germany, Finland, United Kingdom, Portugal and Greece were the first European countries to introduce and develop own minerals policy (2010-2012). Each of Member State prioritized own targets, but sustainability, waste management and climate were also underlined. In 2015 the 17 Sustainable Development Goals were established and adopted in the EU policy framework to monitor and measure the social, economic and environmental aspects. Next Paris Agreement targets and climate neutral has been introduced. They have significant impact also on mining industry. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to discuss the relationship between mineral policy in chosen countries and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and EU climate policy target. Due to limited data for mining sector the impact of mineral policy on sustainable mineral supply and CO2 emissions have been analyzed to identify the specific challenges, trends and successful factors of transition. It was shown that well developed mineral policy - in case of Finland - allow increase over 20% of production with over 20% decrease of CO2 emission. Moreover productivity in the sector in almost all analyzed country has been increased, what can show some correlation between mineral policy and SDG 12. However more detailed indicators for monitoring and assess the mineral policy on EU level and in individual country is needed, especially in contest of impact on sustainable development. It can help to provide acceptance of local society for new investment. It is a long term process which required not only significant financial capital, new technological solutions, but also trust and transparency in monitoring in implementing environmental and social aspects.

AB  - The extraction of minerals from land-based mines necessitates the disposal of large amounts of mine tailings. Dumping and storage of tailings into the marine environment, such as fjords, is currently being performed without knowing the potential ecological consequences. This study investigated the effect of short-term exposure to different deposition depths of inert iron ore tailings (0.1, 0.5, and 3 cm) and dead subsurface sediment (0.5 and 3 cm) on a deep water (200 m) fjord benthic assemblage in a microcosm experiment. Biotic and abiotic variables were measured to determine structural and functional changes of the benthic community following an 11 and 16 day exposure with tailings and dead sediment, respectively. Structural changes of macrofauna, meiofauna, and bacteria were measured in terms of biomass, density, community composition and mortality while measures of oxygen penetration depth, sediment community oxygen consumption and C-13-uptake and processing by biota revealed changes in the functioning of the system. Burial with mine tailings and natural sediments modified the structure and functioning of the benthic community albeit in a different way. Mine tailings deposition of 0.1 cm and more resulted in a reduced capacity of the benthic community to remineralize fresh C-13-labeled algal material, as evidenced by the reduced sediment community oxygen consumption and uptake rates in all biological compartments. At 3 cm of tailings deposition, it was evident that nematode mortality was higher inside the tailings layer, likely caused by reduced food availability. In contrast, dead sediment addition led to an increase in oxygen consumption and bacterial carbon uptake comparable to control conditions, thereby leaving deeper sediment layers anoxic and in turn causing nematode mortality at 3 cm deposition. This study clearly shows that even small levels (0.1 cm) of instantaneous burial by mine tailings may significantly reduce benthic ecosystem functioning on the short term. Furthermore, it reveals the importance of substrate characteristics and origin when studying the effects of substrate addition on marine benthic fauna. Our findings should alert decision makers when considering approval of new deep-sea tailings placement sites as this technique will have major negative impacts on benthic ecosystem functioning over large areas.

AB  - River regulation may filter out riparian plants often resulting in reduced functional diversity, i.e., in the range of functions that organisms have in communities and ecosystems. There is, however, little empirical evidence about the magnitude of such reductions in different regions. We investigated the functional diversity patterns of riparian woody vegetation to streamflow regulation in boreal Sweden and Mediterranean Portugal using nine plant functional traits and field data from 109 sampling sites. We evaluated changes in mean plant functional traits as well as in indices of multidimensional functional traits, i.e., functional richness (FRic) and functional redundancy (FRed) within regions and between free-flowing and regulated river reaches. We found that regulation significantly reduced functional diversity in Sweden but not in Portugal. In Sweden, the increased magnitude of variations in water flow and water level in summer, the prolonged duration of extreme hydrological events, the increased frequency of high-water pulses, and the rate of change in water conditions were the likely main drivers of functional diversity change. Small riparian plant species with tiny leaves, poorly lignified stems, and shallow root systems were consistently associated with regulated sites in the boreal region. In Portugal, the similar functional diversity values for free-flowing and regulated rivers likely stem from the smaller streamflow alterations by regulation combined with the species legacy adaptations to the Mediterranean natural hydrological regimes. We conclude that streamflow regulation may reduce the functional diversity of riparian woody vegetation, but the magnitude of these effects will vary depending on the adaptations of the local flora and the patterns of streamflow disturbances. Our study provides insights into functional diversity patterns of riparian woody vegetation affected by regulation in contrasting biomes and encourages further studies of the functional diversity thresholds for maintaining ecosystems.

AB  - Aim. To bring insights into how healthcare managers and staffing assistants work to achieve sustainable working hours within a participatory scheduling system. Background. Hospital nurses and assistant nurses often work on rotating shifts, which affects their opportunities for sleep, recovery, and work-life balance. In Sweden, a participatory scheduling approach is commonly used, where working hours are planned in collaboration between employees, managers, and staffing assistants. Influence over working hours is related to positive outcomes among shift workers. However, it also places responsibility on the employee to schedule working hours that promote health and patient safety, i.e., sustainable working hours. Accordingly, the organisation has responsibilities to support the employee in this regard. Methods. Semistructured individual interviews were conducted with 11 managers and 9 staffing assistants from four Swedish regions and analysed using thematic analysis. Results. Several key factors for achieving sustainable working hours within the context of participatory scheduling were described: distribution and clarity of responsibilities, allocating time for scheduling, establishing shared responsibility, considering fairness, fostering an individual relationship with the employee, managing dissatisfaction, providing support, clarifying guidelines for sustainable scheduling, managing inconsistencies between employee requests and sustainable working hours, and considering recovery opportunities and the competence mix on shifts. Additionally, contextual factors, such as staffing levels, working procedures, working time arrangements for night work, and technological support, were highlighted as important. Conclusion. Achieving sustainable working hours within participatory scheduling involves considering the interactions between factors at the levels of the organisation, the individual, and the technological systems. Implication for Nursing Management. Nurse managers and staffing assistants must work closely with their employees during participatory scheduling to ensure sustainable working hours. Key goals in this regard include establishing a shared responsibility, clarifying responsibilities and guidelines for sustainable scheduling, and allocating time for the scheduling process.

AB  - In the recent decades, there have been frequent conflicts between groundwater resources and environmentally hazardous activities. An example is the construction of the new highway through the important glaciofluvial esker aquifer Nybroasen, which passes the protection zone of the water supply for the Kalmar municipality, in the southeastern part of Sweden. The decision to build the new road through this important aquifer has been strongly questioned by the municipality and the public because the value of the water resources in Nybroasen was not taken into consideration during the first phase of the decision-making process. Multicriteria decision aid (MCDA) is applied as a tool to structure and analyze the four road alternatives proposed in the environmental impact assessment for the above conflict. The alternatives, including the existing road, are in conflict with water resources, agriculture, natural, and cultural values. The impacts on the water resources have been predicted by a two-dimensional physically based time-variant flow and solute groundwater model, which has been calibrated and evaluated. The MCDA illustrates how it can be used to identify (1) actors and their concerns, (2) ranking of alternative road scenarios according to actors' preferences, and (3) coalition groups of actors, i.e., groups that have similar views with regard to the road alternatives. The analysis shows that the two best compromise solutions obtained in the MCDA were unacceptable by the strongest coalition group, showing that either the family of criteria was not well chosen or new alternatives should have been developed.

AB  - The Energy Park of Vimercate, just outside Milan, stands as the true answer to all the companies operating in Hi-Tech, telecommunications and IT, and which are planning to rationalize their rents and energy bills while improving the environmental and working conditions of their employees.
   The Building 03 of the Energy Park is the first Italian building ever to be issued the LEED Platinum certificate.
   There are only six more Platinum-certified buildings in Europe, more precisely in Sweden, Finland, Luxembourg and Germany.
   The Building is part of the Technology Park of Vimercate and it was built by SEGRO, an investment and development firm, the European leader in the supply of flexible spaces and business solutions. It is a project for the development of an area that was already known for its industrial/manufacturing vocation, in order to achieve a modern, sustainable transformation that is mandatory if this area is to survive in the future.
   The building won the LEED Platinum certificate thanks to the optimum solutions regarding energy consumption, lighting, use of water and of other materials, and thanks to a wide range of strategies aimed at enhancing the sustainability of this structure, which is the subject of this paper.

TI  - National Climate Change Adaptation Strategies of European States from a Spatial Planning and Development Perspective
T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The aim of this article is to give an overview and systematic characterization of different national approaches to developing strategies of climate change adaptation from a spatial planning or regional development perspective, respectively. Based on this analysis, recommendations are made for the implementation of the Territorial Agenda of the European Union. The central research hypotheses addressed in this article are: (1) climate change impacts in Europe are distributed differently in European regions which influence the design of national adaptation strategies (NASs) in Europe as well as the planning-related fields of action; (2) the legal framework and the political-administrative system significantly determine how national adaptation responses are designed and by which institutions they are implemented and (3) spatial planning has the potential to play an important role in climate change adaptation due to its integrative, cross-sectoral character. In order to discuss the hypotheses, a meta-evaluation of already existing assessments of climate adaptation strategies was carried out, as well as nine in-depth country studies (Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Spain, The Netherlands and the UK). The results show that spatial planning is only given minor attention in the assessed analyses and national strategies and that it is rather a matter of political willingness and capacity building than particular instruments or a high climate change vulnerability if spatial planning, however, plays an important role in an NAS.

AB  - Food waste is a significant problem within public catering establishments in any normal situation. During spring 2020 the Covid-19 pandemic placed the public catering system under greater pressure, revealing weaknesses within the system and generation of food waste due to rapidly changing consumption patterns. In times of crisis, it is especially important to conserve resources and allocate existing resources to areas where they can be of most use, but this poses significant challenges. This study evaluated the potential of a forecasting model to predict guest attendance during the start and throughout the pandemic. This was done by collecting data on guest attendance in Swedish school and preschool catering establishments before and during the pandemic, and using a machine learning approach to predict future guest attendance based on historical data. Comparison of various learning methods revealed that random forest produced more accurate forecasts than a simple artificial neural network, with conditional mean absolute prediction error of <0.15 for the trained dataset. Economic savings were obtained by forecasting compared with a no-plan scenario, supporting selection of the random forest approach for effective forecasting of meal planning. Overall, the results obtained using forecasting models for meal planning in times of crisis confirmed their usefulness. Continuous use can improve estimates for the test period, due to the agile and flexible nature of these models. This is particularly important when guest attendance is unpredictable, so that production planning can be optimized to reduce food waste and contribute to a more sustainable and resilient food system.

AB  - Background: Norway has a long history of using telemedicine, especially for geographical reasons. Despite the availability of promising telemedicine applications and the implementation of national initiatives and policies, the sustainability and scaling-up of telemedicine in the health system is still far from accomplished. The main objective of this study was to explore and identify the multi-level (micro, meso and macro) factors affecting telemedicine utilization in Norway.
   Methods: We used a mixed methods approach. Data from a national registry were collected to analyze the use of outpatient visits and telemedicine contacts in Norway from 2009 to 2015. Interviews with key stakeholders at national, regional and local level helped complete and contextualize the data analysis and explore the main issues affecting the use of telemedicine by health authorities and hospitals. Relevant national documents were also used to support, contradict, contextualize or clarify information and data.
   Results: Telemedicine use in Norway from 2009 to 2015 remained very low, not exceeding 0.5% of total outpatient activity at regional level and 0.1% at national level. All four regions used telemedicine. Of the 29 hospitals, 24 used it at least once over the 7-year period. Telemedicine was not used regularly everywhere, with some hospitals using it sporadically. Telemedicine was mostly used in selected specialties, including rehabilitation, neurosurgery, skin and venereal diseases. Three major themes affecting implementation and utilization of telemedicine in Norway emerged: (i) governance and strategy; (ii) organizational and professional dimensions; (iii) economic and financial dimensions. For each theme, a number of factors and challenges faced at different health care levels were identified.
   Conclusions: This study allowed shedding light on multi-level and interdependent factors affecting utilization of telemedicine in Norway. The identification of the main implementation and utilization challenges might support decision makers and practitioners in the successful scaling-up of telemedicine. This work provides a knowledge base useful to other countries which intend to implement telemedicine or other digital health services into their healthcare systems.

The field campaign involved the deployment of 73 Malaise traps at 55 localities across the country for three years (2003-2006). Over the past 15 years, the collected material has been hand sorted by trained technicians into over 300 taxonomic fractions suitable for expert attention. The resulting collection is a tremendous asset for entomologists around the world, especially as we now face a desperate need for baseline data to evaluate phenomena like insect decline and climate change. Here, we describe the history, organisation, methodology and logistics of the SMTP, focusing on the rationale for the decisions taken and the lessons learned along the way. The SMTP represents one of the early instances of community science applied to large-scale inventory work, with a heavy reliance on volunteers in both the field and the laboratory. We give estimates of both staff effort and volunteer effort involved. The project has been funded by the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative; in total, the inventory has cost less than 30 million SEK (approximately 3.1 million USD). Based on a subset of the samples, we characterise the size and taxonomic composition of the SMTP material. Several different extrapolation methods suggest that the material comprises around 20 million specimens in total. The material is dominated by Diptera (75% of the specimens) and Hymenoptera (15% of specimens). Amongst the Diptera, the dominant groups are Chironomidae (37% of specimens), Sciaridae (15%), Phoridae (13%), Cecidomyiidae (9.5%) and Mycetophilidae (9.4%). Within Hymenoptera, the major groups are Ichneumonidae (44% of specimens), Diaprioidea (19%), Braconidae (9.6%), Platygastroidea (8.5%) and Chalcidoidea (7.9%). The taxonomic composition varies with latitude and season. Several Diptera and Hymenoptera groups are more common in non-summer samples (collected from September to April) and in the North, while others show the opposite pattern. About 1% of the total material has been processed and identified by experts so far. This material represents over 4,000 species. One third of these had not been recorded from Sweden before and almost 700 of them are new to science. These results reveal the large amounts of taxonomic work still needed on Palaearctic insect faunas. Based on the SMTP experiences, we discuss aspects of planning and conducting future large-scale insect inventory projects using mainly traditional approaches in relation to more recent approaches that rely on molecular techniques.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for biofuel to replace fossil fuels. One of the key elements in this transition is the securing of a large supply of sustainable biomass. In this study, the feedstock potential of long rotation poplar plantations (12-30 years with diameter of 15 of 30 cm) was determined and the properties of poplar biomass fuel were analyzed with the aim of using thermochemical conversion methods to produce biofuel. Our results demonstrate that Sweden has great potential for producing biofuels from long rotation poplar plantations, with a total of 1.8 million hectares (ha) consisting of arable (0.5 million ha) and forested arable land (1.3 million ha). Based on available land and biomass production potential, our results indicate that 10 million Mg DW could be produced annually. Regions in mid/southern Sweden have the largest potential (larger areas and higher biomass production. Our results further suggest that poplar biomass from these plantations has fuel characteristics similar to forest fuels from other conifer tree species, making the biomass suitable as feedstock for biofuel production based on thermochemical conversion methods. If 25% of the available land were used, 7.6 TWh methanol biofuels could be produced annually from 16 biofuel plants, using 160,000 Mg DW yr(-1), primarily located in the southern part of Sweden. Two counties (Skane and Vastra Gotaland) would be able to support their biofuel plants using poplar plantations as feedstock. Stable biofuel production in the other counties would depend on collaborating with neighboring counties.

AB  - Recent research indicates that sustainability assessment tools (SAT) for farms need to be contextually adapted to be acceptable and useful. Focusing specifically on social sustainability, this study sought to identify important aspects of relevance for Swedish (livestock) farmers' social situation and compare these aspects with social indicators used in three existing SATs (RISE, SAFA, IDEA). A survey revealed that social issues of key importance for the self-reported overall life satisfaction of Swedish livestock farmers are: having a good financial situation, having a similar standard of living as others, not experiencing too much stress, having meaningful work, having decent working hours, and having a desirable family situation. Of the three SATs evaluated, RISE appears best equipped to capture the social situation of Swedish farmers but does not fully address the aspect of finding work meaningful. SAFA and IDEA both fail to capture many aspects of importance for describing the social situation of Swedish farmers. We present a novel method for testing the relevance of social indicators for farmers in a specific context. Applying this method before choosing, applying, and adapting SATs for farm-level sustainability assessments would increase the relevance of the social sustainability dimension, but deeper stakeholder engagement than offered by our survey is needed.

AB  - Key message Drought severely worsened till 2100 and eventually outplayed growth-enhancing CO2 fertilization turning productivity gains into losses for beech and fir. Most scenarios generated notable losses in profitability but economic tipping points were later than for productivity due to lag effects related to discounting. Time mixture of fir and shortening rotation can counteract economic risks under climate change, but requires early admixture and moderate establishment costs.Context Adaptation strategies to climate change (CC) such as establishing mixed forests are often based on ecological understanding while economic rationale is often disregarded.Aims This paper studies CC uncertainty on productivity and profitability of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Besides, the economic consequences to actively adapt beech forests by admixing Silver fir are investigated.Methods We used the process-based forest growth model GOTILWA + to simulate RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climatic projection by the MPI-ESM-LR global circulation model (MPI-ESM-LR) with the CO2 fertilization effect (eCO2) switched on and off. We analysed the sensitivity of the land expectation value (LEV) on CC and economic parameters.Results CC initially increased productivity, but declined after a tipping point (2040-2070) and later also profitability (2045-2100). RCP8.5 had positive, RCP2.6 negative and RCP4.5 neutral effects on LEV. Switching off eCO2 turned RCP8.5 from the most profitable to the least profitable scenario and the opposite for RCP2.6. CC generally reduced optimal rotation (Ropt) being scenario dependant, but comparatively more for fir than beech. Admixing fir created an economic benefit when implemented before stand age 50 of beech. This benefit was nullified with protection costs for browsing control (fencing or tree shelters).Conclusions Economic parameters (not CC) were the major source of uncertainty stemming from discounting factors and establishment costs. Admixture of fir and shortening rotation can provide a solution to tackle economic and climate uncertainties, but requires early admixture and browsing control.

AB  - In the RRIL (Responsible Research and Innovation Learning) ERASMUS+ project, learning material are developed/under development by the partner universities (Finland, Poland and Spain). To be successful one of the key issues is the public engagement as it goes far beyond the researchers activity and the relevant stakeholders at local/regional/national level (non-profit organizations, cities, companies ... ), and include small players (neighbourhoods associations, social actors ... ). Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) is a concept developed by the European Commission for the governance of research and innovation processes with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products. It aims to shape, maintain, develop, coordinate and align existing and novel research and innovation-related processes, actors and responsibilities with a view to ensuring desirable and acceptable research outcomes. The RRIL project pretends to fulfil this gap through the co-creation of higher education modules between different research and innovation actors.

AB  - The dead standing trees i.e. snags are known as habitat for epiphytic and epixylic species including first of all lichens and bryophytes. The vascular plants are much rarer on this type of coarse woody debris (CWD). The eighty snags (CWD elements higher than 1.5m) of Norway spruce Picea abies and beech Fagus sylvatica in the Karkonosze Mts. were examined for the presence of lichens, liverworts, mosses and vascular plants. The height of snags, their decomposition stage, cover of bark, diameter at breast height (DBH) as well as site conditions (elevation, slope and aspect, presence in forest community) were measured and noted. The percent cover of plants and lichens were estimated on each snag. Totally 99 taxa were recorded. There lichen species were dominant (44), followed by mosses (34), liverworts (13) and there were only 8 vascular plants. The total species richness varied from 1 to 22 taxa. The species composition growing on snags was subjected to canonical correspondence analysis and statistical analyses. They revealed that the species identity of snag is one of the most important factors influencing species composition. The number of species is positively correlated with DBH whereas decomposition stage, presence of bark, snag height are not significant factors. The species richness increases also with altitude what is connected with higher abundance of spruce snags. The occurrence of snags in this area is mainly associated with forest management practices in the past. Despite of some observed patterns in colonization of snags they are important habitat especially for lichens.

AB  - BackgroundDrawing on the literature on cutback management, this article deals with healthcare decommissioning in times of austerity. Politicians and decision-makers are typically reluctant to decommission healthcare, and if they do, the public generally reacts strongly towards reductions in service supply. Despite this, comprehensive decommissioning does take place, though empirical knowledge about its effects and economic sustainability is limited. To further the understanding of healthcare decommissioning, this paper aims to introduce the concepts of cutback management into the research on healthcare decommissioning, and apply its components to an empirical case of comprehensive decommissioning. In doing so, the study analyses whether decommissioning measures can be expected to generate long- or short-term economic payoff, and considers what other effects they might have on the healthcare system.MethodWe developed a theoretical framework that enabled us to investigate the measures through which a local healthcare system in Sweden, region Dalarna, responded to an acute fiscal crisis in 2014, and what effects these measures are likely to generate. The method used was a deductive content analysis of Dalarna's decommissioning program, containing 122 austerity measures for saving 700 million Swedish Krona (SEK).ResultsDalarna's local decision-makers responded to the fiscal crisis through a combination of operational cuts (20% of undertaken measures), programme cuts (42% of undertaken measures), and structural reforms (38% of undertaken measures). The instruments most commonly used were increased patient fees and the merger of service facilities. By relying foremost on programme cuts and structural reforms, Dalarna adopted the measures most plausible to have moderate or long-term economic payoffs. Successful implementation, however, may be challenging and difficult to evaluate.ConclusionsHealthcare politicians and decision makers have better potential to stabilize their long-term economic situation if they rely on responses such as operational cuts, programme cuts and structural reforms, as opposed to across-the-board cuts and cuts in investment and capital expenditures. However, with economics being only one important factor for sustainable healthcare systems, further studies should investigate how these measures affect important principles, such as equal healthcare distribution and access.Trial registrationNot applicable.

AB  - Several historic pilgrimage routes called Saint Olav Ways terminate at the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, Norway. All have status as European Cultural Routes. Most popular is the 643 km Gudbrandsdal route from Oslo. The number of pilgrims along this route increases every year, currently totalling a few thousand annually. Our study - the first quantitative analysis of pilgrims in Norway - is based on two years of surveying on-site hikers (using self-registration boxes) and a follow-up, e-mail based, online questionnaire (N = 276). The survey sought information about pilgrims' motives, pilgrimage behaviour and demographics; how they differ from modern pilgrims and pilgrimage elsewhere; and how similar they are to long-distance hikers, and hiking, generally. Drawing from literature on motives for pilgrimage, (thru-) hiking, and certain domains from the Recreation Experience Preference (REP) scales, we used a list of 49 motivational items. An exploratory factor (PCA) analysis revealed eight motivational dimensions. Foreigners dominate, and the "average pilgrim" has little or no previous pilgrim experience, hikes for 22 days and appreciates the simplicity tied to the hiking experience. They walk at a low pace through quiet, natural and unfamiliar environments, reflect on life, develop spirituality, and enjoy contact with local people and heritage. The religious dimension is, on average, not prominent but more evident for those with previous pilgrimage and extensive multi-day hiking experience. The hiking journey is more important than reaching Nidaros. These findings are comparable to studies of modern pilgrimage elsewhere. However, the motives/preferences tie just as well to research findings on long-distance hiking, though the majority (68%) find a great difference in hiking a pilgrimage route compared to other long distance routes. We found this - the knowledge, experience, or image of the SOW route - to be the most influential variable in revealing motivational variation in the studied population.

AB  - This study aims to estimate relative pollen productivity (PPEs) of major pollen types and the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) in a semi-open landscape in western Norway. Extended R-value (ERV) models are used to analyse a data set consisting of surface pollen assemblages from 34 lakes and vegetation survey around each site. Ordination techniques indicate relatively short gradients (<2.3 SD) both in the vegetation and pollen data sets. The lake sizes vary from 0.4 ha to 19.0 ha (mean=5.7 ha, sd=4.3 ha) but follow a normal distribution - a departure from the assumption of the ERV models that the lake size should be constant among sites. Simulations demonstrate that, if the sizes of circular-shaped lakes follow a normal distribution, the ERV model-based methods provide the expected PPE and RSAP values using a standardized lake radius. If the distribution is highly skewed or equally random around the mean, the results are not reliable. We apply the analytical strategy implied from the simulations to obtain relative PPEs and the RSAP in western Norway. PPEs for ten taxa (Alnus, Fagus, Picea, Pinus, Quercus, Juniperus, Salix, Calluna, Cyperaceae, Rumex) relative to Poaceae are comparable with some of those previously obtained in different parts of Europe, indicating that there are general patterns of high and low pollen producers that will be useful for reconstruction purposes. The RSAP estimate is the area within a radius of 900-1100 m. This study demonstrates the importance of careful evaluation of the extent to which the departures from the model assumptions affect the outcomes from the ERV model-based analysis.

AB  - Since 1998, Woodside Mauritania Pty Ltd has been exploring for hydrocarbon deposits offshore from the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, in Northwest Africa. A 3-D seismic survey, undertaken in 1999-2000, revealed the presence of buried and seabed carbonate mounds at approximately 450-550 m water depth on the continental slope. These mounds are approximately 100 m in height, 500 m wide at the base, and cover a linear extent of at least 190 km. Core samples from the mounds were found to contain dead fragments of four species of cold-water corals: Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata, Solenosmilia variabilis and Desmophyllum sp. In 2002, a preliminary towed camera survey revealed large areas of coral rubble at two mound sites suggesting that corals were previously a dominant component of the benthic community. A second video survey, in 2003, recorded some live hard coral polyps and a single live coral colony, probably L. pertusa, at one of the mound sites. Coral rubble at all sites surveyed was found to support epibenthic invertebrate and fish assemblages. The mound areas surveyed may have been exposed to physical impacts that have resulted in damage of coral colonies previously inhabiting these features. Based on the nature of the damage and past and present demersal fishing activity in the region, bottom trawling could have caused these impacts. The discovery of a significant deep-water reefal system offshore Mauritania has implications for future management of trawling and oil exploration activities. These issues are discussed in the context of the potential biodiversity significance and conservation importance of the carbonate mud mounds and their associated biological communities.

AB  - The associations between floristic and palynological richness and landscape structure were studied based on modern pollen-vegetation data from a patchy cultural landscape in southern Estonia (northern temperate vegetation zone). Nine study sites (small lakes and their surrounding vegetation) represent land cover gradient from closed forest to semi-open vegetation. Floristic richness (number of species) and floristic richness of pollen types (number of pollen-equivalent taxa) were used to describe the vegetation within the radius of 250 m from the pollen sampling sites. Palynological richness was calculated to describe the modern pollen samples diversity. Landscape structure was estimated on the basis of landscape openness and three landscape diversity measures: richness of community patches, Simpson evenness of community patches and Simpson diversity of community patches. To study the effect of the spatial scale of landscapes on the vegetation-landscape and pollen-landscape associations, landscape structure was estimated within eight radii (250-2,000 m) around each lake. The results showed that landscape openness was the most important determinant of both floristic richness and palynological richness in southern Estonia and that landscape diversity estimated by Simpson diversity index was also significantly associated with the richness estimates. Floristic and palynological richness were significantly positively correlated with landscape structure within the radii greater than 1,000 m from the pollen sampling sites, which is similar to the estimated Relevant Source Area of Pollen in southern Estonia. We conclude that within one floristic or climatic region, palynological richness gives reliable estimates about the variation in floristic richness and landscape structure; however, caution must be taken when comparing pollen-inferred vegetation diversities from different regions or when interpreting fossil pollen records from times with highly different vegetation associations.

AB  - Wild fish are confronting changing pathogen dynamics arising from anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Pathogens can influence animal behaviour and life histories, yet there are little such data from fish in the high north where pathogen dynamics may differ from comparatively southern regions. We aimed to compare the pathogen communities of 160 wild anadromous brown trout in two fjords in northern Norway and to determine whether pathogens influenced area use or return to spawn. Application of high-throughput qPCR detected 11 of the 46 pathogens screened for; most frequently encountered were Ichthyobodo spp., Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Candidatus Branchiomonas cysticola. The rate of returning to freshwater during the spawning season was significantly lower for the Skjerstadfjord fish. Piscichlamydia salmonis and F. psychrophilum were indicator species for the Skjerstadfjord and pathogen communities in the two fjords differed according to perMANOVA. Individual length, Fulton's condition factor and the time between first and last detection of the fish were not related to the presence of pathogens ordinated using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). However, there was evidence that pathogen load was correlated with the expression of smoltification genes, which are upregulated by salmonids in freshwater. Correspondingly, percentage of time in freshwater after release was longer for fish with greater pathogen burdens.

AB  - The platinum group elements (PGEs), particularly platinum, palladium and rhodium, are nowadays increasingly emitted into the environment from automotive catalytic converters. Thus, a method for the determination of PGEs (especially platinum and rhodium) in dust and plant samples was developed. The developed method was based on microwave-assisted sample digestion and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric (ICP-MS) determination. Spectral interferences in ICP-MS determination were corrected using mathematical correction equations based on signal ratio measurement. In addition, platinum and rhodium concentrations in the digested dust samples were also determined after Te coprecipitation without correction of the interferences. The results for platinum and rhodium in reference materials (NIST SRM 2557, recycled monolith autocatalyst and BCR-723, road dust) were in good agreement with the certified values. Preliminary results for the anthropogenic platinum and rhodium emissions in Oulu, northern Finland, based on dust and plant samples, indicated a common traffic-related source of these metals.

AB  - In Sweden, Electric Road Systems (ERS) are gaining importance in the quest for sustainable solutions for road transportation. The main driver is the 2018 Swedish climate law that requires a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 for domestic transport, excluding aviation, compared to the 2010 level. Due to the urgent need for change, the first decade of ERS evolution has been heavily focused on technological development towards a market-ready technology. Indeed, developing ERS technology is the priority of the two ERS demonstration projects on public roads in Sweden: eHighway E16 (inaugurated: 2016, status: ongoing), and eRoadArlanda (inaugurated: 2018, status: ongoing). Consequently, ERS literature reflects the empirical reality from an evidently technological focal point. However, the nature of ERS makes it a system of systems and couples a large number of stakeholders together, many of them with no previous collaboration. Thus, it is important to address ERS using a holistic focus, including social aspects.
   The aim of this paper is to uncover the interests and influences of different stakeholder groups in ERS development through the organisation of an ERS project as the unit of analysis. For the purpose of triangulation, the ERS stakeholders in the eRoadArlanda demonstration project have been studied in two separate studies at different points in time and using different methods prior to the comparison of findings. The first study uses interviews and an actor network analysis method to understand the ERS stakeholders' interests, influences, actions, factors and goals selections using causal maps, while the second study uses field data collection with interviews as the primary data source, as well as an iterative approach in order to discuss ERS stakeholders' interest, influence, contribution and motivation with those involved in eRoadArlanda. The findings show the different interest and influence of different stakeholders on ERS development. Further, concerns tend to differ between stakeholder groups, while contribution and motivation also vary among stakeholders within the groups.

AB  - Question To what extent does the movement of animals between fragmented habitat patches provide functional connectivity via endozoochorous seed dispersal? Location The Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We followed all movements of livestock between islands during one grazing season. After each movement, manure was collected and its seed content assessed through seedling emergence. Seedling data were then compared to vegetation surveys from the grazed islands with regard to functional traits. Results Light- and nitrogen-demanding locally abundant species, and those with relatively small and persistent seeds were more likely to be moved between islands. For quantitative traits, only a subset of the available trait ranges were dispersed, with extreme values left behind. Species apparently specialized to other means of dispersal emerged from the manure samples. Neither dispersed traits nor seed density changed with timing of movement, but seed richness and diversity both increased throughout the season. The subsets of endozoochorously-dispersed species in the established vegetation were more similar than non-dispersed subsets between islands linked by livestock. Conclusions Grazing networks contribute to the connectivity of the core species in the system, and could provide useful tools for grassland management in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Since the 19th century, urban lawns have gradually taken center stage to become one of the main sources of greening in many cities around the world. The current published research on planting technology, maintenance techniques, the impact of lawn maintenance, preferences for manicured lawns and the biodiversity protection for historical lawns as topics, has developed and increased over time. However, what has been less researched is the relationship and interplay between the perceptions of urban residents and their use of urban lawns. More specifically, our research focused on the question of how residents view, socialize and utilize city lawns accessible to them. To provide some insight into this area of urban lawn use, our research study was conducted in Lund, Sweden a city that uses lawns as their main form of greening. To accomplish the study's objectives the city's lawns were grouped into the following categories:(1) park lawns, (2) residential neighborhood lawns, (3) lawns around public buildings, (4) lawns surrounding residential buildings, (5) lawns along greenways and (6) lawns along roads. By means of distributed open-ended questionnaires the researchers discovered two important findings. First, the socialization patterns and utilization of lawns differed between the six categories due to various factors which included the suitability of the land use. The data also showed that the efficiency of planting lawns in certain areas impacts the ability to access areas for socialization activities (i.e. roadsides and greenways). Secondly, the study revealed that the planting collocation and service facilities of lawns greatly influences residents' ability and opportunities for social interaction.
   Two other study findings were of interest namely that (1) the utilization of lawns among Lund's working class was somewhat lower than that of students; and (2) that socialization and use of lawns were not necessarily related to the user's accustomed environmental background. Subsequently, this article discusses key themes that include residents' attitudes, beliefs and opinions about the interaction of socializing and the meaning of those interactions in an urban environment. It is our purpose that this article spurs a more robust international dialogue about pragmatic lessons urban planners may learn about future designing efforts of urban green space in newly developing cities and established ones already confronting modern space and housing challenges.

AB  - Beekeeping provides honey, protein-containing drone broods and pollen, and yield-increasing pollination services. This study tested the hypothesis that beekeeping can result in net-positive impacts, if pollination services and protein-containing by-products are utilised. As a case example, Finnish beekeeping practices were used. The study was performed using two different approaches. In both approaches, the evaluated impacts were related to climate change, land use, and freshwater use, and were scaled down to represent one beehive. The first approach considered honey production with pollination services and the replacement of alternative products with co-products. The impacts were normalised to correspond with planetary boundary criteria. The second approach evaluated the impacts of the different products and services of beekeeping separately. In the first approach the honey production system moved towards a safe operational space. Freshwater use was the impact category with the largest shift towards a safe operational space (39% shift). The second approach caused a global warming potential of honey production of 0.65 kg(CO2-eq) kg(-1), when pollen and drone broods were considered as byproducts and the influence of pollination services were not included. When honey, pollen, and drone broods were considered as co-products and pollination services were included, the impacts regarding land use and climate change were net-positive. The impact of freshwater use was relatively small. For honey, the impacts on the climate change, land use, and freshwater use were -033 kg(CO2-eq) kg(-1), -7.89 m(2) kg(-1), and 14.01 kg kg(-1), respectively. The impact allocation with co-products and pollination services was conclusive. A lack of consideration for the impact reduction of pollination led to beekeeping having a negative impact on the environment. Based on these results, beekeeping enhances food security within planetary boundaries, provided that pollination services and protein-containing by-/co-products are utilised. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The development of economics and intensive technologies cause the increase of environmental pollution and demand of natural recourses. Sustainable and environment friendly methods became very important in forestry. The development of ecological methods in the forest management became an important task for future. The decreased use of pesticides affects positively forest ecosystem as well as global situation. One of the most widely applied measures to protect seeds from the damage caused by fungi is spreading theaters. Alternative is to use high temperature. All live organisms are destroyed in a high temperature environment. It is very important to find optimal treatment time of high temperature so that pathogenic organisms would be destroyed but germination characteristics of the seeds would remain unaffected. We investigated how a damp water steam affects fungi on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) seed. Control seed's set was not affected by damp water steam and contaminated Penicillium sp., Alternaria sp., Murocales, Aspergillus sp ir Fusarium sp. fungi. Under the treatment of 1 second by damp water steam the fungi Fusarium sp was completely destroyed. Treatment by damp water steam from 2 till 4 seconds completely destroyed Murocales, Aspergillus sp and infection of Penicillium sp., Alternaria sp fungi diminished from 63 till 18 times respectively. From 83.5% till 98.3%. of fungi on the seeds were destroyed when the Norway spruce tissues heated from 59 degrees C till 85 degrees C.

AB  - Meeting environmental, economic, and societal targets in energy policy is complex and requires a multicriteria assessment framework capable of exploring trade-offs among alternative energy options. In this study, we integrated economic analysis and biophysical accounting methods to investigate the performance of electricity production in Finland at plant and national level. Economic and environmental costs of electricity generation technologies were assessed by evaluating economic features (direct monetary production cost), direct and indirect use of fossil fuels (GER cost), environmental impact (CO2 emissions), and global environmental support (emergy cost). Three scenarios for Finland's energy future in 2025 and 2050 were also drawn and compared with the reference year 2008. Accounting for an emission permit of 25 (sic)/t CO2, the production costs calculated for CHP, gas, coal, and peat power plants resulted in 42, 67, 68, and 74 (sic)/MWh, respectively. For wind and nuclear power a production cost of 63 and 35 E /MWh were calculated. The sensitivity analysis confirmed wind power's competitiveness when the price of emission permits overcomes 20 (sic)/tCO(2). Hydro, wind, and nuclear power were characterized by a minor dependence on fossil fuels, showing a GER cost of 0.04, 0.13, and 0.26 J/Je, and a value of direct and indirect CO2 emissions of 0.01, 0.04, and 0.07 t CO2/MWh. Instead, peat, coal, gas, and CHP plants showed a GER cost of 4.18, 4.00, 2.78, and 2.33J/Je. At national level, a major economic and environmental load was given by CHP and nuclear power while hydro power showed a minor load in spite of its large production. The scenario analysis raised technological and environmental concerns due to the massive increase of nuclear power and wood biomass exploitation. In conclusion, we addressed the need to further develop an energy policy for Finland's energy future based on a diversified energy mix oriented to the sustainable exploitation of local, renewable, and environmentally friendly energy sources.

AB  - Weathering of soil minerals is important for the recovery from acidification and for the sustainability of forestry. However, there is still substantial uncertainty about its absolute rate. This study presents a harmonized comparison of field weathering rates estimated with the mechanistic model PROFILE and the depletion method for 16 intensively sampled soil profiles across Sweden representing different site conditions. In general, a correspondence in total weathering rates was found between the two methods except in rare cases where either method yielded deviating results. The weathering rate was higher according to the depletion method than according to PROFILE for Mg, while PROFILE produced higher weathering rates for the other base cations. The Spearman rank correlation (rho) between the two methods indicated significant correlation for Ca (rho = 0.44, p = 0.04) and non-significant correlation for Mg (rho = 0.51, p = 0.09), Na (rho = 0.25, p = 0.34), K (rho = 0.07, p = 0.80), and the sum of the base cations (rho = 0.11, p = 0.67). The variation in weathering rates with depth showed opposite gradients in the upper 50 cm, which reflects the conceptual differences between the methods. This study shows the potential of using multiple methods to identify a probable weathering rate, if harmonized input data are used. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of making comparisons for individual elements in order to interpret differences between methods. Regardless of the method used, weathering rates were below or at the same level as the losses caused by whole-tree harvesting, particularly in southern Sweden, indicating a risk of negative effects on soils and waters.

AB  - Monitoring systems were applied to a single-grip harvester logging cut-to-length round-wood in Finland. Using single-grip harvesters may results in stem damages to the remaining trees during thinning, thereby reducing the growth and wood quality of the trees. These concerns justify the need for a decision support system to monitor stem damage in sustainable wood supply. One method to carry out harvesting-quality monitoring involves the application of image processing. The development of a monitoring system relies on the simulation of stem damage to 54 trees, 23 of which were Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and 31 of which were Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst). The algorithm was validated using data from 15 stands (463 trees) in the field. The damage to the stem was systematically photographed from a strip road and was intended to simulate the operation of machine vision. To determine the relationship between successful detection and stand-harvesting condition, an analysis of the detection of stem damage was conducted using the image processing technique. Meaningful relationships, which are suitable for use in linear classifiers for image processing, were discovered using logistic regression analysis. To improve the stem-damage monitoring system for a single-grip harvester, it was concluded that given the requirement for accurate thresholds of the stem-damage texture, development should focus on multi-view photogrammetry of the damage using machine learning. The monitoring system could be applicable outside Finland for the quality management of sustainable wood procurement. (C) 2019 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective interactions between plants and pollinators are essential for the reproduction of plant species. Pollinator exclusion experiments and pollen supplementation experiments quantify the degree to which plants depend on animal pollinators and the degree to which plant reproduction is pollen limited. Pollen supplementation experiments have been conducted across the globe, but are rare in high latitude regions. To fill this knowledge gap, we experimentally investigated the dependence on animal pollinators and magnitude of pollen limitation in eight plant species north of the Arctic Circle in Lapland, Finland. Our findings show that all plant species were pollinator dependent, but not pollen limited. We discuss several mechanisms that might buffer our focal plants from pollen limitation, including plant and pollinator generalization, and attractive plant traits. Our results demonstrate that many plant species north of the Arctic Circle are currently receiving adequate pollinator service and provide a baseline for future comparisons of pollinator dependence and pollen limitation in the Arctic across space and time.

AB  - Large scale electrification of the transportation sector is generally considered a promising strategy for improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases emissions. Within a broader decarbonization strategy, the development of the electric vehicles sector, including its integration within a smarter energy network, it is considered one of the cornerstones of the future energy and transportation development strategy. On the other hand, feasibility and sustainability studies on the performance of electric vehicles are performed without taking in full consideration the overall impact on the energy infrastructure that so much depends on specific local environmental and climatic conditions. In our work, we assessed the impacts electric vehicles could have on the local (smarter) power network and the infrastructure underlying critical issues in the systems within the Northern Finland winter conditions. Considering the case study of the city of Oulu, we developed a MATLAB based simulation assessing the role a fleet of electric vehicles could play within a smart grid based power system. Analysis results strongly suggest that, within the current logistical and environmental limitations, electric vehicle cannot play an active role on the flattening of the network peaks loads. Furthermore, unless a number of coordinated efforts for the improvement of the existing urban infrastructure are considered, they are likely to significantly increase the overall power consumption opening new questions related to the necessary increase of power production.

AB  - This paper studies decision-making processes in relation to the implementation of innovative source-separating wastewater systems in the development area of Helsingborg called H+, and the non-implementation of the same in Stockholm Royal Seaport. Two analytical perspectives were used to identify critical organisational functions, drivers for change and the anchoring of these decisions within policy: (i) a sustainability transitions framework, and (ii) a policy trickle-down study assessing policy-concept uptake by stakeholders. Critical functions supporting implementation of source-separating systems in H+ were: common vision, leadership, cross-sectoral cooperation, and an innovative approach both within the utility and in the city administration in Helsingborg. In Stockholm, with regard to source-separating wastewater systems, there was a lack of common vision and of cross-sectoral cooperation and leadership. This was also evident in the lack of uptake by stakeholders of the policies for source separation. In Helsingborg, the main drivers for source-separating wastewater systems are increased biogas generation and improved potential for nutrient recycling. In Stockholm, these drivers have not been enough to create change, but the potential for increased heat recovery from greywater at source may be the additional driver necessary for future implementation of source-separating wastewater systems. Comparison of the stalled source-separation policy in Stockholm with a successfully implemented policy in a related field found a key criteria to be the presence of inspired individuals in positions where they had the mandate as well as the ability to create a common vision for change.

AB  - Adaptive flyway management of superabundant geese is emerging as a strategy to reduce damage to agricultural crops and other ecosystem disservices, while also ensuring sustainable use and conservation objectives. Given the calls for intensified hunting as part of flyway management in Europe, we need to increase the understanding of structural, situational, and psychological factors important for goose hunting among hunters. Our survey data, retrieved in southern Sweden, showed a higher potential to intensify hunting among goose hunters than other hunters. In response to hypothetical policy instruments (including regulations, collaborative, and others), hunters declared a minor increase in their intention to hunt geese, with the greatest expected increase among goose hunters should the hunting season be extended. Situational factors (e.g., access to hunting grounds) were associated with goose hunting (frequency, bag size, and intention to increase hunting). In addition, controlled motivation (derived from external pressures or to avoid guilt) and more importantly autonomous motivation (due to hunting being enjoyable or valuable) were along with goose hunter identity positively associated with goose hunting. Hunters' involvement in flyway management may be encouraged by using policy instruments to remove situational barriers and facilitate their autonomous motivation.

AB  - This is a comparative study between two resource endowed economies, Norway and Nigeria towards ascertaining the impact of the resources in the sustainable development (SD) of the countries. The findings are expected to be a highlight for the poor performing economy (Nigeria) and to replicate the tested and workable policies of Norway to Nigeria economic performance. Separate empirical estimates and analyses with quarterly data of (1992QI-2018QIV and 1992QI-2019QIV) for both countries (Nigeria and Norway) respectively are done for each in a time series manner. The results from the both autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and granger causality for both countries are as follows: Dutch disease is found via government spending effects and crude oil price on agriculture. Foreign direct investment (FDI), real gross domestic product (GDP) and real exchange rate are found positively impacting Nigerian agricultural sectors. The findings for the Norway's case are as follows: Dutch disease symptom is found via government spending effects, real exchange rate and crude oil price on manufacturing sector. From granger causality findings, there is a clear exposition of nexus among the govern-ment spending, oil price, FDI and real exchange rate which shows implication of government spending and oil price in both studies. This is a pointer towards existence of Dutch disease in both countries. This, notwith-standing, Norway as a country is among the best performing economies of the world due to efficient and effective policies.

AB  - Research on pre-modern boathouses in Norway over the past decades has principally been concerned with large boathouses reflecting social stratification within Norse communities. In northern Norway there has been a greater interest in smaller boathouses as components of the maritime cultural landscape rather than a narrow focus on the political landscape. This article presents an investigation of variation in the form and content displayed by boathouses outside areas with predominantly Norse settlement in northern Norway, i.e. to the north and east of the Lyngen Fjord. The study is based on boathouse excavations conducted by the authors at Spildra in Kvaenangen and Flatvollen in Lyngen from northern Troms, and Skonsvika at Berlevag in Finnmark. A detailed analysis of the excavation results reveals marked differences, both between the investigated structures and in comparison to boathouses from VestvagOy in the Lofoten Islands associated with Norse settlement. This variability is interpreted as a potential indicator of ethnic interaction in the study area.

AB  - Invasive species have led to precipitous declines in biodiversity, especially in island systems. Brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (R. rattus) are among the most invasive animals on the planet, with eradication being the primary tool for established island populations. The need for increased research for defining eradication units and monitoring outcomes has been highlighted as a means to maximize success. Haida Gwaii is an archipelago similar to 100 km off the northern coast of British Columbia, Canada, that hosts globally significant breeding populations of seabirds that are at risk due to invasive rats. Here, we paired sampling of brown (n = 287) and black (n = 291) rats across the Haida Gwaii archipelago with genotyping by sequencing (10,770-27,686 SNPs) to investigate patterns of population connectivity and infer levels/direction of gene flow among invasive rat populations in Haida Gwaii. We reconstructed three regional clusters for both species (north, central and south), with proximate populations within regions being largely more related than those that were more distant, consistent with predictions from island biogeography theory. Population assignment of recently detected individuals post-eradication on Faraday, Murchison and the Bischof Islands revealed all were re-invaders from Lyell Island, rather than being on-island survivors. Based on these results, we identified six eradication units constituting single or clusters of islands that would limit the potential for reinvasion, some of which will need to be combined with biosecurity measures. Overall, our results highlight the importance of targeted research prior to conducting eradications and demonstrate a framework for applying population genomics for guiding invasive species management in island systems.

AB  - This research studies how recent Finnish smart mobility innovation projects have addressed sustainability in their objectives. A framework and a coding scheme were built upon scientific literature and was used for analysing documented project materials. A truth table was generated that quantifies how the different aspects of sustainability have been addressed in the projects' objectives. The observed differences between the projects were analysed from two directions: in terms of funding sources (European Union vs. national) and project location (urban vs. rural areas). The results of qualitative comparative analysis showed that while sustainability was by and large present in the projects, some of the aspects of sustainability were more dominantly addressed than others. Also, there were differences in how sustainability was addressed between the projects in urban areas and the projects in rural areas.

AB  - Forest area increase has been characteristic to the Eastern Baltic region since the early twentieth century. The emergence of new forest areas in significant amounts changes the visual and ecological character of landscapes and affects forest management decisions. The aim of this study was to investigate how emerging spatial patterns and stand characteristics of new forest areas impact forests in Latvia. Four study areas were selected in Latvia - Skrunda, Bauska, Skujene and Kaunata to analyze new and stable forest areas. Inside these four areas, 27,205 forest compartments were analyzed from new forests and 93,902 compartments in stable forests for reference. New and stable forest areas were mapped for the period of 1967-2017. Latvian State Forest register database provided compartment-level characteristics for new and stable forests. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze differences in tree species composition, ownership structure and management restrictions; and GIS methods - to assess compartment accessibility by roads. Spatial pattern metrics were calculated using Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis in Guidos Toolbox 2.6. Results show that the majority of new forest areas have emerged from spontaneous afforestation, this was especially pronounced in Kaunata area (only 5% of new forest areas were planted). Scots pine, Norway spruce and two birch species comprised the majority in stable forest areas compared to new forest areas, where the proportions of dominant tree species were more evenly distributed. Spatial pattern analysis showed that the emergence of new forest areas has contributed to the homogenization of forest pattern with increasing Core area, reducing Edge and Islet (isolated patch) proportion. 93-99% of new forest areas identified in this study were not state-owned. Compartment accessibility was very good for all four study areas in Latvia, with 60-80% of stands being located closer than 500 m from roads. This study demonstrated that management of such small, spatially scattered and young forest compartments can be problematic. Since the majority or Latvia's private forest owners' holdings are smaller than 50 ha, the lack of resources and education as well physical factors impede successful involvement of these numerous small owners in sustainable management efforts.

AB  - My study is framed against the backdrop of increasingly stringent environmental demands on the pulp and paper industry to reduce water and air pollution, and the changing global market conditions. I first present an observation-based analysis conducted by visiting selected paper mills in Finland, the US, Germany and Sweden. Interesting differences and similarities emerge. Some of the observed differences lie in their focus on achieving incremental efficiency gains from better management of production processes, inventories, supply-chain, product distribution and timing of modernization investments such as information technology. In the second part of the paper I present evidence on firms' productivity paths and the heterogeneity in productivity among relatively similar firms, and selected evidence of firms' investments in specific areas and how these affected productivity. My findings have implications for organizational behavior and business strategies employed by firms to improve their performance and productivity under changing environmental standards and market conditions.

AB  - With its emphasis on cost-reduction and external management, New Public Management emerged as the dominant healthcare policy in many Western countries. The ability to provide comprehensive and customized patient-care is challenged by the formalized, task-oriented organization of home-care services. The aim of this study is to gain deeper understanding of how nurses and the patients they care for, relate to and deal with the organizational systems they are subjected to in Norwegian home care.
   The focused ethnographic design is based on Roper and Shapira's framework. Data collection consisted of participant observation with field notes and semi-structured interviews with ten nurses and eight patients from six home care areas located in two Norwegian municipalities.
   Findings indicate cultural patterns regarding nurses' somewhat disobedient behaviors and manipulations of the organizational systems that they perceive to be based on economic as opposed to caring values. Rigid organization makes it difficult to deviate from predefined tasks and adapt nursing to patients changing needs, and manipulating the system creates some ability to tailor nursing care. The nurses' actions are founded on assumptions regarding what aspects of nursing are most important and essential to enhance patients' health and ensure wellbeing - individualized care, nurse-patient relationships and caring - which they perceive to be devalued by New Public Management organization. Findings show that patients share nurses' perceptions of what constitute high quality nursing, and they adjust their behavior to ease nurses' work, and avoid placing demands on nurses. Findings were categorized into three main areas: "Rigid organizational systems complicating nursing care at the expense of caring for patients", "Having the patient's health and wellbeing at heart" and "Compensating for a flawed system".
   Our findings indicate that, in many ways, the organizational system hampers provision of high-quality nursing, and that comprehensive care is provided in spite of - not because of - the system. The observed practices of nurses and patients are interpreted as ways of "gaming the system" for caring purposes, in order to ensure the best possible care for patients.

AB  - Circular economy and resource efficiency have recently gained enormous attention as solutions to global resource scarcity. Among other actors, cities are in a central position in putting these concepts into action. In Finland, the network of Finnish Sustainable Communities (FISU) encourages its member cities to adopt the principles of resource wisdom: zero climate emissions, zero waste and living within the Earth's carrying capacity. These targets of the cities are monitored through three indicators: greenhouse gas emissions, material loss and ecological footprint. In this study, we tested the applicability of these indicators for the city-level sustainability measurements. The results show that for greenhouse gas emissions, the accuracy of emission inventory varies in different sectors. However, greenhouse gas emissions are applicable for the periodical city-level follow-up towards climate neutrality. Concerning material loss, industrial waste as well as mining waste and excess soil dominate the results. Allocation of waste flows to different municipalities poses a challenge to interpretation of the results. Ecological footprint is a simple and understandable indicator for pointing out overconsumption, and it easily indicates the need for action. Nevertheless, the availability of local data for the calculations is limited. The indicator set can be used as background information for setting long-term visions and targets for a resource-wise city. The conclusions from indicator calculations should be translated into practical actions by setting a local action plan towards sustainability. The annual follow-up of these kinds of action plans requires supporting indicators in addition to the three indicators tested in this study. Several different city-level sustainability indicator frameworks from the literature should be utilized in defining the relevant additional indicators. (C) 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The amount of money that could potentially be saved by households by reducing unnecessary consumption and directed to sustainable investments without compromising the social needs in Finnish households was studied. The study was conducted by using statistical data and by creating short- and long-term scenarios to assess potential savings resulting from changes in household behaviour. According to the results, a Finnish household could save and subsequently allocate an average of (sic)3400-(sic)15,000 annually to invest in sustainability. The greatest potential for preventing unnecessary consumption is related to (1) food and drinks, and (2) transportation. In the long-term scenario, reducing expenditures in the category of housing also provides opportunities for high savings. A significant share of the saving created by sustainable patterns of consumption can be directed for example to investments in renewable energy.

AB  - As demand for minerals is expected to increase due to the energy transition needed to meet climate targets, mineral exploration will continue intensifying. Surveys find that public acceptance of the mining industry is low, particularly in the EU, suggesting that mining conflicts may increase in both number and intensity. Conflict usually occurs in places where a significant number of local actors mobilize resistance against a mining company. Their success is dependent on the emergence of a broader social movement that jumps to the relevant scale of regulation, often the national level. Despite this, very little attention is being paid to the emergence of such a movement, as well as to the state and its institutions, in studies on mining conflicts. Most research into mining conflicts examines developing countries, while mining resistance is an emerging issue also in developed nations, not least in the Arctic. Understanding mining resistance is important in avoiding or addressing conflicts that can be costly for companies, communities, and the state. This paper explores the relationship between state politics and mining resistance at the national level, drawing on social movement research and the concept of political opportunity structures. The results show that confrontational mining resistance will grow at the national level when the state offers little access nor influence to mining-sceptical actors in either policy formulation or implementation, and where there is a sufficient number of simultaneously ongoing contested licensing processes. In cases where indigenous people are involved, weak or contested indigenous rights may also spur resistance.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand the persistent ambiguity of socialization practices in US and Swedish organizations, which promote a mature work identity while infantilizing their employees.
   Design/methodology/approach - Application of the insights from modernist authors' analysis of modernity as experienced by a human subject within professional organizations (Gombrowicz and Musil) and as responsible for proliferation of layers of reality (Eco), to contemporary practices of socialization.
   Findings - The conflict between the need to conform to the corporate culture and the temptation to subvert them for creative or destructive purposes results in production of a "person without qualities," and in the rise of the contemporary form of hyperreal infantocracy, which requires sophisticated irony in order to deal with organizational practices.
   Research limitations/implications - Paying more attention to literary analysts of contemporary condition such as Gombrowicz, Musil, Eco, and Kundera will allow to understand paradoxes of contemporary organizing beyond the limits of traditional social sciences.
   Practical implications - Combating apathy and disillusion among both employees and human resource management practitioners requires a reconceptualization of the programs of organizational socialization in terms of a sustainable and responsible corporate citizenship.
   Originality/value - Few authors have managed to mine the humanist heritage in order to salvage insights, which might have practical implications for a more balanced, sustainable, and humane organizational reality.

AB  - Organisms well suited for the study of ecotype formation have wide distribution ranges, where they adapt to multiple drastically different habitats repeatedly over space and time. Here we study such ecotypes in a Crustacean model, Asellus aquaticus, a commonly occurring isopod found in freshwater habitats as diverse as streams, caves and lakes. Previous studies focusing on cave vs. surface ecotypes have attributed depigmentation, eye loss and prolonged antennae to several south European cave systems. Likewise, surveys across multiple Swedish lakes have identified the presence of dark-pigmented "reed" and light-pigmented "stonewort" ecotypes, which can be found within the same lake. In this study, we sequenced the first draft genome of A. aquaticus, and subsequently use this to map reads and call variants in surface stream, cave and two lake ecotypes. In addition, the draft genome was combined with a RADseq approach to perform a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping study using a laboratory bred F-2 and F-4 cave x surface intercross. We identified genomic regions associated with body pigmentation, antennae length and body size. Furthermore, we compared genome-wide differentiation between natural populations and found several genes potentially associated with these habitats. The assessment of the cave QTL regions in the light-dark comparison of lake populations suggests that the regions associated with cave adaptation are also involved with genomic differentiation in the lake ecotypes. These demonstrate how troglomorphic adaptations can be used as a model for related ecotype formation.

AB  - The energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water intensity, or environmental footprints, of global primary copper production have been estimated. The primary data have been collected from the sustainability reports published by copper producing mines, operations and companies. The mines analysed in this paper are from Australia, Chile, Peru, Argentina, Laos, Papua New Guniea, South Africa, Turkey, Finland, the USA and Canada. The typical range of energy intensity was found to be 10-70 GJ/t Cu, with an average of 22.2 GJ/t Cu. The range of GHG emissions was 1-9 t CO2-e/t Cu, with an average of 2.6 t CO2-e/t Cu. The large variation exists largely due to the form of copper produced, ore grade, sources of fuel and electrical energy, and to a lesser extent the reporting methods and procedures used by the companies. The water footprint averages 70.4 kL/t Cu but can range from several kilolitres to up to 350 kL/t Cu. Variation in water intensity is generally due to inconsistencies in reporting method, the geographical location of the mining operations, limited economies of scale of production site, and the climate type (i.e. arid regions in Australia and Chile or temperate to sub-arctic climates in Canada or Finland). It is recommended that company sustainability reports should clearly specify fuel use by type for vehicles, heat or electrical energy, sources of electricity and their mixes (including GHG emissions factors), and the boundaries of the operation for meaningful use in life cycle assessment (LCA). Sustainability reports should be published at regular intervals so that improvements towards more sustainable performance can be measured, and an LCA of mining activities can be developed for primary copper production more readily. The paper provides a valuable insight into the strong value of sustainability reporting for an industrial sector such as copper mining and how such data can be linked to LCA studies.

AB  - The assessment of the status of fisheries resources is pivotal due to the importance of marine resources in global food security and to halt the ongoing decline in marine biodiversity. Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) is one of the most valuable resources in the Northeast Atlantic. However, overfishing has caused the decline of several Nephrops stocks over the last decades, particularly in the Nephrops Functional Units (FUs) 25 (NW Spain), 26-27 (NW Spain and North Portugal) and 31 (Cantabrian Sea, North Spain). Since 2003, the information provided by the very low level of landings and fishing effort of these three stocks was insufficient to carry out an adequate analytical assessment, so the base of the assessment has been the trends from commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE). The objective of this study was to carry out the first assessment of these three stocks with an analytical MSY-based model. A review of the available data was made and the stochastic Surplus Production Model in Continuous Time (SPiCT) was fitted for each FU. The results indicate an extremely low biomass for FUs 25 and 26-27 since the mid-nineties well below the reference points. For FU 31, on the other hand, estimated biomass is larger. Our findings also identified long-term temporal and spatial changes in the population dynamic of Nephrops in the Northwest Iberian coast. The results were compare with those obtained in the same stocks with other data-limited methods. Also the role of abiotic factors on the observed dynamic of the stocks was explored. The results of this study are not only relevant for the sustainable exploitation of Norway lobster stocks off the Northwest Iberian coast but provide valuable insights into the suitability and limitations of production models for the assessment of crustacean stocks in general.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION In a transgender population referred for fertility consultation, which factors influence the decision to cryopreserve oocytes and sperm?
   SUMMARY ANSWER Previous hormonal treatment, gender affirmation surgery and sexual orientation were associated with the decision to undergo fertility preservation and transgender women underwent fertility preservation more frequently than transgender men.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY It is well-known internationally that fertility preservation and fertility treatment are increasingly requested by transgender men and women. Factors affecting their decisions as well as treatment differences between transgender women and transgender men have been reported, but many studies have had low participation rates and small sample sizes.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION This retrospective cohort study, conducted during 2013-2018, included 78 transgender women (assigned male at birth and referred for sperm cryopreservation) and 164 transgender men (assigned female at birth referred for oocyte cryopreservation).
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS In 2013, the previous requirement for sterilization before completion of a legal gender change was removed in Sweden. All fertile-aged transgender men and transgender women referred to a tertiary care centre for consultation concerning fertility preservation, fertility treatment or hysterectomy were identified from administrative systems. Demographic, medical and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records and from an ART database. Logistic regression was applied to analyse factors affecting the decision to cryopreserve gametes among transgender men and transgender women.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE A majority of transgender men (69.5%) and transgender women (82%), wanted to become parents. Fertility preservation was less frequent in transgender men than in transgender women (26.2% versus 75.6%, respectively). No individuals among those primarily referred for hysterectomy opted for cryopreservation of oocytes. Among transgender men, young age, no previous hormonal treatment and stating homosexual orientation were independent factors associated with the decision to cryopreserve oocytes. Among transgender women, the decision to undergo gender affirmation surgery and stating heterosexual orientation were independent factors associated with a decision to refrain from fertility preservation. Fertility treatments, using IUI or IVF with donor sperm, were mainly performed in partners of transgender men. Ten live births were reported in the group of transgender men and two for transgender women.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The main limitation is the retrospective nature of the study, with missing data for many variables. The short study period and the study population being too young to permit observation of long-term outcomes of fertility preservation and fertility treatments are reasons for caution.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our results confirm that fertility preservation has been requested by transgender people since the change in Swedish legislation in 2013. Information about aspects of fertility early in the transition process is important, since hormonal and surgical treatments may have a large impact on the decision to undergo fertility preservation. It is important to train fertility clinic staff to identify and handle the specific obstacles, as well as address the need for information and support that transgender people may have when planning for fertility preservation, fertility treatment and pregnancy.

AB  - Background: The Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua) is a groundfish of great economic value in fisheries and an emerging species in aquaculture. Genetic markers are needed to identify wild stocks in order to ensure sustainable management, and for marker-assisted selection and pedigree determination in aquaculture. Here, we report on the development and evaluation of a large number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ( SNP) markers from the alignment of Expressed Sequence Tag ( EST) sequences in Atlantic cod. We also present basic population parameters of the SNPs in samples of North-East Arctic cod and Norwegian coastal cod obtained from three different localities, and test for SNPs that may have been targeted by natural selection.
   Results: A total of 17,056 EST sequences were used to find 724 putative SNPs, from which 318 segregating SNPs were isolated. The SNPs were tested on Atlantic cod from four different sites, comprising both North-East Arctic cod ( NEAC) and Norwegian coastal cod ( NCC). The average heterozygosity of the SNPs was 0.25 and the average minor allele frequency was 0.18. F-ST values were highly variable, with the majority of SNPs displaying very little differentiation while others had F-ST values as high as 0.83. The F-ST values of 29 SNPs were found to be larger than expected under a strictly neutral model, suggesting that these loci are, or have been, influenced by natural selection. For the majority of these outlier SNPs, allele frequencies in a northern sample of NCC were intermediate between allele frequencies in a southern sample of NCC and a sample of NEAC, indicating a cline in allele frequencies similar to that found at the Pantophysin I locus.
   Conclusion: The SNP markers presented here are powerful tools for future genetics work related to management and aquaculture. In particular, some SNPs exhibiting high levels of population divergence have potential to significantly enhance studies on the population structure of Atlantic cod.

AB  - Capture fisheries are the only industrial-scale harvesting of a wild resource for food. Temporal variability in environmental performance of fisheries has only recently begun to be explored, but only between years, not within a year. Our aim was to better understand the causes of temporal variability within and between years and to identify improvement options through management at a company level and in fisheries management.
   We analyzed the variability in broad environmental impacts of a demersal freeze trawler targeting cod, haddock, saithe, and shrimp, mainly in the Norwegian Sea and in the Barents Sea. The analysis was based on daily data for fishing activities between 2011 and 2014 and the functional unit was a kilo of landing from one fishing trip. We used biological indicators in a novel hierarchic approach, depending on data availability, to quantify biotic impacts. Landings were categorized as target (having defined target reference points) or bycatch species (classified as threatened or as data-limited). Indicators for target and bycatch impacts were quantified for each fishing trip, as was the seafloor area swept.
   No significant difference in fuel use was found between years, but variability was considerable within a year, i.e., between fishing trips. Trips targeting shrimp were more fuel intensive than those targeting fish, due to a lower catch rate. Steaming to and from port was less important for fuel efficiency than steaming between fishing locations. A tradeoff was identified between biotic and abiotic impacts. Landings classified as main target species generally followed the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) framework, and proportions of threatened species were low, while proportions of data-limited bycatch were larger. This improved considerably when reference points were defined for saithe in 2014.
   The variability between fishing trips shows that there is room for improvement through management. Fuel use per landing was strongly influenced by target species, fishing pattern, and fisheries management. Increased awareness about the importance of onboard decision-making can lead to improved performance. This approach could serve to document performance over time helping fishing companies to better understand the effect of their daily and more long-term decision-making on the environmental performance of their products.
   Fishing companies should document their resource use and production on a detailed level. Fuel use should be monitored as part of the management system. Managing authorities should ensure that sufficient data is available to evaluate the sustainability of exploitation levels of all harvested species.

AB  - This paper evaluates the history and cycling accessibility of Nova, a shopping centre established in Lund, Sweden, in 2002. The current situation was also analysed through observation and a literature review. Moreover, the study conducted a closer analysis of the history and role of the municipality based on further literature study and interviews with officials. The conclusion of the analysis indicates poor and unsafe bikeways caused by conflicts of interest between politicians, officials, landowners and the general public. It also depicts a situation in which the municipality's master plan has been ignored, and, in contrast to the local goals, cycling accessibility at Nova has seen no significant improvement since the shopping centre was first established. The reasons for this, arguably, are a relatively low budget for bikeway improvements in the municipality, as well as a situation in which decision-makers have stopped approaching the subject, as a result of the long and often boisterous conflicts it has created in the past. Lastly, it must be noted that it is easy to regard the whole process of Nova, from its establishment to the current situation, as being symptomatic of the power structures between drivers and cyclists that still affect decision-makers at all levels.

AB  - Through the Kyoto Protocol, Romania is committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Protocol defines three mechanisms that can be use by the parties involved in the Protocol. International Emissions Trading (IET) is one of these three mechanisms. Thus, countries with a surplus of allowances that are available could sell their CO2 emissions to countries with a deficit.
   Having a surplus of available allowances, Romania could trade them to other parties, such as OECD countries, with a deficit. Selling these emissions, the Romanian state could collect up to two billion euros, annually, and the money could be invest in other projects, in order to reduce emissions, further more.
   The aim of this article is to enhance the contribution to the development of a methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions, from the perspective of the forestry land structure. Firstly, the article will focus on the description of the forestry land composition, from the perspective of the species and the groups of species it includes, highlighting the importance of certain forest species in mitigating polluting factors in the atmosphere, through a certain specific analysis. Secondly, we will try to identify those arguments that support the harmonization of the methodology for calculating greenhouse gas emissions with the particularities that derive from the structure of the forestry land.
   In this way, our work suggests that the contribution of certain species can be significantly higher in reducing of the greenhouse gas emissions, even though Romania does not have such a large forest area as other European countries (for example, Sweden). Hence, the financial advantages that Romania receives from trading of emissions could be much greater, than those that have been estimate at present.

AB  - Survey of eighteen islands in the Stockholm archipelago from 1884-1908 was re-examined during 1996-1998 to investigate how island size, degree of isolation and human impact affect the species number, extinction and immigration rates of terrestrial vascular plants. Cattle grazing and haymaking was widely and commonly in practice on the islands, but became less intensive since the 1920s and ceased during the 1960s.
   In the first survey species number was positively correlated with area and negatively correlated with distance to mainland. This pattern was similar in the later survey. However, the number of surrounding islands was positively correlated with island specific species number. During the period from the first to the second survey twenty species disappeared and ninety-three appeared as new. The increased abundance of trees, bushes and shade tolerant herbs suggest that this increase in species number is the effect of an ongoing succession in the landscape. The absolute extinction rate was negatively correlated with island size and distance to mainland, while the immigration rate was positively correlated to island size. The extinction rate was negatively correlated with the distance to mainland probably due to an earlier more intense cultural exploitation closer to the mainland. Our measure of human impact, the presence of houses on islands, was not related to terrestrial plant species number or extinction rate. However, there was a trend for the immigration rate to be higher on islands with houses in 1942 than those without, indicating the importance of human activities for dispersal and/or recruitment.

AB  - P>1. Animal migration has long intrigued scientists and wildlife managers alike, yet migratory species face increasing challenges because of habitat fragmentation, climate change and over-exploitation. Central to the understanding migratory species is the objective discrimination between migratory and nonmigratory individuals in a given population, quantifying the timing, duration and distance of migration and the ability to predict migratory movements.
   2. Here, we propose a uniform statistical framework to (i) separate migration from other movement behaviours, (ii) quantify migration parameters without the need for arbitrary cut-off criteria and (iii) test predictability across individuals, time and space.
   3. We first validated our novel approach by simulating data based on established theoretical movement patterns. We then formulated the expected shapes of squared displacement patterns as nonlinear models for a suite of movement behaviours to test the ability of our method to distinguish between migratory movement and other movement types.
   4. We then tested our approached empirically using 108 wild Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared moose Alces alces in Scandinavia as a study system because they exhibit a wide range of movement behaviours, including resident, migrating and dispersing individuals, within the same population. Applying our approach showed that 87% and 67% of our Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, respectively, can be classified as migratory.
   5. Using nonlinear mixed effects models for all migratory individuals we showed that the distance, timing and duration of migration differed between the sexes and between years, with additional individual differences accounting for a large part of the variation in the distance of migration but not in the timing or duration. Overall, the model explained most of the variation (92%) and also had high predictive power for the same individuals over time (69%) as well as between study populations (74%).
   6. The high predictive ability of the approach suggests that it can help increase our understanding of the drivers of migration and could provide key quantitative information for understanding and managing a broad range of migratory species.

AB  - Interaction between drivers and pedestrians enables pedestrians to cross the street without conflicts. When highly automated vehicles (HAVs) become prevalent, interaction will change. Although HAVs manage to identify pedestrians, they may not be able to assess pedestrians' intentions. This study discusses two different ambitions: Prioritizing pedestrian safety and prioritizing efficient traffic flow; and how these two affect the possibilities to avoid fatal crashes between pedestrians and passenger cars. HAVs' hypothetical possibilities to avoid different crash scenarios are evaluated based on 40 in-depth investigated fatal pedestrian crashes, which occurred with manually-driven cars in Finland in 2014-2016. When HAVs prioritize pedestrian safety, they decrease speed near pedestrians as a precaution which affects traffic flow due to frequent decelerations. When HAVs prioritize efficient traffic flow, they only decelerate, when pedestrians are in a collision course. The study shows that neither of these approaches can be applied in all traffic environments, and all of the studied crashes would not likely be avoidable with HAVs even when prioritizing pedestrian safety. The high expectations of HAVs' safety benefits may not be realized, and in addition to safety and traffic flow, there are many other objectives in traffic which need to be considered.

AB  - In discussing a major public video installation, Elsewhere/Annorstades/Ailleurs by Tania Ruiz Gutierrez, the present article seeks to address what is referred to here as mobility ex situ' - the unsettling aspects of a mobility culture that is both ubiquitous and at the same time exorbitant, never simply in place'. Commissioned for one of the stations along the Oresund Link between Denmark and Sweden, this world-embracing cinematic montage is an integrated part of an expansive connectivity infrastructure. Yet, while providing site-specific motion captures of a translocational world, the work not only actualises a radically transformed sense of presence. Randomised and disjointed, the flow of imagery also draws attention to the territorial incoherencies and asymmetries of a mobility culture, which, despite increased site sensitivity, does not manage to shake off its constitutive elsewheres'. The artwork thus provides an opportunity to unfold the mobility script' from an aesthetic - but also political - point of view, and this in three consecutive steps: the first, an introductory presentation of the art work as situational stammering; the second, a critical reflection through the work on nomadic or dispersed geographies; and the third, a discussion of the work as an expression of a cosmopolitical aesthetics.

AB  - On million-year timescales, carbonate rock weathering exerts no net effect on atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, on timescales of decades-to-centuries, it can contribute to sequestration of anthropogenic CO2 and increase land-ocean alkalinity flux, counteracting ocean acidification. Historical evidence indicates this flux is sensitive to land use change, and recent experimental evidence suggests that trees and their associated soil microbial communities are major drivers of continental mineral weathering. Here, we review key physical and chemical mechanisms by which the symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots potentially enhance carbonate rock weathering. Evidence from our ongoing field study at the UK's national pinetum confirms increased weathering of carbonate rocks by a wide range of gymnosperm and angiosperm tree species that form arbuscular (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal partnerships. We demonstrate that calcite-containing rock grains under EM tree species weather significantly faster than those under AM trees, an effect linked to greater soil acidification by EM trees. Weathering and corresponding alkalinity export are likely to increase with rising atmospheric CO2 and associated climate change. Our analyses suggest that strategic planting of fast-growing EM angiosperm taxa on calcite- and dolomite-rich terrain might accelerate the transient sink for atmospheric CO2 and slow rates of ocean acidification.
   Carbonate mineral weathering in forest soils could act as a transient sink for anthropogenic CO (2) over human timescales of decades to centuries. Our manuscript reviews key physical and chemical mechanisms of carbonate weathering by mycorrhizal fungi of forest tree roots. We also present results of an ongoing field study at the UK's National Pinetum that demonstrates enhanced carbonate weathering by a range of tree species, particularly by ectomycorrhizal species.

AB  - Based on earlier studies, farmers have poorer work ability compared to workers in most other occupations. The aim of this study was to explore if organic production has a positive effect on producers' work ability while controlling for demographic and production characteristics. This study used telephone interview data collected by the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in 2014-2015. The material consisted of 2,164 farmers: 231 in organic production and 1,933 in conventional production. Work ability was measured with a single question regarding the farmers' current work ability compared with their lifetime best on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 meaning unable to work. The data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Organic production had a negative effect on work ability, while larger farm size, experiencing economic uncertainty rarely/never/occasionally (vs. often), age under 55 years, having occupational health coverage, and experiencing low amounts of physical strain or mental strain had positive effects in a multivariable model. While this study could not consider potential biases from the farmers' existing health status at the time of switching to organic production and other sources, it is clear that greater attention needs to be paid to improving worker health, safety, and wellness in organic farming.

AB  - A method for actively protecting river lamprey and increasing the number of river lamprey populations is presented as protocol of rearing stocking material. The objective of the study was to accommodate lamprey larvae during the most critical life period under controlled conditions until they reach a sufficient size, which will increase their chances to survive in the natural environment. The eggs obtained from wild breeders were incubated in Weiss's jars at the water temperature of 12 degrees C. The larvae were reared in tanks set up in closed recirculating aquaculture systems. During the rearing period, the water temperature was 20 degrees C and the density of larvae was 150 individuals per 1 dm(2) of bottom. In the initial rearing phase, the main focus was on the type of feeds and the nourishment method. It was determined that the most suitable feed type was Artemia nauplii combined with Hikari dry food. Additionally, the type of substrate was tested under controlled conditions. In this case, the optimum one was composed of sand of the grain size between 0.3 and 0.5 mm. The experiment proved that it is possible to successfully conduct river lamprey larvae rearing under controlled conditions. The growth rates are comparable to or better than those achieved under natural conditions. After 30 days of the rearing period, the lamprey larvae were 25 mm long. The results create a possibility to develop a technology for the restitution of river lamprey and other lamprey species, which are endangered throughout the world.

AB  - The threat that wolves (Canis lupus) pose to hunting dogs is one reason why Finnish hunters have negative attitudes towards wolves and one of the potential motivations for the illegal killing of wolves. During 2010-2017, wolves killed an average of 38 dogs (range 24-50) per year in Finland. Most of the attacks (91%) were directed at hunting dogs during the hunting season. To decrease the risk of attacks, the last seven positions (one position per hour) of GPS-collared wolves were accessible to the public with a 5 x 5 km resolution during the hunting seasons (from August 20th to February 28th) of 2013/2014 (from September 2nd onwards), 2015/2016, 2016/2017 and 2017/2018. The link was visited more than 1 million times in 3 of the 4 seasons. Fatal attacks on dogs occurred on 17% of the days during the hunting seasons of our study (n = 760 days). Both the attacks and visits peaked in September-November, which is the primary hunting season in Finland. According to the general linear model, the number of daily visits to the website was higher on days when fatal attacks occurred than on other days. Additionally, season and the number of days passed from the first day of the season were significantly related to the daily visits. Visits were temporally auto-correlated, and the parameter values in the model where the dependent variable was the number of visits on the next day were only slightly different from those in the first model. A two-way interaction between season and attack existed, and the least squares means were significantly different in 2017/2018. The change in daily visits between consecutive days was related only to the number of days from the beginning of the season. We examined whether this kind of service decreased dog attacks by wolves. Wolf attacks were recorded in 32% of the wolf territories, where at least one wolf had been collared (n = 22). However, within the territories without any GPS-collared wolves, the proportion of territories with wolf attack(s) was significantly higher than those elsewhere (50%, n = 48). Although public information decreased the risk of attacks, it did not completely protect dogs from wolf attacks and may in some cases increase the risk of illegally killing wolves. The most remarkable benefit of this kind of service to the conservation of the wolf population might be the message to the public that management is not overlooking hunters' concerns about wolf attacks on their dogs.

AB  - Precision agriculture provides important issues toward a more sustainable agriculture. Many farmers have the necessary technology to operate site-specifically, but they do not use it in practice, and thus available information and communications technology (ICT) systems are not used to their full potential. This paper addresses how to reduce the so-called "problem of implementation", based on the knowledge that participatory approaches during the design and development process is one of the most important factors to frame technology adoption. The development of sustainable ICT systems through theories and methodologies from the fields of human computer interaction and user-centered design (UCD) is presented and an ongoing Swedish project for development of an agricultural decision support system (AgriDSS) for nitrogen fertilization is used as an example to frame the issue. The overreaching aim is to develop AgriDSSs that are sustainable in design as well as through design by stressing the importance of participatory approaches for the successful development of AgriDSSs. The Swedish project has the intention to apply a UCD approach, and some pitfalls on starting to use this way of working is identified as well as some suggestions on how to reduce them through co-learning processes. Despite the challenges presented in this paper, ICT can contribute significantly to long-term sustainable development. Thus, several competences and scientific disciplines need to act in concert to help develop a sustainable development of agriculture via a transdisciplinary approach that can make an impact on society at many levels.

Nodtvedt's 2017 novel, Vestlandet, in order to better understand how the author uses references to regional historical and contemporary figures and events to construct what Edward Said labeled a cultural archive in a larger anti-imperialist project. Language, landscape, and identity form the core of Nodtvedt's project. This raucously humorous novel activates the Foucauldian heteropias of indefinitely accumulating time and of the festival, as well as Marc Auge's notion of the non-place in order to comment upon the perceived cultural and political divide between western and eastern Norway.

TI  - Nationalization: an analysis of the competing interests of capital, labour, and government

KW  - nationalization
KW  - sustainability
KW  - capital
KW  - labour
KW  - government
AB  - Any study of the contentious subject of nationalization can ultimately be reduced to a sombre analysis of the simultaneous, and very different, interests of capital, labour, and government. Each of these interests attempts to maximize its objectives, subject to checks and balances provided, in an ideal system, by a country's executive government, legislature, and judiciary. Where even one of the three interests goes out of control, the consequences can be disastrous. The case histories show that when this occurs, the most common culprit is government, or its proxy, such as a dictator.
   At the other extreme, the case studies indicate that the optimum outcome occurs when capital, labour, and government are 'ring fenced' from each other: each enjoys its rights, but is also subject to duties. 'Conflicts of interest' between the three entities are ideally avoided to the maximum possible extent.
   The case studies include several salient instances from both the DRC (Gecamines, La Generale des Carrieres et des Mines) and Zambia, along with Ghana and Chile. Further instances are examined in South Africa (gold), India (Coal of India), Brazil (Petrobras), Venezuela (Petroleos de Venezuela), Sweden(Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag), Mauritania (Societe Nationale Industrielle et Miniere), Norway (Norsk Hydro), Botswana (Debswana), and Namibia (Namdeb).
   The article concludes broadly that South Africa's minerals sector is not ready for nationalization.

AB  - The article analyses how and why agricultural digitalisation unfolds in contrasting agricultural sub-sectors and rural spaces in Europe, with a particular focus on dairy farming. The authors explore the differences and similarities underpinning and produced by agricultural digitalisation and how this intersects with meanings of rural development and the politics of sustainability. Building on qualitative research carried out in the regions of Uppsala (Sweden) and Calabria (Italy), the article unveils the contradictory nature of agricultural digitalisation as a process intertwined with the capitalist development of agriculture that raises key political questions. The cases of Uppsala and Calabria, in particular, show that the transformation of dairy farming through automation and digitalisation is uneven and combined, being deeply connected to how politics of sustainability and rural development are embedded-and negotiated-in specific agrarian settings. The authors discuss their empirical findings in terms of new agrarian questions in Europe.

KW  - Facilities management

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to assess the status of the physical assets of Norwegian hospital facilities in terms of technical condition, building performance, usability and adaptability, thereby comprehending the main challenges for property management as part of facilities management (FM) within hospitals of the Norwegian Specialist Health-Care Services and permitting a discussion on a more strategic property management role.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on an action research approach using data collection from surveys, schemes and questionnaires, literature studies, documentation analysis and workshops with an active research team involvement with stakeholders. In-depth interviews were undertaken with owner representatives, property management representatives and health-care deliverers, and a GAP analysis allowed a study of the quality of property management (as part of the FM).
   Findings - A severe technical backlog was documented together with a strong demand for structural upgrading, which was roughly estimated to be approximately 30-35 billion NOK in 2012 (3.75-4.4 billion euros). Improvements are necessary in all areas of FM delivery within limited economic frameworks, even though several examples of good property management (as part of FM delivery) were found. A gap exists between the general strategy concerning hospital assets and the property management role, particularly with regard to the translation of change in user needs into changed facilities. A need for an increasing professionalization of the role is pressing, turning attention from operational costs and control to potential added value. This requires a shift of focus from the property manager in order to implement visions and goals for the health-care sector, which involves several actions such as an improved communication between stakeholders and technically improved skills, thus ensuring the recruitment and capability of property management staff and improved measurement processes.
   Practical implications - This paper give two major recommendations: first, a stronger integration of the property management role as part of the FM delivery with the executive management of the Health Authorities and Regional and Local Health Trusts; and second, a nationally coordinated strategy for the development of property management in the Specialist Health-Care Services (called Strategic FM). The authors believe that developing a pool of competencies at the national level is necessary to develop the tools, methods and standardized measurements to enable a change in the use of the terms of added value and sustainability. Ultimately, this will enhance the assets of the health sector, and this paper suggests a model that allows for this development.
   Originality/value - This paper shows a model for property management as a strategic role in a holistic process involving all stakeholders from both the bottom up and the top down. The authors believe this process will engage the stakeholders in agreeing upon a clear vision and set of goals for the health-care service assets.

AB  - While questions about adaptation and fidelity are of great concern in many implementation projects, less attention has been paid to reasons for adaptations that remain when evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are used in clinical and community settings. This study aims to explore reasons for adaptations that can arise when using parenting programs in a community setting. Seventeen individual interviews with providers were conducted and analyzed thematically, resulting in 11 reasons for adaptations organized into four separate areas: characteristics of group leaders (supplementary skills and knowledge, preferred ways of working), characteristics of families (problem complexity, diverse or limited educational experience, non-parenting needs for support, colliding value systems), group incidents (criticism and challenges, excessive questions or discussions), and didactic challenges (lack of focus or engagement, limitations of the material, language differences). The study shows that factors triggering adaptation and fidelity decisions continuously reappear in the provision of parenting programs in community settings. Knowledge about reasons for adaptation can be used to inform decision-making during implementation planning, as well as the sustainment of implemented interventions.

AB  - A new market-based voluntary programme aimed at preserving forest habitats on private land has been implemented in Finland. This scheme is based on conservation by fixed-term agreements between forest owners and a governmental authority. In this study we examine the characteristics of forest owners and their properties that indicate the owners' willingness to participate in the programme. In addition, we analyse factors affecting the real compensation claims. The study uses a dual set of data from the pilot project, i.e. one data set supplied by the authority and another collected from the owners involved in the project. The results suggest that to increase the participation rate, information on the conservation project should be targeted in particular to the forest owners who either emphasize financial investment as a motive for forest ownership, have positive attitudes toward nature protection, or own large amounts of forest property. Additionally, owners' positive environmental preferences would decrease and high harvesting value and high ecological quality of a preserved forest stand would increase compensation claims. The voluntary programme could not, however, circumvent owners' strategic behaviour with respect to the claims. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pronounced changes in glacier mass and length were observed for the monitored glaciers in the Jostedalsbreen region, Norway, since the last glacier inventories were compiled in the 1960s and 1980s. However, the current overall extent of the glaciers in the region is not well known. To obtain this information, we have compiled a new inventory from two mosaicked Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes acquired in 2006 that have excellent snow conditions for glacier mapping, the first suitable scenes for this purpose after 22 years of imaging with TM. Drainage divides and topographic inventory parameters were derived from a 25m national digital elevation model for 1450 glaciers. By digitizing glacier outlines from 1 :50 000 scale topographic maps of 1966, we calculated changes in glacier area for similar to 300 glaciers. Cumulative length changes for the 1997-2006 period were derived from an additional TM scene and compared with field measurements for nine glaciers. Overall, we find a 9% area loss since 1966, with a clear dependence on glacier size; however, seasonal snow in 1966 in some regions made area determination challenging. The satellite-derived length changes confirmed the observed high spatial variability and were in good agreement with field data (+/- 1 pixel), apart from glacier tongues in cast shadow. The new inventory will be freely available from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GUMS) glacier database.

AB  - Tree species composition is an essential attribute in stand-level forest management inventories and remotely sensed data might be useful for its estimation. Previous studies on this topic have had several operational drawbacks, e.g., performance studied at a small scale and at a single tree level with large fieldwork costs. The current study presents the results from a large-area inventory providing species composition following an operational area-based approach. The study utilizes a combination of airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data and 97 field sample plots of 250 m(2) collected over 350 km(2) of productive forest in Norway. The results show that, with the availability of hyperspectral data, species-specific volume proportions can be provided in operational forest management inventories with acceptable results in 90% of the cases at the plot level. Dominant species were classified with an overall accuracy of 91% and a kappa-value of 0.73. Species-specific volumes were estimated with relative root mean square differences of 34%, 87%, and 102% for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), and deciduous species, respectively. A novel tree-based approach for selecting pixels improved the results compared to a traditional approach based on the normalized difference vegetation index.

AB  - Aims: The study examined how substance use treatment professionals managed problems and tensions in their work, and explored if the strategies varied by organisational features related to New Public Management (NPM). Methods: A total of 69 semi-structured interviews (2017-2018) with treatment staff in nine sampled local/regional areas formed the basis for constructing a web survey administered to staff across Sweden in 2019 (n=606).The means showed how often the different strategies were used. Regression analyses examined organisational differences, and central strategies were illustrated by the interview study. Results: Treatment professionals in general reported satisfactory freedom in their work. Staff in more NPM-like organisations were less likely to report autonomy and more inclined to report conflicting demands. When conflicts emerged, the staff used both passive strategies indicating adaptation or resignation, and active strategies including boundary spanning, protest, and liberty-taking. Some challenging strategies such as looking for other jobs or reporting one thing but doing another were more common in more NPM-like organisations.The opposite was found for customer orientation. Conclusions: While NPM features on customer orientation and steering methods appeared to create fewer problems, more NPM-like organisations appeared to be less favourable overall and should be applied with caution.

AB  - Functional trait approaches are common in ecology, but a lack of clear hypotheses on how traits relate to environmental gradients (i.e., trait-niche relationships) often makes uncovering mechanisms difficult. Furthermore, measures of community functional structure differ in their implications, yet inferences are seldom compared among metrics. Community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs), a common measure, are largely driven by the most common species and thus do not reflect community-wide trait-niche relationships per se. Alternatively, trait-niche relationships can be estimated across a larger group of species using hierarchical joint species distribution models (JSDMs), quantified by a parameter Gamma. We investigated how inferences about trait-niche relationships are affected by the choice of metric. Using deadwood-dependent (saproxylic) beetles in fragmented Finnish forests, we followed a protocol for investigating trait-niche relationships by (1) identifying environmental filters (climate, forest age, and deadwood volume), (2) relating these to an ecological function (dispersal ability), and (3) identifying traits related to this function (wing morphology). We tested 18 hypothesized dispersal relationships using both CWM and Gamma estimates across these environmental gradients. CWMs were more likely than Gamma to show support for trait-niche relationships. Up to 13% of species' realized niches were explained by dispersal traits, but the directions of effects were consistent with fewer than 11%-39% of our 18 trait-niche hypotheses (depending on the metric used). This highlights the difficulty in connecting morphological traits and ecological functions in insects, despite the clear conceptual link between landscape connectivity and flight-related traits. Caution is thus warranted in hypothesis development, particularly where apparent trait-function links are less clear. Inferences differ when CWMs versus Gamma estimates are used, necessitating the choice of a metric that reflects study questions. CWMs help explain the effects of environmental gradients on community trait composition, whereas the effects of traits on species' niches are better estimated using hierarchical JSDMs.

AB  - Neorealist and neoliberal institutionalist explanations for the state and future of the Arctic region dominate the Arctic debate in international relations. While both schools focus on different aspects concerning the current and future state of Arctic affairs - neorealism evokes a confrontational rush for the Arctic's resources, whereas neoliberal institutionalism propagates the necessary reform of the institutional system governing Arctic issues - both share the underlying assumption of significant and rising stakes towards Arctic commodities. However, this article argues that this debate has hitherto failed to substantiate the actual stakes of the main actors involved. Consequently, many studies make grandiloquent statements about prospects of cooperation and conflict and the appropriate institutional framework for the Arctic region, based on only limited empirical support. This article aims to fill this gap by analysing the Arctic oil and gas interests of the five Arctic littoral states (Russia, USA, Canada, Norway and Denmark/Greenland). The analysis shows greatly different levels of interests towards the High North among the Arctic states. The findings make it possible to make more credible statements about the likelihood of confrontation over Arctic resources and necessary institutional adjustments. The evidence shows that the often-evoked issue of geopolitical rush for Arctic resources is unlikely to eventuate. Nonetheless, there remain institutional challenges for the protection of the fragile Arctic ecosystem.

AB  - By using a two-wave panel design, the present study aimed to study causal, reversed, and reciprocal relations among work-role conflict, work-family conflict, and emotional exhaustion. The Conservation of Resources theory was applied as a theoretical framework. The study was conducted in a large Norwegian oil and gas company (n = 1703). The results demonstrated positive cross-lagged effects of work-role conflict and work-family conflict on emotional exhaustion. In addition, emotional exhaustion predicted work-family conflict over time, and work-family conflict predicted work-role conflict over time, indicating the presence of reciprocal effects. The current study adds new knowledge to the positioning of work-family conflict in relation to perceived conflict in the workplace and emotional exhaustion.

AB  - Arctic soils are constantly subjected to extreme environmental conditions such as low humidity, strong winds, high sa-linity, freeze-thaw cycles, UV exposition, and low nutrient availability, therefore, they have developed unique micro-bial ecosystems. These environments provide excellent opportunities to study microbial ecology and evolution within pristine (i.e. with limited anthropogenic influence) regions since the High Arctic is still considered one of the wildest and least explored environments on the planet. This environment is also of interest for the screening and recovery of unique microbial strains suitable for various biotechnological applications. In this study, a combination of culture -depended and culture-independent approaches was used to determine the cultivation bias in studies of the diversity of cold-active microorganisms. Cultivation bias is a reduction in recovered diversity, introduced when applying a clas-sical culturing technique. Six different soil types, collected in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station Hornsund (Spits-bergen, Norway), were tested. It was revealed that the used media allowed recovery of only 6.37 % of bacterial and 20 % of fungal genera when compared with a culture-independent approach. Moreover, it was shown that a combina-tion of R2A and Marine Broth media recovered as much as 93.6 % of all cultivable bacterial genera detected in this study. Based on these results, a novel protocol for genome-guided bioprospecting, combining a culture-dependent ap-proach, metabarcoding, next-generation sequencing, and genomic data reuse was developed. With this methodology, 14 psychrotolerant, multi-metal-resistant strains, including the highly promising Rhodococcus spp., were obtained. These strains, besides increased metal tolerance, have a petroleum hydrocarbon utilization capacity, and thus may be good candidates for future bioremediation technologies, also suited to permanently cold regions.

AB  - Industrial development in the Arctic enhances the potential risk of accidents occurring under severe conditions. Detailed knowledge of the physical environment and understanding of risk reduction methods are necessary for technical experts and young specialists planning to work in companies dealing with the Arctic. The Arctic is a place of close contact between many countries, where harsh and fragile environment demands the most advanced technology for sustainable development and international collaboration to ensure safety of industrial activity. The SITRA (Safety of Industrial Development and Transportation Routes in the Arctic, 2015-2018) project focuses on organizing an international research and educational network of High North experts for joint investigation and teaching of Arctic engineering courses. SITRA is funded by the Norwegian Centre for International cooperation in Education (SIU). The project is a part of the High North Program. It continues the more than 20-year-long Norwegian-Russian collaboration in the field of Ice Engineering and expands it overseas by means of students and staff/professors exchange and joint field work. Canadian and US universities have also joined the team. The SITRA project multiplies the understanding and awareness of the Arctic problems through education and outreach.

AB  - By using a two-wave panel design, the present study aimed at studying longitudinally the relation between business travel and work-family conflict (WFC) as well as the reciprocal relationships among WFC, emotional exhaustion, and psychological health complaints. The study was conducted in a large Norwegian oil and gas company (n=1702), and the company's business travel database was utilized to examine business travel. The results showed a positive cross-lagged relation between business travel and WFC. In addition, WFC predicted emotional exhaustion over time, whereas emotional exhaustion predicted psychological health complaints over time. Reversed influences also existed, supporting our hypotheses on reciprocal relations. The longitudinal design of the current study makes an important contribution to the research on business travel and employees' psychological health.

AB  - Understanding temporal and spatial variations in historical disturbance regimes across intact, continuous, and altitudinally diverse primary forest landscapes is imperative to help forecast forest development and adapt forest management in an era of rapid environmental change. Because few complex primary forest landscapes remain in Europe, previous research has largely described disturbance regimes for individual forest types and smaller isolated stands. We studied the largest but still largely unprotected mountain primary forest landscape in temperate Europe, the Fagaras Mountains of Romania. To describe historical disturbance regimes and syn-chronicity in disturbance activity and trends between two widespread forest community types, dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), we established 191 permanent study plots (70 beech; 121 spruce) across 11 valleys, thereby providing information at both stand and landscape levels. We used a dendrochronological approach to reconstruct and describe the spatiotemporal patterns of historical disturbances. We observed a diverse spectrum of disturbance severities and timing across the forest landscape. High-severity disturbances created periods of synchrony in disturbance activity at the landscape scale, while moderate-and low-severity disturbances were asynchronous and random in both spruce-and beech -dominated primary forests. We detected a peak of canopy disturbance across the region at the end of the nineteenth century, with the most important periods of disturbance between the 1890s and 1910s. At the stand scale, we observed periods of synchronised disturbances with varying severities across both forest types. The level of disturbance synchrony varied widely among the stands. The beta regression showed that spruce forests had significantly higher average synchrony and higher between-stand variability of synchrony than the beech-dominated forests. Synchronised disturbances with higher severity were infrequent, but they were critical as drivers of subsequent forest development pathways and dynamics across both forest types.Our results provide valuable insight into future resilience to climate-driven alterations of disturbance regimes in spruce-and beech-dominated mountain temperate forests in the Carpathians. We suggest that conservation efforts should recognize strictly protecting large continuous and altitudinally diversified forest landscapes such as Fagaras Mts. as a necessary measure to tackle climate change and ensure temporal and spatial structural heterogeneity driven by a wide range of disturbances. The diverse and synchronous disturbance activity among two interconnected forest vegetation types highlights the need for complex spatiotemporal forest management approaches that emulate disturbance synchronicity to foster biodiversity across multiple forest vegetation types within forest landscapes.

AB  - Vendace Coregonus albula have recently invaded the Pasvik River system, a subarctic watercourse on the borderline between Norway and Russia, after having been introduced into the Finnish headwaters in the 1950-1960s. The watercourse is characterised by several consecutive lakes and reservoirs. Vendace were first recorded in the upper part in 1989, and had by 1995 invaded the whole 120 km long water system. In the upper part, vendace have become the dominant fish species in the pelagic zone, whereas whitefish Coregonus lavaretus have been relegated to the profundal and littoral zones. In the lower part, whitefish were by 1995 still dominant in the pelagic habitat, but vendace constituted 30% of the pelagic catches after being first recorded there in 1993. Vendace have established reproducing populations in the whole watercourse, with the 1990 and 1991 year-classes being particularly strong and important for the downward displacement. The new occurrence of vendace in the Pasvik River system probably represents the world's northernmost distribution of the species. The invasion appears to have a major ecological impact on the native communities, and represents a threat for both biodiversity conservation and the commercial fishery in the watercourse.

AB  - Understanding car-following behavior in different countries is essential for the design and development of autonomous driving and further development of active safety systems that can function well worldwide, in particular, in mixed traffic conditions. However, very few studies exist that compare car-following behaviors in different countries based on real driving data. This paper analyses the similarities and differences of drivers' car-following behavior, in terms of time gap, gap distance, and time to collision (TTC), using both China and Sweden datasets from real road driving studies, in a bid to identify how these indicators affect drivers' speed control in car-following situations. The results indicate that the highest frequency of gap distance is observed in the same value range in both datasets, while the highest frequency of time gap in the Sweden dataset is found at a lower value range than the corresponding value range in the China dataset. For both datasets, time gap is observed to be a more reliable indicator for car-following analysis than gap distance since it is less sensitive to speed variations. Furthermore, TTC in the low travel speed ranges (v < 50 km/h) tends to be steady in comparison with the TTC at other speed ranges, so the time gap in the high-speed ranges is (v > 90 km/h). Therefore, time gap is recommended as the safety indicator for car-following analysis in high-speed conditions, while a combination of time gap and TTC is recommended for low-speed conditions, especially on urban roads.

AB  - This study proposes a conceptual framework that aims to gain insight into the integration of the sustainable development goals (SDG) within the Norwegian salmon value chain (NSVC). The proposed framework was developed by applying the systems engineering six-step method and validated through empirical findings from the NSVC. The framework's application highlighted and analyzed the presence of the SDGs in corporate sustainability reports, academic curriculum, research, and governmental policies. This study uncovered the complexity-reduction elements within the system that drive SDG integration and assure their progress. The SDGs provide a global context for sustainability endeavors in the NSVC. A globally expanded value chain has an organic relationship with global sustainability terms and schemes. The existing practice of corporate sustainability annual reporting was found to be a significant channel for SDG communication. The novelty of this study was that it proposed a mind-map to understand SDG integration within an industrial value chain abstracted into three concepts: commitment, communication, and performance measurability.

AB  - Drawing on historical records and ethnographic fieldwork, the present article examines the history of the so-called curved knife, or krumkniv, as a window on the governance and regulation of indigenous Sami reindeer slaughter in Norway. Originally developed by scientific activists in the 1920s, in the context of a series of experimental field trials held at a farmstead in Roros, the knives were designed to combine efficiency and ease of use with the elimination of visible animal pain, thus bringing indigenous slaughter in line with the shifting aesthetic and moral concerns of the time. The innovation was highly successful, and the knives rapidly adopted as essential tools of the herding trade - to the point where today, most users disregard their origins. Moving forward to the early 21st century, the situation had shifted almost entirely: animal welfare activists now decried the same knives as a barbaric anachronism, while herders defended them as part of their cultural heritage. Historical narratives of moral progress articulated with other discourses to produce a homogeneous present moment of the state, a moment that threatened to exclude herders from participation in the ongoing nation-building project - constituting them instead as objects of intervention and reform, targeting the successes of previous reform. Herders, meanwhile, challenged such negative constructions by defining the knife as an indigenous tradition, invoking the international commitments of the state to preserve their cultural heritage. Comparing these two historical moments, the article draws out how the technical minutiae of slaughtering practice could operate both as an instrument of social engineering, and as an arena within which complex, large-scale issues - to do with matters such as social inclusion and participation, the value of history, the function and obligations of the state - could be settled, contested and redrawn.

AB  - Mountain forests offer a range of socio-economic and ecological services, e. g. providing wood harvest products, serving as hotspots of biodiversity and fulfilling protective functions. In the European Alps, where these environments are dominated by drought-sensitive Norway spruce, it has been questioned whether these services can be secured in the substantially warmer and drier climates predicted for the mid-to-late 21st century. Here, we compile a tree-ring width network of 500 spruce trees from the Northern Limestone Alps to assess growth reactions to drought events and evaluate the long-term impact of the recent temperature shift through ana lyses along elevational transects. Our dataset covers a larger region in the Northern European Alps extending 250 km from west to east and encompassing an altitudinal range of 1200 m (from 500 to 1700 m a.s.l.). Climate-growth analyses reveal spatially varying drought sensitivities within this spruce network, with elevation (along with associated hydrothermal changes) being the key drivers behind the varying responses. Trees at lower elevations are affected negatively by drought and high temperatures, but at higher altitudes, spruce benefits from warmer climatic conditions. However, despite a sharp temperature increase of similar to 1 degrees C since the 1990s, we observed neither growth suppression at the lower elevation sites nor growth increase at higher elevation sites. These findings reveal the ability of mountain forests to adapt to an unprecedented temperature shift, suggesting that adaptation to forthcoming climate changes might not require a shift in tree species composition in the Northern Limestone Alps.

AB  - The short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), which lives in open wetland habitats, has been threatened and become endangered in South Korea due to the destruction and loss of its habitats. However, the diet of the short-eared owl remains to be studied. The prey of the short-eared owl was monitored using molecular methods as an alternative tool. A total of 121 pellets of the species were collected in the Dalsung wetland. Of these pellets, about 30% (n = 33) were selected for prey identification in 2002 (n = 12), 2003 (n = 6) and 2006 (n = 15). Two hundred and thirty-two bone fragments were successfully analyzed and 9 prey species were detected. In an expanded analysis, excluding 4 pellets used for the preliminary analysis, small mammals constituted the highest percentage (89.1%.) : 47.6% Eurasian field mouse (Apodemus agrarius); 27.2% European harvest mouse (Micromys minutus); 6.1% Japanese wild house mouse (Mus musculus); 5.4% Asian lesser white-toothed shrew (Crocidura sbantungensis); and 2.7% Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus). Not only small mammals, but birds and amphibians were also identified: 4.1% Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica); 3.4% vinous-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis webbianus); 0.7% eastern turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis); and 2.7% Kori salamander (Hynobius yangi). This result would be valuable in understanding the feeding ecology of the short-eared owl in its wetland habitats.

AB  - The rise of climate-active municipalities - cities and towns voluntarily creating carbon reduction policy substantially more stringent than their host countries or the international system as a whole - presents a puzzle. Countries, with greater resources and the capacity to create binding agreements to overcome public goods problems, appear to view carbon reduction as an unappealing burden. So why are municipalities, with fewer resources and no way to guarantee a coordinated global effort, so eager to take on the potential disadvantages of stringent carbon reduction? Based on examination of municipal-level carbon reduction activity in Sweden and Portugal, I argue that in fact local-level climate activity represents not a burden but a tool. Municipal climate policy forms the basis for 'paradiplomacy' that captures goods for cities, creates international linkages for municipalities, and allows direct participation in setting the terms of global carbon commons policy. The evidence suggests that the nature of the climate commons - incompletely structured from a legal and political perspective, and open to access and intervention by actors at multiple levels - provides unique opportunities for actors to act as makers rather than takers of global governance structure and diplomatic effort in a critical area of emerging international policymaking.

AB  - This multiple case study investigates internal crisis communication in Finnish and Norwegian hotels and restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing a Nordic leadership perspective to the research area. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, a qualitative research design was chosen, and 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with hospitality leaders, middle managers, and employees. The multilevel analysis revealed that existing internal communication practices were challenged due to the urgency and uncertainty of the crisis. The findings show that managerial transparency and presence facilitated sensemaking processes and contributed to trust in the managers. Yet, limited autonomy among middle managers and lack of employee consultation when communicating about decision-making indicated a conflict between internal crisis communication and aspects of Nordic leadership such as cooperation, consensus-seeking, and delegation of responsibility. However, the findings suggest that the openness and transparency of Nordic leadership prevailed in the crisis and contributed to managerial learning and solution-finding through crisis communication and management. Furthermore, leaders should find a balance between control and participation when communicating about internal decision-making during a crisis. We conclude that transparency and participative communication are essential when striving for effective internal crisis communication, facilitating employees' sensemaking, and building trust relationships during a crisis.

AB  - Alpha-emitting radioisotopes are the most toxic among all radionuclides. In particular, medium to long-lived isotopes of the heavier metals are of the greatest concern to human health and radiological safety. This review focuses on the most common alpha-emitting radionuclides of natural and anthropogenic origin in wild mushrooms from around the world. Mushrooms bio-accumulate a range of mineral ionic constituents and radioactive elements to different extents, and are therefore considered as suitable bio-indicators of environmental pollution. The available literature indicates that the natural radionuclide Po-210 is accumulated at the highest levels (up to 22 kBq/kg dry weight (dw) in wild mushrooms from Finland), while among synthetic nuclides, the highest levels of up to 53.8 Bq/kg dw of Pu239+240 were reported in Ukrainian mushrooms. The capacity to retain the activity of individual nuclides varies between mushrooms, which is of particular interest for edible species that are consumed either locally or, in some cases, also traded on an international scale. The effective radiation dose from the ingestion of this food can reportedly range from 0.033 mu Sv/kg dw to 26.8 mSv/kg and varies depending on the country. Following pollution events, such consumption may expose consumers to highly radiotoxic decay particles produced by alpha emitters.

AB  - Forests provide a diversity of non-wood forest products as a resource base for regional and rural development. The role of non-wood forest products differs in time and space. The aim of the study was to analyze the role of non-wood forest products in livelihoods, especially forest-dependent communities, in Ukraine and Sweden. 114 interviews with local stakeholders in two countries were done for this study. The results showed that (1) non-wood forest products have potential for economic rural development, (2) traditional practices of non-wood forest products utilization were retained and revived in Ukraine, (3) and were no longer economically but rather socially important for local people in Sweden. Non-wood forest products have great potential for sustainable rural development, as resources for economic development.

AB  - This study provides empirical evidence on the drivers affecting Norwegian salmon consumption in three Euro-pean countries - Italy, Poland, and France - using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). We also highlight the effects of positive and negative information about the sustainability of salmon farming on consumers' percep-tions and behaviour. The empirical study was conducted using an online survey with representative samples of French (n = 748), Italian (n = 771) and Polish (n = 756) consumers. A treatment including neutral, positive, and negative information was applied using a between-subjects design in the three countries. This study confirms the role of attitudes in affecting consumers' intentions, and consequently, behaviour. We show that negative in-formation more strongly affects consumers' attitudes and intentions than positive one, as the negative infor-mation frame modifies the structural paths in the studied countries. Newly available negative information also affects the way that attitude and intention correlate with the individuals' prior health and environmental beliefs.

AB  - For afforestation, it is necessary to consider habitat conditions and their impact on specific tree species, in order to enable the selection of appropriate species to improve forest productivity and stand stability. Based on the 2014 Beijing forest management inventory data, we evaluated site quality using theoretical growth equations and quantile regression; we analyzed the effects of climate, topography, and soil variables on the growth of six main tree species using random forest models optimized by a genetic algorithm; and we mapped the potential habitat of six main tree species in Beijing. The results showed that climatic factors were the most important factors affecting tree growth. The prediction models had good accuracy, with an AUC of 0.75-0.85. Among the six main tree species studied, Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. was suitable for all of Beijing's forest land. Platycladus orientalis (Linn.) Franco, Robinia pseudoacacia Linn. and Salix matsudana Koidz. were suitable for the mountainous areas, while Sophora japonica Linn. and Populus tomentosa Carr. were suitable for planting in the plains area of southeast Beijing. The optimized random forest model applied in this study gives insight into the distribution suitability of the main tree species in Beijing, and could serve as a reference for afforestation design.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate how the open-air museum of Skansen in Stockholm as venue for celebration of Persian Fire Festival is assessed by the festival's visitors. The study is based on a delimited part of a larger online survey with 280 completed questionnaires including both close-ended and open-ended questions, and a qualitative thematic analysis method has been used in this paper. The results show a high level of appreciation of the Skansen venue that gives the visitors positive emotions, meanings, place attachment, place identity and a sense of place. Contributing factors have been the high status of the venue that has given the visitors pride and dignity; security and safety of the venue; size of the venue; and the natural beauty of the venue. The most important disadvantage factor has been the lack of accessibility combined with lack of sufficient public transport. The results have implications for the Swedish society, for the policy makers in Stockholm city and for both the host and the organiser of the festival and gives rise to new debates on immigrants' socio-cultural integration into Swedish society. This paper gives a contribution to existing literature on festival venue and its impact on the visitor's overall assessment of the festival.

KW  - multidisciplinary
KW  - sustainable development
KW  - knowledge instrumentalism
KW  - teaching
AB  - Background: Sustainable development, as an area of knowledge, appears in several different places in the curriculum and does not fit neatly within the scope of traditional subject areas. In many countries, including Sweden, it has long been upheld as an important tool for increasing understanding of, and dealing with, environmental problems. It is not clear, however, what role education can actually have in the making of a more sustainable future. Even though there are several potential ways for sustainable development to be involved in education, the concept raises many questions when transferred to the school context.Purpose: This paper investigates how teachers deal with the difficulty of defining and approaching sustainable development as an area of knowledge in Swedish schools.Sample: This article is based on semi-structured interviews with 40 teachers, 13 of whom were lower secondary school teachers (pupil age 12-15) and 27 were upper secondary school teachers (pupil age 15-18). The study involves teachers in all subjects where sustainable development is a goal in the syllabus. The study is also based on participant observation in one upper secondary class. A total of 17 different schools were involved, from a wide range of locations in Sweden.Design and methods: The paper builds on qualitative data and the analysis of transcribed interviews and group interviews with teachers in Swedish lower and upper secondary schools. Group interviews, involving three or more people, were conducted on eight occasions. The pupils at an upper secondary school were also observed while they were working on a course called policy and sustainable development'. Data were transcribed and analysed thematically.Findings: The analysis suggests that, according to the teachers' experiences, the demands of equivalence and measurability in school have increased and that this affects how sustainable development is approached in teaching and learning. Three main categories of knowledge were identified. The study also presents two representations that model how teachers may approach knowledge about sustainable development - metaphorically termed the Accountant' and the Adventurer' - and their different effects on knowledge.Conclusions: There is a tendency for complex knowledge areas such as sustainable development, which do not fit seamlessly into traditional curriculum subjects, to become oversimplified when translated into teaching situations. According to the representations that we described metaphorically, the teacher, as an accountant, is characterised by knowledge instrumentalism', which means that teachers administer knowledge and the pupils consume it. In this transactional model, the accountant is also very dependent on external governance and control. Alternatively, the teacher, as an adventurer, is characterised by authority, knowledge and self-control. In this model, knowledge sometimes grows in an unpredictable way in the meeting between people who share common experiences. For adventurers, sustainable development is a matter of commitment and awareness, and it involves an explicit stance. The metaphors can be placed on a continuum which describes how teachers manage the demands of the school system in relation to the knowledge area of sustainable development.

AB  - Questions
   How have the historical frequency and severity of natural disturbances in primary Picea abies forests varied at the forest stand and landscape level during recent centuries? Is there a relationship between physiographic attributes and historical patterns of disturbance severity in this system?
   Location
   Primary P.abies forests of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, Romania; a region thought to hold the largest concentration of primary P.abies forests in Europe's temperate zone.
   Methods
   We used dendrochronological methods applied to many plots over a large area (132 plots representing six stands in two landscapes), thereby providing information at both stand and landscape levels. Evidence of past canopy disturbance was derived from two patterns of radial growth: (1) abrupt, sustained increases in growth (releases) and (2) rapid early growth rates (gap recruitment). These methods were augmented with non-metric multidimensional scaling to facilitate the interpretation of factors influencing past disturbance.
   Results
   Of the two growth pattern criteria used to assess past disturbance, gap recruitment was the most common, representing 80% of disturbance evidence overall. Disturbance severities varied over the landscape, including stand-replacing events, as well as low- and intermediate-severity disturbances. More than half of the study plots experienced extreme-severity disturbances at the plot level, although they were not always synchronized across stands and landscapes. Plots indicating high-severity disturbances were often spatially clustered (indicating disturbances up to 20ha), while this tendency was less clear for low- and moderate-severity disturbances. Physiographic attributes such as altitude and land form were only weakly correlated with disturbance severity. Historical documents suggest windstorms as the primary disturbance agent, while the role of bark beetles (Ips typographus) remains unclear.
   Conclusions
   The historical disturbance regime revealed in this multi-scale study is characterized by considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which could be seen among plots within stands, among stands within landscapes and between the two landscapes. When the disturbance regime was evaluated at these larger scales, the entire range of disturbance severity was revealed within this landscape.

AB  - 1. For migratory birds the implications of environmental change may be difficult to predict because they use multiple sites during their annual cycle. Moreover, the migrants' use of these sites may be interdependent. Along the flyway of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus population, Norwegian farmers use organized scaring to minimize goose use of their grasslands in spring. We assessed the consequences of this practice for regional site use of pink-footed geese along their spring migration route.
   2. We used dynamic programming to find the sequence of migratory decisions that maximizes the fitness of female geese during spring migration, assuming scaring impinges on both food-intake rates and predation risk. The parameterization of the model was based on data gathered from individually marked pink-footed geese between 1991 and 2003.
   3. The effect of scaring in terms of fitness and site use was most noticeable regarding food-intake rate. Scaring resulted in a redistribution of geese along the flyway. Furthermore, the outcomes of the modelling exercises were highly dependent on whether or not the geese were omniscient or naive: at moderate scaring levels naive geese were predicted to succumb.
   4. On a qualitative basis there was good correspondence between the predictions from the model and the empirical evidence gathered to date.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Besides highlighting the importance of learning and changing behaviour in an adaptive fashion, our modelling exercise indicated the potential vulnerability of the geese to abrupt environmental change. In addition, the exercise emphasized the interdependence of site use along the migratory flyway. The model supports the necessity for an integrated flyway management approach. In Norway, discussion is ongoing about the future management of the spring conflict between farming interests and geese. Farmers in north and mid-Norway have announced that they will expand the scaring campaign if a long-term solution, including a compensation scheme, is not forthcoming. If scaring on such a large scale is implemented abruptly, it may have severe consequences for the population: management of both the scaring intensity and its geographical extent is urgently required.

AB  - Pest insect population dynamics are species specific and complex due to nonlinearities and interactions among different trophic levels. Consequently, the impacts of climate change on pests are also species specific and they are often difficult to predict. However, there are some clear examples of increasing forest pest risks due to a warming climate. The damage caused by the Eurasian spruce bark beetle has recently increased in Finland as a consequence of more frequent storm damage and longer growing seasons. In a warming climate, timely salvage and sanitation cuttings will be needed to guarantee the sustainability of the forestry. Several defoliating pests overwinter in the egg stage. Warmer winters may not kill the eggs and, therefore, the incidence of outbreaks is predicted to increase in the northern and continental areas. The most important societal implications will be due to Geometrids attacking subarctic mountain birch forests. Together with heavy reindeer grazing, Geometrids reduce the resilience of the ecosystem and they are threatening the sustainability of local livelihoods.

AB  - The Future Energies Forum organized its annual Energy Forum in Berlin on September 29, 2005. The 2005 Energy Forum debated the topic of '' Nuclear Power - Competing for a Sustainable Energy; Supply in Europe?'' In this way, not only the members of the Forum were offered all opportunity to discuss this topical subject. Ambitious goals of carbon dioxide reduction, rising prices of raw materials and energy, and the construction of a new nuclear power plant in Finland have caused many countries to reconsider the role of nuclear power in meeting future problems.
   Four keynote papers dealt with this topic from different perspectives.
   A panel discussion provided a possibility of in-depth discussion with other partners.

AB  - Conflicts within the Norwegian construction industry have reached unacceptable levels. The grievance of these disputes, whether it is the number of conflicts or the expense involved in these conflicts, is under discussion. This article examines the reasons for these conflicts in a comprehensive and inclusive manner. Twenty-five respondents with expertise and understanding of most conflicts in the Norwegian construction industry were interviewed. Results from a questionnaire sent to 1799 contractors have also been included in this study. Sixteen reasons for disputes were identified out of which four comprised the root causes. Tender specification and contract understanding came in first followed by "final settlement-payment related", corroborating previous findings. The third and fourth root causes of conflicts were "low priced contracts" and "changes in projects" respectively. Our findings point to design deficiencies and defective contract plans as significant causes of conflicts, confirming the view of construction experts. The third root cause of conflicts might explicate some aspects of the first and second major causes of disputes. It is also important to mention that though this is the general view, one can also see how every group involved in this study interpret major causes of conflicts. Our findings also point to "communication between clients and contractor", "carried out quantities" and "client restriction to time extension" as among the chief causes of conflicts, confirming the view of construction experts. Client understanding of contractors' anxiety and quest for sound contracting process are aspects that Norwegian clients are currently engaging in, for the sake of conflict reduction and prevention in future construction projects.

AB  - Introduction: This paper investigates new new-built premium in urban redevelopments. Constructing new homes on urban redevelopment sites entails additional investments in reshaped lay-out, refurbished infrastructure, and upgraded outdoor areas. These improvements are expected to yield new-build premiums when the new units are put on the market, with 'premium' defined as the extra price that a developer asks for, compared to similar units in the second-hand market, in nearby locations.
   We ask: Do urban redevelopment schemes create extra new-build premiums? Does the organisation of re-developments affect the size of the premium and who harvests it?
   Method and data: In focus here are redevelopment schemes in Oslo, Norway, 2002-2015. It distinguishes between four types of developments: greyfield, brownfield and two kinds of infill. This distinction is applied to compare new-build premiums in various redevelopments. As the value-added from upgraded redevelopment may spill over to adjacent neighbourhoods, we also analyse whether such neighbourhoods experience hikes in house-prices. Our dataset consists of sales transactions from approx. 90,000 second-hand house sales and 19,000 new house sales.
   Results/findings: The premium for new-builds in relation to second-hand sales varies significantly among the types of development. Units in small infill developments entail significantly higher new-built premiums than units in large brownfield-or greyfield redevelopments. Moreover, some schemes show a negative new-build premium. Examination of existing houses nearby shows a hike in prices in the time-span in question. We conclude that the new-build premium is low, and that developers fail to harvest full new-build premiums in urban redevelopment schemes.
   Discussion: In interpreting our findings, we revisit 'rent-gap theory' and its emphasis on attracting investment to rundown central areas. Concurrence in scale, design and time helps to explain the differences across types of redevelopments, and why what might be expected to be new-build premiums instead raise prices in existing neighbouring areas.

AB  - Although river restoration has increased rapidly, observations of successful ecological recovery are rare, mostly due to a discrepancy in the spatial scale of the impact and the restoration. Rivers and their ecological communities are a product of four river facets-hydrology, geomorphology, ecology and biogeochemistry-that act and interact on several spatial scales, from the sub-reach to the reach and catchment scales. The four river facets usually affect one another in predictable pathways (e.g., hydrology commonly controls geomorphology), but we show that the order in which they affect each other and can be restored varies depending on ecoregion and hydroclimatic regime. Similarly, processes at different spatial scales can be nested or independent of those at larger scales. Although some restoration practices are dependent of those at higher scales, other reach-scale restoration efforts are independent and can be carried out prior to or concurrently with larger-scale restoration. We introduce a checklist using the four river facets to prioritize restoration at three spatial scales in order to have the largest positive effect on the entire catchment. We apply this checklist to two contrasting regions-in northern Sweden and in southern Brazil-with different anthropogenic effects and interactions between facets and scales. In the case of nested processes that are dependent on larger spatial scales, reach-scale restoration in the absence of restoration of catchment-scale processes can frankly be a waste of money, providing little ecological return. However, depending on the scale-interdependence of processes of the river facets, restoration at smaller scales may be sufficient. This means that the most appropriate government agency should be assigned (i.e., national vs. county) to most effectively oversee river restoration at the appropriate scale; however, this first requires a catchment-scale analysis of feedbacks between facets and spatial scale interdependence.

AB  - This paper investigates one crisis management effort during the COVID-19 pandemic's first wave in Stockholm, Sweden. Decision-makers in Stockholm were afraid that intensive care unit beds would run out due to the massive sp?read of the virus and therefore decided to build a temporary hospital in an exhibition hall outside Stockholm. Using field study observations and interviews, this paper uses grounded theory method to describe what happened between two actors, a hospital and a regional administrative body, during this process. These two actors, in this paper called the Operational and the Administrative organisation, are two separate but dependent actors who had to collaborate during this crisis. The crisis management process can be seen as forced collaboration. By investigating the different phases of the crisis management, we found that there were conflicting situational assessments, conflicting actions, power play and stereotyping, which contributed to making collaboration and crisis management difficult.

AB  - Aphanomyces astaci, a specialised parasite of North American freshwater crayfish, is the disease agent of crayfish plague that is lethal to European freshwater crayfish. The life cycle of A. astaci has been inferred from experimental laboratory studies, but less is known about its natural sustainability and ecology. To address such questions, tools for monitoring of A. astaci directly in aquatic environments are needed. Here, we present an approach for detecting and quantifying A. astaci directly from water samples using species-specific TaqMan (R) minor groove binder real-time PCR. Samples of a 10-fold dilution series from similar to 10(4) to similar to 1 spore of A. astaci were repeatedly tested, and reliable detection down to 1 spore was demonstrated. Further, to simulate real-life samples from natural water bodies, water samples from lakes of various water qualities were spiked with spores. The results demonstrated that co-extracted humic acids inhibit detection significantly. However, use of bovine serum albumin or the TaqMan (R) Environmental Master Mix largely removes this problem. The practical application of the approach was successfully demonstrated on real-life water samples from crayfish farms in Finland hosting infected North American signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. Direct monitoring of A. astaci from aquatic environments may find application in the management of wild noble crayfish Astacus astacus stocks, improved aquaculture practices and more targeted conservation actions. The approach will further facilitate studies of A. astaci spore dynamics during plague outbreaks and in carrier crayfish populations, which will broaden our knowledge of the biology of this devastating crayfish pathogen.

AB  - Over the past few years, considerable emphasis has been put on decarbonization, which, in the context of the recent events in Europe, proves that mixing energy sources is the best strategy. This article discusses ways in which individual EU member states manage their energy source diversification, while comparing their levels of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources (RESs) usage. The research data was acquired from the Eurostat website and comprises of 15 indicators describing the use of energy both from conventional and renewable sources in the European Union, in 2019. The study employs taxonomical methods, such as ranking and cluster analysis. The authors put forward a hypothesis that EU member states approach the use of energy resources in several ways. There are countries which take advantage of both traditional and renewable sources (Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Italy). However, there is a group of states that relies on a single energy source and exclusively uses either traditional (Poland) or renewable energy resources (Sweden, Finland). The analyses enabled the isolation of country clusters with similar activities and energy strategies.

AB  - Many freight trains depart Swedish marshalling yards before or after their planned departure times. Today, a deviating departure time is allowed if no conflicting train path can be found a few stations ahead. This increases the risk that the train might be delayed to its destination and cause delays to other trains. We present a meta-heuristic that modifies a timetable by adding a train path (for our freight train) and, if necessary, adjusting surrounding train paths. The aim of the insertion of the additional train path and the adjustments of the existing ones is to obtain a large bottleneck robustness, that is, the largest possible minimal temporal distance to any other train in the timetable. We provide experimental results for a Swedish railway stretch with a non-cyclic timetable and heterogeneous traffic. We show that we quickly add a train path, while improving the robustness of the timetable.

AB  - Sharing goods and services has been promoted as fostering more sustainable consumption. In this paper, we explore sharing in a middle-class neighbourhood in a Norwegian city. We ask what influences and frames neighbours' current sharing practices, contending that Polanyi's notions of exchange systems, specifically reciprocity and redistribution, yield valuable insights for our study. We show that reciprocal and redistributive sharing may reinforce each other by increasing the frequency of sharing and the variety of items shared. Furthermore, redistributive sharing systems may foster close relations and interpersonal trust, which are prerequisites for reciprocal sharing. Hence, if the goal is to increase the rate of sharing of goods and services in neighbourhoods like that studied here, two initiatives can be valid. First, items with the right affordances can be redistributed by existing institutions; second, reciprocity can be encouraged by organising more opportunities for resident interaction.

AB  - Corkwing wrasse, Symphodus melops, is one of the main species used as cleaner fish to combat sea lice infestation in salmon aquaculture; however, there is little knowledge about its biology. Here, we describe the embryonic development of this species and examine the viability of the eggs under three temperature regimes. The experiments were conducted at three water temperature regimes, 12, 15, and 18 degrees C, which resemble common sea water temperatures registered during the spawning season of corkwing wrasse at different latitudes along the Norwegian coast. Corkwing wrasse spawn small spherical eggs of 0.75-0.80 mm in diameter (mean 0.78, CV = 3.6%) with several oil droplets and go through eight developmental stages until hatching. The shortest hatching time was registered after 144 hr at 18 degrees C and after 222 and 372 hr at 15 and 12 degrees C, respectively. These observations provide important baseline biological information to advance the establishment of commercial rearing techniques and sustainable fishing management practices for this heavily exploited species.

AB  - This study was conducted with the aim of outlining a comprehensive picture of the coverage of various sustainability schemes or criteria sets related to the entire value-added chain of biomass and bioenergy and comparing them accordingly. Eight sustainability schemes and one draft directive were chosen for the qualitative comparison: two existing sets of criteria for agricultural biomass (RSPO, RTRS); two existing forest certification schemes (FSC, Finnish FFCS); two newly developed initiatives for biomass for energy raw material (WWF Meta standard, CSB); and three recent proposals for bio energy and biofuels (SSB, Finnish SLF, EU draft directive).
   The analysis demonstrated that five schemes (RSPO, RTRS, FSC, CSB and SSB) are created for global application and commonly cover all sustainability issues plus the legal framework around it. The WWF Meta standard does also cover all issues, although the economic items are underemphasised. The two Finnish sets (FFCS and SLF) are mainly locally or regionally applied and focus more on environmental issues, as other issues are covered by existing legislation. The EU draft directive focuses mainly on the governance of energy from renewable sources at the European level, emphasising environmental issues. This paper resulted in the proposal of a tri-dimensional approach (sustainability issues; technical biomass conversion routes; physical trade flows) when comparing various biomass and bioenergy schemes and for further development and empirical testing of overall European biomass and bioenergy sustainability.

AB  - Dendrochronolgy uses tree-rings to date the change in the environment. The paper brings results of mercury analyses in tree rings of five forest tree species sampled in five various areas in Slovakia. The research was done in industry areas (near a thermal power plant and chemical industry factory), near a crematorium and in flysch zone of the Western Carpathians, which should not be affected by anthropogenic activities. Wood samples were taken from Norway spruce (Picea abies), beech (Fagus sylvaticus), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula pendula) and alder (Alnus glutinosa). Wood was sampled with Pressler's increment borer. Samples were analyzed with the Advanced Mercury Analyzer (AMA 254). The values of mercury in wood ranged from 0.002 to 0.111 mg.kg(-1) depending on the tree species, the site (geological substrate and emission load) and the age of the wood sample. Reliability of dendrochronology for dating changes in Hg content in wood needs great indicator, a tree species which is able to accumulate mercury in its woody biomass. The paper includes some practical aspects of the dendrochronology utilization for analysing mercury in the environment as well as assessment of its significance as monitoring method.

AB  - The restoration of extracted peatlands poses challenges with regard to their recolonisation by vegetation. The most significant problems are unstable water levels, destroyed propagule bank, and temperature fluctuations on bare peat surfaces. Rewetting is considered necessary for the re-establishment of peat-forming vegetation. Revegetation was investigated in a long-term field study at two rewetted extracted peatland sites in southcentral Sweden, namely Vastkarr (originally a lagg fen) and Porla (originally a bog). Both sites were expanses of bare peat before rewetting.
   Rewetting procedures were applied in 1999 and strongly promoted plant colonisation. At Vastkarr, colonisation started in the first year after rewetting, mostly by species that were not found during repeat vegetation surveys 15 years later. By 2014, Vastkarr was a shallow lake surrounded by mesotrophic and eutrophic vegetation with species such as Carex rostrata, Lemna minor, Typha latifolia, Phalaris arundinacea and Phragmites australis. Revegetation of the Porla site was slower and started with Eriophorum vaginatum and Polytrichum spp. Sphagnum mosses appeared after six years and had established quite well after 13 years. A residual Sphagnum peat layer, inflowing surface water and groundwater provided spatially variable nutrient conditions. Sphagnum species and E. vaginatum established in nutrient-poor areas, while C. rostrata, P. australis and Eriophorum angustifolium colonised more nutrient-rich locations.

AB  - Elevated streamwater concentrations of aluminium have been associated with the onset of acidification, both by natural and anthropogenic means. This has important implications for river water quality. Concentrations of total. labile-inorganic and non-labile-organic fractions of aluminium were determined across the River Dee catchment, northeast Scotland. Fifty-nine subcatchments, chosen to reflect the variety of soils, parent materials and land use patterns across this major river system were sampled bi-weekly for I year. The distribution of aluminium was closely linked to factors of parent material and organic soil cover. Strong spatial and temporal relationships were observed between pH and all fractions of aluminium. Significant episodic peaks in aluminium occurred, these being especially pronounced when a storm event followed a period of dry weather. A weathering rate index utilizing the Na dominance of base cations was found to be a predictor of potential streamwater toxicity implied through Ca/inorganic aluminium ratios, It was demonstrated that Al was mobilized from acid headwater streams, whilst concentrations in the main stem remained much lower.

AB  - The assessment of long-term effects of forest management practices, particularly species mixing and stand density, provides valuable information for the forestry sectors. This study evaluated and compared the effect of stand composition and density on organic horizon (i.e., OL, OF, OH) and organo-mineral horizon characteristics of nine stands in the Orleans State Forest (France), seven years after the first thinning treatments. To this end, three triplets of stands of pure Quercus petraea Matt., pure Pinus sylvestris L. and a mixture of both species were selected. Each stand consisted of two plots with different tree densities: low and normal. Physicochemical variables were measured on the organic humus horizon (OH), while microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN), and soil microbial metabolic profile were evaluated on the organo-mineral horizon; the abundance of soil microbial populations (i.e., bacteria, fungi and archaea) in each plot was also assessed by qPCR. The OH thickness consistently increased under pure pine stands (25-35 mm), while other OH characteristics showed no variation based on stand composition and tree density. Low-density plots exhibited changes in microbial biomass, with a significant decrease in both MBC and MBN. Moreover, the highest MBC was recorded under pure pine stands (1241 mg C.kg(- 1 )DW soil), and the highest MBN under pure oak stands (24-39 mg N.kg(- 1 ) DW soil). The highest C assimilation rates were recorded in the mixed stands, especially under low tree density. Bacteria and archea were similarly abundant across stand compositions and tree densities, while fungi tended to be more abundant in the mixed coniferous-broadleaf stands. Our findings should be considered by the forestry sectors of European countries where these two species are distributed, and suggest that EU forestry strategies should promote biodiversity in the context of tree plantations.

AB  - As part of the model intercomparison study MICS Asia II, the Swedish MATCH model was set up for Southeast and East Asia. In that study, the comprehensive photochemistry scheme of MATCH was used for the first time in Asia. The current work focuses on results of surface ozone from the MATCH model simulations falling outside the model intercomparison study. Model results of surface ozone concentrations for the entire year of 2001 were investigated and compared with measurements in Southeast Asia.
   The model produced higher surface ozone concentrations than the observations at all of the non-remote stations investigated but underestimated during the dry season at remote locations. Modelled seasonal variation was similar to, but less pronounced than, the variation in the measurements. This study indicates that NOx is the limiting precursor for ozone production in the model, while the fractionation in different species and total amount of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emissions are less important. Naturally emitted NMVOC, isoprene, is an important precursor of surface ozone at certain conditions, and a better inventory of these emissions is needed. Deposition velocities of ozone also have impact on surface concentrations. To improve the model performance, it is important to add a land use inventory with corresponding deposition velocities.

AB  - Technology intensive companies establish new R&D laboratories in regions of high innovation and near centers of scientific excellence. Identifying the right R&D director to head up such greenfield investments is central to the success or failure of the new lab. Analyzing 162 interviews with senior R&D managers, we identify eight different directorship profiles. Examples of new R&D sites and their directors include IBM, Daimler, Leica, Microsoft, Xerox, Lucent and Ciba. The initial mission and the intraorganizational and intraregional integration of the new lab are principal factors for director selection, determining expatriate or national management, cultural and ethnic familiarity, as well as local or international transfers. The analysis of succeeding R&D directors indicates a trend towards locally rooted yet organizationally competent R&D managers. The paper concludes with desired qualifications of director candidates for newly established international RD sites.

AB  - We compared two > 20 year long data sets of airborne and deposited pollen from northern Finnish Lapland (Kevo) and the middle boreal forest zone (Oulu) in terms of the plant taxa represented and their annual pollen quantities. Tree pollen (Betula spp., Pinus sylvestris) made up 92.8% of the total annual pollen in the air samples at Kevo, while in the ground-level deposition samples the tree pollen fraction was 61.5%; the remaining 38.5% comprising pollen of ground and field level plants (Ericaceae, Cyperaceae and others). In Oulu, the proportion of tree pollen in the air and deposition samples was 90.6% and 89.0%, respectively. The annual fluctuations in the quantity of total pollen and tree pollen in both sampling systems were correlated, but no such correlation was detected for the low growing plants, except in the case of Urticaceae at Kevo. This suggests that pollen of these low-growing plants mainly reflects the vegetation of the sampling site. Because tree pollen rises well into the atmosphere, it reflects pollen production from a larger area. Long-range transported Betula spp. pollen recorded in the atmosphere prior to local flowering comprised a considerable part of the Betula spp. pollen at Kevo and was collected by both sampling systems.

AB  - This paper discusses the use of biomarkers within the environmental protection framework that has evolved since the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) was given a broad mandate for the protection of the environment under the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (NSCA) in 2000. Unique insights have been obtained through environmental assessments for major nuclear projects conducted under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, and through the Environmental Effects Monitoring (EEM) requirements at uranium mines and mills (Metal Mining Effluent Regulations under the Fisheries Act (FA)). Altogether, the Canadian nuclear sector now has 17 years of experience in applying biological evidence in decision-making. Key examples are discussed where improved effluent controls were implemented at uranium mines for three substances (U, Mo, Se) based on risk assessments and supporting biological evidence. In the case of U, potential for localized harm from the chemical toxicity rather than radiological toxicity of U was identified at three older mines through environmental risk assessment. Evidence of potential harm in the field was also obtained from a community ecology bioindicator (benthic invertebrate biodiversity). This led to the improvement of effluent controls for U that were straightforward to implement under the NSCA. In the case of Mo, the weight of evidence for potential health effects on moose and other riparian wildlife from ecological risk assessments (supported by field evidence from Sweden) prompted improved controls based on precaution and pollution prevention. A technological solution was readily available for reducing Mo in effluent and was therefore implemented. In the case of Se, population level effects in fish and individual level effects in waterfowl in the USA led to selenium risks being evaluated downstream of uranium mines. Biomarkers (larval teratogenic deformities) played a pivotal role in attributing observed effects (harm) to the probable cause (selenium accumulation in the environment). However, as technological solutions were not straightforward, effort was required to build a consensus on achievable effluent control targets in a multi-stakeholder and multi-jurisdictional context. Through site-specific research and the latest scientific literature, criteria for selenium risk evaluation and water treatment system improvements were agreed upon and implemented. Within the EEM program, similar issues have arisen in managing a robust and defensible regulatory framework for controls on multiple hazardous substances across many mining sectors. However, an initial review of biomarkers resulted in the selection of only ecologically-relevant parameters (fish health and population indicators, benthic invertebrate biodiversity) as triggers for regulatory action. Altogether, these and other parallel experiences are discussed in terms of the desirable attributes of biological effects monitoring in a Canadian regulatory context.

AB  - Advances in process-based modelling of loads of nitrogen and phosphorus carried by rivers have created new possibilities to interpret time series of water quality data. We examined how model runs with constant anthropogenic forcing can be used to estimate and filter out weather-driven variation in observational data and, thereby, draw attention to other features of such data. An assessment of measured and modelled nutrient concentrations at the outlets of 45 Swedish rivers provided promising results for total nitrogen. In particular, joint analyses of observational data and outputs from the catchment model S-HYPE strengthened the evidence that downward trends in nitrogen were due to mitigation measures in agriculture. Evaluation of modelled and observed total phosphorus concentrations revealed considerable bias in the collection or chemical analysis of water samples and also identified weaknesses in the model outputs. Together, our results highlight the need for more efficient two-way communication between environmental modelling and monitoring.

AB  - Groundwater concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon and carbon dioxide have increased by 28% and 49%, respectively, across Sweden between 1980 and 2020 due to partial recovery from historic anthropogenic acid deposition and increased soil respiration, suggest geochemical model calculations.
   Groundwater is one of the largest continental carbon reservoirs and tightly linked to globally important carbon fluxes such as uptake on land, degassing from inland waters and delivery to oceans. Despite emerging evidence that these fluxes are sensitive to environmental changes, long-term carbon dynamics in groundwater remain widely unknown. Here I show that dissolved inorganic carbon and carbon dioxide concentrations in groundwater, calculated from environmental monitoring data (e.g. alkalinity, pH), have increased on average by 28% and 49%, respectively, across Sweden during 1980-2020. I attribute the observed changes mainly to a partial recovery from atmospheric sulfate deposition and associated shifts in weathering pathways, but also to enhanced soil respiration. The results highlight previously neglected long-term and large-scale dynamics in groundwater carbon cycling. These dynamics should be included in carbon cycle models for accurate evaluations and predictions of the effects of environmental changes on landscape and global carbon stocks and fluxes.

AB  - We have investigated value arguments concerning forest policy in Finland and reflected on their prevalence in an international context. The arguments of the organised stakeholders of current forest policy are analysed using semi-structured interview data and secondary material. We have categorised these arguments, and based on them, constructed value positions. The explorative rhetoric analysis reveals shared as well as conflicting values and beliefs.
   We have identified two dominating value positions: forestry position and nature position. The recognised core values include utility, property rights and value of nature, the utility dominating the policy discussion scene. A principal feature of the polarised policy field is a lack of trust. In addition to the polarisation, there is also a broad common ground in positions towards traditional rights of ownership and access to forests as well as on citizens' rights to influence forest policy. In order to gain more influence in forest policy, both positions make an effort to redefine the concepts in the argumentation of the others. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few studies have been conducted to assess agricultural sustainability in the European Union (EU), and all of them fail to provide a holistic view of sustainability in a relevant temporal horizon that could effectively support the design of policies. In this paper, a composite indicator is constructed based on the geometric aggregation of 12 basic indicators measured yearly in the period 2004-2020 (17 years) on all EU countries plus United Kingdom, with weights determined endogenously according to the Benefit of Doubt (BoD) approach. Our composite indicator has a two-level hierarchical structure accounting for the contributions of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. In our results, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania and Poland are the countries with the strongest growth rate of sustainability, while countries reaching the 90th percentile of the score in sustainability include Austria, Czechia, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and Sweden. In overall, the social and the environmental dimensions have similar levels, while the level of the economic dimension is definitely higher. Interestingly, several countries with a high level of sustainability are characterized by a decline of the economic dimension, including Austria, Finland, Italy, Latvia and Slovakia. The reliability of our composite indicator is supported by the substantial agreement of sustainability scores with subsidies attributed by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Therefore, our proposal represents a valuable resource not only to monitor the progress of EU member countries towards sustainability objectives, but also to refine the scheme for the attribution of CAP subsidies in order to stimulate specific sustainable dimensions.

AB  - Boreal peatiands are major sources of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and forest harvesting generally further increases the loading of DOC and nutrients. Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is proposed to be an environmentally more sustainable management option for peatland forests than conventional even-aged clear-cutting. However, the impacts of CCF on water quality, the biodegradability of DOC and consequent CO2 emissions from inland waters are poorly known. We studied the concentrations of N, P and DOC, the quality of DOC, and the mineralization of DOC to CO2 in ground water and ditch water in clear-cut, partially harvested, i.e. CCF, and uncut drained forests in Finland. Groundwater total N, NH4-N and PO4-P concentrations were significantly lower in CCF and uncut forest than in the clear-cut forest. Groundwater DOC concentrations were often highest in the clear-cut forest, where the water table was doser to the soil surface. Ditch water DOC and N concentrations were lowest next to the clear-cut area. DOC aromaticity in ground water was higher in the uncut forest than in the clear-cut and CCF, whereas ditch water aromaticity did not differ between the treatments. The biodegradation of DOC was studied by incubating water (at 15 degrees C for 24 h) 1, 3, 7 and 21 days after sampling. The results indicated that the majority of the CO2 production took place during the first three days, and CO2 fluxes were considerably higher from the ditch water than from the groundwater. The CO2 emissions were lower in summer than in the other seasons. Ditch water and groundwater CO2 production were generally significantly higher in the clear-cut than in the uncut forest. The results suggest that CCF can decrease the nutrient concentrations as well as CO2 emissions from inland waters compared to conventional clear-cutting. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) and the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) are critical to the reconstruction of past plant abundances. Extended R-value (ERV) models are commonly used for developing PPEs and estimating the RSAP. In this study, in the forest-steppe ecotone of northern China that is sensitive to climate change and significant in vegetation openness reconstruction, pollen data from surface sediment samples of 24 lakes and highresolution data of vegetation within the lake basins were applied to ERV models to calculate the PPEs of Pinus, Quercus, Betula, Ulmus, Poaceae, Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Compositae, and Cyperaceae and the RSAP of different lake sizes. The PPEs of arboreal pollen were higher than herbaceous pollen, and Chenopodiaceae had the highest productivity of herbaceous pollen taxa. The RSAP of lakes with an average lake radius of 400 m was estimated to be 1600 m. Our results suggested that PPEs and RSAP are region specific and that RSAP is also lake size specific even within the same region. Although environmental factors and imperfections in the ERV models may affect the accuracy of results, our study emphasized that a systematic vegetation survey considering zonal and azonal vegetation, the forest and steppe mosaic, and the vertical vegetation belt can help improve the PPEs and RSAP in areas with complicated vegetation distribution, such as the forest-steppe ecotone.

AB  - The technical advancements of the past decade have rendered motorised, high-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) investigations increasingly popular for archaeological research and cultural heritage management in Norway. However, the agricultural use of most survey areas limits the time available for fieldwork in spring and autumn and thus reduces the method's potential. An extension of the fieldwork period into the winter season would be desirable. The project "Arkeologi i veien?" aimed to develop practical solutions for efficient motorised GPR surveys on snow and to evaluate to what extent the thickness of the snow cover affects data quality. Four sites with known archaeological remains in the ground have been investigated under snowless conditions and with snow cover. The comparative data analysis showed that GPR surveys can result in useful data even on areas covered with one metre of snow. This study shows that different temperatures and resulting variable snow conditions can have a strong effect on the quality of the generated GPR data. The possibility for GPR measurements on snow offers the opportunity to extend fieldwork into the winter period without conflicting with the growing season; however, local weather and snow conditions have to be closely observed in order to obtain useful prospection data.

AB  - This study aims to analyse how vegetation, and in particular the degree of openness of the landscape, is reflected in pollen assemblages from surface sediment in lakes. Modern analogues of ancient cultural landscapes in southern Sweden were selected. Surface sediments from 22 small lakes (0.5-20 ha) located mainly in the forest region of southern Sweden were collected and analysed for pollen in order to enlarge and complement an earlier data set of 13 takes collected in the open, agricultural region of southernmost Sweden. The composition of the landscape surrounding the lakes was mapped within 1000-m and 500-m radii around the lakes using Colour InfraRed (CIR) aerial photographs. The pollen and landscape data were analysed using numerical ordination techniques. The results show that, despite the large variation of landscape openness, the variation in non-arboreal pollen (NAP) is low between the sites which was not the case for the 13 lakes of the previous study. It is hypothesised that this may be due to differences in the major characteristics of the two regions in which the sites were selected, i.e. mainly treeless and intensively farmed in the previous study and mainly forested in the present investigation. The difference in background pollen appears to play a decisive role on the relative representation of NAP. This implies that the background pollen should be estimated before NAP percentages can be used for quantitative reconstruction of past landscape openness. In the 22 lakes studied, Gramineae, Cerealia (excluding Secale), Filipendula and Sulric are positively correlated to cultivated land within both radii, and with open land (tree cover not exceeding 20%) within the 1000-m radius. Quercus and Fagus have some positive correlation with deciduous forest within 1000-m radius. We conclude that the landscape units cultivated land, open land and deciduous forest within 1000-m radius are reasonably well reflected in the pollen assemblages and could be predicted within this area.

TI  - Partnerships for Progress Toward Sustainable Road Systems
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Road infrastructure institutions and organizations are beginning to face a period of major change that will affect current partnerships in the transportation sector. The fundamental element of this change centers around the increasing importance of the concept of sustainability, which is developing from the increasing realization that the world has geophysical limits and that transportation systems, in common with many other human systems, are putting increasing pressure on these limits. The paper first reviews four perspectives of sustainability: negative, superficial, weak, and strong. It then evaluates how the ethical principles of strong sustainability could translate into transportation sector policy, based on the Swedish Vision Zero approach to road safety, within the overall concept of sustainability across society. Understanding of the implications of a possible sustainable road transportation infrastructure policy involves a preliminary evaluation of potential changes in current transportation institutions in the light of a number of indicated outcomes in a framework of pricing and investment, integration, mobility, and modal change. Four broad classifications of road infrastructure organization are then reviewed: departmental systems, public agencies with a degree of political independence, government-owned companies, and public-private partnerships. In each case, the structures are reviewed to understand the potential for sustainable outcomes from current systems, together with the likely consequences for future elected government functions. The paper concludes with a brief examination of the political process of change and the need for change to bring together community partnerships to support progress.

AB  - This paper illustrates and underscores the importance of sustainable practices with the focus on reprocessing fashion products. The reprocessing concepts include; repair, (re) dying, and (re) styling to increase the life and usability of products. An exploratory case study was conducted with organisations located in and around Boras in Vastra Gottland region of Sweden. The interviews were taken using semi-structured questionnaires from the people holding managerial positions in the selected organisations. In addition to the interviews, the direct observations were also documented. The respondents emphasised the role of reprocessing, extending the life of fashion. This is imperative in the fast-changing fashion world because each fashion season offers a new range of products, and the old ones are generally discarded. The process of (re)dying and (re)styling could be adapted to cope with the fast-changing demand of consumers for fashion products. Value addition can also be used to repair the damaged parts.

KW  - AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES
AB  - Economic sustainability assumes profitability (revenues >= costs including annual cash expenses as well as family labor and investments). Calculations Suggest that sheep flocks of more than 500 ewes can be profitable under Swedish conditions whereas smaller flocks are unprofitable unless they are managed by cheap existing resources including buildings, fences, machinery and family labor with low or no opportunity costs. Despite these economies of scale less than 1% of the Swedish sheep flocks have 500 or more ewes. Possible reasons are, according to interviews with lamb producers which have built up for Swedish conditions large sheep flocks of 90-900 ewes (average 380), growth sacrifices when developing large flocks and lack of accessible cheap land for providing large flocks with pasture and winter forage. The growth sacrifices reducing revenues or increasing costs during or immediately after the growth period include low production of primiparous ewes, reclamation of additional land and capital costs of new buildings before the Hock has been expanded to the intended number. The cash-flow is another problem for expanding sheep operations. Profitable lamb production presupposes large areas of land with zero or low opportunity costs. In fertile flatlands the opportunity costs are too high and in forest-dominated regions it is difficult to get hold of large enough areas near the farm centre for pasture and winter feed production. The latter problem can be solved by leasing cheap land further away and transporting feed and grazing animals, and by extending present pastures by incorporating adjacent overgrown pastures, marginal arable land and forest land. Another requirement for long-term profitable lamb production is to reduce the costs of new sheep sheds below what is a common cost level in Sweden. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Serious games are gaining increasing prominence in environmental communication research, but their potential to form an integrated part of participatory research approaches is still strikingly understudied. This is particularly the case for applications of interactive digital formats in research on environmental challenges of high complexity, such as climate adaptation, which is a specifically suitable case as it involves complex interaction between climate systems and society, but where the response also involves trade-offs with potentially negative - maladaptive - outcomes. Intervention. This article presents the Maladaptation Game, which was designed to facilitate dialogue about potential negative outcomes of agricultural climate adaptation.
   Methods. We conducted test sessions with agricultural stakeholders in Finland and Sweden, and analysed quantitative and qualitative, audio-recorded and transcribed, material for opportunities and challenges related to dialogues, engagement, interactivity and experienced relevance.
   Results. The qualitative analysis of recorded dialogues shows that the Maladaptation Game has potential to support dialogue by challenging players to negotiate between options with negative outcomes. The gameplay itself presents opportunities in terms of creating engagement with options that provoke disagreement and debates between players, as well as interactivity, that players reflected upon as quick and easy, while challenges were related to the experienced relevance, in particular the options provided in the game, and its general framing.
   Conclusions. The results indicate a need for complementary approaches to this type of game but also suggest the importance of moderation when the game design is aimed at creating dialogue around a complex environmental challenge such as agricultural climate adaptation.

AB  - Even though biomass is characterised as renewable energy, it produces anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially from biomass logistics. Lifecycle assessment (LCA) is used as a tool to quantify the GHG emissions from logistics but in the past the majority of LCAs have been steady-state and linear, when in reality, non-linear and temporal aspects (such as weather conditions, seasonal biomass demand, storage capacity, etc.) also have an important role to play. Thus, the objective of this paper was to optimise the environmental sustainability of forest biomass logistics (in terms of GHG emissions) by introducing the dynamic aspects of the supply chain and using the geographical information system (GIS) and agent-based modelling (ABM). The use of the GIS and ABM adds local conditions to the assessment in order to make the study more relevant. In this study, GIS was used to investigate biomass availability, biomass supply points and the road network around a large-scale combined heat and power plant in Naantali, Finland. Furthermore, the temporal aspects of the supply chain (e.g., seasonal biomass demand and storage capacity) were added using ABM to make the assessment dynamic. Based on the outcomes of the GIS and ABM, a gate-to-gate LCA of the forest biomass supply chain was conducted in order to calculate GHG emissions. In addition to the domestic biomass, we added imported biomass from Riga, Latvia to the fuel mixture in order to investigate the effect of sea transportation on overall GHG emissions. Finally, as a sensitivity check, we studied the real-time measurement of biomass quality and its potential impact on overall logistical GHG emissions. According to the results, biomass logistics incurred GHG emissions ranging from 2.72 to 3.46 kg CO2-eq per MWh, depending on the type of biomass and its origin. On the other hand, having 7% imported biomass in the fuel mixture resulted in a 13% increase in GHG emissions. Finally, the real-time monitoring of biomass quality helped save 2% of the GHG emissions from the overall supply chain. The incorporation of the GIS and ABM helped in assessing the environmental impacts of the forest biomass supply chain in local conditions, and the combined approach looks promising for developing LCAs that are inclusive of the temporal aspects of the supply chain for any specific location.

AB  - Traditionally, the role of primary education has been emphasized strongly in development interventions. There's an increased recognition that all levels of education must be addressed simultaneously, and that the link between higher education with human development and realization of human rights is crucial. Higher education has gained a recognized role as a key driver for development [1] [2]. Higher education has increasingly been understood to be underpinning all development targets, from poverty reduction to employability, health to environmental sustainability [3].
   The Finnish development policy framework with its strong focus on adopting a Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) is also instrumental in the Finnish Higher Education Institutions Institutional Cooperation Instrument (HEI ICI); a funding instrument by the Finnish Foreign Ministry for capacity building of educational institutions in the Global South. (A Human Rights Based Approach in Finnish Development Cooperation; Guidance Note) [4]. This paper presents findings of a desk study of the HEI ICI programme phase implementation and reports during 2013-2015 as well as applications made for the programme period of 2016-2018.
   The very premise the funding instrument is built on is to be a vehicle for promoting democratic societies and through their interventions supporting states to respect, protect and fulfil their human rights obligations. The projects, to various degrees, have integrated the core principles of HRBA: participation and inclusion, transparency and accountability. Many HEI ICI projects are firmly anchored in a principle of equality and non-discrimination. Multi-stakeholder dissemination events and project activities have created windows of opportunity for participation and empowerment of civil society, and marginalised and vulnerable communities and their representatives. Projects have played a role in promoting transparency and accountability and the practices of good governance at participating institutions.
   Although there's limited evidence of to what degree HEI ICI projects have affected the broader development and policy landscape in target countries, there are important indications for instance in terms of enhancing participation and accessibility. Some projects have targeted out-of-school populations and professionals, such as health professionals in vulnerable circumstances. Funded projects have enhanced rights in higher education and skills development through engaging learners of all ages and promoted lifelong learning practices. It is found that, for instance, skills development in the field of ICT can strongly support HRBA.
   Higher education can be instrumental in the realization of rights such as the right to water or the right to an adequate standard of living through development project implementation in the sphere of education. The HEI ICI project final reports and related results signal to the wider development and education communities that capacity building interventions have vast potential to promote social cohesion and stability. Projects support democracy and sustainable development as well as the principles of peace and non-violence and positive social transformation. These projects support the notions that higher education capacity building initiatives at the minimum ought to be human rights sensitive, or at the best, can be human rights progressive. The Finnish experience can serve as guidance in terms of advancing the fulfilment of rights and freedoms in the Global South as an integral part of project implementation.

AB  - After coming close to extinction, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) has re-colonized Scandinavia during the last two decades. The current population numbers some 100-120 individuals, and is distributed in small packs along the Swedish-Norwegian border. However, with wolf re-colonization, several conflicts have arisen. One conflict is due to wolf predation on livestock, especially sheep and reindeer. Another is predation on wild ungulates. As the wolves have shown a strong preference for moose (Alces alces) in this respect, a smaller moose population is available for game hunting. The cost of increased moose predation by wolves is examined using a two-step process. First, we analyse the costs to landowners, comprising the loss of animals potentially available for bunting less the reduction in browsing damage associated with a smaller moose population. Second, we examine the problem from a broader point of view, where costs external to landowners and local communities are included. By far the most important cost here is damage related to collisions between moose and motor vehicles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forest biomass is one of the main contributors to the EU's renewable energy target of 20% gross final energy consumption in 2020 (Renewable Energy Directive). Following the RED, new sustainability principles are launched by the European energy sector, such as the Initiative Wood Pellet Buyers (IWPB or SBP). The aim of our study is the investigation of the quantitative impacts from IWPB's principles for forest biomass for energy only. We deploy a bottom up method that quantifies the supplies and the costs from log harvest until forest chip delivery at a domestic consumer. We have a reference situation with existing national (forest) legislation and voluntary certification schemes (scenario1) and a future situation with additional criteria based on the IWPB principles (scenario2). Two country studies were selected for our (2008) survey: one in Finland with nearly 100% certification and one in Leningrad province with a minor areal share of certification in scenario 1. The sustainable potential of forest resources for energy is about 54 Mm(3) (385 PJ) in Finland and about 13.5 Mm(3) (95 PJ) in Leningrad in scenario 1 without extra criteria. The potential volumes reduce considerably by maximum 43% respectively 39% after new criteria from the IWPB, like aminimum use of sawlogs, stumps and slash for energy, and by an increased area of protected forests (scenario 2A Maximum extra restrictions). Incase sawlogs can be used, but instead ash recycling is applied after a maximum stump and slash recovery (scenario 2B Minimum extra restrictions), the potential supply is less reduced: 5% in Finland and 22% in Leningrad region. The estimated reference costs for forest chips are between (sic)18 and (sic)45 solid m(-3) in Finland and between (sic)7 and (sic)33 solid m(-3) in the Leningrad region. In scenario 2A, the costs will mainly increase by (sic)7 m(-3) for delimbing full trees (Finland), and maximum (sic)0.3 m(-3) for suggested improved forest management(Leningrad region). In scenario 2B, when ash recycling is applied, costs increase by about (sic)0.3 to (sic)1.6 m(-3), depending on the rate of soil contamination. This is an increase of 2%, on top of the costs in scenario 2A. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study utilizes the media persuasion perspective to investigate the connection of media exposure of robots on the general attitude and trust toward robots of people from different cultural backgrounds. Study 1 utilized 2016 survey data from Finnish care workers (N = 3800). Study 2 used two 2019 datasets from the adult population of the United States (N = 1003; N = 969), and Study 3 involved a trust game experiment on robots (n = 331). Results showed that the overall media exposure of robots is linked to a positive general attitude toward robots, but only fact-based media channel exposure had a positive impact on trust in robots. Results suggest that the experience of robots gained through media exposure is a relevant factor affecting people's perceptions of robots. The findings contribute to the discussions on media effects and have practical implications for gaining evidence about the precursors of accepting robots.

AB  - Populations at range margins may be genetically different from more central ones for a number of mutually non-exclusive reasons. Specific selection pressures may operate in environments that are more marginal for the species. Genetic drift may also have a strong effect in these populations if they are small, isolated and/or have experienced significant bottlenecks during the colonisation phase. The question if peripheral populations are special, and if yes then how and why, is of obvious relevance for speciation theory, as well as for conservation biology. To evaluate the uniqueness of populations at range margins and the influence of gene flow and selection, we performed a morphometric study of two grassland butterfly species: Coenonympha arcania and C. hero (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae). The samples were collected from Swedish populations that are peripheral and isolated from the main area of the species distributions and from populations in the Baltic states that are peripheral but connected to the main area of the species distributions. These samples were compared to those from central parts of the species distributions. The isolated populations in both species differed consistently from both peripheral and central populations in their wing size and shape. We interpret this as a result of selection caused by differences in population structure in these isolated locations, presumably favoring different dispersal propensity of these butterflies. Alternative explanations based on colonisation history, latitudinal effects, inbreeding or phenotypic plasticity appear less plausible. As a contrast, the much weaker and seemingly random among-region differences in wing patterns are more likely to be ascribed to weaker selection pressures allowing genetic drift to be influential. In conclusion, both morphological data and results from neutral genetic markers in earlier studies of the same system provide congruent evidence of both adaptation and genetic drift in the isolated Swedish populations of both species.

AB  - Freshly cut beech deadwood was enriched in the canopy and on the ground in three cultural landscapes in Germany (Swabian Alb, Hainich-Dun, Schorfheide-Chorin) in order to analyse the diversity, distribution and interaction of wood-inhabiting fungi and beetles. After two years of wood decay 83 MOTUs (Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units) from 28 wood samples were identified. Flight Interception Traps (FITs) installed adjacent to the deadwood enrichments captured 29.465 beetles which were sorted to 566 species. Geographical 'region' was the main factor determining both beetle and fungal assemblages. The proportions of species occurring in all regions were low. Statistic models suggest that assemblages of both taxa differed between stratum and management praxis but their strength varied among regions. Fungal assemblages in Hainich-Dun, for which the data was most comprehensive, discriminated unmanaged from extensively managed and age-class forests (even-aged timber management) while canopy communities differed not from those near the ground. In contrast, the beetle assemblages at the same sites showed the opposite pattern. We pursued an approach in the search for fungus-beetle associations by computing cross correlations and visualize significant links in a network graph. These correlations can be used to formulate hypotheses on mutualistic relationships for example in respect to beetles acting as vectors of fungal spores.

AB  - Biomass as a renewable energy source is an alternative to fossil fuels. Due to its lower energy density compared to fossil fuels, different ways of converting biomass into an energy-dense fuel are sought after. Fast pyrolysis of biomass into pyrolysis oil represents such method, allowing wider substitution of fossil fuels. Pyrolysis is an energy -intensive process but its efficiency can be improved by integration of pyrolysis reactor into a combined heat and power plant. In this study environmental analyses are conducted on the production of 50 000 tons of pyrolysis oil from wood to substitute for heavy fuel oil. The pyrolysis oil is produced either in a stand-alone reactor or as an integrated part of a combined heat and power plant. The combined heat and power plant is wood and peat fueled, producing of 820 GWh of energy. The cradle-to-grave emissions of CO2-eq. NOx, SO2, and PM are calculated by using two methods: 1) life cycle assessment and 2) the Tool for Sustainability Impact Assessment. Reductions in environmental loads of over 75% in (fossil) CO2-eq and over 90% in NOx, SO2, and PM can be achieved when heavy fuel oil is replaced by pyrolysis oil. The pyrolysis is 20% more efficient if integrated with CHP production. The potential reductions vary several percent between the applied methods because of different system boundaries. Nevertheless, integrating the pyrolysis reactor into a combined heat and power plant appears as the best option irrespective of the method used. Extending the system boundaries with the life cycle inventories results in significant increases of emissions in many processes; however, combustion in plants has a dominant role in overall emissions but is not subject to the boundary extensions, and thus, the totals of emissions between the methods are nearly the same.

AB  - This article explores four political debates in the Swedish diet and among the ruling elite in Stockholm on the organization of public services. The results demonstrate how in different ways notions of the common good permeated the discourse on all occasions.
   When the Swedish government tried to initiate public street lightning in Stockholm in 1749, there was a broad consensus among government and city officials that this should be done by the creation of a municipal organization financed by tax income. The burghers of Stockholm, however, opposed the proposal and argued that they were themselves better suited to care for the street lights. The common good should be provided by individual action of responsible, male householders. Eventually the burghers got the upper hand and public street lightning continued to be organized by private initiative until the mid-nineteenth century.
   When in the 1720s the Swedish diet discussed the lease of custom duties by a merchant consortium (Sw. generaltullarrendesocieteten), the problem of corruption emerged as the bone of contention. Proponents claimed that this form of private enterprise was an effective means to suppress widespread corruption among state officials. Their opponents argued to the contrary that private leaseholders would skim off the profits for themselves, thereby depriving the state of its income.
   In the mid-eighteenth century the city authorities in Stockholm debated whether the emptying of latrines should remain an individual concern or if it should be recognized as a public matter. The city officials at first decided that this task was indeed a matter of public concern that should be handled by private entrepreneurs. Within a few years they had changed their minds, however, proposing instead that a new communal organization should be created for the removal of city waste. By now, the ruling elite of Stockholm had begun to identify the common good with municipal direction.
   The development of railway infrastructure was a hotly debated subject in the Swedish diet of the 1850s. Some representatives argued that private entrepreneurs would provide more cost-effective solutions than publicly managed railways, while others claimed that the state must administer a national system of railways. In the debate, private self-interest was juxtaposed with equal access to the common good. The proponents of state intervention claimed that national concerns must have priority over financial gain, and this argument would eventually influence the final decision.
   By the middle of the nineteenth century there was a growing consensus among the ruling elites in Sweden that the common good could best be provided for by state or municipal initiative. In the debates, arguments about organizational efficiency and equal access to public services eventually won out over notions of individual responsibility and private enterprise as a better alternative to corrupt government. In the late twentieth century the debate had shifted radically, however. The reasons for this shift will be the subject of our future research.

AB  - This study compares UK and Norwegian offshore workers' evaluations of social and organizational factors that can have an impact upon safety on offshore installations. A total of 1138 Norwegian (87% response rate) and 622 UK workers (40% response rate) responded to a self-completion questionnaire, which was distributed to 18 installations in February/March 1994. The questionnaire contained six scales that were suitable and relevant for the purposes of comparison. These scales measured 'risk perception', 'satisfaction with safety measures', 'perceptions of the job situation', 'attitudes to safety', 'perceptions of others' commitment to safety' and 'perceptions of social support'. The data show clear differences in how UK and Norwegian workers evaluate various social and organizational factors that can have an impact upon safety, however, eta 2 analysis indicated that for most of the scales 'installation' explained a greater percentage of the variance than sector. The exceptions to this were scales measuring 'safety attitudes' where both sector and installation contributed equally to the effects. Although the results from the 'safety attitudes' scales should be interpreted with caution (due to low internal reliability), it is possible that they are tapping into more deeply held beliefs about the nature of safety, e.g. 'fatalism' and the 'causes of accidents'. In contrast, the other scales are measuring factors directly related to the working environment such as perceptions of risk and satisfaction with safety measures on the installation. These may reflect the prevailing 'safety climate' or 'atmosphere' on the installations surveyed, whereas constructs such as 'fatalism', etc. may be reflections of underlying 'cultural' values. Recognizing the existence of different 'safety cultures' and understanding the processes which lie behind them could have implications for safety management in an industry which is highly international in nature and in which workers' are often required to work in foreign countries for varying periods of time.

AB  - Participation in leisure sports is undergoing a transformation that is guided by societal and cultural changes as well as recent developments in, and the use of, digital sports media and technologies. This paper discusses how changes in leisure sports participation can be understood using mediatization as a theoretical framework. This theoretically informed analysis of change is contextualized within Finnish climbing and trail running subcultures. The paper proposes that mediatization contributes to the diversification of the sporting landscape, enables fluidity in sports communities, and strengthens commercialization of leisure sports. Additionally, the paper outlines how the dynamics of de- and reinstitutionalization of leisure sports are connected to the rise of digital media and communication.

AB  - The formation of green clusters is one of the directions of state policy of all countries looking for transition to a green economy. The article outlines the authors' vision of a typical model of a green cluster and provides a comparative analysis of the practices of green clusters in Europe and Russia on example of the Green Net Finland cluster of environmentally friendly technologies in Finland, the EnviroCluster Peterborough cluster of environmental enterprises in the UK, the Green Tech Valley cluster in Austria, as well as the consortium St. Petersburgh Cluster of Clean Technologies for the Urban Environment, garbage clusters for sorting, recycling and composting, the Green Moscow Innovative Intersectoral Cluster. It is concluded that green clusters play an important role in solving the problems of environmental protection and waste recycling. They are created in order to implement international agreements to reduce emissions, to switch to clean technologies, achieve carbon neutrality and create a circular economy in European countries. In Russia green clusters are primarily considered as an instrument to achieve the goals of sustainable development, and ultimately the environmental indicators established in national projects, programs and strategies. The European and Russian experience in the formation of green clusters is of practical importance and can be taken into account by other countries that are just planning to switch to a green economy.

AB  - We studied Siberian jays, breeding in northern Sweden, to examine the potential for interactions between nest predation and reduced vegetation heterogeneity around nest sites to cause a decrease in jay numbers. Parent behaviour and nests are highly cryptic in the species. Our 12-year data showed, however, that nests had a probability of only 0.46 to be successful and produce at least one nestling. Nest predation was intense and a main cause of nest failure. All predators that could be identified were visually oriented hunters, mostly other corvids able to colonize taiga forest only close to human settlements. Consistent with the idea that predators used visual cues, nest predation increased with parental activity, which suggests that predators used parental provisioning trips to locate nests. Furthermore, a reduction in daily nest survival rates with decreasing amount of nesting cover was more pronounced in areas with high corvid activity as predicted when cover mediates the hunting efficiency of visual oriented predators. Declining temperatures interacted with the effects of habitat characteristics to further reduce daily nest survival rates suggesting that parents were not able to increase nest visitation rates to satisfy the higher energy demands of their nestlings without endangering the nest. Our results identify a mechanism through which predation and human-induced reduction in nesting cover on a larger scale may interact to cause a reduction in Siberian jay numbers larger than expected from habitat loss alone.

AB  - This article analyses the transformation of Kirkenes, a small town on the Russian-Norwegian border, from an industrial town to a border town. Kirkenes was established as a harbour for an iron-ore mining venture in what today is the municipality of Sor-Varanger. This industry closed down during the 1990s. The article describes how Kirkenes has been transformed within "bordered'' relationships of civic society, business and a combination of high-level and local political activities. Being a border town and a centre in the Barents Region is the hegemonic narrative of today. The manifold transformations have led to a situation where Kirkenes has become "Russianized'', though local actors struggle with how to handle this aspect of local development and the meaning of the place. The article also investigates to what degree the transformations have changed local identity. The focus is on how identities are dealt with, whether they are seen as immanent and essential cultural traits, or as something that tends to be changed and adapted to the situation. Based on the concept of narrative identities, there are reasons to believe that there are strong identities based on both public narratives relating to local history and nature and metanarratives about globalization and cross-border communities.

AB  - The paper applies the multi-level perspective (MLP) in a descriptive study of three Norwegian ports, to shed new light on the sociotechnical processes that structure their efforts to develop into zero emission energy hubs. While exogenous pressures cause tensions over port governance, the studied ports utilize their full spectre of functions; as landlords, operators, authorities and community managers, to enable transition. The respective approaches vary, related to their local context, market situation and social networks, including port's relations with their owners. Individual orientations and organizational capacity further influence their engagement with radical innovation niches (e.g. OPS, hydrogen, LNG). The study highlights the active role of ports in sustainability transition. It shows how the interaction between geographical factors and institutional work influences the scope for new solutions around the individual port, and how this makes for different feedback loops and contributions to sustainability transition in wider transport and energy systems.

AB  - The Norwegian infrastructure market experiences a development of larger projects with bigger budgets than ever before. This paper provides an overview of the current situation in the Norwegian rail and road infrastructure market, in order to grant contractor and client input on how value can be increased through efficient procurement and contract models in the future projects. The papers addresses the following research questions: What are the biggest opportunities and challenges of operating on the Norwegian infrastructure market for the clients and contractors? How can we ensure a healthy competition on the Norwegian infrastructure market? An initial literature study was followed by fourteen semi-structured open-ended interviews with key persons involved in one rail and three road projects, respectively. These case specific interviews were supported by six semi-structured interviews with experienced practitioners. Our findings present several challenges and possibilities of being on the Norwegian market. The identified factors, such as cultural differences and political stability makes the market challenging and preferred at the same time. We also found that clients can increase the international competition by offering contracts that are written in English, contracts of a certain size and by letting the contractors handle the design phase themselves. The public clients find themselves in a position where they feel an obligation to protect the established contractors, but at the same time attract new ones. This study is limited to projects where the contract is signed after 2012, and with a net value above 40 million euros. Due to an ongoing change in the market, where new contractors win several large-scale projects, it becomes important to identify the opportunities and challenges that occur when the competition in the market increases. The paper describe how clients can facilitate for a healthy competition and also successful projects in the near future. Some of the opportunities and challenges may also exist in other infrastructure markets, which may make the results usable for not only the Norwegian public clients, but also construction clients in other parts of the world.

AB  - City ponds have the potential to harbour a rich biodiversity of aquatic insects despite being located in an urban landscape. However, our current knowledge on the correlates of pond biodiversity is limited and even less is known about the factors that influence the ecological uniqueness of urban ponds. The multiple environmental gradients, at different spatial scales, that may affect biodiversity and ecological uniqueness of urban ponds can thus be seen both as an opportunity and as a challenge for a study. In this study, we aimed to fill this gap by focusing on aquatic insect assemblages in 51 ponds in the Swedish city of Stockholm, using a metacommunity perspective. We found that species richness was primarily determined by the density of aquatic insects, water depth and proportion of buildings around the pond. The uniqueness of ponds was estimated as local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD), and it was primarily related to the proportion of arable land and industry around the ponds. With regard to the metacommunity we found two interesting patterns. First, there was a negative relationship between richness and LCBD. Second, biodiversity was spatially independent, suggesting that spatially-patterned dispersal did not structure species richness or LCBD. These last two patterns are important when considering conservation efforts of biodiversity in city ponds. We hence suggest that the conservation of insect biodiversity in urban pond should consider the surroundings of the ponds, and that high-richness ponds are not necessarily those that require most attention because they are not ecologically the most unique.

AB  - Predation impacts by introduced predators are predicted to be most intense in island ecosystems, and also variable depending on environmental conditions, but large-scale experimental field testing is rare. In this study we examine the factors that determine the distribution and abundance of vole metapopulations preyed upon by feral American mink Mustela vison in the outer Finnish archipelago of the Baltic Sea. Specifically, we follow the dynamics of field voles Microtus agrestis and bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus on 40 small islands under variable rainfall as part of a large-scale mink removal experiment. For both vole species occupancy rates were negatively influenced by island isolation, as were extinction events for field voles. High summer rainfall in 1998 corresponded to large vole populations where mink were absent, populations that then crashed in 1999 and 2000 when below average rains fell during the summer breeding season. Where mink were present however, vole abundance remained more constant between years with no boom-bust apparent. We conclude that weather and predation may drive vole abundance whereas habitat patchiness and metapopulation processes more strongly drive vole distributions. There may also be potential for interaction between these factors: because feral mink prevent rapid vole population growth after good summer rains, and vole dispersal is influenced by population size, feral mink may be changing vole dispersal patterns to disrupt the natural metapopulation dynamic. Hence this indirect impact of mink could lead to gradual erosion of vole populations in the outer archipelago by reducing recolonisation processes.

AB  - Based on data from the Weddell Sea in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, the total number of macrozoobenthic species was estimated for the entire Antarctic shelf using species-accumulation methods, jack-knife estimators, and Incidence-based Coverage Estimators of species richness. Ranging between 11 000 and 17 000 expected species, Antarctica seems to have an intermediate species richness when compared to other selected tropical, temperate or Arctic habitats.

AB  - As a part of its climate policy, Finnish government facilitated the creation of low-carbon roadmaps by sectors of industry. The roadmap process and the roadmaps were promoted as an international benchmark in COP26. They also form a part of the policy process towards the government's goal of carbon neutrality by 2035. We analyse the need and role of biomass use contained in the roadmaps of the key sectors and compare it to data on available forest biomass. The combined need for forest biomass in the roadmaps is well over 140 Mm(3), which is over double that of the logging level in 2019, and drastically over the roadmaps' projection of future sustainable yield. This creates a challenge for the carbon neutrality goal via the loss of carbon sinks in forests, risking the carbon neutrality target and other sustainability goals. Although, up to date, the roadmaps present the most detailed picture of industrial transformation towards carbon neutrality in an EU member state, they are made unrealistic by the omission of a comprehensive material perspective. The addition of such a perspective and a clear setting of boundaries would increase the viability of the roadmaps as a policy tool.

AB  - In many countries, the existing housing stock will be a major part of the total stock for the coming hundred years or more. Thus, to reach Urgent goals for sustainable building, it is necessary not just to develop better concepts of new building, but also new models for housing renovation and management. In Sweden, during the last decade, several environmentally oriented renovation projects have been realized in large housing areas built 1946-1975. Thorough studies of some fifty projects aiming at environmental sustainability, as well as social, economic and cultural, offer an overview of problems and technical solutions. The aim of this paper is to give a Summary of this overwiew and to discuss the effects, efficiency, and applicability of specially interesting types of measures concerning building envelopes as well as technical systems and equipment, the Outdoor environment, and social sustainability.

AB  - A conflict arises when some groups interpret a siting as a possibility while others see it as constituting a risk. The actors involved are faced with various problems regarding decisionmaking. What, for the government, can be a solution to an environmental problem can be seen by the people living in the area in question as a threat to their health and immediate environment. This article discusses the possibility of creating a dialogue between various actors involved in a siting conflict. It is stated that the dialogue should be democratic and based on knowledge: siting has political dimensions, and therefore it is important that citizens have the possibility of participating in the decision-making process. In addition, by allowing several different perspectives to influence a siting decision, more knowledge is created about the proposal. In conclusion, the paper gives some general advice concerning how such a dialogue can be brought about. A dialogue can fail, but the chance of a good solution increases if a dialogue is encouraged to proceed.

KW  - FOOD
AB  - Prior to Christianization, initiated by the Swedish Crown and Church during the seventeenth century, the religion of the native Sami people of northern Scandinavia included animistic beliefs centered on animal ceremonialism. The Sami religion evolved in the framework of hunter-gatherer subsistence, and landscapes were laden with religious significance. The authors of this essay seek to highlight the significance of sacrificial sites as ethnic and religious demarcations in times of conflict between Swedish society and the Sami. We focus especially on sacrificial wooden objects as representations of religious space, discussing three sacrificial sites from different periods and representing a geographical gradient. We conclude that wooden sacrificial sites were still frequent and prominent features of the Sami landscape during the seventeenth century and the first half of the eighteenth century in northern Sweden. However, in the following century, the indigenous religion was forced into secrecy. Today, elements of indigenous religious space, as indicated by place names and oral traditions, reflect but fragments of a landscape that was once a coherent whole.

AB  - Tree-ring analyses of 23 bark-stripped trees, mostly Thuja plicata (western red cedar) but also Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (yellow cedar) and Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce), help describe traditional Native tree-bark exploitation at a site north of Ketchikan in southeast Alaska, USA. Tree-ring samples exposed 36 cultural scars dating from between a.d. 1718 and 1912, showing that Natives landed on this hazardous stretch of Clarence Strait to take tree bark in 29 (about 15%) of the 195 years spanned by the sample. One-third of these culturally modified trees had multiple scars indicating repeated use of individual trees. The most intensive forest use occurred between 1852 and 1895, while the lack of bark scars after 1912 marks a decline in traditional Native craft. A burst of bark-stripping between 1779 and 1787 may be associated with the legendary last battle between the Stikine Tlingit of Alaska and the Tsimshian of British Columbia. The sample is compared with dated samples from British Columbia (Canada) and Washington State, USA.

AB  - Sustainable methods are required to protect newly planted tree seedlings from insect herbivore attack. To this end, here Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) seeds were treated with 2.5 mM nicotinamide (NIC), 2.5 mM nicotinic acid (NIA), 3 mM jasmonic acid (JA) or 0.2 mM 5-azacytidine (5-Aza), and 6-month-old seedlings grown from these seeds were planted at a reforestation area in central Sweden. Attack by pine weevils (Hylobius abietis) was reduced by 50 per cent by NIC treatment, 62.5 per cent by JA treatment and 25 per cent by 5-Aza treatment, when compared with seedlings grown from untreated seeds. Watering 18-month-old spruce seedlings with 2 mM NIC or 2 mM NIA did reduce attack during the first season in the field by 40 and 53 per cent, respectively, compared with untreated plants. Girdling was also reduced by the different treatments. Analysis of conifer seedlings treated with 5-Aza points at a possible involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this defensive capacity. This is supported by a reduced level of DNA methylation in the needles of young spruce seedlings grown in a greenhouse from NIC-treated seeds. Seed treatment for seedling defense potentiation is simple, inexpensive and also a new approach for forestry with many potential applications.

AB  - In this paper we test the performance of the Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model using pollen records from multiple small sites. We use Holocene pollen records from large and small sites in southern Sweden to identify what is/are the most significant variable(s) affecting the REVEALS-based reconstructions, i.e. type of site (lakes and/or bogs), number of sites, site size, site location in relation to vegetation zones, and/or distance between small sites and large sites. To achieve this objective we grouped the small sites according to (i) the two major modern vegetation zones of the study region, and (ii) the distance between the small sites and large lakes, i.e. small sites within 50, 100, 150, or 200 km of the large lakes. The REVEALS-based reconstructions were performed using 24 pollen taxa. Redundancy analysis was performed on the results from all REVEALS-model runs using the groups within (i) and (ii) separately, and on the results from all runs using the groups within (ii) together. The explanatory power and significance of the variables were identified using forward selection and Monte Carlo permutation tests. The results show that (a) although the REVEALS model was designed for pollen data from large lakes, it also performs well with pollen data from multiple small sites in reconstructing the percentage cover of groups of plant taxa (e.g. open land taxa, summer-green trees, evergreen trees) or individual plant taxa; however, in the case of this study area, the reconstruction of the percentage cover of Calluna vulgaris, Cyperaceae, and Betula may be problematic when using small bogs; (b) standard errors of multiple small-site REVEALS estimates will generally be larger than those obtained using pollen records from large lakes, and they will decrease with increasing size of pollen counts and increasing number of small sites; (c) small lakes are better to use than small bogs if the total number of small sites is low; and (d) the size of small sites and the distance between them do not play a major role, but the distance between the small sites and landscape/vegetation boundaries is a determinant factor for the accuracy of the vegetation reconstructions.

AB  - The species composition of wood-inhabiting fungi (polypores and corticoids) was investigated on 1138 spruce logs and 992 pine logs in 90 managed and 34 natural or near-natural spruce and pine forests in SE Norway.
   Altogether, the study included 290 species of wood-inhabiting fungi. Comparisons of logs with similar properties (standardized tree species, decay class, dimension class) in natural and managed forests showed a significant reduction in species number per log in managed spruce forests, but not in managed pine forests. The species number per log in managed spruce forests was 10-55% lower than on logs from natural spruce forests. The reduction was strongest on logs of large dimensions. A comparison of 200-400 spruce logs from natural and managed forests showed a 25% reduction in species richness corresponding to a conservative loss of ca. 40 species on a regional scale.
   A closer inspection revealed that species confined to medium and very decayed spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests, whereas species on early decay classes and decay generalists were unaffected. Similarly, species preferring large spruce logs were disfavored in managed forests. Forest management had strongest impact on low-frequent species in the spruce forests (more than 50% reduction), whereas common species were modestly affected. Corticoid fungi were more adversely affected than polypore fungi.
   These results indicate that wood-decaying fungi in pine forests are more adapted to forest disturbances than spruce-associated species. Management measures securing a continuous supply of dead wood are more important in spruce forests than in pine forests. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Forestry has markedly changed a large proportion of the world's boreal forests, often with negative effects on biodiversity. As a result, forest restoration is increasingly implemented to counteract the negative effects. However, restoration measures aimed at mimicking natural disturbance regimes could simultaneously increase the risk of unwanted negative effects, such as damage by forest pest species. This study compares the effect of two restoration methods (prescribed burning and gap-cutting), on both biodiversity conservation and pest control, to provide a basis for solutions to this potential conflict.
   2. Bark beetles are ideal for studying this conflict, as this group is both species-rich and contains notorious pest species. We conducted a unique, large-scale field experiment in which we compared the effect of two different restoration methods on the abundance, species richness and assemblage composition of bark beetles. In addition, we estimated uncontrolled tree mortality by the number of trees that died post-restoration.
   3. Beetles were divided in two groups, primary and secondary, the former with an ability to kill growing trees. Bark beetle diversity did not differ between treatment groups prior to restoration. However, after restoration, assemblage composition and primary bark beetle abundance differed between the treatments. Furthermore, species richness was higher in burned and gap-cut stands compared to reference stands.
   4. The number of trees that died post-restoration was highest on burned sites, whereas no difference was found between gap-cut and reference stands. The number of dead trees was correlated with the number of primary beetles.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the potential for a conflict between forest restoration for biodiversity conservation and the potential risk for tree mortality caused by forest pests. This is likely to become a problem in many boreal forests; however, our results suggest that this conflict can be moderated by the choice of restoration method. The restoration method gap-cutting had a similar positive impact on bark beetle species richness as compared to the burning method, but did not as burning, increase tree mortality. Thus, in areas where there is an apparent risk for pest outbreaks, our data suggest that gap-cutting should be the chosen method to avoid an unwanted increase in tree mortality at the stand level.

AB  - Much of the research that concerns the impacts of management measures in the eastern Baltic cod fishery has focused on fish stock rather than understanding fishermen's attitudes towards regulations. Hence, there is little information available on fishermen's responses although they are the ones whom the regulations affect most profoundly. This study analyses the views of fishermen towards management measures with an emphasis on fishing closures (marine protected areas, MPAs). Swedish log-book data from 1996 to 2005 were used to describe MPA induced fishing effort displacements. Fishermen argued that MPAs have been inefficient in conservation of cod stock. The enlargement of Bornholm MPA in 2005 caused substantial effort displacement towards areas dominated by smaller sized fish. This contributed to the increased discarding of juvenile cod. Enlarged MPAs also intensified competition between different fleet segments and reallocated fishing areas. To reduce fishing mortality, fishermen suggested days-at-sea (effort) regulation and an effective landings control system for all fleets that exploit cod stocks in the Baltic Sea Main Basin. These measures would better motivate fishermen for mutual rule compliance, which is a prerequisite for a sustainable cod fishery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reports on the fauna found in/on tubes of 10 species of Ceriantharia and discusses the characteristics of these occurrences, as well as the use of mollusc shells in ceriantharian tube construction. A total of 22 tubes of Ceriantharia from Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Norway, Portugal and the United States were analysed, revealing 58 species of marine invertebrates using them as alternative substrates. Based on a literature review and analyses of the sampled material, we report new occurrences for Photis sarae (Crustacea), Microgaza rotella (Mollusca), Brada sp., Dipolydora spp., Notocirrus spp., and Syllis garciai (Annelida). The use of mollusc shells in tube construction increases the tubes' structural resistance and strength. Ceriantharian tubes are suitable alternative substrates for the dwelling of numerous tubicolous and infaunal species that usually burrow into sediments or anchor on fixed or mobile habitats seeking shelter, thus playing a relevant role as local biodiversity hotspots.

AB  - Bioenergy is one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing sectors of the global energy economy. The use of food crops for conversion to biofuel has been criticized for several reasons, among which its competition with the global food chain. Instead, lignocellulosic substrates are claimed to provide a bioenergy alternative without competing with food demand. This is particularly true when dealing with residues or waste. In this paper, we explored the environmental performance and sustainability of a bioenergy production system that integrates wastewater treatment, willow farming, and a Combined Heat and Power plant (CHP) located in Enkoping (Sweden). Several methodologies for environmental assessment are integrated in this study within a life cycle perspective to investigate material and energy requirements as well as emissions and related impacts of the whole bioenergy production chain. Results show that full integration of different subsystems of a productive network is a desirable option for bioenergy production, within a zero emission oriented production pattern. The investigated wood biomass powered CHP plant was able to co-generate heat and electricity with high production efficiency and much better environmental performance and sustainability than fossil fuel based power plants.

AB  - There is increased commercial interest in the production of lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) as a biological control against sea lice infections in Atlantic salmon farming. To ensure a sustainable supply of lumpfish, reliable captive reproduction is required however, optimal husbandry and conditions for captive broodstock performance remain unknown. Artificial fertilisation of gametes remains the preferred management strategy for lumpfish, but this requires an effective milt management protocol. The present study tested several milt extender solutions for short term cold storage and validated sperm concentration assessment of lumpfish milt. Results demonstrated lumpfish sperm has a long motility survival time (motile for up to 3 h) when compared to other marine teleosts. Importantly, all extenders used in the study were non-activating on dilution of the milt. Lumpfish milt was successfully stored at 4 degrees C in Modified Turbot Extender (MTE), Herring Ringers Solution and Aquaboost SpermCoat (Cryogenetics, Norway) for up to 14 days post stripping. MTE performed more effectively with regards to maintenance of sperm activation time in comparison to the other tested extenders. There was a significant positive correlation between sperm concentration identified through cell counts using a haemocytometer and both packed cell volume (spermatocrit) and measured optical density at 640 nm (r(2) = 97.42 +/- 2.14). This suggests both packed cell volume and spectrophotometric measurements can be effective methods for rapidly assessing sperm concentration in lumpfish. This study validated several options for quantifying sperm concentration and short-term cold storage of lumpfish milt that can be used for hatchery management in lumpfish aquaculture.

AB  - Public procurement is increasingly being recognized as a tool to promote corporate social responsibility and a vehicle to help governments achieve their social development goals. Due to their power to intervene and their reliance on tax money, public sector organizations are focused on expanding the inclusion of social responsibility in their public procurement strategies. At the EU level, there is a strong focus on providing new opportunities for public authorities to promote socially responsible public procurement. Utilizing trans-lation theory and following the travel of ideas framework in a Scandinavian institutionalism approach, this study maps the adoption, development, and implementation of social responsibility in public procurement through the five stages of materialization, categorization, transportation, institutionalization, and re-travel. Qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with public procurement authorities from municipalities, regional councils, and governmental organizations in Sweden. The findings show that the travel of social responsibility policies in public procurement follows a new Scandinavian institutionalism approach that has brought policy makers freedom in prioritizing social issues but leaves them confused about what to prioritize. Furthermore, while the results show a positive relationship in organizations between their size, measured as full-time procurement employees, and their maturity level in terms of social responsibility, this maturity level is not associated with their procurement spending. The study findings have important implications for research on socially responsible public procurement. Additionally, the data collected from public organiza-tions suggest several ways that policy makers can include, promote, and institutionalize social responsibility in their procurement strategies to reduce disparity and improve social welfare.

AB  - On the Tautra Ridge - a 39-100 m deep morainic sill located in the middle of the Trondheimsfjord, Norway - some of the world's shallowest known occurrences of the scleractinian cold-water coral (CWC) Desmophyllum pertusum can be found. The earliest D. pertusum records from the Tautra Ridge date back to the 18th century, and since then, the location has provided easy access to physical coral specimens for numerous scientific studies. In 2013, the ridge was declared a marine protected area by the Norwegian Government due to its unique CWC reefs. However, few attempts have to our knowledge yet been made to characterize the distribution, extent and condition of these reefs extensively. The aim of the current study was therefore to add geospatial context to the Tautra CWC reef complex. In the study, data from multibeam echo sounding, synthetic aperture sonar imaging and underwater hyperspectral imaging are used to assess CWC reef occurrences from multiple perspectives. The study demonstrates how complementary remote sensing techniques can be used to increase knowledge generation during seafloor mapping efforts. Ultimately, predictive modeling based on seafloor geomorphometry is used to estimate both distribution and areal coverage of D. pertusum reefs along the majority of the Tautra Ridge. Our findings suggest that D. pertusum reef distribution on the Tautra Ridge is affected by several geomorphometric seafloor properties, and that the total reef extent in the area likely is close to 0.64 km(2). Better description of current patterns across the Tautra Ridge will improve our understanding of the interaction between hydrography and geomorphology at the Tautra CWC reef complex in the future.

AB  - Introduced species are used more and more for timber production throughout the world. This raises much debate about their impact on natural ecosystems. In Quebec, Canada, similar concerns are expressed regarding Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), which was introduced in the early 1900s and is currently the main non-native conifer used for planting. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the current spread of Norway spruce in Quebec and to assess under which circumstances it can regenerate and become established. We studied Norway spruce regeneration dynamics over 5 years in the understory, edge and surroundings of 10 thinned Norway spruce plantations aged 36 to 65 years. Most Norway spruce regeneration was found in the understory and near the edge of plantations, and beyond the plantation border on a few sites. Norway spruce seedling density was highly variable in the understory and at the plantation edge (0.6-30.7 stems.m(-2) and 0-8.5 stems.m(-2), respectively). Beyond the edge, high densities of Norway spruce regeneration (0.1 to 1.2 seedlings.m(-2 )) were found in 2 recent clearcut areas and in only 2 intolerant hardwood high forests, as far as 28 m from Norway spruce plantations. Overall, Norway spruce regeneration was young (less than 16 years for 98% of seedlings) and relatively slow-growing (on average, 1.1-7.9 cm.year(-1), depending on transect location and height class). Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill), a native species, regenerated well (mean density of 3.1 stems.m(-2)) in the understory and the edge of 5 of the 10 studied plantations. When regeneration of both species was present, mean seedling age, growth and height were similar, but balsam fir had a better survival rate than Norway spruce (84% vs. 65%). These findings suggest that Norway spruce shows a limited invasive capacity, particularly in the closed canopy of natural forests. Moreover, the presence of native balsam fir in the understory of Norway spruce plantations indicates that the successional pathway could move the stand towards a more natural ecosystem. These results can be useful to target surveys of the most sensitive ecosystems and to develop proactive management strategies.

AB  - The core aim of the present study is to examine the psychometric qualities of a measurement instrument for self-assessment of driving ability. The results are based on a self-completion questionnaire survey conducted among a representative sample of Norwegian drivers who were 18, 19 and 20 years of age (n = 1419). The response rate was 37%. The results showed that self-assessment of driving ability consisted of the following four dimensions: general driving ability, safety orientation, the body dimension, and specific task skills. The reliability and validity of the measurement instrument were found to be satisfactory. The highest level of self-assesscd driving ability was found among male respondents, experienced drivers, drivers who had had a high amount of informal driver training, and drivers with the lowest levels of accident risk, The consequences of the results for driver training and accident prevention are discussed.

AB  - A strategy for sustainable stormwater management is needed. This study has focused on the relative importance of stormwater as a pollutant source in a catchbasin, if Best Management Practices (BMPs) result in pollutant removal or pollutant redistribution, and methods for screening of stormwater strategies. Stormwater is most likely an important pathway for pollutants in a catchbasin perspective. True pollutant removal can only be achieved if the pollutant sources are eliminated. Until that is reached, we should have the best possible control of the pollutant fluxes in the watershed. This study indicates that the search for a sustainable stormwater strategy could be easier to handle if different "screens" could be used. The Swedish environmental objectives, which try to encapsulate all aspects of sustainability, may be used as a foundation for a "sustainability screen". By using this screen, the "unsustainable" features of different stormwater strategies could be pointed out. A "standards and legislation screen" will be based on the EU Water Framework Directive. As this study has shown, it is doubtful whether the conventional BMPs, such as stormwater ponds and infiltration facilities, produce a sufficient pollutant control.

AB  - A dynamic coupled biogeochemical ecological model was used to simulate the effects of nitrogen deposition and climate change on plant communities at three forest sites in France. The three sites had different forest covers (sessile oak, Norway spruce and silver fir), three nitrogen loads ranging from relatively low to high, different climatic regions and different soil types.
   Both the availability of vegetation time series and the environmental niches of the understory species allowed to evaluate the model for predicting the composition of the three plant communities. The calibration of the environmental niches was successful, with a model performance consistently reasonably high throughout the three sites.
   The model simulations of two climatic and two deposition scenarios showed that climate change may entirely compromise the eventual recovery from eutrophication of the simulated plant communities in response to the reductions in nitrogen deposition. The interplay between climate and deposition was strongly governed by site characteristics and histories in the long term, while forest management remained the main driver of change in the short term.

AB  - Ski slope construction is one of the major anthropogenic factors responsible for ecosystem degradation in mountain areas in Finnish Lapland. Mt. Yllas has been used as a downhill skiing slope for about 30 years. Until 1992, the ski slopes were kept in their natural condition: there was no removal of vegetation and soil above the tree line. After 1992, Mt. Yllas went through an extensive construction, the ski slopes were machine-graded and machine-levelled, which caused damage to both vegetation and soil. The aim of the study presented here was to examine nutrient status of various soils on the machine-graded and machine-levelled ski slopes in relation to their potential use as a substrate for revegetation practices.
   Soil organic matter and nutrient status were analysed in three sites on the slopes of kit. Yllas in the tree line zone (transit zone between wooded vegetation and treeless alpine vegetation): (1) reference site on the undisturbed area between the ski-runs (Control); (2) disturbed site on the ski-run area (DSP - 'DiSturbed Podzol', DSL - 'DiSturbed Leptosol' and DSB 'DiSturbed Bare soil'); and (3) Revegetation study Plots established on the ski-runs (RP). The analysis of element concentrations and their relative proportions allow us to conclude that only DSP and DSL can be considered as potentially appropriate for unassisted ecosystem recovery on the ski-runs. Presence of native plant species on these patches supports our conclusion. As a recommendation for revegetation of ski-runs, we propose implementation of substrate composed of upper layer of initial soil. Such substrate can be collected during the construction work on ski slopes or on building sites in the area with similar soils. Uncomposted substrate or at least short period of composting is preferable. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the transformative capacity of top-down imposed collaborative institutions on participants' beliefs and coordination patterns. First, do collaborative arenas enhance learning in terms of belief change and belief convergence among participating actors? Second, what types of beliefs are changed and, third, how are changes in beliefs reflected in the formation of coalitions? To answer these questions, a longitudinal study encompassing three collaborative decision-making arenas in the highly adversarial system for wildlife management in Sweden is performed. The empirical analysis indicates both stability and change within the new management system that confirms, as well as challenges, the theoretical assumptions guiding the analysis. While beliefs overall are rather stable, we note, surprisingly, how some participants' more normatively oriented policy core beliefs have been slightly modified over time. A more expected result was that these adjustments in normative policy core beliefs were accompanied by a reformed coalition structure within the studied decision-making arenas. The study contributes to our understandings of policy beliefs and coalitions in conflicted policy areas; it underlines the mixed results of collaborative institutions found in previous research; yet, lends a modest support in favor of the transformative capacity of collaborative institutions.

AB  - The assessment of waste management systems for electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) from developed economies (Germany, Sweden and Italy) and developing countries (Romania and Bulgaria), is discussed covering the period 2007-2014. The WEEE management systems profiles are depicted by indicators correlated to WEEE life cycle stages: collection, transportation and treatment. The sustainability of national WEEE management systems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions is presented, together with the greenhouse gas efficiency indicator that underlines the efficiency of WEEE treatment options. In the countries comparisons, the key elements are: robust versus fragile economies, the overall waste management performance and the existence/development of suitable management practices on WEEE.
   Over the life cycle perspective, developed economies (Germany, Sweden and Italy) manage one order of magnitude higher quantities of WEEE compared to developing countries (Romania and Bulgaria). Although prevention and reduction measures are encouraged, all WEEE quantities were larger in 2013, than in 2007. In 2007-2014, developed economies exceed the annual European collection target of 4 kg WEEE/capita, while collection is still difficult in developing countries. If collection rates are estimated in relationship with products placed on market, than similar values are registered in Sweden and Bulgaria, followed by Germany and Italy and lastly Romania. WEEE transportation shows different patterns among countries, with Italy as the greatest exporter (in 2014), while Sweden treats the WEEE nationally. WEEE reuse is a common practice in Germany, Sweden (from 2009) and Bulgaria (from 2011). By 2014, recycling was the most preferred WEEE treatment option, with the same kind of rates performance, over 80%, irrespective of the country, with efforts in each of the countries in developing special collection points, recycling facilities and support instruments. The national total and the recycling carbon footprints of WEEE are lower in 2013 than in 2007 for each country, the order in reducing the environmental impacts being: Germany, Italy, Sweden, Bulgaria and Romania. The negative values indicate savings in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, the GHG efficiency shows no differences of the WEEE management in the developed and developing countries.

AB  - Nowadays, circular economy (CE) is on the agenda, however, this concept of closed supply chains originated in the 1960s. The current growing quantity of studies in this area accounts for different discourses except the holistic one, which mixes both approaches-contextual and operating (contextual approach utilizes the thorough examination of the CE theory, stricture of the policy, etc.; the operating one uses any kind of statistical data)-to assess the capacity of circular economy regulatory policy packages (CERPP) in operating raw materials and industrial wastes. This article demonstrates new guidelines for assessing the degree level of capacity (DLC) of CERPPs in the operation of raw materials and industrial wastes by utilizing the apparatus of the fuzzy set theory. It scrupulously surveys current CERPPs in three regions: the EU overall, Finland and Russia; and assesses for eight regions-the EU overall, Finland, Russia, China, Greece, France, the Netherlands and South Korea-the DLC of CERPPs in operating raw materials and industrial wastes. The results show that EU is the best in CE policy and its CERPP is 3R. The following are South Korea and China with the same type of CERPP. Finland, France and the Netherlands have worse results than EU with the type of CERPP called "integrated waste management" because of the absence of a waste hierarchy (reduce, recover, recycle). Russia closes the list with the type of CERPP "basic waste management".

AB  - 'Elite communities' are the areas where the wealthy, and even 'superrich', live, socialize and raise their children as future economic and financial elites; they are the places where a few lead socially and economically privileged lives. Earlier studies have concentrated on the inner dynamics of these settings, focusing on the way residents are constructed and socialized as elites through their social, communicative and aesthetic abilities that are perceived as exemplary in contemporary neoliberal society. In this paper, we broaden the perspective, by exploring how these areas contribute to polarization, that is, how they generate distinctions based on money, morals and manners that are peculiar to neoliberalism's idealization of 'entrepreneurship', 'self-management', 'leadership' and the pursuit of an 'active lifestyle'. Our data come from two major ethnographic studies: one conducted between 2010 and 2015 of Sweden's wealthiest community, Djursholm, that is populated by the country's business and financial elites; the other conducted between 2016 and 2019 of three of Australia's most prestigious and economically privileged suburbs, Toorak (Melbourne), Mosman (Sydney) and Cottesloe (Perth).

AB  - Stored-product moths cause large economic damage in food processing industries and storage facilities. Control of indoor pests is currently dealt with locally, and control strategies seldom include different mills or cooperative industries in joint efforts to reduce infestations. In colder climates where conditions hinder flight dispersal of stored-product moths, we hypothesize that human transport between mills will facilitate dispersal. Albeit considered intuitive, this hypothesis has so far never been tested. Male moths from three mills (populations) in southern Sweden and Denmark were collected and by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) pair-wise F (st) values were calculated. Cluster (population) origins of the genotypes were computed by using a model-based method, structure. The results suggest that known transportation of flour between two mills generate genetically more similar populations of the economically important stored-product moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zell.) (Lepidoptera; Pyralidae), compared to the third mill, with another distribution area, but situated geographically in between the other mills. The structure model placed the sampled genotypes to belong to either two or five original populations, with a higher probability of two original populations. The third mill was consistently different from the other two mills independent of the models' calculated number of populations. Although the study was restricted to three mills and one transportation route, it highlights the possibility that transportation of food products promotes genetic mixing (i.e. dispersal) of insect pest populations. Including cooperating mills in control (or monitor) strategy schemes against stored-product pest insects would therefore be a more effective action, rather than to treat each mill separately.

AB  - Sustainable aviation fuels offer the opportunity to reduce the climate impact of air transport while avoiding a complete overhaul of the existing fleet. For Europe, the domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel would even lead to a reduced dependency on energy imports. Biomass-based fuel production in Europe is limited by the availability of sustainable biomass. This limitation can be alleviated by the Power and Biomass to Liquid (PBtL) process, which attains near full biogenic carbon conversion to Fischer-Tropsch fuel by the addition of electrolytic hydrogen. This study evaluates the economic feasibility and environmental impact of the sustainable aviation fuel production from European forest residue based on a region-specific analysis. As of 2020, only a few sweet spots, such as Norway or Sweden, could serve as production sites for sustainable PBtL fuel when the electrical energy for the electrolysis is supplied by the national grid. The grid mix for many other countries is too carbon intensive to justify producing PBtL fuel there. Yet, with the direct usage of renewable electricity sources, a fuel output of 25 Mt a(-1) can be reached assuming 33% of all forest residue can be used for fuel production. Under these conditions, the EU goal of providing 32% of the total aviation fuel demand with sustainable aviation fuel in 2040 could be met.

AB  - Invasive alien species, once introduced, may affect local biodiversity, both directly (e.g. by predation) and indirectly (e.g. by reducing the vegetation cover). Among those, rats (Rodentia, Muridae) are listed among the most invasive species, exerting strong impacts particularly when introduced to island ecosystems. Accordingly, black rats Ranus rattus have been eradicated from a number of islands in the Mediterranean basin to protect breeding seabirds. Where the larger Norway rat Rattus norvegicus is present, extent of damage may be even higher. In our work, we present the results of the first eradication program dealing with Norway rats in a small Mediterranean island (Isola delle Feminine, Sicily, Southern Italy). The eradication took place in 2007-2008 and, since then, no rat has been observed on the island, thus proving the success of the management action. Vegetal cover increased on the island after rat eradication. Furthermore, the Sardinian warbler and the blackbird started to breed on the island.

AB  - Since the announcement of the Icelandic Pledge in June 2017, destinations are increasingly turning to national destination pledges as a possible tool to address negative impacts caused by visitors. This article uses qualitative interviews with 17 stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of the full sample of national destination pledges at the time of the research (namely the Icelandic Pledge, the Palau Pledge, the New Zealand Tiaki Promise and the Sustainable Finland Pledge) as an empirical basis. It explores the catalysts for the development of national destination pledges including undesirable visitor behaviour, increasing visitor numbers and a desire to protect the destination and its people. It then demonstrates how national destination pledges are social marketing initiatives, which employ commercial marketing techniques to positively influence visitor behaviour. By analysing the social marketing strategies used by national destination pledges and linking these strategies to behaviour change literature, this paper demonstrates that pledges' use of peer pressure, emotional engagement of visitors, and positive, targeted messaging are all characteristics that hold potential to influence visitor behaviour.

AB  - This article examines how imaginaries of security in the Anthropocene function at the Svalbard Global Seed Vault (SGSV), otherwise known as the 'Doomsday Vault'. Recent explorations by scholars of security have suggested that different ways of seeing, understanding, acting in, and imagining the world are necessary to adequately respond to complex crises in the Anthropocene. The dissolution of the nature/culture divide and the existential risk from planetary threats are said to require new and creative formations of security. Buried in the Norwegian high Arctic, the heavily fortified SGSV was built in 2008 as a planetary-scale, 'deep-time organisation' that would forever secure a wide variety of plant seeds and their genetic makeup against regional or global upheavals. The article argues that his seed 'ark' materialises three Anthropocene security imaginaries: apocalypse, hope and escape. The prevalence and use of these imaginaries reveal the stability of long-held security logics and challenge the widely-held belief in the innately transformative properties of the Anthropocene concept for security. Instead, the SGSV demonstrates the difficulty in overcoming a collective mindfulness that fixes security to eternal forms even in the midst of unprecedented threats, interventions and technology.

AB  - The implementation of urban sustainability practices is affected by political obstacles, and diverse political ideologies may defend different city models. Sustainable policy design could also be affected by several factors that cause the deflection of resources initially allocated to other groups that are contrary to the concerns pursued and have the power to veto sustainable plans by exerting pressure on the party in power.
   In this sense, the aim of this paper is to show the impact that political factors have on cities' sustainability, and the effect of both on cities' economic development. To do so, we used the 78 Spanish cities with a population over 100,000 studied by MERCO (Spanish Corporate Reputation Monitor) as regards their levels of sustainability for the fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Both relationships have been tested empirically through two dependence models using linear regression techniques.
   The results obtained show that political competition improves cities' sustainability, while a leftist ideology has an inverse impact. On the other hand, a significant direct relationship has been observed between urban sustainability and municipal economic activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the current health condition (defoliation), state of natural regeneration, and mycoflora and phytopathogen-caused attacks in Scots pine forests (Pinus .sylvestris L.) planted in the 1960s in areas affected by wind disturbances in the West Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. Some damage types (resin outflow and anthropogenic damage) were present to a low extent in the research plots (S - Selishte and PK - Pobit Kamak). Some were missing completely (damage by deer and other animals, the presence of lignicolous fungi and abiotic damage). The most important results of this study were the following: i) the occurrence of the bark beetle pest Tomicus minor Hartig (Coleoptera, Scolytinae) was recorded on average in 4.6 (S) and 2.3 (PK) of fallen shoots under the tree crown within 1 m diameter around the stem; ii) significant damage to tree crowns due to the loss of assimilation organs in Scots pine trees (28% - S and 39% - PK, respectively) was several times higher than that recorded in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) (10%); iii) tree species composition resulting from natural regeneration showed 95-100% proportion of Norway spruce despite the predominance of Scots pine in the maternal stand. These observations might provide evidence of unsuitable environmental conditions in the studied localities for pine forests on the southern range of the natural P. sylvestris occurrence. Forest management in similar ecological and climatic conditions should aim at significant diversification of the forest stand structure by utilizing tree species suitable for the given ecosystems.

AB  - Since the eruption of the war in Ukraine in February 2022, both Ukrainian and Russian diasporas in Sweden have been reframing themselves through memories, narratives and symbols. They have been revised in connection to the initial Russian-backed insurgency in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea (2014), the "homeland" as well as previous diasporic mobilizations in the country of residence. Revising the memories, narratives and symbols to fit the new reality of a full-scale war also has meant renegotiating group boundaries in the solidarity with Ukraine movement. In this study, I focus on the collective memory and group boundary-making within the pro-Ukraine movement and demonstrations in Stockholm, Sweden, and investigate the change in solidarity patterns, specifically performed during the initial mobilization due to the annexation of Crimea, Russian-backed insurgency in the eastern Ukraine, and the first months of Russian invasion of Ukraine.

AB  - Climate change and the projected depletion of fossil energy resources pose multiple global challenges. Innovative technologies offer interesting possibilities to achieve more sustainable outcomes in the energy production sector. Local, decentralized alternatives have the potential to sustain livelihoods in rural areas. One example of such a venture has emerged around heating businesses in rural Finland, and is referred to as heat entrepreneurship. Heat entrepreneurship entails a system where a local forest owner, usually a farmer, provides heat to a small community or local building, such as a school. Heat is produced using local forest resources that would otherwise be unutilized. The purpose of this study is to examine heat entrepreneurship as a potential sustainable alternative for energy production and its multifunctionality. The data was collected by interviewing 15 heat entrepreneurs in the area of Central Finland. The study demonstrates how multifunctional farming-related energy production can provide more sustainable livelihoods for farmers by increasing social, economic and environmental sustainability. This is achieved by diversifying farmers' economic options, enhancing rural areas economically, increasing farmers' social networks and well-being and, to some extent, by boosting local environmental capital. However, the study also points to differences among the farmers and sustainability trade-offs, suggesting for the need to better acknowledge the local perceptions in policy-making.

AB  - Marriage records from 1750 through 1949 were used to examine effects of population size, geographic distance, and temporal change on rates of marital exogamy in the Aland Islands, Finland. Exogamy rates for individuals (not couples) were computed for 15 Aland parishes in each of four 50-year time periods, giving a total of 60 observations. These rates were analysed with respect to population size using a quadratic regression model. Regression analyses were also used to examine the relationship of marital exogamy with two measures of geographic distance-average distance to all other parishes and nearest-neighbour distance. Analysis of variance was used to examine temporal trends. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine all of these factors simultaneously. Marital exogamy is highest in smaller and larger populations, and less in medium-sized populations. Higher exogamy rates in small populations are related to the lack of available mates in small groups. Higher exogamy rates in larger populations may reflect economic attraction of larger groups. Exogamy rates are lower in the more geographically isolated parishes. From 1750 through 1899 there is little change in exogamy rates, whereas exogamy rates double after 1900. This temporal change reflects changes in transportation technology and other cultural factors promoting increased migration. The multiple regression model shows population size, geographic distance, and temporal change are all significant correlates of exogamy, collectively explaining a large percentage of variation in rates (R2=0.79).

AB  - Contradictory findings on the relationship between proactive environmental strategy and performance are reported in the existing literature. The way that proactive environmental strategy is defined, the omission of crucial mediating variables and the misfit between strategy and business structures may help explain these conflicting findings. Drawing upon the logic of strategy-action-performance, this study tests the effects of two implementation variables of proactive environmental strategy-green human resource management (GHRM) and environmental legitimacy (EL)-on environmental performance as well as the mediating roles played by the implementation of green operational practices (GOP). Further, based on contingency theory, this study proposes that the impacts of GHRM and EL on the implementation of GOP might be moderated by operational barriers (OR) and managerial barriers (MB). The proposed hypotheses are empirically tested using a dataset of 260 sample plants in 11 countries/regions (Finland, Sweden, Germany, Taiwan, Israel, Mainland China, Spain, Brazil, Italy, South Korea and Japan). The results show that the effect of GHRM on environmental performance is fully mediated by the implementation of GOP (the path coefficient b for the direct link between GHRM and environmental performance changes from 0.436, p < 0.001 to 0.180, p > 0.1). EL has no statistically significant direct or indirect effects on environmental performance (direct effect: b = -0.08, p > 0.1, indirect effect: b = 0.083, p > 0.1) but has a marginally significant effect on the implementation of GOP (b = 0.218, p < 0.1). The results also indicate that OB reduce the effectiveness of EL in facilitating the implementation of GOP (b = -0.103, p < 0.1), and MB reduce the effectiveness of GHRM in supporting the implementation of GOP (b = -0.11, p < 0.1).

AB  - The 7000 years transition from a pristine environment towards a modern city has brought a number of chemical changes and effects to urban lake sediments in Bergen. Metals, such as Pb, Hg, Zn, Cu and Fe, display a large anthropogenic influence and reflect historical point sources that existed within the drainage area from approximately AD 1790 until today. The concentration peaks alternate with intervals of lower concentration due to phases of coarser grained sediment input but also periods of potentially reduced metal influx. All discussed elements, except Cd, increase in concentration with decreasing grain size and also correlate with the amount of clay fraction particles. The results emphasize the importance of considering grain size when interpreting sediment chemistry. Correlation with TOC is not apparent in the same extent. The transition from natural to anthropogenically influenced sediments, which is characterised by a sudden increase of several elements, is accompanied by a reduction in Cd, As and Ni concentration. This is interpreted to be the result of hypoxia, changes in pH and reduced erosional input. Factor analysis and the comparison with reference sediments indicate that the elements Pb, Hg, Zn and Cu most clearly demonstrate man-made pollution. Analyses of stormwater culvert sediments suggest that urban runoff contributes to the pollution load today, with standing building mass and traffic contributing to the load.

AB  - The study is inspired by the change in the risk landscape caused by the development of digitalization and automation in the high-risk industry. The increasing convergence of process-safety, physical security, and cybersecurity risks can lead to major accidents. Integrated management of safety and security (IMSS) is a necessary means of preventing and preparing for accidents. The objective of this paper is to get new insights into the current state of IMSS and related challenges in the nuclear industry. The data includes the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Institute for Nuclear Security (WINS) reports, articles on digitalization, IMSS, and interviews with safety and security experts from two power companies and the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland. The paper compares the results with those in Seveso installations. The methods are thematic and qualitative content analysis. Theoretical framework consists of organizational culture and management perspectives. The paper provides new meanings to the ways in which IMSS is currently implemented. The paper shows the IAEA structural support to IMSS, differences in IMSS implementation in the nuclear industry, and organizational cultural aspects that constrain the IMSS. The latter include the subordination of security to safety, the assumption that organizational culture automatically integrates safety and security, the lack of co-identification and co-assessment of safety and security risks, which prevents a better understanding of systemic risks. The conclusion is that the current state of IMSS is not adequate to address converging, systemic risks, and coordination of safety and security aspects requires more attention.

TI  - Presumptions of culture: Applications and safety implications
T2  - SAFETY AND RELIABILITY: METHODOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS
LA  - English
CP  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE EUROPEAN SAFETY AND RELIABILITY CONFERENCE (ESREL)
AB  - Contemporary safety thinking is saturated with cultural ideas. Culture is presumed important-for safety. Culture has become part of the convention, the normal scientific approach to understand and improve safety. It is part of the standard toolbox in terms of explanatory and interpretive repertoire. But, what is the nature of the culture conceptions? How is culture "applied" in terms of interpretations and explanations? Pursuing such questions, this paper identifies conceptions of culture by conferring source material pertaining to the Norwegian petroleum industry (official documents and an incident investigation reports). The analysis was performed by establishing a set of analytical dimensions or thematic axes: The What, The How, The Where, and The Who of safety culture. The results of these analyses are discussed. The core thesis of this paper is that the premises, presumptions, and implications of a given concept need active consideration. And, in a mode of efficient application, there is a danger of merely pointing towards "culture", and omitting the necessary "detour" of specifying suppositions and implications involved in the given cultural concept. This underscores the need to actively "apply" theory (Storseth and Grotan, 2011). By addressing issues of theoretical underpinnings and presumptions concerning association, function and causality-a needed, additional layer of analysis and learning as application (Baumard, 1999; Storseth and Tinmannsvik, 2013) is forced into consideration, bringing awareness to the "directions" that silently influence interpretive and explanatory efforts to understand and improve safety.

AB  - Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) is a tree species native to Central Europe and occurs in scattered or in small populations mixed with other tree species. Since Norway maple is considered to be adaptable to climate change, it has increasingly become a focus of forestry as one of the so-called alternative tree species to diversify species composition in forests. However, little knowledge exists on the phenotypic variation in the natural range, and no studies on the reproductive behavior of this monoecious and insect-pollinated tree species. The sexual system of Norway maple is known as heterodichogamous, with male-first and female-first flowering individuals mixed in a population. In a first step, we conducted a mating system analysis in a seed orchard. We used a recently developed set of species-specific SSR markers to genotype the parental clones and respective seed samples. The total seed had proportions of 68% outcrossed offspring between clones of the seed orchard, 11% selfing and 20% external pollination. Four flower types were observed, with protogynous and hermaphrodite types contributing more female gametes, while the protandrous type is highly variable in its female or male contributions. The number of ramets per clone in the seed set has a significant impact on the proportion of genetic contribution per clone to total seed yield. Conclusions are drawn for the establishment of new seed orchards and for further research.

AB  - Current ecological frameworks emphasize the relative importance of local and regional drivers for structuring species communities. However, most research has been carried out in systems with discrete habitat boundaries and a clear insular structure. Stream networks deviate from the insular structure and can serve as excellent model systems for studying hierarchical community dynamics over different temporal and spatial extents. We used benthic invertebrate data from streams in a small northern Swedish catchment to test whether metacommunity dynamics change between seasons, across spatial hierarchies (i.e. at the whole catchment scale vs. the scales of first-order and second/third-order sites within the catchment) and between stream-order groups. We assessed metacommunity structure as a function of three relevant dispersal dimensions (directional downstream processes, along-stream dispersal and overland dispersal). These dispersal dimensions were related to species groups with relevant dispersal traits (flying capacity, drift propensity) and dispersal capacities (weak vs. strong) to elucidate whether the observed spatial signals were due to dispersal limitation or mass effects. Results showed complex community organization that varied between seasons, with the scale of observation, and with stream order. The importance of spatial factors and specific dispersal dimensions was highly dependent on the time of sampling and the scale of observation. The importance of environmental factors was more consistent in our analyses, but their effect on species community structure peaked at first-order sites. Our analyses of species dispersal traits were not unequivocal, but indicated that both mass effects and dispersal limitation could simultaneously contribute to the spatial signal at the scale of the whole catchment through different dispersal pathways. We conclude that the study of hierarchically organized ecosystems uncovers complex patterns of metacommunity organization that may deviate substantially from those of systems with insular structure and discrete habitat boundaries. Moreover, we show that dispersal constraints imposed by the dendritic structure of stream networks and distinct dispersal mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation) may be evident also at very small spatial extents. Thus, even at this small scale, a landscape management approach that takes the dendritic nature of stream networks into account is needed to effectively conserve stream biodiversity.

AB  - The Finnish forest industry is committed to applying novel technologies for increasing carbon-neutral development and environmental sustainability in "green" circular industry. This study compares the energy efficiency indicators of road freight transportation. Additionally, effects of four mass limits of vehicle combinations are analyzed after a three-year adaptation process that took place in a wood procurement region of 100% renewable resources. The wood-based energy efficiency model (load's wood energy/fossil transport energy) was the most accurate and precise measure as the development indicator. The indicator showed that the transportation systems (60, 64, 68, and 76 t) and (64, 68, and 76 t) were carbon negative (122, 133, 144, and 108) (142, 147, and 133) in 2014 and 2016, respectively. The numbers reveal positive energy ratio of renewable wood and fossil fuels. In comparison to 60 t, the use of 68 t vehicles increased energy efficiency most effectively in the systems, by 18.0% and 20.5%, respectively. The indicator robustly revealed the energy efficiency of a partial system in the smaller supply region, which depended on the region's transportation conditions. This novel knowledge can be applied for advancing the adaptation toward carbon-neutral supply networks. There is also the development potential of an industrial ecosystem model for optimizing the environmental sustainability of "green" circular industry.

AB  - Simple Summary The control of gastrointestinal parasites in sheep is often based on the integrated use of anthelmintics and pasture management. As problems with resistance to anthelmintics become more common, it is important to consider the timing of treatment. This is because one way to delay selection for anthelmintic resistance is to take into account that there are susceptible parasites in refugia that are not selected for treatment. In Sweden, stabled ewes are sometimes treated before being let out to pasture with their lambs in the spring. It is thought that this may increase selection for resistance. However, unlike in many other parts of the world, in Sweden, treatment is usually motivated by large numbers of worm eggs detected in faecal samples. In this review, we discuss whether the Swedish model is a risky strategy. In doing so, we consider the experience from several studies conducted in Sweden and abroad. We conclude that the evidence is inconclusive. Moreover, there are gaps in our knowledge, not least regarding the genetic background of resistance formation and how this is influenced by refugia. Further fundamental work is therefore needed on this topic. Gastrointestinal nematodes in grazing livestock are ubiquitous and can cause severe damage, leading to substantial losses in agricultural yields. It is undeniable that the integrated use of anthelmintics is often an essential component of successful intensive livestock management. However, anthelmintic resistance has been a major challenge for several decades, especially in pasture-based lamb production. Measures are therefore needed to reduce the risk and prevent further spread. In many countries with more extensive lamb production and pronounced resistance problems than in Sweden, the importance of keeping parasites in refugia is emphasised. To ensure that treatment is necessary, the Swedish model is based on deworming certain groups of ewes based on the parasitological results of a faecal examination and then releasing them with their lambs to safe pastures. This is intended to reduce the risk of infection, which ultimately reduces the number of subsequent treatments. Whether this preventive strategy in turn means an increased risk of resistance is debatable. In this review, we explain the importance of parasites in refugia and how they can help delay the development of resistance to anthelmintics. We also discuss how likely it is that our model contributes to an increase in resistance risk and whether there is reason to question whether it is a sustainable strategy in the long term.

AB  - This paper develops a model based on the concept of Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) that is useful for ex-ante analyses of how policy measures affect commercial fisheries. PMP models are frequently used in agriculture, but rarely for analyzing fisheries. Fisheries often face a large set of constraints such as effort regulations and catch quotas of which some might be binding and others not. An econometric approach is developed for calibrating models with both binding and non-binding constraints. The interaction between seals and Swedish fisheries is used as an empirical application. Seal interaction is modeled as seals predating fish from passive gear (nets and hooks), which is primarily an issue for the coastal fishery. The model contains 24 fleet segments involved in 247 different fishing activities in 2012. The results show that if no further management action is taken, fisheries using passive gear will reduce their activities from about 46 000 days at sea per year to about 41 000 and reducing their economic performance from losses of about 2 million Euros to about 3.3 million. The impact from seals can be reduced by reducing the seal population or providing economic compensation.

AB  - Silver is one of the most toxic elements for the marine microbial and invertebrate community. However, little is known about the distribution and behaviour of dissolved silver in marine systems. This paper reports data on dissolved and sediment-associated silver in European estuaries and coastal waters which have been impacted to different extents by past and present anthropogenic inputs. This is the first extended dataset for dissolved silver in European marine waters. Lowest dissolved silver concentrations were observed in the Gullmar Fjord, Sweden (8.9 +/- 2.9 pM; x +/- 1 sigma), the Tamar Estuary, UK (9.7 +/- 6.2 pM), the Fal Estuary, UK (20.6 +/- 8.3 pM), and the Adriatic Sea (21.2 +/- 6.8 pM). Enhanced silver concentrations were observed in Atlantic coastal waters receiving untreated sewage effluent from the city of A Coruna, Spain (243 +/- 195 pM), and in the mine-impacted Restronguet Creek, UK (91 +/- 71 pM). Anthropogenic wastewater inputs were a source of dissolved silver in the regions studied, with the exception of the Gullmar Fjord. Remobilisation of dissolved silver from historically contaminated sediments, resulting from acid mine drainage or sewage inputs, provided an additional source of dissolved silver to the estuaries. The ranges in the log particle-water partition coefficient (K-d) values of 5-6 were similar for the Tamar and Mero estuaries and agreed with reported values for other estuaries. These high K-d values indicate the particle reactive nature of silver with oxic sediments. In contrast, low K-d values (1.4-2.7) were observed in the Fal system, which may have been due to enhanced benthic inputs of dissolved silver coupled to limited scavenging of silver on to sediments rich in Fe oxide.

AB  - Fragmentation of social service and healthcare services has been given attention in many countries and a variety of strategies and models are used in attempts to remedy the problem. In a parallel development, demands have been made that users/patients should have more influence over their own care, and research has shown that user involvement can support the recovery process. This article focuses on how professionals view user involvement in collaborative efforts in care planning, using the Coordinated Individual Plan (CIP) in Sweden as an example. Since 2009, social service and healthcare agencies are required to draw up CIPs when they are judged to be needed, with the purpose of improving the care process. An additional purpose is to increase users' involvement in their own care. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2019 with 20 professionals working within social service and healthcare agencies for people with mental health and/or substance abuse problems in the Stockholm region. Analysis was by qualitative content analysis. Findings show that professionals study experience ambivalence concerning user involvement in care planning. On the one hand, they support the user ' s own demands of services and, on the other hand, they correct the user ' s demands to fit the range of services and organisation of care. The user/patient's position is expressed as vulnerable, caught between caregivers who often safeguard their organisational duties and economical restrictions. These findings reflect the conflict predicted by Lipsky's theory of street-level bureaucracy. Professionals are expected to act as advocates for the user/patient, while at the same time exercising a controlling and gatekeeping function. The question is raised whether a model such as CIP provides sufficiently for factors which can counterbalance the power of the professionals relative to the user/patient in care planning.

AB  - Invasive species have already reduced biodiversity, damaged the environment, threatened human health, and created economic losses worldwide. Alaska, by contrast, had relatively few invasive species for most of the 20th century. But increased population and development in recent years have brought an influx of non-native species. However, the problem remains in its infancy, and Alaska still has the opportunity to take advantage of cost-effective management, given appropriate coordination among government agencies and private groups. To help improve such coordination and increase public understanding about this issue, the authors collected data on spending to manage invasive species in Alaska between 2007 and 2011: Such spending increased from $4.7 million in 2007 to $6.9 million in 2010, and it totaled $29 million over the entire study period. Federal agencies paid 84% of that total, non-profits paid 9%, the State of Alaska paid 5%, local governments paid 2%, and private donors paid less than 1%. Most spending (79%) targeted invasive terrestrial plants and animals, but spending for invasive marine and freshwater organisms increased over the period. The largest individual expenses were for eradicating Norway rats that were killing bird populations on an Aleutian island ($5 million), northern pike that were eating juvenile salmon in lakes of Southcentral Alaska ($2.7 million), and European rabbits that were destroying bird habitat in southwestern Alaska ($0.8 million). Overall, research accounted for 24%, monitoring for 20%, eradication for 20%, administration and planning for 11%, and other spending for 25% of total expenditures. The number of jobs in managing invasive species increased over the study period, as did volunteer efforts, which may suggest increasing public awareness about this issue in Alaska.

AB  - Fishing regulations such as harvest restrictions are implemented to limit the exploitation of many fish stocks and ensure the sustainability of fisheries. In Norway, inland recreational fisheries are co-managed by the government and by local riparian rights holders, meaning that Atlantic salmon Salmo salar harvest restrictions differ somewhat among rivers. Data from Norwegian rivers from 2009 to 2013 were used to test for variation in the proportion of salmon released by anglers and the relative size of salmon harvested and released by anglers in rivers that had varying harvest restrictions in terms of quotas, size restrictions, and/or female harvest restrictions. The proportion of the catch released by anglers was higher in rivers where there were harvest restrictions (proportion released = 0.09-0.24) than in rivers with no such restrictions (proportion released = 0.01). On average, salmon released in rivers with size restrictions larger (average mass difference between harvested and released salmon = -1.25 kg) than those released in rivers without harvest restrictions (difference = 0.60 kg). The proportion of the catch released was larger in rivers with seasonal quotas (0.29) than in rivers with daily (0.07) or collective (i.e. total catch for the river; 0.06) quotas. Rivers with low daily (one salmon per angler per day) or seasonal (<5 salmon per angler per year) quotas had a larger proportion of salmon released (0.23, 0.38, respectively) than rivers with moderate (0.10, 0.21) or high (0.07, 0.16) quotas. High seasonal quotas resulted in larger individuals harvested than released (difference = 1.16 kg), on average, compared to moderate (1.22 kg) and high seasonal quotas (-0.30 kg). We conclude that harvest restrictions influenced the extent to which fish were released and thus the stock composition (i.e. size distribution) escaping the recreational fishery with the potential to spawn.

AB  - Few studies address food preference of geese on agricultural land (utilization related to availability) and only a handful so for the breeding season. We studied Greylag geese Anser anser during the breeding season in an intensively farmed area in southern Sweden. Few of 22 available field types were truly preferred. Pastureland was the most consistently preferred, by goslings (with parents) as well as by non-breeders. In some sampling periods, goslings also preferred grazed hay, ley, and carrot fields. Non-breeders exploited a greater variety of crops/fields, feeding also on barley, fallow, grazed hay, lettuce, oats, potatoes, and carrots. Most of these crops were preferred on at least one sampling occasion, except for fallow, grazed hay, and wheat, which were always used less than expected from availability. GLMs revealed that goslings rested more than they fed and preferred shorter vegetation before higher. Moreover, goslings occurred in higher densities in younger age classes than in older and preferred nearshore areas. In contrast, density of non-breeders was only related to field type and sampling occasion (higher densities as the season progressed). The maximum number of broods observed (106) implies a breeding success of 34% based on 311 active nests earlier in the season. Brood size decreased from 3.5 to 2.1 during the study period. Our study shows that goose management during the breeding season should consider goslings and their parents separately from non-breeders, and it implies little potential conflict between Greylag geese and agriculture during the breeding period.

AB  - The role of seafood in supporting transitions towards more sustainable and healthier diets is often overlooked. Oysters, for example, are a nutrient dense aquatic food whose production requires no feed, freshwater, or land use. However, oyster consumption in Sweden is limited, possibly in part due to being traditionally served raw. This study investigated consumer acceptance of oysters when cooked and prepared to resemble familiar foods and examined whether food neophobia (FN) was related to liking. Four oyster-based samples (raw oyster, oyster crepe, oyster burger, and oyster soup) were evaluated in an ecologically valid setting. Participants (N=102; convenience sampling) rated the samples in terms of hedonics (expected liking and liking after tasting), described which aspects of the samples were liked/disliked, and reported the contexts in which oyster consumption is perceived as appropriate. The findings suggest that FN was negatively associated with expected liking of raw oysters, but not with expected liking for cooked oyster-based products that were cooked to resemble familiar foods. On the other hand, familiarity with oysters was positively associated with expected liking of raw oysters. This suggests that expanding oyster preparations beyond its traditional raw format could be a valuable strategy to promote oyster consumption in Sweden.

AB  - In the eastern Gulf of Finland, European smelt Osmerus eperlanus occurs as an anadromous ecological form that spawns in coastal, low-salinity zones and in several rivers entering the gulf, most importantly in the River Neva. Osmerus eperlanus is a key commercial fish species for the population of St. Petersburg, and the city's fish symbol. However, the state of the smelt stock has considerably deteriorated over the past few decades. Monitoring shows that annual catches during 1965-1992 averaged 2274 t, compared to 292 t in 2002-2017, although some improvement is inidicated by a gradual increase in catches in recent years (e.g., to 595 t in 2017). This paper addresses long-term and recent changes in the fisheries for smelt in the eastern Gulf of Finland, including both commercial and recreational fisheries, and the range of fishing gears used. The commercial smelt fishery is mainly conducted during the spawning period (April-May) on migrating fish, using trap nets of various designs and beach seines. There has been an increase in recreational fisheries for smelt; in years when ice cover on the gulf during winter (December-April) is steady, recreational fishers from St. Petersburg, using hook and line, may catch quantities that are comparable to those of commercial catches. Several factors may account for the stock dynamics and associated changes in catches of smelt: these include a decrease in prey availability in the gulf; loss and degradation of spawning and nursery habitats, partly associated with large-scale hydroengineering operations in Neva Bay; and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing which became widespread in post-Soviet decades. In spite of a gradual increase in smelt abundance in the most recent 15 years, a failure to accurately monitor and manage the extent of IUU and recreational fishing for smelt, to assess the status of the stock, or to forecast catches, increases the risk of overfishing of the spawning stock.

AB  - The paper proposes that landscape quality assessment may be approached on the basis of two contrasting paradigms, one which regards quality as inherent in the physical landscape, and the other which regards quality as a product of the mind - eye of the beholder. These are termed, respectively, the objectivist and subjectivist paradigms. These paradigms underlie the surveys of the physical landscape and studies of observer preferences.
   Examination of these paradigms through the approaches taken by philosophers from Plate to modern times demonstrates the ubiquity of the paradigms in underlying human perception of landscape. Until recent centuries, the objectivist paradigm provided philosophers with the basis for understanding beauty, including landscape beauty. However, the philosophers Locke, Hume, Burke and particularly Immanuel Kant identified beauty as lying in the eyes of the beholder rather than in the object. The parallels between Kant's aesthetic philosophy and contemporary theories of landscape quality based on an evolutionary perspective are examined. Most philosophers over recent centuries have adopted the subjectivist view of aesthetics.
   The paper concludes by proposing that only the subjectivist model should be used in research of landscape quality. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stream restoration usually relies on ecological theories presuming that increased habitat heterogeneity leads to higher biodiversity. However, to test this hypothesis a quantitative metric of overall geomorphic complexity is needed. We quantified geomorphic complexity using 29 metrics over five dimensions (sediment distribution, longitudinal profile, cross section, planform, and instream wood) of headwater streams in northern Sweden. We examined reaches with four different restoration statuses after a century of timber floating (channelized, restored, demonstration restored, and unimpacted) to determine (1) whether restoration increases complexity in all dimensions, (2) whether a complexity gradient can be quantified and which metrics can serve as proxies for the gradient, and (3) levels of potential complexity based on large-scale controls (drainage area, glacial legacy sediment, valley slope, valley confinement old-growth forest/buffer zone, and beaver activity). We found a significantly higher complexity in unimpacted and demonstration restoration sites than in channelized sites in all five dimensions except the cross section (based on the two metrics quantifying variability in the cross section). Multivariate analyses were able to elucidate an apparent complexity gradient driven by three complexity metrics: longitudinal roughness, sediment sorting, and cross section chain and tape ratio. The large-scale factors of valley and channel gradient as well as median grain size, along with restoration status, drive differences in complexity composition. Restoring a reach to its potential complexity is beneficial in regions without reference systems or sufficient data to model flow and sediment processes. Unimpacted and demonstration restoration reaches displayed not only more intrareach variability than channelized reaches but also greater interreach heterogeneity in complexity composition, which supports a focus on reach-scale controls on potential complexity and a landscape-scale view on restoration.

AB  - A growing need for food is causing increased interest for seaweed farming globally. This requires the knowledge of the industry's effects on the marine environment. We therefore aimed to explore the communities hosted by a kelp farm compared to that of wild kelp forests. The study was performed in mid-western Norway. Kelp associated fauna were collected from farmed kelp (Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta), in wild kelp forests (S. latissima, A. esculenta, and Laminaria hyperborea), and from fauna traps in the water column. The study showed that the kelp farm had lower taxa abundance and richness and a lower biodiversity than the wild kelp forests. Nonetheless, the farmed kelp hosted many associated species, with communities different from what was found on ropes without kelp (i.e., in the water column). The fauna communities among the farmed kelp were more similar to what was found in the wild L. hyperborea kelp forest than to its wild counterparts. The difference between the fauna communities of 'old' and 'young' farmed kelp (grown for 3 and 7 months, respectively) was not significant, but the fauna was dominated by the isopod species Idotea pelagica in the young forest and by amphipods, mainly belonging to the genus Caprella, in the older. The study contributes to our knowledge of kelp farms' ecological role in the marine environment, which is of importance for today's management as well as for ensuring a sustainable future development of the kelp farming industry.

AB  - Norway spruce is one of the most common and economically most important tree species in Northern and Central Europe. Its area has expanded far beyond the limits of its natural range. Causes and consequences of this expansion are described. Changes in climatic conditions such as changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme warm. and dry weather conditions, increased atmospheric depositions and elevated CO2 are discussed as possible causes for changing growth rates and mortality. Consequences of increased average stand volume and age, as well as stand mixture on forest productivity and stability, are considered.
   In order to reduce ecological and economic risks on a European scale, it is of great importance to know on which sites Norway spruce stands are most susceptible to climatic fluctuations and other environmental changes. Knowledge about the economic demands of tree species as well as knowledge about the changing needs of society are important for sustainable forest ecosystem management.

AB  - Arctic coastal populations share a close relationship with their environment consisting of linkages among communities, landscapes and seascapes, and the social institutions developed to sustain the system. This cultural-biogeophysical dynamic is termed throughout the section as a social-ecological system (SES). Marine mammals constitute a large portion of the subsistence diet for these communities, and as such represent key ecological services provided by the system. At the same time, marine mammals have gained iconic status as symbols for climate change in the North. A tension results between the demands of balancing on one hand good policy optics consistent with national and international norms and, on the other hand, flexible and adaptive institutions able to take on the task of managing resources in a dynamic, changing North. This tension and associated policy solutions such as co-management are explored in a series of papers focusing on marine mammal management dilemmas and policy practices around the circumpolar North. This introduction communicates the problem context and describes the five papers making up this special section. A guiding premise to this work is that new international pressures to implement moratoria on marine mammal hunting in the North ignore critical human dimensions of marine mammal management. Such policy proposals are unlikely to succeed in areas that require collaboration across scales. Simultaneously, new local-scale participation in multi-level management regimes holds promise for creating more resilient marine mammal SESs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Svalbard Archipelago, Norway, is warming rapidly, resulting in environmental change that is likely already affecting the underwater soundscape, a critical habitat feature for marine mammals. Baseline information about current sound levels is needed to monitor future changes. Fixed-location recorders were used in this study to characterize the soundscape and study the occurrence and phenology of marine mammals at two locations within Svalbard. Kongsfjorden (2017-2018), on the west coast, has already undergone vast environmental change, whereas M2 (2019-2020), on the east coast, remains more Arctic. The results of the study reveal that the soundscapes and species assemblages differed markedly west vs east. In the west, Arctic species were detected from winter to summer and migrant marine mammal species were detected occasionally through the autumn. In the east, Arctic species were detected constantly on an almost year-round basis, and a few migrant species were detected during summer. Vessels were detected more often in the west than in the east, in accordance with AIS traffic data that indicated more boat traffic in Kongsfjorden in the west than in the east of the archipelago. In terms of soundscapes, geophonies (wind, ice) were the main factors determining the sound energy at both locations. Kongsfjorden's soundscape was characterized by glacier-melt sounds with moderate levels of anthropogenic noise and some biophonies (marine mammals). At M2, sea-ice noises shaped the soundscape, which was otherwise dominated by biophonies from Arctic marine mammals. At the east coast site there was little impact from anthropophonies (vessels). This study provides information on Svalbard's current underwater soundscape, which is likely to be transformed in the future due to ongoing climate change, with the west coast reflecting future conditions in many Arctic regions if ship-traffic is not regulated.

AB  - Maintaining sufficient soil phosphorus (P) levels for non-limiting crop growth is challenging in organic systems since off-farm inputs of P are restricted. This study assessed the status of P on organic farms in Europe using soil test results for extractable P. Data was obtained from published literature, unpublished theses, and various national and regional databases of soil test values. Most of the data (15,506 observations) came from field scale soil tests, but in some cases (1272 observations) values had been averaged across a farm. Farm scale and field scale data were analysed separately and the impact of farm type (arable, dairy, grassland, horticulture, mixed, poultry, unknown) was assessed. Soil test results were assigned to P classes from very low (P class 1) to very high (P class 5). The farm scale data came primarily from Norway, Sweden and Switzerland and did not indicate deficiencies in extractable P; 93% of farms fell into class 3 or above. The majority of the field scale data came from Germany and indicated sufficient or higher levels of P availability for arable and grassland systems on 60% of fields; the remaining fields had low or very low available P. Adaptations in organic systems may improve P uptake and utilization efficiency allowing yields to be maintained in the short-term, nevertheless there is cause for concern about the long-term P sustainability of some organic farming systems in Europe. This highlights the need to reassess allowable P inputs in organic farming systems to improve overall sustainability.

AB  - QuestionWhat is the impact of the fire cues smoke and ash on seed germination of important functional groups in the heathland system, namely ericads, herbs and graminoids? We predict that if germination from heathland seed banks is in part regulated by fire cues, there should be stronger responses to fire cue treatments in seed bank samples taken from heath that has not been recently burned in comparison with samples taken from newly burned heath, where seed banks have been exposed to the same cues in situ.
   LocationLygra, Lindas commune, western Norway.
   MethodsThe efficacy of smoke, charred wood, ash and heat in promoting germination has been documented in a wide range of species and systems, but relatively little work has been done on fire-related cues in northern European heathlands under anthropogenic fire regimes. We studied fire experimentally by testing the effects of aqueous smoke solution, ash and a combination of the two treatments, on the germination of graminoids, herbs and ericads. A greenhouse germination trial compared seed banks from old heath (28yr since the last fire) with seed banks from newly burned heath (burned the previous year), where we expected that fire-cued germination had already occurred.
   ResultsWe found that both ericads and graminoids responded to fire cues, whereas herbs did not. In line with our predictions, responses were stronger in the old heath than in the young heath. Further, the smoke treatment is a more effective cue than ash across all functional groups.
   ConclusionsThe prevalence of positive fire cue responses across functional groups underscores the importance of fire in the ecology of these heathlands, and hence of burning as a central tool for their management. The finding that the germination response is stronger in naive seed banks than in seed banks that have already been exposed to recent fire cues through in situ fires further supports the role of fire in the successional dynamics of these heathlands.

AB  - Lund University, Sweden, is developing a video analysis system for making long-term behavioural studies, primarily in complex urban environments. Road users are detected using the KLT (Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi) interest point tracker. Trajectories are estimated using foreground-background segmentation, whereas speed is estimated using the shape analysis of interest points. The extracted trajectories are further used for behavioural analysis. The authors present the experience from an ongoing study in Stockholm city, where the task was to find out if allowing two-way bicycle traffic on one-way streets had negative effects on safety. The video analysis system was applied to detect biking in the 'wrong' direction and analyse traffic conflicts between cyclists and other road users. The manual observations done in parallel allowed validating the accuracy of system performance.

AB  - The optimal size of nature reserves has been debated for some time. Although edge and core habitats are often recognized, it is commonly assumed in theory and in studies of a particular habitat type that reserves or patches of different sizes have similar habitat structure. However, for older, highly fragmented landscapes it has been suggested that small areas are of conservation interest as high-quality remnants, whereas large areas are more degraded. We studied 49 randomly selected forest reserves in the size range 5-230 ha (typical for many highly fragmented landscapes) and 3653 sites of key habitat (unprotected deciduous broadleaf forest). Structures in forest that are generally correlated with value for biodiversity were measured, and reserve objectives were examined from declaration texts. Both the density of large trees and the density of dead wood (snags, logs) decreased with increasing reserve size. The mean size of identified key habitats was very small (1.6 ha). A botanical objective for establishment of reserves was more frequently used for smaller reserves. In contrast, cultural and especially recreational objectives were more commonly used when larger reserves were established, suggesting higher values for recreation in these reserves. For vascular plants, birds and beetles, a literature review indicated that small forest patches do not contain impoverished communities, but are often rich (per unit of area). Small reserves and key habitats have several disadvantages, but they are probably important components of reserve networks for biodiversity in highly fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The primary aim of the study was to estimate the spatial scale of pollen dispersal and deposition for pollen assemblages from moss polsters in the cultivated landscape of southern Sweden, as a mean to improve future studies of the pollen/vegetation relationship in the region, and interpretation of fossil pollen data in terms of past cultural landscapes. This can be done by estimating the 'relevant source area of pollen' (RSAP) defined as the area around the pollen sampling point beyond which the pollen-vegetation relationship does not improve. Forty-two sites from nonfertilized grasslands in the traditional open agricultural (Open Region) and semi-open forested (Semi-Open Region) regions of southern Sweden were selected. The vegetation survey was performed within a 1500 m radius area around the moss polsters sampling area. The extended R-value (ERV) model was used to evaluate the pollen-plant abundance relationship. The RSAP for moss polsters in the Open Region was estimated to c. 400 m from empirical data. In the Semi-Open Region, however, the likelihood function score, an indicator of the goodness-of-fit of the data to the ERV model, showed an unexpected pattern of change, making it difficult to evaluate the RSAP. Simulations using hypothetical landscapes suggest that systematic selection of sampling sites could cause this pattern. Simulations also demonstrate that the size of vegetation patches affect the RSAP, i.e., the larger the vegetation patches are, the larger the RSAP becomes. Similar RSAP for the Open and Semi-Open Regions is obtained in simulations using the same patch size, and random selection. In the actual vegetation, patch size is comparable in the two regions, which would suggest that the RSAP for moss polsters in the Semi-Open Region is c. 400 m as well.

AB  - Lotic invertebrate distribution patterns are governed by factors acting at scales ranging from regional or catchment-wide processes to characteristics of individual local patches (MALMQVIST 2002). Benthic assemblages in intermittent streams are subject to further constraints through the recurrent dry phase of their habitats (BOULTON & LAKE 1990). As macroinvertebrates are involved in various processes in stream ecosystems (WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996), their distribution patterns may affect ecosystem functions. Decomposition of organic matter is a crucial ecosystem process, recycling nutrients and supporting detrital based food webs. The significance of fragmentation of coarse organic matter by the functional feeding group shredders is well recognized (ANDERSON & SEDELL 1979, WALLACE & WEBSTER 1996, GRACA 2001). The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of shredders in 3 intermittent streams. We hypothesized that shredder diversity and abundance would be highest at sites with (1) a shorter duration of summer drought, and (2) forest riparian vegetation; and that (3) recovery of shredders after summer drought would be slower at sites with longer dry phase.

AB  - Background: Urban air pollution can trigger asthma symptoms in children, but there is conflicting evidence on effects of long-term exposure on lung function, onset of airway disease and allergic sensitization.
   Methods: The spatial distribution of nitrogen oxides from traffic (traffic-NOx) and inhalable particulate matter from traffic (traffic-PM10) in the study area was assessed with emission databases and dispersion modeling. Estimated levels were used to assign first-year exposure levels for children in a prospective birth cohort (n = 4089), by linking to geocoded home addresses. Parents in 4 Swedish municipalities provided questionnaire data on symptoms and exposures when the children were 2 months and 1, 2, and 4-year-old. At 4 years, 73% of the children underwent clinical examination including peak expiratory flow and specific IgE measurements.
   Results: Exposure to air pollution from traffic during the first year of life was associated with an excess risk of persistent wheezing (odds ratio [OR] for 44 mu g/m(3) [5th-95th percentile] difference in traffic-NO, = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 1.09-2.36). Similar results were found for sensitization (measured as specific IgE) to inhalant allergens, especially pollen (OR for traffic-NO, = 1.67; 95% CI = 1.10-2.53), at the age of 4 years. Traffic-related air pollution exposure during the first year of life was also associated with lower lung function at 4 years of age. Results were similar using traffic-NOx and traffic-PM10 as indicators.
   Conclusions: Exposure to moderate levels of locally emitted air pollution from traffic early in life appears to influence the development of airway disease and sensitization in preschool children.

AB  - Aim The dominant role of Tilia in primeval forests of Scandinavia has long been recognized, but the timing and mechanisms for its decline have not been completely unravelled. A particular uncertainty involves the balance between climate and human activities as the drivers of the change. One reason for the uncertainty is the challenge in evaluating the past cover of the genus owing to its poorly dispersed pollen; another is that a multi-site study would be required to trace subregional differences. To overcome these obstacles, we here apply two different analytical methods to pollen data from 42 sites in two distinct vegetation zones of Sweden.
   Location Temperate and hemi-boreal vegetation zones of southern Sweden.
   Methods Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were used to model the development of Tilia and cereal pollen percentages over time. Twelve sites were used for reconstruction of local cover of Tilia using the landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA).
   Results Before 4000 cal. Bp the Tilia mean pollen percentages were similar in the two vegetation zones. Thereafter, values in the hemi-boreal zone declined, with less Tilia since around 3000 cal. Bp. In contrast, Tilia did not decrease in the temperate zone until this past millennium. The LRA application revealed that in some forests a large cover of Tilia remained considerably longer than has traditionally been estimated by pollen percentages alone.
   Main conclusions By using a large coherent dataset we found significant differences in how the abundance and distribution of Tilia changed through time between two adjacent vegetation zones. We interpret the initial decline in the northern hemi-boreal zone to be driven by cooling climate, and the later decline in the southern temperate zone to be driven more by human land-use.

AB  - Development of major shopping centres continues even though online shopping is increasing. This has implications for mode and destination choice for shopping travel and therefore also for sustainability, which need to be considered in planning policy. In this paper, we estimate models for shopping travel using an unusually rich data set of shopping attractions. We find that shopping travel is best represented in three separate models: consumables in short and long activity segments and durables. In all of these models, we show that representing nearby attractions outside the destination zone adds to the measured attraction. For long activity consumables and for durables, the addition of secondary attractions within 2 km of the main destination gives the best models. For short activity consumables, both 2 km and 5 km add to the model, but 5 km is slightly better. Furthermore, we find significant within-zone correlation in the consumables models but are unable to find significant between zone correlation, indicating that zone boundaries have some behavioural meaning for shopping travellers, but larger areas are not viewed in this way. Shopping attractions with a specifically Swedish impact, Systembolaget (official alcohol outlet in Sweden) and IKEA, proved to be important in all the models. These attractors work better as part of the size than as part of the utility, indicating that they appear to be separate attractors of trips, rather than as adding to the utility of other attractors. The models are also applied in two policy scenario analyses in which the impacts of new IKEA establishments and availability of Systembolaget in all zones on destination and mode choice are assessed.

AB  - Considering the changing climatic conditions, the Czech and Slovakian vegetation has been vertically divided into Forest Vegetation Zones (FVZs) units. Each FVZ is represented by a specific tree species, i.e., the oaks (Quercus sp.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and dwarf pine (Pinus mugo Turra). The FVZ concept has been applied in the Czechoslovakian forestry classification practice since the 1950s. Due to the broad time span of the studied topic, this article is divided into five chapters regarding the evolution of the FVZ concept. Its currently applied form was established primarily in the 1970s on the grounds of data gathered during two decades of forest typology research. An FVZ unit has become an upper unit of the Czech Forest Ecosystem Classification since its legislative codification in the Forest Act (289/1995) in 1995. To this day, however, the FVZ concept has not been reassessed by advanced, multi-dimensional statistical methods. This paper aims to describe key moments of the development of this concept and provide a perspective on its limitations, also in connection with current trends in ecological research. This review aims to provide a better understanding of the forest vegetation-environment relationship in the Czech Republic in relation to climate change, indirect anthropogenic environmental impact, and prediction of forest and landscape ecosystems response.

AB  - Background Surface raw water used as a source for drinking water production is a critical resource, sensitive to contamination. We conducted a study on Swedish raw water sources, aiming to identify mutually co-occurring metacommunities of bacteria, and environmental factors driving such patterns. Methods The water sources were different regarding nutrient composition, water quality, and climate characteristics, and displayed various degrees of anthropogenic impact. Water inlet samples were collected at six drinking water treatment plants over 3 years, totaling 230 samples. The bacterial communities of DNA sequenced samples (n = 175), obtained by 16S metabarcoding, were analyzed using a joint model for taxa abundance. Results Two major groups of well-defined metacommunities of microorganisms were identified, in addition to a third, less distinct, and taxonomically more diverse group. These three metacommunities showed various associations to the measured environmental data. Predictions for the well-defined metacommunities revealed differing sets of favored metabolic pathways and life strategies. In one community, taxa with methanogenic metabolism were common, while a second community was dominated by taxa with carbohydrate and lipid-focused metabolism. Conclusion The identification of ubiquitous persistent co-occurring bacterial metacommunities in freshwater habitats could potentially facilitate microbial source tracking analysis of contamination issues in freshwater sources.

AB  - Predation rates on artificial wader nests, solitary curlew (Numenius arquata) and lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) nests and lapwing nests in colonies were studied on a farmland site in central Sweden. Predation rates were highest on artificial wader nests, intermediate on solitary curlew and lapwing nests and lowest on lapwing nests in colonies, probably because of active defence of adults at real nests and/or because of selection of nest sites with lower predation risk by breeding birds, A comparison of nests close to (less than or equal to 50 m) and far away from (greater than or equal to 200 m) forest edges revealed no increased predation risk close to edges for any of the studied nest types. Predation risk changed during the season for artificial nests (highest: in the middle of May), while predation rates on lapwing and curlew nests were more stable. Artificial nests seem to be inappropriate for measuring actual predation rates and temporal differences in predation rates on real nests, but they might be suitable for use as an index of spatial differences.

AB  - Projecting changes in forest productivity in Europe is crucial for adapting forest management to changing environmental conditions.
   The objective of this paper is to project forest productivity changes under different climate change scenarios at a large number of sites in Europe with a stand-scale process-based model.
   We applied the process-based forest growth model 4C at 132 typical forest sites of important European tree species in ten environmental zones using climate change scenarios from three different climate models and two different assumptions about CO2 effects on productivity.
   This paper shows that future forest productivity will be affected by climate change and that these effects depend strongly on the climate scenario used and the persistence of CO2 effects. We find that productivity increases in Northern Europe, increases or decreases in Central Europe, and decreases in Southern Europe. This geographical pattern is mirrored by the responses of the individual tree species. The productivity of Scots pine and Norway spruce, mostly located in central and northern Europe, increases while the productivity of Common beech and oak in southern regions decreases. It is important to note that we consider the physiological response to climate change excluding disturbances or management.
   Different climate change scenarios and assumptions about the persistence of CO2 effects lead to uncertain projections of future forest productivity. These uncertainties need to be integrated into forest management planning and adaptation of forest management to climate change using adaptive management frameworks.

AB  - Embodied energy in barns is found to contribute to about 10-30% of total energy use on dairy farms. Nevertheless, research on sustainability of dairy farming has largely excluded consideration of embodied energy. The main objectives of this study were to apply an established model from the residential and commercial building sector and estimate the amount of embodied energy in the building envelopes on 20 dairy farms in Norway. Construction techniques varied across the buildings and our results showed that the variables which contributed most significantly to levels of embodied energy were the area per cow-place, use of concrete in walls and insulation in concrete walls. Our findings are in contrast to the assumption that buildings are similar and would show no significant differences. We conclude that the methodology is sufficiently flexible to accommodate different building design and use of materials, and allows for an efficient means of estimating embodied energy reducing the work compared to a mass material calculation. Choosing a design that requires less material or materials with a low amount of embodied energy, can significantly reduce the amount of embodied energy in buildings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We reconstruct the Holocene shore displacement of the Vastervik-Gamlebyviken area on the southeast coast of Sweden, characterised by a maritime cultural landscape and archaeological significance since the Mesolithic. Sediment cores were retrieved from four lake basins that have been raised above sea level due to the postglacial land uplift and eustatic sea level changes after the melting of the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet. The cores were radiocarbon dated and analysed for loss on ignition and diatoms. The isolation thresholds of the basins were determined using LiDAR data. The results provide evidence for the initiation of the first Littorina Sea transgression in this area at 8.5 thousand calibrated years before present (cal. ka BP). A relative sea level rise by similar to 7 m a.s.l. is recorded between 8.0 and 7.5 cal. ka BP with a highstand at similar to 22 m a.s.l. between 7.5 and 6.2 cal. ka BP. These phases coincide with the second and third Littorina Sea transgressions, respectively, in the Blekinge area, southern Sweden and are consistent with the final deglaciation of North America. After 6.2 cal. ka BP, the relative sea level dropped below 22 m a.s.l., and remained at similar to 20 m a.s.l. until 4.6 cal. ka BP coinciding with the fourth Littorina Sea transgression in Blekinge. From 4.6 to 4.2 cal. ka BP, the shore displacement shows a regression rate of 10 mm a(-1) followed by a slowdown with a mean value of 4.6 mm a(-1) until 1.6 cal. ka BP, when the relative sea level dropped below 3.3 m a.s.l. The Middle to Late Holocene highstand and other periods of minor sea level transgressions and/or higher salinity between 6.2 and 1.7 cal. ka BP are attributed to a combination of warmer climate and higher inflow of saline waters in the southern Baltic Sea due to stronger westerlies, caused by variations in the North Atlantic atmospheric patterns.

AB  - The massive need for sustainable energy has led to an increased interest in new energy resources, such as production of algae, for use as biofuel. There are advantages to using algae, for example, land use is much less than in terrestrial biofuel production, and several algae species can double their mass in 1 day under optimized conditions. Most algae are phototrophs and some are nitrogen-fixing. Algae production therefore requires only small amounts of amendments such as carbon sources and nutrients. In the present paper an experiment was performed using water sampled from Lake Malaren in Sweden. The lake water is considered nutrient rich, has relatively neutral pH and is rich in organic compounds and suspended solids. The idea behind this research was to enhance indigenous algae production rather than inoculate new species into the system. A simple experimental setup was designed where algae biomass growth was measured regularly over a 13 day period. FT-IR absorption spectra were evaluated in order to determine protein, lipid, carbohydrate and silicate contents of the algae. The algae community structure was characterized throughout the production cycle. Furthermore, the potential for energy supply for the transportation sector in the Malardalen region from algae cultivated as tested in the experiment was evaluated.

AB  - From September to November 2015, more than 100,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden. Societal solidarity was unmistakable during this period, but six months later, when the refugees were to be accommodated, the situation had changed. In this analysis of imaginaries of migrants as strangers I scrutinize the city of Gothenburg's plan to build 1,000 temporary housing units to accommodate refugees. The project failed, resulting in only 57 units being built. In this article I analyse the societal imaginations the project revealed, including those embedded in political and public conflicts of opinion. In an attempt to understand why people sometimes refuse to share social space, I draw on a combination of Sara Ahmed's theories on the figure of 'the stranger' and Julia Kristeva's theories on how the stranger emanates from an ontological lack. I also outline in the article how different techniques of expulsion can be used to create spatial and temporal estrangement. In the subsequent analysis I demonstrate how practices of exclusion worked to expel migrants from urban development plans in the city of Gothenburg. The conclusion emphasizes the urgent need to scrutinize imaginaries among majority populations, and draws attention to the fact that the 'foreigner is within us'.

AB  - Quercus spp. are one of the most important tree genera in temperate deciduous forests in terms of biodiversity, economic and cultural perspectives. However, natural regeneration of oaks, depending on specific environmental conditions, is still not sufficiently understood. Oak regeneration dynamics are impacted by climate change, but these climate impacts will depend on local forest management and light and temperature conditions. Here, we studied germination, survival and seedling performance (i.e. aboveground biomass, height, root collar diameter and specific leaf area) of four oak species (Q. cerris, Q. ilex, Q. robur and Q. petraea). Acorns were sown across a wide latitudinal gradient, from Italy to Sweden, and across several microclimatic gradients located within and beyond the species' natural ranges. Microclimatic gradients were applied in terms of forest structure, distance to the forest edge and experimental warming. We found strong interactions between species and latitude, as well as between microclimate and latitude or species. The species thus reacted differently to local and regional changes in light and temperature ; in southern regions the temperate Q. robur and Q. petraea performed best in plots with a complex structure, whereas the Mediterranean Q. ilex and Q. cerris performed better in simply structured forests with a reduced microclimatic buffering capacity. The experimental warming treatment only enhanced height and aboveground biomass of Mediterranean species. Our results show that local microclimatic gradients play a key role in the initial stages of oak regeneration; however, one needs to consider the species-specific responses to forest structure and the macroclimatic context.

AB  - We studied the immediate effects of retention-felling on the occurrence of tree uprooting in two different types of boreal spruce forest in Finland to determine whether susceptibility to uprooting is dependent on the biotope. During the first post-treatment year, 7.1% of the trees in the paludified forest type and 1.8% in the upland forest type were uprooted. During the 2 following post-treatment years, uprooting percentages increased considerably (39.3% in the paludified type and 11.5% in the upland type in year 2; 48.3% in the paludified type and 15.2% in the upland type in year 3). Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), the dominant species in both forest types, was the species most susceptible to uprooting. The high uprooting rate in the paludified groups was probably caused by an interaction between the rocky ground and moist overlying peat layer with the shallow root system of P. abies. As paludified forest biotopes are generally recognized to have high biodiversity, the use of green-tree retention in these biotypes may enhance the continuum and survival of sensitive species. Moreover, because of the high level of uprooting, green-tree retention in paludified forest types can quickly and more naturally help restore levels of coarse woody debris.

AB  - P>1. Biological responses to liming of acidified surface waters are equivocal and limit the overall assessment of food web responses. In this study, we analysed community structure in limed, acidified and circumneutral lakes, based on the analyses of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral, profundal) and fish between 2000 and 2004. We also studied associations between functional feeding groups in food webs.
   2. Most univariate metrics of structure and function revealed similar community attributes among lake types, suggesting that community responses to natural recovery from acidification and liming management converge with those observed in circumneutral lakes. These trends were less clear in the multivariate analyses which showed significant community differences among lake types. For phytoplankton, these patterns were partly mediated by the invasive raphidophycean flagellate Gonyostomum semen.
   3. The associations between functional feeding groups indicated less connectivity and food web complexity in limed lakes relative to the other lake types. We speculate that repeated lime applications comprise frequent pulse disturbances which offset the establishment of stable trophic relationships in the food webs of limed lakes.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The limited structural and functional food web similarity among lake types supports the argument that liming constitutes an ecosystem-level disturbance. Managers should be aware of the ecosystem impacts of altered disturbance regimes when designing their management schemes because this can influence the success of restoration programmes. Furthermore, the lack of recovery, mediated in part by species invasions, suggests that impacts derived from global change are likely to lead to novel environmental situations. This calls for adaptive management strategies where managers are challenged to tackle multiple forms of anthropogenic stress simultaneously.

AB  - Mining activities in the Arctic often have a strong impact on people living here and the sustainability of their communities. The article takes as its point of departure two widely different cases relating to Arctic communities: the former mining city of Qullissat in the Greenlandic Disko Bay area and the rural village of Sakajarvi, which is threatened by expansions of the Aitik copper mine in the Norbotten County, Sweden. The cases differ in terms of time span, the number of people affected and the intensity of the affective economies, but they go through comparable processes of giving rise to emotional communities as a result of the termination or expansion of mining activities. Based on field observations and social and web-based media, the author argues that various actors with diverging purposes here compete to install their respective temporalities and narratives in the processes ofcommunitification, i.e., by articulating borders or performing as community. In both cases, the communities employ narrative strategies ofuchronotopia: aiming towards better futures by narratively breaking with the past. The agency of these communities depends to a high extent on the intensity of their affective economies, a symbolic capital that may hold considerable potential for creating desirable futures.

AB  - One of the limitations for reaching sustainable forest development is related to the traffic of machines andvehicles during harvest operations and wood transport, which may cause soil structure degradation. Seeking a way to analyze this problem, the objective of this study was to determine the traffic effects due to harvest operations and wood transport, on the preconsolidation pressure (sigma(p)) in a Typic Acrustox cultivated with eucalyptus. This study was conducted using undisturbed soil samples collected at the 0.10. 125 m depth. Undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. Soil sampling consisted of two stages, before and after the mechanized harvest operations. The traffic effects on the sigma(p) in the dry season indicated that the soil compaction process was neither evident nor important. However, in the rainy season the traffic effects on the sigma(p) indicated that the operations performed with Harvester and Forwarder caused greater soil compaction than those with Motorized Saw and Manual, which caused less soil compaction.

AB  - The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs (UCCS) has long recognized the importance of developing in its graduates the ability to address problems that do not fit neatly into a discipline-specific "box" that tends to be defined for the purposes of encapsulating the content of an undergraduate engineering student's course of study. Additionally, recognized is the importance of developing the "soft skills" necessary to succeed professionally, including both written and verbal communication, team skills, planning and project management, etc. These are the critical skills necessary to put their engineering knowledge to work productively, and while not ignored by engineering curricula per se, the development of these skills tends to be more effectively realized through experience rather than classroom work or traditional assignments, the bread and butter of undergraduate assessment. For many years, the Senior Design Program in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department has endeavored to provide an opportunity for students to begin their transition from engineering student to productive, practicing engineer through its year-long capstone design program. As with many engineering capstone programs, this is accomplished by bringing in external project sponsors with real problems faced by their organizations that the students, functioning in small teams, address over the span of a full academic year. Most of the project sponsors are for-profit companies, with many of those being engineering companies of some sort. This has proven to be a particularly effective model, and has proven very scalable as the program has grown over the years. It is also recognized that in the changing global economy with its many multinational corporations, international collaborative engineering teams have become ubiquitous. These collaborations bring with them many complications beyond those experienced in regionally (or nationally) isolated teams, including remote coordination, cultural, and language issues, to name only a few. As a means to provide a unique opportunity for some UCCS engineering students to experience and begin developing some proficiency in working on such teams when they enter industry, the UCCS Senior Design program staff reached out to colleagues at Linkoping University (LiU) in Sweden to propose a collaborative project. Students from both universities teamed to address a problem brought to them by a Swedish company. There were many educational objectives anticipated from this collaboration, but there were also many complications that had to be addressed. In the end, the collaboration was a tremendous success, from the perspective of both academic programs, from the perspective of the sponsor company, and from the perspectives of the students. This paper details this collaborative project, provides insights into the logistical issues at both academic institutions and how they were managed, and lays out a model to be considered elsewhere for similar collaborative arrangements. Lessons learned and future plans are also shared.

AB  - Outbreaks of clubroot disease caused by the soil-borne obligate parasite Plasmodiophora brassicae are common in oilseed rape (OSR) in Sweden. A DNA-based soil testing service that identifies fields where P. brassicae poses a significant risk of clubroot infection is now commercially available. It was applied here in field surveys to monitor the prevalence of P. brassicae DNA in field soils intended for winter OSR production and winter OSR field experiments. In 2013 in Scania, prior to planting, P. brassicae DNA was detected in 60% of 45 fields on 10 of 18 farms. In 2014, P. brassicae DNA was detected in 44% of 59 fields in 14 of 36 farms, in the main winter OSR producing region in southern Sweden. P. brassicae was present indicative of a risk for >10% yield loss with susceptible cultivars (>1300 DNA copies g soil(-1)) in 47% and 44% of fields in 2013 and 2014 respectively. Furthermore, P. brassicae DNA was indicative of sites at risk of complete crop failure if susceptible cultivars were grown (>50 000 copies g(-1) soil) in 14% and 8% of fields in 2013 and 2014, respectively. A survey of all fields at Lanna research station in western Sweden showed that P. brassicae was spread throughout the farm, as only three of the fields (20%) showed infection levels below the detection limit for P.brassicae DNA, while the level was >50,000 DNA copies g(-1) soil in 20% of the fields. Soil-borne spread is of critical importance and soil scraped off footwear showed levels of up to 682 million spores g(-1) soil. Soil testing is an important tool for determining the presence of P. brassicae and providing an indication of potential yield loss, e.g., in advisory work on planning for a sustainable OSR crop rotation. This soil test is gaining acceptance as a tool that increases the likelihood of success in precision agriculture and in applied research conducted in commercial oilseed fields and at research stations. The present application highlights the importance of prevention of disease spread by cleaning of farm equipment, footwear, etc.

AB  - Until recently, Norway remained immovable on its conservative policy that illegal drug use is a crime. In 2018, the Health Minister appointed an inquiry commission to design a less restrictive drug policy, which included two "drug user representatives." But the Minister's choices for these posts met massive dissatisfaction from some drug users who contended that the representatives "are not real drug users" and do not "speak for" nor "act on the behalf" of their experiences and opinions. They mobilized to establish an alternative organization, the Shadow Committee, to propose a drug policy reform shaped by "the user voices" and "not polluted by political compromises." Yet, while performing a labor of difference, this committee, too, became caught in conflicting landscapes of representation with some members contesting strategic solidarity. Based on this case, and an ethnographic fieldwork among the protesters, this article investigates the concept of representation as understood, contested and applied by "drug users." Exploring how they relate to "user voices" and question the authenticity of some of "user representatives," I highlight how changing political landscapes affect understandings of representation and shape political, individual and collective forms of involvement. I draw on Pitkin's political philosophy and apply the classical categorization of political representation to suggest reconsidering the governing assumptions regarding "user representatives" that increasingly inform drug and treatment policies in Norway. I ask if the concept of representation itself may be a barrier to meaningful involvement.

AB  - Using hydrogeochemical analysis of two large boreal rivers (pristine Kalix and hydropower regulated Lule) discharging into the Gulf of Bothnia, the major impacts of regulation on water discharge, element transport and their seasonal redistribution have been assessed. The pre-regulation hydrogeochemical features were assumed to be similar for the two rivers. For the Lule River, the average maximum runoff was almost halved, while the average minimum was tripled as a result of the regulation. The fraction of winter transport of total organic carbon (TOC), Fe, Si, suspended Mn and P in the Lule River was, according to a conservative estimate, two to three times higher than in the pristine river. Longer residence time in the Lule River delayed arrival of the suspended Mn peak and dissolved Si decline to the river mouth. During summer, the suspended C/N ratio in the regulated river was 10-20 compared to < 10 for the pristine, suggesting presence of predominantly old organic material. This was supported by a virtually constant suspended P/Fe ratio throughout the year in the Lule River, indicating low abundance of phytoplankton. TOC varied irregularly in the Lule River suggesting temporal disconnection between the river and the upper riparian zone. The disappearance of the spring flow maximum, a shift of element transport from spring to winter and supply of mainly old organic material during the vegetation growth season may have a pronounced impact on the ecosystem of the Gulf of Bothnia and the river itself.

AB  - To enhance sustainable urban development, cities may contribute to the market diffusion of wooden multistory residential construction (WMC) and to wood use in the renovations of old multistory residential buildings (i.e., wooden retrofits). For the construction sector, building with wood enables a shift from the dominant concretebased building regime, which has hindered the industrialization of building processes and the use of prefabricated modules. Although industrial wood construction has become more common in Finland in the 2000s, WMC and especially wooden retrofits have remained niche systems in residential building markets. The aim of our study is to provide information on how municipalities, especially cities at the core of urban development, may contribute to the market diffusion of WMC and wooden retrofits through policy instruments and via their involvement in local business ecosystems (BE). The interview data of the study were mainly gathered from 40 professionals representing the five case cities, but we also included other experts connected to local BEs that linked with the WMC and wooden renovation cases. We employed qualitative methods in the analyses. Our study shows that WMC and wooden retrofits could be catalyzed by both policy instruments and collaboration in BEs. Results show that policy instruments have been more effective when they include characteristics of the building projects (e.g., instrument usability differs between municipalities or private persons as building owners). To be powerful actors, municipalities could take on more active collaborative roles within the local BEs (e.g., as initiators of projects as building owners or as active enablers). As an implication of these results, city-level experimentation could benefit from a full range of policy measures and mixes to accelerate the diffusion of WMC and wooden retrofits.

AB  - Short-term (< 7 years) effects of prescribed litter-raking on forest-floor nutrient pools, stand nutrition, and seepage water chemistry were studied in an N-saturated Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forest in Southern Germany subject to high atmospheric-nitrogen deposition. The study was based on a comparison of plots with and without annual prescribed litter raking at three sites with different N-deposition levels. Prescribed litter-raking resulted in a considerable reduction of forest-floor thickness and mass, as well as of forest-floor C, N, P, K, Mg, and Ca pools. Furthermore, it induced a significant decrease of the foliar N content in current-year needles of the pines and a more balanced nutritional status of the stand. Particularly on the site subject to the highest N deposition, but to a lesser degree also at the other sites, the mean NO3- concentration in the subsoil seepage water and the N export into the groundwater were substantially reduced on the litter-raked plots. The results show that in N-saturated Scots pine ecosystems prescribed litter-raking on areas of limited size, which are used as sources of groundwater-derived drinking water and/or serve as habitat for endangered plant species, is a quick and effective method to achieve a more balanced nutritional status of the trees and to reduce seepage-water NO3- concentrations and N export into the groundwater. In terms of sustainable ecosystem nutrient management, the conversion of conifer monocultures into broadleaf-rich mixed stands is the better, yet less immediately effective method to reduce the seepage-water N export from conifer forests subject to high atmospheric-N deposition.

AB  - The geochemistry of lake (Renstradtrasket) and estuarine (Pieni Pernajanlahti Bay) sediment was investigated in a medium sized watershed draining to the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Catchment land-use types were compared and found similar. Sediment cores were dated using Pb-210- and Cs-137-chronologies and analyzed for Al, K, Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn, phosphorus fractions, TN, TC and biogenic silica (BSi). Differences between the sediment cores were studied by using linear regression analysis and principal components analysis (PCA). Despite similarities in catchment land-use and history, the sediment geochemical profiles of the sites varied significantly. Some of the differences could be related to differences in chemical sedimentation environment (lacustrine versus estuarine). TP concentration was found to be positively correlated with sediment iron content in estuarine sediment but negatively correlated with Fe in lake sediment. In the estuarine core sedimentary iron was not correlated to lithogenic potassium and aluminum but in the lake core the iron seemed to be lithogenic in origin, as suggested by the strong positive correlations (r(2) = 0.95-0.96) between these three variables. Most similarities among the cores were found in Al concentrations. Estuarine nutrient profiles appeared relatively monotonous compared to the lake core. This is probably due to more vigorous mixing of the sediments that may ensure more rapid and complete consumption of the organic matter deposited on the bottom of the estuary. Therefore the lake sediment appeared to preserve the historical record of eutrophication better. Biologically less active and more particle-bound materials like the trace metals Cu and Zn seemed to retain good records of anthropogenic impact also in the estuarine core. The study highlights the need to take the sedimentation environment into account when interpreting geochemical record.

AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the contributions of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems to the notion of nearly zero-energy cities in the capitals of the European Union member states (EU), Norway, and Switzerland. Moreover, an in-depth investigation of the barriers and challenges ahead of the widespread rollout of BIPV technology is undertaken. This study investigates the scalability of the nearly zero-energy concept using BIPV technology in moving from individual buildings to entire cities. This study provide a metric for architects and urban planners that can be used to assess how much of the energy consumed by buildings in Europe could be supplied by BIPV systems when installed as building envelope materials on the outer skins of buildings. The results illustrate that by 2030, when buildings in the EU become more energy-efficient and the efficiency of BIPV systems will have improved considerably, BIPV envelope materials will be a reasonable option for building skins and will help in achieving nearly zero-energy cities. This study reveals that in the EU, taking a building skin to building net surface area ratio of 0.78 and a building skin glazing ratio of 30%, buildings could cover their electricity consumption using BIPV systems by 2030. Eighteen challenges and barriers to the extensive rollout of BIPV systems are recognised, classified, and discussed in this study in detail. The challenges are categorised into five stages, namely the decision, design, implementation, operation and maintenance, and end of life challenges.

AB  - Nitrate reduction was optimized in water from the Siilinjarvi mine site with iron powder and iron nanoparticles. Iron waste from a mold machining industry was then tested as a potential alternative. Complete reduction of nitrate from the mine water was achieved with the iron powder and nanoparticles at pH 2. The iron waste, though less efficient, still achieved 53% nitrate reduction. Examination of the surface of the iron powder and waste by SEM-EDS showed iron corrosion: crystals of iron oxides grew on the iron surface as the pH increased during NO3- reduction, until about pH 5. The major by-product of the NO3- reduction of mine water was NH4+, with low NO2- concentrations (< 7%). Although iron powder and nanoparticles were more reactive, the iron waste results are promising. Despite its low BET surface area, the use of iron waste to treat high volumes of mine water would appear to have economical and sustainable advantages. More efficient NO3- reduction could possibly be attained with iron waste of higher BET surface area and/or by combining it with other chemical treatments.

AB  - Modern forestry is increasingly confronted with challenges that appear with intensive forest management and the progression of the effects of climate change. The forestry sector is able to react to the changing conditions by adapting management plans, forest structure or planting tree species with a higher stress resistance. However, during stand management activities, silvicultural treatments and harvesting operations can have an impact on the further development of the remaining forest ecosystem. In Germany, the most widely used harvesting system for thinning operations is a single-grip harvester used for felling and processing trees followed by a forwarder for timber extraction from the machine operating trails to roadside. In this research project, debarking rollers and other modifications designed for Eucalyptus harvesting heads were tested on conventional harvesting heads for the first time to assess the possibility of adding debarking to mechanized forest operations under Central European conditions. Seven field tests with varying tree species, diameters and age classes, were established within German state forests in Lower Saxony and in Bavaria. These tests were repeated in both summer and winter seasons to evaluate the influence of associated tree sap flows on debarking quality. Three different harvesting heads were modified to assess the altered mechanical characteristics and setups. To assess debarking ability originating from head modifications, a photo-optical measurement system developed within the scope of the project was used. The results demonstrate that especially for summertime operations, simple modifications to currently used harvesting heads are able to provide an average debarking efficiency up to 90% depending on the modifications. Another key finding is that a negatively affected sap flow, experienced during wintertime operations, resulted in 46% lower debarking efficiency, while spruce bark beetle infestations only resulted in a wider spread of the variation. Additionally, the vertical position of the log within the tree proved to have an influence on debarking efficiency, resulting in 15% lower average debarking for butt logs and 9% for top logs as compared to middle logs. Since a debarking process requires the stem to be fed through the harvesting head on multiple occasions to remove bark, average harvesting productivity might be reduced by approx. 10% compared to productivity measured with conventional harvesting heads. Considering the results and the extent of the modifications, the system proved to be a potential addition to existing harvesting methods facing changing challenges in future forestry.

AB  - Wild insect pollinators are essential to cultivated and natural ecosystems globally. Today, many pollinator species are declining. One reason is a general lack of flowering habitats at landscape scales. However, urban areas, including private gardens, may provide flowers, and constitute beneficial habitats for pollinators. Here, we evaluate the ecological outcomes of a citizen science campaign run by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) (called "Operation: Save the bees"), encouraging citizens to incorporate interventions beneficial to wild pollinators (garden meadows, flower plantings, and bee hotels) in their gardens. Data on insect observations and flowering plants were collected through online questionnaires at the end of the growing season. In total, we received 3,758 responses for the three interventions. We found that participants were more likely to observe many pollinators (as opposed to few or none) in more species rich garden meadows, and in larger and older plantings. The surrounding environment also affected pollinator abundance: fewer pollinators were observed in plantings in dense urban areas. Direct counts of pollinators during 10-min surveys correlated strongly to the simplistic abundance assessment (none, few, or many insects seen over the summer season). Bee hotel occupancy was positively related to local flower availability and bee hotel age. Smaller nest holes (<10 mm) were more occupied than larger holes (11-15 mm) and hotels in rural gardens and natural/semi-natural sites were more occupied than those in urban gardens. This study demonstrates that flower-rich private gardens provide integral habitat for wild pollinators and that citizen science programs can provide a tool for implementing and evaluating conservation practices. However, longer lasting commitment resulting in older interventions are preferable and should be encouraged in future campaigns.

AB  - The increasing population living in cities is leading to higher resource utilization, which strains the cities' ability to focus on sustainability. Adoption of different technologies can transform cities into "smart cities" that utilize energy in a more efficiently.
   This paper presents results from a technology assessment tool developed together with six mid-sized European cities. The main areas of focus have been evaluated based on the cities' priorities: transportation (both public and private) and consumers' perspectives on the use of smart electricity meters. The use of electric vehicles in Sweden, and a techno-economic evaluation of biogas-derived biomethane and electricity use in public transportation have been analyzed. The main conclusions show an overall higher efficiency for biogas-derived electricity use in electric buses; a need for higher consumer engagement through more detailed information provision for both increasing EV market penetration and electricity savings; and a need to establish detailed technology assessments for successful technology adoption in cities.

AB  - According to the model of product life cycles, the global coal mining industry is in the stagnation phase. The coal demand of the main consumer, China, has peaked in 2013 and is slowly declining. The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has excluded coal-related companies for ethical reasons. Important players like the UN or the EU have already begun to describe pathways towards decarbonization. Increasing competition between coal mining companies and the mining regions can be expected worldwide if companies want to keep their positions on the global and national coal markets. Companies will focus on the best deposits. European countries like France, Spain, or Germany are only forerunners of this development-their centuries of coal production have been finished. The concept of sustainable development (SD) is fundamentally based on a model of progress where ecological, economic, and social dimensions should be developed equally and positively. But without the idea of competition, the concept of SD is incomplete. Questions arise, such as how can SD be realized on stagnating or declining markets without guarantees for companies "to live forever"? How can SD be a corporate goal in a phase of decline? How can declining mining regions sustainably progress into a better future? The German hard coal mining industry's lifecycle has ended in 2018 after 60 years of stagnation and decline. As of 2019, all hard coal consumed in Germany will be imported, especially from Colombia, Russia, and South Africa. What has been done in Germany to handle the coal decline in a sustainable way and the lessons learned from this process is described in this paper. It may be useful for mining regions who will face a similar future sooner or later.

AB  - Domestic lamb mortality on an open forested and alpine summer range in the municipality of Malselv in northern Norway was investigated. Two hundred and fifty-three lambs in four of the area's six flocks were randomly fitted with mortality transmitters and monitored throughout the summer grazing season from June to September. Total losses in the six flocks were 183 (22.9%) lambs and 20 (4.2%) ewes. The carcasses of 69 lambs, 36 of which had radio-collars, and six ewes were recovered. Of the collared lambs, eight (22%) died as a result of disease and 27 (75%) were killed by predators. Implicated predators included red fox Vulpes vulpes, lynx Lynx lynx, golden eagle Aquila chryisaetos and wolverine Gulo gulo. Diseased animals included those diagnosed with pasteurellosis, disrupted intestinal functions and advanced coccidiosis. The remains of one lamb were too decomposed for necropsy, though there was no evidence that it had been attacked by a predator. Factors associated with losses were identified using logistic regression. Age of lamb at time of release on the summer range and age of dam were statistically associated with lamb losses (P < 0.05). Mortality was higher among older lambs and those of year-old ewes. Parameters commonly associated with lamb size and growth were not statistically associated with mortality. The negative association between lamb mortality and age of dam may be related to the quality of maternal care provided by ewes of different ages, particularly vigilance in the habitat of predators. Similarly, the positive association between mortality and age of lamb may be related to changing lamb behaviour, specifically increased distance from ewe, as lambs grow older and more independent. Predators, when present, are a major cause of mortality in free-ranging lambs, as in most wild ungulates.

AB  - It is necessary for rural communities to meet conditions of decline, including depopulation, with effective strategies for rural revival and revitalisation. Based on Hirschman's 'exit-voice' theory, this paper investigates the way in which local stakeholders respond to processes of rural depopulation. Case studies undertaken in Xiaoguan village in China and in Are in Sweden reveal the effectiveness of bottom-up revitalization initiatives in combating rural decline. We show how local stakeholders' strong "voices" in these places which called for improved living conditions and increased job opportunities held people and groups together, encouraging them to work together with shared values and attitude. The strong leadership demonstrated either by local committees or in stakeholders' self-organized actions played an important role in carrying out revitalisation initiatives. We highlight the importance of not only reviving economies but also creating desirable rural lifestyles. Our findings also emphasize the need for bottom-up initiatives to align with government policy and regional development plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As climate change brings an increase in torrential rain events in Nordic climates, new technologies are developed to manage stormwater. Blue-green roofs are constructed as a means to reduce the runoff of stormwater from roofs and reduce the risk of urban flooding. However, compared to conventional roofs, blue-green roofs represent different construction and operation conditions, which may affect the long-term integrity of the roof. The purpose of this research is to understand the variety of perspectives on how different actors perceive and manage quality risks related to blue-green roofs-that is, the probabilities and consequences of defects. The quality risks of blue-green roofs have been investigated through document studies and interviews with actors in the Norwegian building sector. Data have been collected from actors across the building sector to map differences in how risk is managed from several perspectives. The findings show that actors view quality risk in very different ways. While building owners are primarily concerned with the quality of the finished product, the primary concern of other involved actors may be to ensure that eventual defects cannot be attributed to their own activities. The efforts of the various actors to reduce the risks in their own activities may not necessarily reduce the risk of defects in roofs. To ensure a more comprehensive management of quality risk in blue-green roofs, it is necessary to consider the perspectives and incentives of all involved actors. This way, a framework could be developed as a feasible tool in blue-green roof projects.

AB  - Pinus sylvestris has undergone extirpation and reintroduction in several countries in north-western Europe. In Ireland, the species' native status is disputed and the conservation value of reintroduced pinewoods is unclear. To clarify the implications of this reintroduction for biodiversity conservation, we evaluated the level of floristic similarity between reintroduced and native stands. Plots recorded in reintroduced stands in Ireland and native stands in Scotland were compared using cluster analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling. A synoptic table was prepared incorporating floristic data from native stands in south-western Norway. The reintroduced plots were classified in terms of the British National Vegetation Classification and compared with Irish fossil pinewood assemblages. Four groups were identified by cluster analysis; three were floristically similar to Irish fossil pinewood assemblages and three corresponded, to varying degrees, to extant native pinewoods in Scotland or Norway. Irish bog pinewoods corresponded to the EU Habitats Directive Annex I priority habitat bog woodland. This suggests that reintroduced P. sylvestris is an important resource for Ireland's native botanical and habitat diversity, given Ireland's low cover of native woodland. For practical conservation purposes, P. sylvestris should be retained and managed as a native species in woodland habitats in Ireland.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY-ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGEWANDTE ICHTHYOLOGIE
LA  - English
AB  - Atlantic salmon are caught in the coastal waters of the Baltic, Parents and White seas, in their river basins and in the lakes of Russia. About 1.5-2.0 x 10(3) tonnes of salmon were caught annually in these regions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Overfishing, dam construction and pollution of biotopes have resulted in habitat loss in the Gulf of Finland coastal waters and in the rivers and lakes of Russian Karelia. In the Arkhangelsk region, salmon yield has decreased by a factor of 3.5 when compared to data from the 1930-40s. The salmon harvest from the Kola Peninsula appears to have remained the most steady while, for the past decade, the Pechora and Varzuga rivers have yielded more than 50-60 % of the total Russian salmon catch. This crisis in restocking shows an urgent need for the rapid development of a federal programme to conserve the Atlantic salmon genetic resources within the region.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) accumulation on leaves of 22 trees and 25 shrubs was examined in test fields in Norway and Poland. Leaf PM in different particle size fractions (PM10, PM2.5. PM0.2) differed among the species, by 10- to 15-folds at both test sites. Pinus mugo and Pinus sylvestris, Taxus media and Taxus baccata, Stephanandra incisa and Betula pendula were efficient species in capturing PM. Less efficient species were Acer platanoides, Prunus avium and Tilia cordata. Differences among species within the same genus were also observed. Important traits for PM accumulation were leaf properties such as hair and wax cover. The ranking presented in terms of capturing PM can be used to select species for air pollution removal in urban areas. Efficient plant species and planting designs that can shield vulnerable areas in urban settings from polluting traffic etc. can be used to decrease human exposure to anthropogenic pollutants.

AB  - Linking ecology and evolution can be challenging, particularly as these fields evolve rapidly tracking technological and theoretical developments. Thus, it is important for practitioners of different biological disciplines to understand new opportunities and challenges. Since theory and methods evolve, so will research programmes-often tracking opportunity. Here, we describe a research programme where we have investigated the population biology of grayling Thymallus thymallus in a Norwegian alpine landscape over three decades. Starting with classical ecological studies, we identified a set of populations that had evolved population-specific phenotypic traits over a relatively short time span (10-30 generations). These observations led us into evolutionary studies at various levels of biological organization, using population and quantitative genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the results show that the populations exhibit evolutionary responses to local-scale differences in environment (mainly water temperature during early development). Further, plastic responses are important in the early phase of population diversification. Population genomic studies are now becoming possible following the completion of an annotated genome. This will help us and others in addressing questions about the genetic architecture of traits important for local adaptation, thus emphasizing that combining ecological and evolutionary approaches is more important and interesting than ever.

AB  - Nabta Smart Town (NST), in New Borg el Arab, close to Alexandria, is an ambitious project under planning that includes residential and commercial facilities, in combination with high quality "Educational Magnets" capable of creating a dynamic community and generating all sorts of interesting activities. Therefore, the uniqueness of NST is building a fully integrated and inclusive neighbourhood - Educational Magnet, Residential, Commercial (shopping, leisure and entertainment), with Administrative Offices (including high-end security). The initial conceptualization of NST by the local promoters envisions a culture that protects, maintains and recycles within the community. The collaboration of VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. (VTT) was sought to ensure that the Master Plan (MP) and the buildings of the University, as well as the Residential and Commercial facilities of NST comply with the standards of a modern EcoCity adapted to the Egyptian context. The first phase of the work focuses mainly on carrying an EcoCity Energy Efficiency Feasibility Assessment.

AB  - Species richness of wood-inhabiting cryptogams was compared on fine woody debris (FWD; diameter 5-9 cm) and coarse woody debris (CWD; diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm) logs of Picea abies (L.) Karst. Data were collected from managed boreal forests of northern Sweden. Species richness was higher on CWD than FWD when equal numbers of logs were compared. When equal surface areas were compared, species richness on FWD and CWD did not differ. When equal volumes of CWD and FWD were compared, FWD had more species. This was an effect of surface area and log quantity, as a certain volume of FWD was composed of more logs and had greater surface area than the same volume of CWD. We varied woody debris volume and proportion of FWD in a simulation model of species richness on logs. At low volumes of woody debris, species richness increased with the proportion of FWD. At higher log volumes, species richness increased with the proportion of CWD. In managed forests where there are small amounts of woody debris, FWD is important for the total species richness on logs and should not be neglected despite the fact that species richness is generally positively correlated with log diameter.

AB  - The objective of the study is to compare entrepreneurship program for undergraduate engineering students at University College of Northeast Norway (USN) with a similar entrepreneurship program at University of California, Berkeley (UCB), which is a part of The Silicon Valley ecosystem. The entrepreneurship program at USN is optional and consists of 2 courses in the 3rd year with a total of 30 credits out of 60 per year. The program starts with a motivation seminar with guest lectures from local industry and UCB. Then, the students form teams, so-called student enterprises that are the core aspect of the program. Lectures in start-ups, business plan development, economy, and intellectual property protection are given throughout the semester. Each student team proposes a product or service idea to meet a market need, develops a business idea, writes a business plan and makes a presentation for a jury with real life startup experiences. The students are expected to seek advice and knowledge from mentors, in collaboration with UCB, and other networks. The presentations are given for the jury for validation of their business idea, the business plan and their presentation. In the end of the year, the student enterprises compete with other student enterprises at regional, national, and possible European championships. The entrepreneurship program for undergraduate engineering students at UCB is given through The Berkeley Method of Entrepreneurship (BMoE). BMoE is a comprehensive teaching and learning method developed at UCB to enable engineers to be more entrepreneurial. It is focused on three main elements: networks, mindset and frameworks. The program is optional in upper division (3rd and 4th year) of undergraduate studies. A motivational lecture series is given throughout the semester by distinguished innovators telling about their successes and failures. The students have to form teams and come up with an idea through an idea generation process, develop a business idea, write a business plan and make a presentation. Lectures in business establishment, business plans, economy, and intellectual property rights are given throughout the semester. In addition, courses in integrated device design and product development are offered in the framework of BMoE. Students are encouraged but not required to participate in various competitions. The main difference between USN and UCB's entrepreneurship program for engineers appears to be more comprehensive approach of BMoE and being part of Silicon Valley ecosystem. Different way of teaching entrepreneurship relies also on cultural differences between the two countries.

AB  - Introduction: The prevailing inequities in healthcare have been well addressed in previous research, especially screening program participation, but less attention has been paid to how to overcome these inequities. This paper explores a key factor of a successful improvement project: collaboration with local doulas to raise cervical cancer screening participation by more than 40 percent in an area with a large number of foreign-born residents.
   Methods: Data was collected through two focus group discussions with the doulas in order to design interventions and debrief after interventions had been carried out in the community. Various tools were used to analyze the verbal data and monitor the progress of the project.
   Results: Three major themes emerged from the focus group discussions: barriers that prevent women from participating in the cervical cancer screening program, interventions to increase participation, and the role of the doulas in the interventions.
   Conclusions: This paper suggests that several barriers make participation in cervical cancer screening program more difficult for foreign-born women in Sweden. Specifically, these barriers include lack of knowledge concerning cancer and the importance of preventive healthcare services and practical obstacles such as unavailable child care and language skills. The overarching approach to surmount these barriers was to engage persons with a shared cultural background and mother tongue as the target audience to verbally communicate information. The doulas who helped to identify barriers and plan and execute interventions gained increased confidence and a sense of pride in assisting to bridge the gap between healthcare providers and users.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine attitudinal factors underlying the use of public transport in winter among university students. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among 441 students at the two largest university campuses in Trondheim, Norway. A Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) modelling approach was used to test relationships among constructs using an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour hypothesized to predict public transport use during the winter. Analyses revealed strong effects of social-normative influence and perceived behavioural control on the use of public transport. Social status attribution and perceived accident involvement probability had significant influences on the attitude. The findings suggest that campaigns promoting sustainable and environmentally friendly travel modes can benefit from highlighting the above factors while bearing in mind the demographic characteristics of the target population.

AB  - Here we report the detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) isolated from Swedish wastewater and gull faeces. CPE have not been detected in samples from animals in Sweden preceding this report. Sampling of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) inlet and outlet, sedimentation basins, surface seawater from key aquatic bird habitats and freshly deposited gull faeces was done on six separate occasions during May to September 2021. Following broth enrichment, selective screening of putative CPE was performed on mSuperCarbaTM (CHROMagar). Species identification was done with MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed according to EUCAST. In total, seventeen CPE were verified by genome sequencing carrying blaGES-5, blaIMI-3, blaOXA-181 or blaOXA-244. The blaGES-5 was carried on IncP plasmids in four different species; Escherichia coli ST10 isolated from WWTP outlet, Raoultella ornithinolytica isolated from WWTP inlet, outlet and sedimentation basins as well as gull faeces collected at the WWTP and Klebsiella spp. isolates from WWTP inlet and outlet. The genetic environment surrounding blaGES-5 was similar in two Citrobacter freundii causing human infections. The blaIMI-3 was carried on IncFII(Yp) plasmids in four Enterobacter ludwigii, isolated from WWTP outlet and gull faeces collected at a recreational city park 2 km from the WWTP. The blaOXA-181 was located on a COLKP3 plasmid found in an E. coli, while blaOXA-244 was chromosomally located in an E. coli ST10, both isolated from WWTP inlet. Phylogenetic analysis of R. ornithinolytica and E. ludwigii isolates indicate that the gulls carried strains related to those identified in the WWTP samples. The results thus add to the increasing evidence of WWTPs as anthropogenic reservoirs for mobile genetic elements with antibiotic-resistance functionality. Such environments could profoundly impact the dissemination and spread of such genetic elements via for example aquatic birds, thereby warranting further study and surveillance.

AB  - Microbes are central drivers of soil processes and in-depth knowledge on how agricultural management practices effects the soil microbiome is essential in the development of sustainable food production systems. Our objective was therefore to explore the long-term effects of organic and conventional cropping systems on soil bacterial and fungal quantity, their community structures and their combined function. To do so, we sampled soil from a long-term experiment in Southeast Norway in 2014, 25 years after the experiment was established, and performed a range of microbial analyses on the samples. The experiment consists of six cropping systems with differences in crop rotations, soil tillage, and with nutrient application regimes covering inorganic fertilizers, cattle slurry (both separately and combined with inorganic fertilizers) and biogas residues from digested household biowaste. The quantity of soil microbes was assessed by extraction of microbial C and N and by analysis of soil DNA (bacterial 16S rRNA, and fungal rRNA internal transcribed spacer region). The structures of the microbial communities were determined and assessment of relatedness of bacterial and fungal communities was done by the unweighted pair group method. Estimates of richness and diversity were based on numbers of unique operational taxonomic units from DNA sequencing and the function of the microbial assembly was measured by means of enzyme assays. Our results showed that production systems including leys had higher microbial biomass and higher numbers of bacterial and fungal gene copies than did systems with cash crops only. A cropping system which appeared to be particularly unfavourable was a reference-system where stubble, roots and exudates were the single source of organic material. Production system significantly affected both bacterial and fungal community structures in the soil. Systems including leys and organic fertilization had higher enzyme activities than did systems with cash crops only. An inclusion of ley in the rotation did not, however, increase either microbial richness or microbial diversity. In fact, the otherwise suboptimal reference-system appeared to have a richness and diversity of both bacteria and fungi at levels similar to those of the other cropping systems, indicating that the microbial function is largely maintained under less favourable agricultural treatments because of the general resilience of soil microorganisms to various stresses. Neither disturbance through tillage nor the use of chemical fertilizer or chemical plant protection measures seemed as such to influence soil microbial communities. Thus, no differences between conventional and organic farming practices as such were found. We conclude that the choice of agricultural management determines the actual microbial community structure, but that biodiversity in general is almost unaffected by cropping system over many years. Adequate addition of organic material is essential to ensure a properly functioning microbial ensemble and, thus, to secure soil structure and fertility over time.

AB  - Petroleum explorers commonly acknowledge the contribution of luck in exploration outcomes. Our survey of 237 current industry practitioners revealed that 90% of them believe that luck affects the outcome of exploration projects. However, luck has never been quantified before as a factor in petroleum exploration, and therefore, it remains an abstract concept that is not deeply considered by geoscientists and exploration managers. Luck clearly exists in petroleum exploration, because it contributed to many serendipitously discovered plays and pools. Luck is also a factor in the relative performance of different exploration companies. Looking at companies exploring on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in 1966-2005, we concluded that differences in success rates of individual companies are essentially random. Using a global data set of 3258 conventional exploration wells in which 733 companies took 8096 equity positions in 2008-2017, we calculated that the proportion of variance in geological success rates among the companies is 39% attributable to luck (25% for commercial success), the rest being related to skill. In frontier plays, luck contribution to the variation in geological and commercial success rates between different companies is 100%. The factor of luck is relatively less in emerging (67% for geological success), maturing (38%), and mature (29%) plays. Recognizing that luck is a part of the exploration success equation has numerous implications for exploration strategies, investors, companies, managers, and individual explorers. The factor of luck can be reduced only through a sustainable long-term exploration program with numerous independent wells. Explorers should focus on developing their prediction skills rather than obsess about the binary outcomes of each well.

AB  - Killer whales Orcinus orca have a cosmopolitan distribution with a broad diet ranging from fish to marine mammals. In Norway, killer whales are regularly observed feeding on overwintering Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring Clupea harengus inside the fjords. However, their offshore foraging behavior and distribution are less well understood. In particular, it is not known to what degree they rely on the NSS herring stock when the herring move to deeper offshore waters. Satellite telemetry data from 29 male killer whales were analyzed to assess whether their offshore foraging behavior is linked to herring distribution. Unlike most marine predator-prey studies that use indirect proxies for prey abundance and distribution, our study utilized 2 herring density estimates based on (1) direct observations from acoustic trawl survey data and (2) simulations from a fully coupled ecosystem model. Mixed effects models were used to infer the effect of herring density and light intensity on whale movement patterns. Our results suggest that killer whales follow NSS herring over long distances along the coast from their inshore overwintering areas to offshore spawning grounds. All whales changed from fast, directed, to slow, non-directed movement when herring density increased, although individuals had different propensities towards movement. Our data indicated that whales continue to feed on herring along the Norwegian shelf. We conclude that NSS herring constitute an important prey resource for at least some killer whales in the northeastern Atlantic, not only during the herring overwintering period, but also subsequently throughout the herring spawning migration.

AB  - Palaeoecological analyses from a small fen deposit, combined with pollen analysis from buried soil profiles under prehistoric burial mounds, have been used to investigate the timing and vegetation change associated with the Holocene development of a cultural landscape in southern Sweden. Traditional pollen analysis is complemented with plant macrofossil analysis and soil pollen analysis from within and in close proximity to the burial mounds in the coastal Bjare peninsula, well known for its high density of well-preserved Bronze Age monuments. The vegetation development is linked to the construction of the burial mounds. A marked increase of cultural impact on the landscape is recorded during the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition and estimates of landscape openness suggest that by the onset of the Bronze Age, forest cover was only 20-40%, falling to 10% in the immediate vicinity of the burial mounds themselves. The coastal strip appears to have been affected by human activity to a greater extent and at an earlier date than sites from further inland in southern Sweden and the Bronze Age burial mounds were most likely designed to be visible in a largely deforested landscape.

AB  - As the environmental crisis gains pace, different strands of posthumanist theorizing have aimed to reshape the ecological conditions of human actions. This article examines ecological justifications in French pragmatic sociology, developed by Boltanski and Thevenot, situating it to discussions about materiality. The approach has proven useful for analyzing various controversies as it provides tools for examining how actors coordinate conflict situations and cope with uncertainty. However, previous studies have also raised questions about the applicability of pragmatic sociology in studying environmental problems. These discussions have revolved around the distinctiveness of 'green' justifications. In this article, we examine organic agriculture as a case of green critique that has brought ecology to the fore. Our analysis focuses on contestations about organic agriculture and the possibilities of novel green justifications to establish a 'green reality test'. By combining conceptual work on justifications and empirical analysis of organic agriculture, the study underlines the key task of critically differentiating a new form of worth as meaningfully different from established forms thereof. In so doing, it also contributes to topical discussions of developing social theoretical frameworks for addressing environmental issues.

AB  - This paper analyses the effect of innovation on firms' technical efficiency. Using climate-related patent data to proxy for innovation activity in different technological fields, the paper employs a stochastic frontier approach to estimate the impact of innovative efforts on agricultural firms' technical efficiency taking account of both unobservable heterogeneity and double heteroscedasticity in the inefficiency and idiosyncratic terms. Our findings confirm that innovation has a positive impact on firms' productivity (technical efficiency). While agricultural firms located in Germany and Sweden are more efficient compared to those in southern countries, all the European countries considered are distant from the maximum production frontier. This leaves room for governments to design economically sustainable agriculture policies, incentivize firms and foster technological innovation to achieve adaptations to present and future changes in climate.

AB  - Environmental impact and use of energy and materials are relevant topics in companies. To achieve energy savings and enhance environmental performance, managers can invest in technologies (technical measures) and/or implement management practices (low-cost and non-technical measures). This paper focuses on energy and environmental management practices in foundry, which is a particularly energy-intensive industry producing significant carbon dioxide emissions. We conducted a scoping review of scientific publications and technical documents to identify practices that enable energy efficiency improvement and adverse environmental impact reduction in cast iron foundries using coreless induction furnaces. The review returned 399 practices, which we categorised according to the process step of application and theme. We developed a hierarchy to classify the practices according to their sustainability. The results show that the practices proposed in the literature focus mainly on avoiding or reducing resource consumption, rather than on recovering residual value. The intended contribution is to promote the adoption of management practices as an effective lever to increase energy efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, while also providing a summary of current knowledge to facilitate the identification of areas for further research. The review could also support foundry managers in the selection and prioritisation of the practices to adopt.

AB  - The review gives a short general history of the selection system, suggests a way to systematize silviculture and summarizes research on the selection system in Fennoscandia. The review is restricted to Norway spruce, Picea abies (L.) Karst, being the only tree species having documented examples of being managed with selection system in boreal Fennoscandia. It covers four main subjects: (i) the dynamics governing the stand structure and the possibilities to maintain a full-storied structure over time; (ii) how ingrowth is affected by stand density and structure, and by internal dynamics within the seedling-sapling layer, and to what extent it is possible to get sufficient ingrowth to perpetuate the selection system: (iii) the key characteristics governing volume growth at stand level; and (iv) the maximum long-term growth compared to the rotation-forestry system.
   The residual standing volume is crucial to the long-term growth level. A moderate harvest strength at relatively short intervals, focusing on the largest trees and leaving behind a large standing volume, results in a high sustainable volume growth, low requirement of ingrowth, large average stem volumes and low levels of damage to the remaining stand. Long-term volume growth can then be approximately equal to the site productivity expressed by site characteristics, which is lower than the level expected in even aged plantations managed with rotation-forestry. The review ends with suggestions for future research. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The deposition of strong acids is one of many threats to forest ecosystems and viable forestry. Several counteractions against acidification have been launched, e.g. changes in forestry management and the introduction of chemicals. The inter-institutional programme ''Counteractions Against Acidification in Forest Ecosystems'' was established in 1993 to evaluate existing knowledge and run experimental and full-scale field experiments. A total of 240 metric tons of coarse dolomite powder was spread by helicopter in September 1994 on 84 ha forest catchment dominated by pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). potential desirable and undesirable effects after this carbonate application may be less pronounced than recorded at other sites due to the relatively moderate dose (3 tons ha(-1)). Pre-liming stream water quality (mean values for May 1993-September 1994) was as follows: pH 4.8; Ca 1.13 mg L(-1); reactive Al (RA1) 248 mu g L(-1); inorganic monomeric Al (A1(i)) 72 mu g L(-1). The reference station was slightly higher in Ca and slightly lower in both RA1 and Al-i. Dolomite application resulted in a significant increase in pH to 5.7 as mean value for the post-liming period (September 1994-April 1995). Both Ca and Mg increased significantly after liming, and both RAI and Al, declined significantly. The rapid detoxification of stream-water may be explained by dissolution of dolomite particles in both streams and catchment, a resulting pH increase and change in Al species composition. Retention of Al in the catchment probably explains the reduction in RA1. No increase in NO3, total N, total P or TOC was recorded the first seven months.

AB  - Windthrows in the forestry fund, which have become more frequent due to the increase in extreme weather events, have had, and continue to have, mostly negative economic and ecological effects, making them a pressing issue in forestry research. The main objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of windthrows on some microbiological properties of forest soils and to monitor the evolution of the degraded tree regeneration, four years after the event, for three tree species: Norway spruce (Picea abies L.), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The experimental plot used is arranged in dispersed blocks and subdivided plots, with three repetitions, and is bifactorial, with factor A representing the tree species and factor B the windthrows. There are two possibilities: affected by windthrows (AW) and unaffected by windthrows (WW). For each tree species, dehydrogenase activity (DA) and the number of fungi (NF) in the organic horizon at the soil surface were studied. Correlations were highlighted between the differences in AW and WW of Current Dehydrogenase Activity (CDA), Potential Dehydrogenase Activity (PDA), and NF with the number of naturally regenerated seedlings (NRS) and the type of soil. Stimulating NRS in AW forests and increasing the volume of terrestrial organic carbon (TOC) biomass is directly dependent on soil fertility, primarily determined by Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), which accumulates in the soil as a result of organic matter, deposited on the surface. Sustainable forest management of AW plots should stimulate the accumulation of SOC, including the partial or total preservation of dead trees, provided that the attack of specific diseases and pests is avoided.

AB  - Valaam archipelago in the northern part of Ladoga lake belongs to the middle taiga subzone with Scots pine and Norway spruce forests and is characterised by the typical vegetation complex. Nemoral element also plays here a considerable role. Many introduced species such as Larix sibirica, Abies sibirica, Pinus sibirica and Quercus robur have been grown and self-reproduced here for over 130 years.
   Tourism and pilgrimage as well as monastery economic activities affect the nature of the island. Since 1979 archipelago received a status of the State historical and architectural reserve-museum because of it's special historical and cultural value (the Valaam monastery has been functioning since XIV century) as well as uniqueness of natural complexes.
   Until recently there were practically no studies of the archipelago's macromycetes. Three expeditions to Valaam were carried out in 1995-1996. This paper is the first in a planned series of publications. 197 species and intraspecific taxa from the orders Boletales, Russulales, Cortinariales, and Agaricales (Tricholomataceae only) are reported here. Information on location, habitat, collection date and number (in brackets) or LE herbarium specimen number are given for each species sample.
   The specimens are kept at Komarov Botanical Institute of RAS (LE).

AB  - In recent years there has been an increasing interest in the biogeography of chrysophytes from the Polar region in Russia (Siver et al. 2005. Voloshko 2007). The Polar Ural represents one of the last true wilderness areas in Europe. Future effects of global climate changes and local anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. coal-mining and gas pipeline building) can be especially significant in the Arctic region. First investigations of chrysophytes in oligotrophic waterbodies showed a relatively diverse and abundant flora, including 45 different taxa from the genera Chrysosphaerella (2), Dinobryon (2), Hydrants ( I), Mallomonas (19), Paraphysomonas (5), Spiniferomonas (6), and Synura (10). Forty-three species are new records for the region and two species are new to Russia (Mallomonas corcontica and Spiniferomonas septispina). Two recently described taxa of Mallomonas (M. striata var. getseniae and M. striata var. balonovii) were found. New records for the rare species M. crassisquama var. papillosa are reported. The most frequently distributed species were Mallomonas alpina, M. striata var. striata, M. akrokomos, Synura petersenii var. petersenii. Spiniferomonas trioralis, Hydrurus foetidus, and Paraphysomonas vestita. Hydrants foetidus forms a continuous cover with an offensive odor on the coastal substrate of mountain streams. The majority of taxa are cosmopolitan and more temperate than arctic in nature. The Sorensen quotient demonstrates a rather low degree of similarity between the floras of the study lakes. Only in 23% of the comparisons was the quotient equal to at least 50%, and in other waterbodies the similarity did not exceed 9-37%. The species composition of chrysophytes in the region shows a rather high similarity with the floras of Bolshezemelskaya tundra (61%) and Finland (51%). These findings extend the knowledge on the geographical distribution of many chrysophyte taxa in cold northern regions. The occurrence and distribution of the flora in relation to some ecological data are discussed.

AB  - The creation of pathways toward a societal transition to clean energy requires the engagement of multiple stakeholders with different and sometimes conflicting interests. In this connection, stakeholder analysis (SA) offers a technique for identifying, assessing and structuring different needs, interests and concerns related to different stakeholders within the context of sustainability. This article aims to present the findings from a qualitative stakeholder analysis (QSA) by using a thematic network approach (TNA), with the help of the ATLAS.ti software. It focuses on Project X, which was aimed at engaging multiple stakeholders and creating favorable conditions for small and medium-sized companies in a region situated in the central part of Sweden, with the potential to start biogas production. In this work, the findings and discussions of the QSA using TNA are structured by using the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal (PESTEL) themes of the model. The present study concludes that for the small-scale biogas industry to successfully develop an understanding of the possibilities of the biogas value chain, it is necessary to have analyzed the nature of the main themes by which various stakeholders relate to biogas production and envision their contribution to creating a sustainable society. Herein, we demonstrate that QSA by a TNA, combined with the application of a PESTEL model, are valuable analytical tools in sustainable project management. The lessons from Project X can be applied to other local biogas initiatives, as many identified threats and opportunities are shared by others.

AB  - The intervention measures in historic buildings, if planned and implemented correctly, provide enormous cultural, economic, environmental and social benefits. Moreover, performing the improvements at an urban level, for groups of buildings that hold similar significance and preservation status, would ensure the uniformity of intervention works and result in time- and money-saving than treating each building separately. Nevertheless, maintenance and adaptation interventions in historic buildings have a high level of difficulty. Specific protection statuses and considerable constraints for change lead to additional restrictions that need to be maintained. This added complexity, along with the demanding targets of energy efficiency in the building stock, are among the challenges that need to be faced for the present and future generations. The Zero Emission Refurbishment (ZER) method, applied here as an example to a historic block in the city of Trondheim in Norway, shows the reduction potential of the carbon footprint before undergoing large-scale interventions. The method includes legislative conservative requirements and the environmental impact of the actions to select the most adequate intervention measures. It is flexible and comprehensive and can be applied to diverse built environments. The overall carbon footprint of the intervention measures, linked with the operational energy improvement after the completion of the works, serve as an indicator for the estimation of renewable energy generated from the neighbourhood and therefore, for the transition to a low carbon society by developing sustainable historic neighbourhoods with zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

AB  - The Tallinn Bay is a 10x20-km semi-enclosed area of the Gulf of Finland. Since tidal currents are negligible in this area, wind waves and local currents that both cause moderate near-bottom velocities off shoreline govern the beach processes. In recent years, high-speed ship traffic has increased considerably and amounts to 70 traverse per day. The ships frequently sail with speeds close to the critical velocity. Comparison of a long-term reconstruction of wind wave climate with the direct ship wave measurement shows that, in the coastal zone of the bay the mean energy of ship waves is 7-10% from the bulk wave energy and wave-induced power as high as 40% from the bulk wave power. The annual maximum of significant wind wave heights is frequently <1.5 m (periods 5-6 s) whereas fast ferries generate waves with the heights about 1 m. The highest component of ship wake has frequently periods 10-15 s and causes unusually high near-bottom velocities at the depths of 5-20 m. Thus, the wake of fast ferries is a new forcing component of vital impact on the local ecosystem that may cause considerable intensification of beach processes as well as enhanced vertical mixing in the water body and have significant influence on the aquatic wildlife.

AB  - In this study we estimate relative pollen productivity (RPP) for plant taxa characteristic of human-induced vegetation in ancient cultural landscapes of the low mountain ranges of Shandong province in eastern temperate China. RPP estimates are required to achieve pollen-based reconstructions of Holocene plant cover using modelling approaches based on Prentice's and Sugita's theoretical background and models (REVEALS and LOVE). Pollen counts in moss samples and vegetation data from 36 sites were used in the Extended R-Value (ERV) model to estimate the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) of moss polsters and RPP of major plant taxa. The best results were obtained with the ERV sub-model 3 and Prentice's taxon-specific method (using a Gaussian Plume dispersal model) to distance weight vegetation data. RSAP was estimated to 145 m using the maximum likelihood method. RPP was obtained for 18 taxa of which two taxa had unreliable RPP (Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae and Vitex negundo). RPPs for Castanea, Cupressaceae, Robinia/Sophora, Aster/Anthemis-type, Cannabis/Humulus, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae and Galium-type are the first ones for China. Trees, except Robinia/Sophora (RPP = 0.78 +/- 0.03) have larger RPPs than herbs other than Artemisia (RPP = 24.7 +/- 0.36). The RPPs for Quercus, Pinus and Artemisia are comparable with other RPPs obtained in China, the RPPs for Pinus, Quercus, Ulmus, Cyperaceae and Galium-type with the mean RPPs obtained in Europe, and RPP for Cupressaceae with that for Juniperus in Europe. The values for Aster/Anthemis-type, Caryophyllaceae, Asteraceae SF Cichorioideae and Juglans differ from the few RPPs available in China and/or Europe.

AB  - For lichen epiphytes the loss of trees from a site represents a complete break in the availability of their primary habitat. Epiphytic species are therefore expected to provide powerful indicators for the ecological continuity of woodlands. Suites of lichen indicators have been developed in a semi-quantitative way, and represent working hypotheses which are cautiously interpreted against site-specific conditions by expert field biologists. Here, we test the utility of lichen indicators in a more generic fashion, by attempting to falsify the null hypothesis that the occurrence of lichen indicators is unrelated to variation in woodland continuity. We compared the association of recommended lichen indicators with woodlands in different continuity classes, after adjusting for sampling bias. We demonstrated differences in accuracy for contrasting sub-groups of indicators related to their biogeography; a sub-group of 'western' indicators tended to be more strongly associated with long-continuity woodland compared to an 'eastern' indicator sub-group. Our results underpin the need for further research into the fundamental biology which explains the value of indicators, before these tools can be applied generally and independently of expert-led opinion in a site-specific context.

AB  - The evolution of pest resistance to management strategies is a major challenge for farmed systems. Mitigating the effects of pest adaptation requires identifying the selective pressures imposed by these strategies. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, barriers are used to prevent salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) larvae (copepodids) from entering salmon cages. These barriers are effective against shallow-swimming copepodids, but those swimming deeper can pass underneath and infest salmon. Laboratory experiments suggest that depth regulation in copepodids is a variable behavioural trait with a genetic basis. We used biological-hydrodynamic dispersal models to assess how this trait variation alters the dispersion of lice through the ocean environment and into farms. The dispersal of copepodids with 3 behavioural phenotypes (deep, mean or shallow) was modelled over winter-spring and spring-summer periods in a Norwegian fjord system with intensive aquaculture. The infestation pressure of each phenotype on barrier cages was estimated from their modelled depth distributions: copepodids deeper than 10 m were predicted to successfully pass underneath barriers. The deep phenotype was the most abundant below 10 m and reached infestation pressures 3 times higher than that of the mean phenotype. In contrast, the shallow phenotype infestation pressure reached less than half that of the mean phenotype. These differences in relative fitness indicate that barriers can impose strong directional selection on the swimming behaviour of copepodids. The strength of this selection varied seasonally and geographically, with selection for the deep phenotype stronger in winter-spring and at coastal locations than in spring-summer and within fjords. These findings can be applied across farms to slow louse adaptation, by limiting barriers during situations of strong selection, although this must be balanced against trade-offs to short-term efficacy. More broadly, our study highlights new ways in which dispersal models can address evolutionary questions crucial for sustainable parasite management in aquaculture.

AB  - Coral reef resilience depends on the balance between carbonate precipitation, leading to reef growth, and carbonate degradation, for example, through bioerosion. Changes in environmental conditions are likely to affect the two processes differently, thereby shifting the balance between reef growth and degradation. In cold-water corals estimates of accretion-erosion processes in their natural habitat are scarce and solely live coral growth rates were studied with regard to future environmental changes in the laboratory so far, limiting our ability to assess the potential of cold-water coral reef ecosystems to cope with environmental changes. In the present study, growth rates of the two predominant colour morphotypes of live Lophelia pertusa as well as bioerosion rates of dead coral framework were assessed in different environmental settings in Norwegian cold-water coral reefs in a 1-year in situ experiment. Net growth (in weight gain and linear extension) of live L. pertusa was in the lower range of previous estimates and did not significantly differ between inshore (fjord) and offshore (open shelf) habitats. However, slightly higher net growth rates were obtained inshore. Bioerosion rates were significantly higher on-reef in the fjord compared to off-reef deployments in- and offshore. Besides, on-reef coral fragments yielded a broader range of individual growth and bioerosion rates, indicating higher turnover in live reef structures than off-reef with regard to accretion-bioerosion processes. Moreover, if the higher variation in growth rates represents a greater variance in (genetic) adaptations to natural environmental variability in the fjord, inshore reefs could possibly benefit under future ocean change compared to offshore reefs. Although not significantly different due to high variances between replicates, growth rates of orange branches were consistently higher at all sites, while mortality was statistically significantly lower, potentially indicating higher stress-resistance than the less pigmented white phenotype. Comparing the here measured rates of net accretion of live corals (regardless of colour morphotype) with net erosion of dead coral framework gives a first estimate of the dimensions of both processes in natural cold-water coral habitats, indicating that calcium carbonate loss through bioerosion amounts to one fifth to one sixth of the production rates by coral calcification (disregarding accretion processes of other organisms and proportion of live and dead coral framework in a reef). With regard to likely accelerating bioerosion and diminishing growth rates of corals under ocean acidification, the balance of reef accretion and degradation may be shifted towards higher biogenic dissolution in the future.

AB  - The aim of this research is to study the seasonal histological changes in the digestive gland of males and females Nephrops norvegicus at the Pagasitikos Gulf. The food availability in Pagasitikos Gulf varies and depends on the seasonality, physicochemical conditions and diversification of organic material. After obtaining histological sections, the size of tubules, their lumens and the R-, F- and B-cells were calculated in March and May. A special image analysis algorithm was used that can automatically calculate both the above area ratios using digestive gland histological sections. Both male and female, which were sampled in May, had a larger density of lipid droplets than N. norvegicus sampled in March. However, females sampled in May had more lipid droplets per tubule and a smaller F-cell-to-tubule ratio than males, which indicated that the intensive feeding period had started for reproduction in the females. The digestive gland can be used as a nutritional indicator to assess the nutritional status of Nephrops stocks and to assist with the management of the Nephrops wild stocks by proposing a seasonal fishery management plan to improve the sustainability of the stocks.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight translanguaging practices in the home among bilingual/multilingual Russian-speaking children and their parents in Cyprus, Sweden and Estonia. Multilingual families are the focus of our research: 50 in Cyprus, 20 in Estonia and 50 in Sweden. Using parental written questionnaires with the focus on general background, socio-economic status and language proficiency, as well as oral semi-structured interviews and ethnographic participant observation, our study attempts to describe how family language policy is managed through translanguaging and literacy activities in multilingual Russian-speaking families in three different cultural and linguistic environments. Our results show both differences and similarities among Russian-speakers in the three countries, not only in their family language practices, but also in their attitudes towards the fluidity of language, language repertoires, translanguaging and Russian-language literacy. Russian-speakers incorporate a wide range of language repertoires in their everyday lives. Sometimes, such language contacts generate power struggles and the language ideological dimension becomes a key terrain to explore how speakers feel about the need to effectively attain a degree of multilingualism. Multilingualism and the maintenance of the Russian language and culture are usually encouraged, and parents often choose the one-parent-one-language approach at home. However, not all families make conscious choices regarding specific language management and may have "laissez-faire" attitudes to the use of languages in the family. We show how family language use and child-directed translanguaging can support, expand and enhance dynamic bilingualism/multilingualism, and reinforce and integrate minority language in a wider context: societal and educational.

AB  - PurposeThe degrading impacts of livestock production on the environment are well acknowledged. Although ruminants are much studied due to their large contribution to climate change impact, monogastrics are also known to carry a significant load, and mitigation options need investigation. Here, the climate change impact and water scarcity impact of Finnish pork production was investigated using the life cycle assessment approach.MethodsAs the importance of communicating reliable environmental information has been acknowledged in the EU, methods and guidance for this purpose have been developed. Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules have also been published for several food product categories, although not yet for meat. Here, the life cycle assessment methods were used based on PEFCR guidance and the draft version of red meat PEFCR guidance to achieve a reliable, transparent and comparable assessment.ResultsFinnish pork production resulted in a climate change impact of 3.6 kg CO2 eq. kgCW-1 and a water scarcity impact of 0.69 m3 eq. kgCW-1. The largest contribution to the climate change impact came from feed crop production, with an impact of 43%. Land-use changes were included, and their contribution to the Finnish pork climate change impact was 3%. Similarly, in the water scarcity impact, feed crop production was a major contributor, with 41% from fattening pig feed production. Significant contributions to both categories also came from piglet production, including feed crop production, and to the climate change impact from manure storage.ConclusionsFinnish production was seen to already largely utilise sidestreams and domestic feed ingredients, although, e.g. soybean is still used. Based on the results, in mitigating the environmental impacts of Finnish pork production, attention should especially be paid to the resource-efficient production of domestic feed crops and reduced use of organic soils. As current assessment models are unable to grasp the impacts of regenerative farming techniques, the development of LCA methods is also required. Water scarcity impact was seen to be largely affected by the utilisation of feed crops originating from water-scarce countries. As a mitigation measure, the procurement of these feed crops and ingredients should therefore be directed to water-abundant areas and from production which does not depend on irrigation water or the extensive use of synthetic inputs.

AB  - Feeding the expected global population of 9 billion by 2050 is a daunting challenge, which engages researchers, technical experts, and leaders across the globe. Particularly, fish consumption in 2030 is projected to be 20 % higher than in 2016 (30 million tons live weight). Salmon farming is one of the main industries that may help in covering the projected world fish demand. Specifically, the largest worldwide salmon exporters are Norway and Chile, representing around 80 % of the market. Therefore, this study aims to analyze strategies to enhance the cold production performance of a typical Chilean salmon company, by developing a simulation model to analyze different improvement strategies for the productive processes in the plant. For three real scenarios, the cold production line throughput was increased between 6.65%-22.95%, where the best case represented an increase of about 330 tons per month. Additionally, we provide relevant significant insights for both practitioners and researchers, based on implementing our methodology.

AB  - Old industrial landfills are important sources of environmental contamination in Europe, including Finland. In this study, we demonstrated the combination of TRIAD procedure, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and statistical Monte Carlo analysis for assessing the risks to terrestrial biota in a former landfill site contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) and metals. First, we generated hazard quotients by dividing the concentrations of metals and PHCs in soil by the corresponding risk-based ecological benchmarks. Then we conducted ecotoxicity tests using five plant species, earthworms, and potworms, and determined the abundance and diversity of soil invertebrates from additional samples. We aggregated the results in accordance to the methods used in the TRIAD procedure, conducted rating of the assessment methods based on their performance in terms of specific criteria, and weighted the criteria using two alternative weighting techniques to produce performance scores for each method. We faced problems in using the TRIAD procedure, for example, the results from the animal counts had to be excluded from the calculation of integrated risk estimates (IREs) because our reference soil sample showed the lowest biodiversity and abundance of soil animals. In addition, hormesis hampered the use of the results from the ecotoxicity tests. The final probabilistic IREs imply significant risks at all sampling locations. Although linking MCDA with TRIAD provided a useful means to study and consider the performance of the alternative methods in predicting ecological risks, some uncertainties involved still remained outside the quantitative analysis.

AB  - Substantial scholarly attention has been given to the effectiveness and legitimacy of private forest governance, especially the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Research has suggested that such cooperation between forest corporations and ENGOs may develop shared norms for responsible forestry. At least initially, however, conflicts are likely to occur since these stakeholders are accountable to different constituencies.Yet there are comparatively few studies on how such conflicts have affected the development and legitimacy of forest certification on the national level, which is where conflicts must be managed. This study explores how stakeholders' search for accountability has influenced the legitimacy of forest certification schemes, drawing on developments in Sweden. The study relies on the theoretical foundations of governance, legitimacy and accountability, and on reports from forest corporations and ENGOs. The results show that these stakeholders have continuously disagreed on the input and output legitimacy of forest certification, though the positions have changed over time, eventually making ENGOs reject forest certification schemes. These repeated conflicts have been fuelled by the stakeholders' search for public reputational accountability and market accountability. In effect, the very meaning of the FSC label is today being questioned. Thereby forest certification in Sweden has, at least temporarily, left the suggested path to the evolution of shared norms. These results call for related studies on how to manage accountability issues and power relations in forest certification. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - Studying the effect of surface ozone (O-3) and water stress on tree growth is important for planning sustainable forest management and forest ecology. In the present study, a 22-year long time series (1998-2019) on basal area increment (BAI) and fructification severity of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H.Karst.) at five forest sites in Western Germany (Rhineland Palatinate) was investigated to evaluate how it correlates with drought and stomatal O-3 fluxes (PODY) with an hourly threshold of uptake (Y) to represent the detoxification capacity of trees (POD1, with Y = 1 nmol O-3 m(-2) s(-1)). Between 1998 and 2019, POD1 declined over time by on average 0.31 mmol m(-2) year(-1). The BAI showed no significant trend at all sites, except in Leisel where a slight decline was observed over time (-0.37 cm(2) per year, p < 0.05). A random forest analysis showed that the soil water content and daytime O-3 mean concentration were the best predictors of BAI at all sites. The highest mean score of fructification was observed during the dry years, while low level or no fructification was observed in most humid years. Combined effects of drought and O-3 pollution mostly influence tree growth decline for European beech and Norway spruce.

AB  - Biomass derived from small-diameter, dense, thinning stands is largely underutilized within the European Union, mainly because of in-effective harvesting methods and cutting technology, leading to high supply costs. Therefore, the efficacy of boom-corridor thinning (BCT) and selective thinning (ST) on harvester felling and bunching productivity was compared for the first thinning of whole tree biomass in small-diameter, dense stands. BCT working method is when trees are cut with linear movements of the harvester's boom reach, along narrow corridors, instead of cutting each tree selectively (ST). Trials were performed in six forest stands, one in Sweden, two in Finland, and three in Slovenia, using the same harvester and operator. A time-and-motion study was carried out in 64 pre-marked study units (32 replications per method), across a variety of stand conditions. The biomass removal for both treatments averaged 40.2 dry t ha -1 and BCT productivity averaged 5.4 dry t PMh -1. For BCT, harvester work time consumption (sec tree -1) and productivity (dry t PMh -1) were on average 27% lower and 16% higher, respectively, compared with ST. The effectiveness of the accumulating felling head technology used could potentially be increased by implementing a feed-roller system when handling excessive tree lengths. Developing dedicated harvesting technology for BCT could further boost productivity, facilitating cost-effective and sustainable utilization of low-value small-diameter tree biomass and replacing fossil resources.

AB  - Within the field of climate change adaptation research, "stories" are usually simply mined for data, developed as communication and engagement technologies, and used to envision different futures. But there are other ways of understanding people's narratives. This article explores how we can move away from understanding stories as cultural constructs that represent a reality and toward understanding them as the way in which adaptation is lived. The article investigates questions such as the following: As climate adaptation researchers, what can and should we do when we are told unsolicited stories? How can storytelling, as a way of life rather than as a source of data, inform and elaborate scientific approaches to adaptation research and planning? In this article, I move away from the literature that seeks to develop narrative methods in adaptation science. Instead, I focus on stories that we do not elicit and the world-making practice of storytelling.

AB  - The share of the renewable resources used continues to grow due to environmental, economic and political reasons. Consequently, intensification of forest management is ongoing and expected to continue in the future. Logging residues, such as treetops, branches and stumps, are a significant renewable energy source. Since the logging residues are noticeably richer in nutrients than conventionally harvested stems, there is a concern related to the negative impact of intensified harvesting on the ecosystems, productivity of the sites and sustainability of forestry in general. To evaluate the impact, this study has compared different intensity harvesting effect on the next rotation young stand productivity in eight sites in Latvia. In a nutrient-rich site, the productivity of Norway spruce was higher in the whole-tree harvest (WTH) subplot comparing to stem-only harvesting (SOH) subplot three years after the planting. Productivity of Scots pine in oligotrophic conditions was observed to be higher in SOH subplot comparing to WTH subplot two and three years after planting. Furthermore, in a site on a mineral soil relatively richer in nutrients no significant differences were observed. Comparing WTH to whole tree harvest + stump biomass (SB) extraction subplots, the productivity of Norway spruce was higher in WTH four to five years after the planting; in a mixed stand of Norway spruce and black alder no productivity differences of spruce were detected, but productivity of black alder was higher in WTH+SB subplot five years after the planting; in black alder stands a significantly higher productivity was observed in WTH subplot four and five years after the planting.

AB  - In spite of the abundance of research on HRM in developing countries, there is a dearth of knowledge of what human resource (HR) practitioners actually do in developing countries. With the aid of Conner and Ulrich's widely reported framework for HR roles, we investigated the roles played by HR practitioners in a state-owned oil and gas company with a workforce of 15,000 employees. The study was based on a survey of 140 HR and line managers in the company. The main finding of the study is that even in a developing country such as Indonesia, Conner and Ulrich's (1996) model of HR roles has some validity. Our findings indicate that all the four roles are practised by HR practitioners in the company. The finding lends support to similar studies in the USA (Wright, McMahan, Snell and Gerhart 2001; Simpkins 2005), the UK (Caldwell 2003), Denmark (Lemmergaard 2009), Finland (Antila 2006) and Lithuania (Zuzeviciute and Margarita 2010). Another significant feature of the study is the revelation that HR practitioners play more strategic roles than operational roles. This is entirely unexpected. The theoretical/research and practical implications of the findings have also been discussed.

AB  - The numbers of reported human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in Europe have increased in several endemic regions (including Finland) in recent decades, indicative of an increasing threat to public health. As such, it is important to identify the regions at risk and the most influential factors associated with TBE distributions, particularly in understudied regions. This study aimed to identify the risk areas of TBE transmission in two different datasets based on human TBE disease cases from 2007 to 2011 (n = 86) and 2012-2017 (n = 244). We also examined which factors best explain the presence of human TBE cases. We used ensemble modelling to determine the relationship of TBE occurrence with environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic factors in Finland. Geospatial data including these variables were acquired from several open data sources and satellite and aerial imagery and, were processed in GIS software. Biomod2, an ensemble platform designed for species dis-tribution modelling, was used to generate ensemble models in R. The proportion of built-up areas, field, forest, and snow-covered land in November, people working in the primary sector, human population density, mean precipitation in April and July, and densities of European hares, white-tailed deer, and raccoon dogs best es-timated distribution of human TBE disease cases in the two datasets. Random forest and generalized boosted regression models performed with a very good to excellent predictive power (ROC = 0.89-0.96) in both time periods. Based on the predictive maps, high-risk areas for TBE transmission were located in the coastal regions in Southern and Western Finland (including the angstrom land Islands), several municipalities in Central and Eastern Finland, and coastal municipalities in Southern Lapland. To explore potential changes in TBE distributions in future climate, we used bioclimatic factors with current and future climate forecast data to reveal possible future hotspot areas. Based on the future forecasts, a slightly wider geographical extent of TBE risk was introduced in the angstrom land Islands and Southern, Western and Northern Finland, even though the risk itself was not increased. Our results are the first steps towards TBE-risk area mapping in current and future climate in Finland.

AB  - Tillite lithified by magnesium silicate hydrate (M-S-H) cement has been formed at the surface of the Feragen Ultramafic Body in SE Norway. Serpentinization of olivine-rich rocks led to formation of brucite, which dissolves during weathering to form a high-pH (>9) Mg-rich fluid. This fluid dissolves quartz deposited by glaciers during the Weichselian glaciation. Subsequent evaporation leads to the precipitation of a nanocrystalline magnesium silicate hydrate phase with the approximate composition Mg8Si8O20(OH)(8).6H(2)O. The resulting cemented rock is characterized by disintegrated and partly dissolved quartz grains that are surrounded by the M-S-H cement. This process occurs at surface conditions in a subarctic climate and is known to take place on a timescale of a few decades, as constrained by mining activities. Magnesium-based cement is currently of high interest as the search for environmentally friendly cement is a pressing task considering that the widely used Portland cement accounts for about 7% of the worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emission. As this study provides new key insights into the formation process of natural CO2-neutral magnesium-based cement on the field- and microscale, it could contribute in the development of a new sustainable construction material.

AB  - Purpose Transaction costs in projects can be reduced through improved collaboration between contractors and clients. The purpose of this paper is to respond to the call for further research on the framework suggested by Li et al. (2015) who presented 26 factors that determine project transaction costs. The objective is to empirically test the framework to identify factors that have the greatest influence on project collaboration so that practitioners can prioritize their efforts on the most salient factors that will improve collaboration and reduce transaction costs. Design/methodology/approach The paper employed interviews with 38 project practitioners from three different industries in Norway. The respondents had in average 20 years of professional experience. Findings The quality of communication, project uncertainty, owner's organizational efficiency, change orders and trust were the five most frequently found factors that influence both project transaction costs and collaboration level. When the authors compared findings between different industries the authors found that the quality of communication was important for all industries. The owner's organizational efficiency was also highly important in oil and gas and ICT projects. Trust was particularly important in oil and gas projects while frequency of claims was particularly important in construction projects. Originality/value The paper contributes to the conceptual theory of transaction costs and collaboration as it empirically tests and extends the framework developed by Li et al. (2015).

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore and compare three different methods for modelling potential natural vegetation (PNV), a hypothetic natural state of vegetation that shows nature's biotic potential in the absence of human influence and disturbance. The vegetation was mapped in a south-central Norwegian mountain region, in a 34.2 km(2) area around the village of Beitostolen, in 2009. The actual vegetation map (AVM) formed the basis for the development of PNV using three different modelling methods: (1) an expert-based manual modelling (EMM), (2) rule-based envelope GIS-modelling (RBM), and (3) a statistical predictive GIS-modelling method (Maxent). The article shows that the three modelling methods have different advantages, challenges and preconditions. The findings indicate that: (1) the EMM method should preferably be used only as a supplementary method in highly disturbed areas, (2) both the RBM and the Maxent methods perform well, (3) RBM performs especially well, but also Maxent are more objective methods than EMM and they are much easier to develop and re-run after model validation, (4) Maxent probably underestimates the potential distribution of some vegetation types, whereas RBM overestimates, (5) the Maxent output is relative probabilities of distribution, giving higher model variation than RBM.

CP  - ENC 98 Meeting
AB  - In a lecture give in Nice, Dr. Hans Blix, former Director General of the Vienna International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned against turning back the wheel of energy policy development. Blix sees major deficits in information among a number of politicians bearing responsibility in important European states. This was evident not only from the opt-out plans in Sweden and Germany, but also from the request to delete nuclear power from the catalog of safe and sustainable energy sources, which had been rejected in the European Parliament by a very slim majority. Actually, there were indications of the public acceptance of nuclear power being broader also with a view to problems of climate than was evident from statements by politicians. Blix accused politicians of being opportunists playing to antinuclear voters. A factor influencing this situation could be the fact that the true consequences of opting out of the use of nuclear power, including higher carbon dioxide emissions, always became apparent long after the next election date. Blix asked what the nuclear industry could do to convince the public that nuclear power, compared with other forms of energy, should be classified as a sustainable energy source not only in terms of its price, but also with respect to its environmental impact. In this connection, the former Director General of IAEA mentioned five areas in which the nuclear industry was required to make progress on its own.
   These included the need for still more safety in all areas of nuclear technology worldwide, from exploration in the uranium mines to the storage of nuclear waste, in particular, those responsible should seek to attain public acceptance of the need for nuclear waste management and storage strategies as soon as possible. Ultimately, this required nuclear organizations to seek a direct dialog with the public. Blix concluded with the statement that it was simply unconvincing to venture into a future for billions of people on earth with energy concepts dating from the period before the industrial revolution.

AB  - Environmental labeling is a valuable communication and marketing tool used to enlarge the visibility and disclosure of environmental attributes of products, processes, and services. Therefore, scientists worldwide are investigating the use of environmental labeling and its possible compliance with technical and economic standards. This paper has examined the scientific output on environmental labeling over the past twenty-two years, reviewing the literature in three scientific databases. A total of 1,246 articles indexed out of 580 magazines were retrieved. The USA contributed most publications on environmental labels. European countries, such as Italy and Sweden, discussed labeling in the food industry, transportation, and forest certification. Brazil is leading Latin America in publications, including the food industry and civil construction. Type I ISO labeling has been the most used, followed by a growing number of publications on Type III ISO labels in recent years. The results display a tendency in aquaculture and food applications in Europe and South America, exhibiting a panorama of advancing scientific and practical strength of environmental labeling in such areas. Finally, we recommend simple, step-by-step activities for consumers to obtain additional benefits by choosing more sustainable products based on the information available on environmental labels.

AB  - The aim of the study was determination of air pollution impact of the copper smelter in Bor and its surroundings (Serbia) by assessing the suitability of birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and spruce (Picea abies L.) for the purposes of biomonitoring and comparing it with previously published data from the same study area. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb and Mn in leaves/needles, branches, roots and soil were determined. Sampling was performed during 2009 in two zones with high load of air pollution due to copper mining and smelting activities, and one background zone. Metal accumulation and translocation was evaluated in terms of biological factors. In addition, plant enrichment factor was calculated. According to the results, plant foliage was not enriched through soil, which indicates absorption from the air, with both species acting as excluders of Cu, Pb, Zn and Mn. Leaves were more enriched with all the metals than needles, indicating a better response of birch to airborne pollution than spruce. Cluster analysis showed different level of pollution at the sites, while correlations between Cu and Pb obtained by Principal Component Analysis indicated their anthropogenic origin. Regarding previously published results, beside birch leaves, pine needles (which showed higher level of response to pollution compared to linden leaves) could be applied in air biomonitoring surveys near copper smelters.

AB  - This work compares the different methods of transport used to import pellets, through a case study of pellets imported into Italy. The objective was to evaluate the economic and environmental sustainability of the different transport methods, the former via a cost analysis, and the latter via an LCA analysis. In particular, the method of transport by sea from Virginia (USA) was compared to overland transport from some European locations. Industrial pellet markets strictly depend on the import of wood pellets from outside the EU-27. The analysis of transport phase is therefore crucial, for inspecting the consequences of transporting such a commodity along considerable distances and allowing decision makers to make strategic decisions about trade planning, optimize international routes, and choose the most sustainable transport methods. The economic analysis showed that road transport cost ranged from 18 to 112 (sic) t(-1), while sea cost from 68 to 82 (sic) t(-1). Concerning the environmental evaluation, the impact categories most involved were Fossil Fuels, Respiratory Inorganics and Land Use, showing that the critical points in the transport phase are the oil consumption per km and the production of high quantities of SO2 and NOx. Basically, transport by sea appeared to be better, from the economic viewpoint, and for what concerns one of the major environmental impacts involved (fossil fuels) and primary energy consumption, compared to road transport from some of the European locations normally supplying the Italian market. On the contrary, road transport was preferred if transporting pellets from locations nearest to Italy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ability of a coastal settlement to adapt to climate change is largely dependent upon access to a range of resources, which many coastal towns and small cities lack. Coastal small towns of less than 10,000 are therefore at a significant disadvantage compared to larger settlements when it comes to adaptation. One way to begin to overcome this disadvantage is to compare coastal small towns in order to identify efficiencies and support knowledge sharing. In this article we present and analyse five case studies of coastal small towns: Fuvemeh, Ghana; Kiyu, Uruguay; Hanko, Finland; Lemvig, Denmark; and Nome, Alaska, USA. A number of key outcomes and lessons were identified which highlights the need for a formal network of international coastal small towns to encourage and develop knowledge sharing practices going forward. A further lesson is the importance of using a range of indicators in order to establish the regional/national importance of a town. Basing this solely on population size can result in an erroneous interpretation of the significance (and therefore adaptive capacity) of a coastal small town. Finally, despite many barriers to adaptation in coastal small towns, being small offers some potential advantages, such as the possibility of being able to form a community consensus more easily, using 3D visualisations for adaptation planning, and having managed realignment as a realistic management option. It is imperative that climate change resilience in coastal small towns is increased by focussing on overcoming barriers and developing appropriate adaptation approaches by governments, non-governmental organisations, business, and researchers.

AB  - The management system for solid and liquid organic waste affects the environment and surrounding technical systems in several ways. In order to decrease the environmental impact and resource use, biological waste treatment and alternative solutions for sewage treatment are often advocated. These alternatives include increased agricultural use of waste residuals. To analyse whether such proposed systems indicate improvements for the environment and its sustainability, systems analysis is a useful method The changes in environmental impact and resource use is not only a result of changes in waste treatment methods, but also largely a result of changes in surrounding systems (energy and agriculture) caused by changes in waste management practices. In order to perform a systems analysis, a substance-flow simulation model, the organic waste research model (ORWARE), has been used. The results are evaluated by using methodology from life cycle assessment (LCA). An economic analysis was also performed on three of the studied scenarios. The management system for solid organic waste and sewage in the municipality of Uppsala, Sweden, was studied. Three scenarios for different treatments of solid waste were analysed: incineration with heat recovery, composting, and anaerobic digestion. These three scenarios included conventional sewage treatment. A fourth scenario reviewed was anaerobic digestion of solid waste, using urine-separating toilets and separate handling of the urine fraction. The results are only valid for the case study and under the assumptions made. In this case study anaerobic digestion result in the lowest environmental impact of all the solid waste management systems, but is costly. Economically, incineration with heat recovery is the cheapest way to treat solid waste. Composting gives environmental advantages compared to incineration methods, without significantly increased costs. Urine separation, which may be implemented together with any solid waste treatment, has great advantages, particularly in its low impact on the environment. However, there is a large increase in acidification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conventional farmers converting to organics have contributed to most of the rapid expansion of organic farming in recent years. The new organic farmers may differ from their more established colleagues, which may have implications for the development of the organic farming sector and its distinctiveness vis-a-vis conventional production and marketing practices. The aim of this study was to explore Norwegian organic dairy farmers' personal and farm production characteristics, farming goals, conversion motives, and attitudes to organic farming, grouped by year of conversion (three groups). A postal survey was undertaken among organic dairy farmers (n=161). The results show that the newcomers (converted in 2000 or later) were less educated than the early entrants (the so-called 'old guard') who converted in 1995 or earlier. The frequency of activities like vegetable growing and poultry farming among the old guard was high. The late-entry organic herds were fed with more concentrates and had a higher milk production intensity, showed a higher incidence of veterinary treatments and less frequent use of alternative medicine than the herds of the two earlier converting groups. For all groups of farmers, the highest ranked farming goals were sustainable and environment-friendly farming and the production of high-quality food. Late entrants more often mentioned goals related to profit and leisure time. On average, the most frequently mentioned motives for conversion were food quality and professional challenges. The old guard was more strongly motivated by food quality and soil fertility/pollution issues than the others, whereas financial reasons (organic payments included) were relatively more important among the newcomers. All groups held very favorable views about the environmental qualities of organic farming methods, albeit with different strengths of beliefs. Even though trends towards more pragmatic and business-oriented farming were found, the majority of the newcomers were fairly committed.

AB  - The aim of this article is to contribute to the discussions about the relationship between feminism and neoliberalism and the status of feminist emancipatory claims in marketized policy fields. My approach has been to analyse gender equality work within the highly marketized field of regional development in Sweden with a specific interest for how the convergence of the policy goals of gender equality and economic growth is represented by gender equality workers and to discuss the status of feminist emancipatory claims in this policy field. The analysis consists of articulating three representations of the relationship between gender equality and economic growth, characterized by various degrees of conflict: reciprocity, co-optation and Trojan horses. However, none of the representations articulate open emancipatory claims as legitimate within the field of regional development. Thus, the study shows gender equality in its relationship to economic growths renders emancipatory claims illegitimate unless beneficial for economic growth or hidden trough marketized language or logics.

AB  - Tree-ring stable isotopes, providing insight into drought-induced eco-physiological mechanisms, are frequently used to reconstruct past changes in growing season temperature and precipitation. Their climatic response is, however, still not fully understood, particularly for data originating from non-extreme, mid-latitude environments with differing ecological conditions. Here, we assess the response of delta C-13, delta O-18 and tree-ring width (TRW) from a temperate mountain forest in the Austrian pre-Alps to climate and specific drought events. Variations in stem growth and isotopic composition of Norway spruce, common beech and European larch from dry, medium and moist sites are compared with records of sunshine, temperature, moisture, precipitation and cloud cover. Results indicate uniform year-to-year variations in delta C-13 and delta O-18 across sites and species, but distinct differences in TRW according to habitat and species. While the climate sensitivity of TRW is overall weak, the delta C-13 and delta O-18 chronologies contain significant signals with a maximum sensitivity to cloud cover changes (r = -0.72 for delta O-18). The coherent inter-annual isotopic variations are accompanied by substantial differences in the isotopic signatures with offsets up to similar to 3aEuro degrees for delta C-13, indicating species-specific physiological strategies and varying water-use efficiencies. During severe summer drought, beech and larch benefit from access to deeper and moist soils, allowing them to keep their stomata open. This strategy is accompanied by an increased water loss through transpiration, but simultaneously enables enhanced photosynthesis. Our findings indicate the potential of tree-ring stable isotopes from temperate forests to reconstruct changes in cloud cover, and to improve knowledge on basic physiological mechanisms of tree species growing in different habitats to cope with soil moisture deficits.

AB  - The Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus is one of the most important marine resources for European fisheries. However, overfishing has caused the stocks to decline over the last decades, particularly in the Mediterranean Sea. The implementation of no-take marine reserves could change these current trends, thus achieving a more sustainable fishery. The effectiveness of no-take reserves depends on optimal size design, and because of this, new behavioural data on the spatial ecology of the species are of pivotal importance. Here, for the first time, we investigated the spatial movements and daily activity patterns of Norway lobster in a deep-water (315-475 m depth) no-take marine reserve of 10 km(2) in the continental slope of the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, by combining acoustic tracking and tagging-recapture procedures. The results revealed the territorial behaviour of Norway lobster, centred in small exclusive individual areas where most displacements took place at midday. We found that once settled in a place, their home ranges reached approximate sizes of 17.75 to 736.25 m(2), suggesting that no-take marine areas focussed on recovering Norway lobster populations do not require large extents to be effective. Tag-recapture data indicated minimal spillover of biomass, implying that Norway lobsters are site settled and do not perform large movements. Future studies on larval spread and recruitment would be necessary to focus on the possible spillover benefit for fisheries. The acoustic telemetry system used in the present experiment effectively revealed the range of movement of individuals, and thus represents a promising monitoring tool to assess no-take marine reserve sizes and reciprocal spacing for deep-water demersal resources.

AB  - Information on the temporal stability of genetic structures is important to permit detection of changes that can constitute threats to biological resources. Large-scale harvesting operations are known to potentially alter the composition and reduce the variability of populations, and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) has a long history of heavy exploitation. In the Baltic Sea and Skagerrak waters, the census population sizes have declined by 35-50% over the last three decades. We compared the genetic structure of Atlantic herring in these waters sampled at least two different times between 1979 and 2003 by assaying 11 allozyme and nine microsatellite loci. We cannot detect any changes in the amount of genetic variation or spatial structure, and differentiation is weak with overall F-ST-0.003 among localities for the older samples and F-ST=0.002 for the newer ones. There are indications of temporal allele frequency changes, particularly in one of five sampling localities that is reflected in a relatively small local N-e estimate of c. 400. The previously identified influence of selection at the microsatellite locus Cpa112 remains stable over the 24-year period studied here. Despite little genetic differentiation, migration among localities appears small enough to permit demographic independence between populations.

AB  - The unknown and exotic North fascinated European minds in the early modern period. A land of natural and supernatural wonders, and of the indigenous Sami people, the northern margins of Europe stirred up imagination and a plethora of cultural fantasies, which also affected early antiquarian research and the period understanding of the past. This article employs an alleged runestone discovered in northernmost Sweden in the seventeenth century to explore how ancient times and northern margins of the continent were understood in early modern Europe. We examine how the peculiar monument of the Vinsavaara stone was perceived and signified in relation to its materiality, landscape setting, and the cultural-cosmological context of the Renaissance-Baroque world. On a more general level, we use the Vinsavaara stone to assess the nature and character of early modern antiquarianism in relation to the period's nationalism, colonialism and classicism.

AB  - It is argued that sustainability transition in agriculture requires a shift from a regime oriented towards increasing agricultural productivity to a regime in which the environmental and social effects of production are regarded as central. Practice theories represent an emerging perspective on analysing sustainability transitions and provide a way to focus on farming activities and their changes. Focusing on practice elements - materials, meanings and competences - we explore the prospects of applying practice theory when analysing differentiation and change in agricultural fertilisation practices. Empirically, the article is based on semi-open qualitative interviews among Finnish farmers. We identified five different fertilisation practices. The differences and changes in practices could be explained by the diverse and hierarchically organised purposes in farming which contributed to different elements and their linkages in the performance of the practices. Consciously cultivating changes in meaning are especially important in facilitating the change in practices.

AB  - The demand for seafood is increasing globally and is being met, in some cases, by unsustainable fishing practices. When a country fishes outside of its jurisdiction, any negative social and environmental impacts associated with fishing are displaced to the fished location and may not be compensated. This is particularly problematic when a country fishes in jurisdictions with poorer, less-effective, fisheries management than itself (henceforth 'unequal displacement'). Using two different indices for national fisheries management effectiveness, we calculated unequal displacement of wild-capture seafood globally. We found that up to 23% (19.8 Mt) of seafood was unequally displaced annually between 1976-2015, most of which was caught in the high seas. During the period that the management effectiveness data is most accurate (2007-2011), almost all 172 countries unequally displace seafood (n = 123), but a few are responsible for the majority (China, India, Japan, Norway, Russia, Republic of Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand). Achieving both sustainable food provision and ocean health requires improving international fishing and trade policies targeted at these countries to encourage the reduction of unequal seafood displacement.

AB  - Sea level rise (SLR) caused by climate change presents challenges for public planners all over the world. In this study, practical challenges and ethical factors in adaptation to SLR were identified based on interviews with planners in Sweden. Six challenges were identified: lack of knowledge and human resources, lacking integration and coordination, lacking or insufficient frameworks for dealing with long-time-horizons, responsibility for implementation and financing, and goal conflicts in the process of implementing adaptation policy. These challenges are then developed into a typology of ethical factors that are of particular importance for adaptation to SLR, categorised as input-oriented, process-oriented and outcome-oriented ethical factors. The challenges and ethical factors identified in this paper are the first step taken towards answering the question of what a sustainable and ethical adaptation to SLR in the context of local and regional policy-making could look like.

AB  - Depredation on livestock and competition with hunters for game species are prominent among the conflicts that the return of large carnivores generates in multi-use landscapes. The relative magnitude of the conflict strongly depends on what prey selection patterns predators will adopt once established in a new area. We explored prey selection and kill rates from 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Southern Norway, between 2006 and 2011, using Global Positioning System collars. We recorded 603 lynx predation events on a wide range of prey species, ranging from passerines to large ungulates. During summer, domestic sheep were the most frequent prey, representing 64% of the ungulates killed, for an average kill rate of 8.2/100 days, whereas roe deer Capreolus capreolus were killed in about 33% of cases (kill rate = 4.2/100 days). In winter, when sheep were unavailable, roe deer were the most frequent prey, accounting for about 73% of the kills, for an average kill rate of 9.4/100 days, whereas red deer were found at 17% of the kill sites, corresponding to a kill rate of 2.2/100 days. Lynx-killed prey provided an average of 400kg of meat per 100 days, irrespective of prey density. In both seasons, the proportion of each species killed by lynx was determined by the combined effect of all prey densities, so that the density of wild ungulates had the potential to affect the rate of depredation on sheep, to the same extent as the abundance of sheep could influence the kill rate on wild ungulates. Our results underline the complexity of carnivore-ungulate trophic interactions in multi-use landscapes where livestock and wildlife co-occur, and suggest that changes in densities of prey, predators or both may produce undesired outcomes, if such complexity is not taken into account during the decision-making process for management and conservation.

TI  - Developments in the ecology, evolution, and behaviour of the charrs, genus <i>Salvelinus</i>:: relevance for their management and conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
LA  - English
CP  - 4th International Charr Symposium
AB  - Salvelinus species are one of the most thoroughly studied groups of fishes. Many reasons explain this intense interest in charr biology. First, charrs have a Holarctic distribution encompassing many Asian, North American, and European countries and occupy a diversity of aquatic environments, including both marine and freshwater habitats. For instance, the presence of anadromous, stream-resident, and lacustrine life histories within and among species provides a rich template for ecological and physiological study and experimentation. Second, most of the current distribution of charr includes areas that were directly influenced by climate and topographic change associated with the many Pleistocene glaciations. This means that there has been tremendous opportunity for repeated episodes of isolation, divergence in distinct refugia (and different selective environments), and recontact between divergent lineages. Undoubtably, these conditions have promoted much of the tremendous morphological, ecological, and genetic variability and plasticity within species of the genus and make charr very good models to study evolutionary processes 'in action'. Third, many charr species exhibit demographic characteristics such as slow growth, late maturity, and life in extreme environments, that perhaps make them more susceptible to extinction from habitat changes and overexploitation, particularly because they often occupy depauperate aquatic habitats. This vulnerability makes understanding their biology of great relevance to biodiversity and conservation. Finally, charr are of great cultural, commercial, and recreational significance to many communities, and their intimate linkage with human societies has therefore undoubtedly stimulated much interest in this enigmatic genus.
   During the last two decades, a series of events and publications have contributed markedly to the advancement of knowledge on Salvelinus species. In 1980, a first important monograph 'Charrs: Salmonid fishes of the genus Salvelinus' was edited by Eugene Balon. This monograph (Balon 1980) contains reviews of the main species as well as original studies on taxonomy, biogeography, phylogeny, morphology, ontogeny, ethology, physiology, and ecology of charr over their geographical distribution. Soon after, and stimulated by Balon's (1980) monograph, the first International Charr Symposium was held in Winnipeg (Canada) from 4 to 8 May 1981. This symposium was devoted mainly to Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, and lead to the publication of the proceedings 'Biology of the Arctic charr' edited by Johnson & Burns (1984). The second International Charr Symposium was held in Sapporo (Japan) from 3 to 9 October 1988. The organizers extended their symposium to Masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou masou, because of the similarities in life histories of Masu salmon and charrs and because the salmon's distribution is confined to the northern far East. The proceedings of this symposium were published in a special issue of Physiology and Ecology Japan, edited by Kawanabe et al. (1989). The third International Charr Symposium was held in Trondheim (Norway) from 3 to 18 June 1994, and a collection of papers presented at this symposium was published in a special issue of Nordic Journal of Freshwater Research, edited by Klemetsen et al. (1995).
   The fourth International Charr Symposium was held in Trois-Rivieres (Canada) from 25 June to 1 July 2000. This special volume of Environmental Biology of Fishes is devoted to a selection of papers presented at this symposium. A total of 123 presentations (72 talks and 5 1 posters) were given at the symposium, which attracted more than 160 scientists from 12 different countries (Canada, England, France, Finland, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Russia, Scotland, Sweden, USA). To pursue the tradition of the charr symposia, concurrent sessions were avoided in order to bring together all participants and allow them to attend every presentation. The opening keynote lecture was presented by Geoffrey Power and invited speakers opened most of the topical sessions. A poster session was held in the main mail of the Conference Center, and posters were kept in the mail for the duration of the Symposium, giving them additional visibility. The Symposium was followed by a scientific excursion to James Bay, northern Quebec, which attracted 45 participants.
   The organisation of the fourth International Charr Symposium as well as the production of this special issue would have not been possible without the enthusiasm, involvement, and commitment of many persons and organisations. We first express our special acknowledgements to the students who played a major role in the symposium organisation and logistics, Julie Adams, Melanie Caron, Angelique Dupuch, Danielle Heroux, Guillaume Lapierre, Raphael Proulx, Martin-Hugues St-Laurent, and Isabelle St-Onge from the Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres.

We thank Office du Tourisme et des Congres de Trois-Rivieres and Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres for their invaluable logistic support. We thank Eugene Balon and David Noakes. who supported the project of a special volume on Salvelinus species, and the numerous referees, listed at the end of this journal's Volume, for their careful reviews of the papers submitted for publication. We are very grateful to Laure Devine and Raphael Proulx for their meticulous work with editing and processing of papers published in this volume. Eugene Balon was also particularly helpful with the final editorial process. Finally, we want to express Our gratitude to the invited speakers and to all participants at the Symposium as well as to authors of this special volume for their significant scientific contributions.

AB  - An extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied by means of Structural Equation Modelling to testing various hypotheses on attitudes and intentions of dairy farmers towards three novel sustainable production strategies, as well as the influence of organic practices and collaborative behaviours, such as information sharing with supply-chain partners. Data on the acceptance of three sustainable production strategies, namely Agro-forestry, Alternative protein source, and Prolonged maternal feeding were collected by a survey of dairy farmers in six European Union (EU) countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, United Kingdom). We found that perceived usefulness is the key determinant of acceptance, while the intention to adopt a sustainable production strategy may derive from the influence of opinions (and behaviours) of relevant others (e.g., leading dairy farmers, family members, advisors) showing the role of interactions among farmers and other stakeholders in the adoption of innovations. Finally, the perceived usefulness of all of the investigated strategies is higher for organic farmers, while collaborative patterns reduce the impact of subjective norm on usefulness and overall acceptance. Our findings should encourage policy makers to consider the important role of supply chain management practices, including collaboration, to enhance the sustainability of dairy farming systems.

AB  - Scoping studies of mining investment projects are based on initial drilling data and expert assumptions, generally including an elementary mine plan, a processing method and preliminary estimates of the financial outcomes. They are not detailed enough for investment decision making but should provide at least sufficient knowledge of the project's risks.
   In this paper, the Cinovec lithium project in the Czech Republic will be assessed at the scoping study level. Data used for this analysis were collected by the Czechoslovakian government from the 1960s to the 1980s. Nevertheless, only information related with significant drill intercepts and the analysis made of the samples was used. Thus, the conclusions that were obtained cannot be considered in any way as a professional recommendation for investment.
   The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that scoping studies based on adequate data gathered from similar mining investment projects around the world can help to make the case for quick, early, and sound strategic decisions, something that may be especially crucial for small mineral development companies to decide whether they should proceed with further project developments.
   The basis for this analysis will be the previously published paper, "Lithium mining: accelerating the transition to sustainable energy", in which five ready-to-go lithium mining investment projects were studied around the world: Whabouchi Project (Canada), Keliber Project (Finland), Cauchari-Olaroz Salars Project (Argentina), Sonora Project (Mexico), and Pilgangoora Project (Australia).

AB  - Energy has been the cornerstone for all the technological advancements that are happening in the world. The need for energy at present is great than ever before and it is foreseen to rise in the future, as a result, it triggered us to look into zero-emission alternatives i.e. renewables to meet our energy demand. Energy demand surge is not the only cause, rising fossil fuel prices and global warming are among the major factor for such a verdict. Governments of nearly all the nation are taking the necessary measures that will result in a greater good. Carbon neutralization is a feat that every nation must attain to ensure sustainable global development, renewables prove to be the best tool to achieve it. The scope of the study is to analyse both the drivers and de-motivators for renewable energy development for the study nations including India, China, Iceland, Sweden, and the US are taken into account, each country has its unique strongholds in renewable energy genesis. This work will give a descriptive overview of the country's renewable assets and its green future by means of a SWOT analysis where each country will be assessed based on the four parameters namely Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats for renewable resources. This study has been carried out to access each country potential for renewable energy generation. The motive for selecting these countries is that, these countries show promising outcomes to the leap towards green energy generation and utilization. Their positive results are due to various factors that will be analysed in this work. Additionally an arithmetic based approach was formulated to identify which of the countries will be able to attain Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Media representations of the future are a key component of climate change and energy policies. This study integrates media analysis with futures studies and focuses on the media framings and representations of futures related to key national-level energy and climate strategy documents. It utilizes qualitative content analysis of online news articles of Finland's national public broadcasting company committed to high-quality journalism. The results show that a more multifaceted coverage of climate action increased during the study period of 2015-2020, especially in terms of frames and future scenario archetypes, and indicate gradually widening awareness of climate risks. However, climate change has been framed as an isolated policy area, and climate change mitigation and adaptation remain framed as subordinate to economic policy targets.

AB  - The direction taken towards sustainable power system and renewable energy generation is now irreversible. The power grid needs to host more renewable energy sources, such as solar power, and tackle power quality problems that come along with it. In this paper, firstly, the Hosting Capacities (HCs), of Photo-Voltaic (PV), were found for various regions and their limiting constraints were defined. Afterwards, comparison was made with the HC values obtained for different voltage value standards defined by various countries. Next, single-phase PV connection percentages in the network were defined that makes the voltage unbalance the limiting factor for HC. Lastly, the HC of the solar generation coupled with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) was assessed for the Finnish Low-Voltage (LV) grids. Different BESS-based scenarios were employed and their impact on voltage unbalance and HCs were observed. Finally, also the load voltage unbalance was incorporated to make the approach realistic and its impact on HC was analyzed. Results reveal that, depending on the connection strategy, the BESS can increase as well as decrease the HC based on voltage unbalance criteria. However, the load voltage unbalance has little effect on the solar HC values.

AB  - Engineers of today require a holistic understanding of the lifecycle of products and processes, from conceptualization to operations. Maintenance and reliability are areas receiving increased attention due to the contribution to sustainable industry practices. The related literature describes ways to strengthen the education with respect to curricula and teaching, but studies on the extent and content of maintenance-related education in engineering programs are lacking. The purpose of this study is to describe the maintenance-related education content in Swedish engineering programs. The main objects of study are the curricula and courses of engineering programs in Sweden. In total, 123 Bachelor of Engineering and 119 Master of Engineering programs were studied, as well as 36 maintenance-related courses. It was found that 12% of the engineering programs include one or more maintenance-related course, either mandatory or elective. On the Master of Engineering level, only 4% of the programs include mandatory maintenance-related courses. The corresponding number for Bachelor of Engineering programs is 15%. The courses are typically of 6-7.5 credits, but as low as under one credit worth of maintenance-related content is seen, as well as two specialized programs offering up to 60 credits. Of the 36 courses, 20 have a distinct maintenance focus, 2 are degree thesis courses, and 2 are within reliability engineering, while the rest have a focus in other areas. The lack of maintenance-related education makes future engineers less prepared to make good decisions and judgments that might affect the operational phase of the product or system.

AB  - This study focuses on the contemporary use of two well-known Sami offering sites in Alta, Finnmark, Norway. Today, these are hiking destinations and sightseeing points for both the Sami and the non-Sami local population, as well as a few non-local visitors. Many of these visitors leave objects at the sites, such as parts of recently slaughtered reindeer, clothing, coins, toys, sweet wrappers and toilet paper. This indicates that visitors have different levels of knowledge about and reverence for the traditional significance of these places. Through repeated surveys over several years, we also observed a certain development and change in the number and character of these depositions, as well as a variation in depositions between different sites. A series of interviews with various users and key stakeholders were performed to clarify the reasons for these changing practices, as well as what individuals and groups visit these sites, their motivation for doing so and for leaving specific objects, and what potential conflict of interest there is between different users. Furthermore, we surveyed what information has been available to the public about these sites and their significance in Sami religion and cultural history over time. The results show that a diverse group of individuals visit the sites for a variety of reasons, and that there are contrasting views on their use, even among different Sami stakeholders. While it is difficult to limit the knowledge and use of these places because they are already well known, more information about old Sami ritual practices and appropriate behaviour at such sites may mediate latent conflicts and promote a better understanding of the importance of offering sites in both past and present Sami societies.

AB  - Visions of smart energy systems are increasingly influencing energy systems around the world. Many visions entail ideas of more efficient versions of existing large-scale energy systems, where smart grids serve to balance energy consumption and demand over large areas. At the other end of the spectrum are visions of smart energy places that represent a challenge to dominant, large-scale energy systems, based on smart microgrids that facilitate the self-sufficiency of local, decentralized energy systems. Whereas smart energy places do not necessarily aim to create completely isolated microgrids, they generally aim to strengthen the connection between energy consumption and production within delimited spaces. The aim of this article is to better understand how visions of smart energy places are translated into sociomaterial configurations. Smart Grid Gotland and Climate-Smart Hyllie were two Swedish initiatives where notions of place were central to the attempts to reconfigure the local energy system. Several solutions proposed within these smart energy places struggled because of regulatory lock-in to the existing spatial arrangements of the electricity market. There was a mismatch between the larger spatial scales institutionalized in the Swedish electricity market and the smaller scales introduced in these smart energy places. The conflicting spatial arrangements between electricity market and these initiatives suggest that demonstrations of smart energy places require some degree of protection from market regulations. Without this protection, visions of smart energy places might instead result in incremental changes to existing large-scale energy systems. Key Words: energy systems, place, smart cities, smart grids, visions.

AB  - The paper examines the introduction of the so-called professor's privilege in Sweden in the 1940s and shows how this legal principle for university patents emerged out of reforms of techno-science and the patent law around World War II. These political processes prompted questions concerning the nature and functions of university research: How is academic science different than other forms of knowledge production? What are the contributions of universities for economy and welfare? Who is the rightful owner of scientific findings? Is academic science "work"? By following the introduction of the professor's privilege, the paper shows how spokespersons for the academic profession addressed such questions and contributed to a new definition of university science through boundary-setting, normative descriptions, and by producing symbolic relationships between science and the economy. The totality of those positions is here referred to as a "nomos" - that is: a generic and durable set of seemingly axiomatic claims about universities. This Swedish nomos, as it took shape in the 1940s, amalgamated classical notions of academic science as exceptional and autonomous with emerging ideas of inventiveness and close connections between academics and business. Crucially, though, the academic-industrial relations embedded in this nomos were private and individual, thus in sharp conflict with the ideas of entrepreneurial universities evolving globally by the end of the 20th century.

AB  - A crucial aspect in environmental sciences is related to the transportation, accumulation and fate of solid organic pollutants. Coal-derived particles originating from mines, as well as from processing and power plants, tend to disseminate over long distances either as air- or water-borne material, and finally precipitate and mix with sediments and/or the topsoils. By applying organic-petrography methods, discrimination between natural and anthropogenic solid-organic residues can be achieved.
   In this study we present the petrographical features of seven samples obtained from lake sediments from Sweden, Finland and The Netherlands. Most of the samples represent the uppermost layers, which accumulated during the recent past. Their total organic carbon content ranges between 1.5 and 20%. Density separations using heavy liquids were applied, in order to concentrate the organic matter and thus to facilitate the petrographical determinations. The organic-matter fraction of each sample was embedded with epoxy resin and prepared for microscopic examination.
   The microscopic approach is based on the maceral nomenclature applied for coals. In each sample, 500 organic particles (i.e., macerals) were determined. The maceral features revealed significant variations on the origin and hence, the type of the contained organic matter. Apart from the modern plant debris contained in the surface sediments, and the algae indicating water-saturated conditions, several "more mature" humic material, as well as artificially oxidized organic particles were identified. In other words, some of the samples correspond to blends of naturally and artificially derived solid-organic material. The latter constitutes organic pollutants, which include unburnt residues of high-rank coals identified as vitrinites, and oxidized tissues referred to as chars. The sample that contained the higher percentage of vitrinites and chars originates from a heavily industrialized area. Huminite, which represents the humic fraction of plant-derived remnants, includes the predominant organic tissues in most of the samples, with values ranging between 40-80 vol.-% on dry, mineral matter-free basis (dmmf). Vitrinite was identified in various amounts, and particularly in one sample its content reaches up to 40 vol.-% (dmmo indicating the intense pollution of the respective area. Liptinite that corresponds to hydrogen-rich plant remnants like lipids, cuticles, waxes, spores and algae, ranges from 2-51 vol.-% (dmmg. Inertinite, which includes the oxidized (naturally or artificially) organic particles, shows values between 1-21 vol.-% (dmmf]l. The quantification of the solid organic contaminants is relatively easy under the microscope with the limitation of the grain size (> 5 mu m). Hence, significant information can be obtained regarding the trace and mapping of the contamination impact in certain areas.

AB  - As our world becomes increasingly digitalized, data centers as operational bases for these technologies lead to a consequent increased release of excess heat into the surrounding environment. This paper studies the challenges and opportunities of industrial symbiosis between data centers' excess heat and greenhouse farming, specifically utilizing the north of Sweden as a case study region. The region was selected in a bid to tackle the urgent urban issue of self-sufficiency in local food production. A synergetic approach towards engaging stakeholders from different sectors is presented through a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to facilitate resilient data-center-enabled food production. The paper delivers on possible future solutions on implementing resource efficiency in subarctic regions.

AB  - This article gives a state of the art overview on quantitative analyses from Norway and Sweden of Life cycle analyses (LCA), which compare the environmental impacts of substitution between wood and alternative materials, with emphasis on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, economics and methodological issues. In all studies referred to this overview, wood is a better alternative than other materials with regard to GHG emissions. Furthermore, wood is causing less emissions of SO2 and generates less waste compared to the alternative materials. Preservative treated wood, on the other hand, might have toxicological impacts on human health and ecosystems. Impacts on acidification, eutrofication and creation of photochemical ozone vary in different comparisons. Amount of greenhouse gases avoided due to substitution between wood and steel is in the range of 36-530 kg CO2-equivalents per in 3 input of timber with 4% discount rate; depending on waste management of the materials, and how carbon fixation on forest land is included. This amount is 93-1062 kg CO2-equivalents for substitution between wood and concrete, if the wood is not landfilled after use. Many of the LCAs could be considerably improved, if the analyses were done with several alternative assumptions regarding boundaries of the system used in the LCA. This is important, not least to map what are the main assumptions for the results obtained and to compare with other studies. It is also important to consider the time-profile of the GHG emissions and other impacts over the life-cycle-it is surprising that this is not taken more seriously. Wood as a building material is competitive on price in those studies that include costs. It is a weak point of many LCAs that costs as well as other economic aspects influencing product substitution are not included, and a major research challenge is to combine traditional LCA with economic analysis in order to make both more policy relevant. In particular, one should develop dynamic input/output models where price and income substitutions as well as technological changes and cost components are included endogenously.

AB  - Two new species of the thyasirid genus Spinaxinus (S. emicatus Oliver n. sp. and S. phrixicus Oliver n. sp.) are described from the Gulf of Mexico and the southwest Pacific, respectively. Both are compared with the type species of the genus, the eastern Atlantic S. sentosus Oliver and Holmes, 2006. Living specimens from the Gulf of Mexico were retrieved from artificial sulfide bio-generators on the upper Louisiana Slope. Gill morphology and molecular markers from the symbiotic bacteria confirm that Spinaxinus is chemosynthetic and that the chemoautotrophic bacteria are related to sulfide oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria. Living specimens from the southwest Pacific were retrieved from hydrothermal vent sites in the Fiji and Lau Back Arc Basins. In the Atlantic Spinaxinus is now recorded from two anthropogenic situations and appears to be generally absent from natural cold seep sites and not yet recorded at any hydrothermal sites. The primarily anthropogenic distribution of Spinaxinus in the Atlantic is discussed with reference to the natural hydrothermal vent habitat of the Pacific S. phrixicus.

AB  - As hotspots of local biodiversity in the deep sea, preservation of cold-water coral reef communities is of great importance. In European waters the most extensive reefs are found at depths of 300 - 500 m on the continental margin. In Norwegian waters many of these reefs are located in areas of interest for oil and gas exploration and production. In this study drilling was carried out in the Morvin drill field in proximity to a number of small Lophelia pertusa coral reefs (closest reefs 100 m upstream and 350 m downstream of point of waste drill material release). In a novel monitoring study, ROV video surveys of 9 reefs were conducted prior, during, immediately after and > 1 year after drilling operations. Behavior of coral polyps inhabiting reefs exposed to differing concentrations of drill cuttings and drilling fluids (waste drilling material) were compared. Levels of expected exposure to these waste materials were determined for each reef by modelling drill cutting transport following release, using accurate in-situ hydrodynamic data collected during the drilling period and drill cutting discharge data as parameters of a dispersal model. The presence / absence of associate reef species (Acesta excavata, Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis) were also determined from each survey video. There were no significant differences in Lophelia pertusa polyp behavior in corals modelled to have been exposed to pulses of > 25 ppm drill cutting material and those modelled to be exposed to negligible concentrations of material. From the video data collected, there were no observed degradations of reef structure over time, nor reductions of associate fauna abundance, regardless of modelled exposure concentration at any of the surveyed reefs. This study focused exclusively on adult fauna, and did not assess the potential hazard posed by waste drilling material to coral or other larvae. Video data was collected by various ROV's, using different camera and lighting setups throughout the survey campaign, making comparison of observations prior, during and post drilling problematic. A standardization of video monitoring in future monitoring campaigns is recommended.

AB  - Urban air pollution is a health hazard linked to anthropogenic emissions. Reliable evaluation of changes in pollutants due to altered emissions requires considering meteorological and other variability influencing concentrations. Here, a combination of ensemble learning, competitive learning and unsupervised clustering is proposed and applied to leverage the change analysis of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants.
   Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Random Forest (RF) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were trained with historical meteorological data, pollutant concentrations and traffic indicators. The importance of different variables for local PM(2.5)( )was determined with RF. SOM was configured for multivariable cluster analysis. The trained SOM enabled predicting a cluster for new data representing conditions with shifted anthropogenic activity. The prediction forms a benchmark for the analysed period with maximized meteorological similarity, which facilitates identifying changes in ambient pollutants due to changed emissions.
   The method was applied to data from the start of COVID-19 pandemic, 3/2020, when emissions suddenly decreased. For measurements from Helsinki, Finland, the SOM yielded a statistically significant change in PM2.5 (-0.7%), NO2 (-33%) and O-3 (+17%). Comparing data from 3/2020 to data from 3/2017-2019 produced different results (PM2.5 -1.7%, NO2 -37%, O-3 -4.0%). Statistical indicators confirmed better compatibility between the analysed period and its benchmark when using the SOM prediction instead of calendar-based selection: Average RMSRE was 19%-points lower and Willmott's d(r) 41% higher with SOM than with 3/2017-2019.
   Based on the case study and method evaluation, using ML for multivariate analysis of changed air pollution is feasible and yields meaningful results.

AB  - Hunting is the predominant way of controlling many wildlife populations devoid of large carnivores. It subjects animals to mortality rates that far exceed natural rates and that differ markedly in which age, sex, or size classes are removed relative to those of natural predators. To explain the emerging selection pattern we develop behavioral microfoundations for a hunting model, emphasizing in particular the constraints given by the formal and informal norms, rules, and regulations that govern the hunter's choice. We show how a shorter remaining season, competition among hunters, lower sighting probabilities, and higher costs all lead to lower reservation values, i.e., an increased likelihood of shooting a particular animal. Using a unique dataset on seen and shot deer from Norway, we test and confirm the theoretical predictions in a recreational and meat-motivated hunting system. To achieve sustainability, future wildlife management should account for this predictable selection pressure.

AB  - Latvia is one of the forest-richest countries in Europe. Very often in young forest stands of spruce admixture of coniferous or deciduous trees are taking place. During the growth trees suffer from influence of different risk factors. Damages in mixed stands depend on chosen mode and intensity of economic activities. Forest management cannot be imagined without creating the infrastructure (roads, ditches, etc.). However, the development of infrastructure may cause an effect of fragmentation and lead to changes in the forest structure. The aim of the research is to analyze influence of forest spatial features on the sanitary state of mixed stands of spruce. In 2011 and 2012 mixed stands of spruce younger than 40 years were investigated in all regions of Latvia. Nineteen stands were measured and surveyed and 80 sample plots were arranged. With the help of Geographical Information System (GIS) data base of the State Forest Service of Latvia the forms of forest plots (regular or irregular), as well as location of neighboring infrastructural objects and location of mixed stands in forests were stated. In unnaturally created regular form plots damages of risk factors usually tend to be larger than in those, which have been created naturally. With the credibility of 95%, linear connection between occurrence of damages caused by browsing and intensity is relevant (r=0.937 > r(0.05) = 0.575), as well as occurrence and intensity of damages caused by Lophophacidium hyperboreum Lagerb. (r=0.999 > r(0.05) = 0.575).

AB  - Attacks by wolves (Canis lupus) on dogs (C. familiaris) presumably are motivated both by preying and elimination of potential competitors. Regardless of these alternative motivations in wolves, the risk of attacks might be higher when the density of primary prey is low. We examined how many dogs do territorial wolves in Finland kill in relation to the population density of the most abundant ungulates, moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Most attacks by wolves on dogs take place in hunting with dogs. The number of wolf-killed dogs was in highly significant negative relationship to the population density of white-tailed deer and to total ungulate biomass per unit area which is largely determined by the density of white-tailed deer. Our results indicate that abundant wild prey would decrease the risk at which wolves attack dogs. On the other side of the coin prevail two hard facts which wildlife managers had to take a notice. White-tailed deer, although a potential mitigator of wolf-human conflict, is an alien species and a partner in > 6000 traffic collisions annually in Finland. One factor that seemed to increase the risk of wolf attacks on dogs is the low ungulate density in regions where moose is the only remarkable ungulate prey. Higher moose densities could decrease the risk of attacks, but on the other hand, higher densities could increase the risk of serious traffic collisions and browsing damages in forests.

AB  - Soil samples from 57 Norway spruce stands on sandy and nutrient poor soils in western Denmark were analysed for their content of exchangeable calcium, potassium and magnesium. The content of the three elements showed a strong spatial variation and the content of Mg and Ca correlated significantly with stand yield class. Estimations on nutrient export by harvest of stem and bark and a comparison with soil content, suggest that severe nutrient deficiencies may occur on many sites in the future. A soil weathering assay applied to selected sites, indicated that the long-term Ca supply is particularly critical, whereas the long-term supply of K and Mg from weathering of soil minerals, is more stable.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Precision livestock farming (PLF) will have a profound influence on animal husbandry, farm animal welfare and animal-based production chains. Even though consumers ultimately pay the costs of innovations, their perceptions of PLF technologies have been under-investigated. To explore consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains, altogether six focus group discussions were conducted in Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect that PLF technologies will enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing transparency in livestock farming. They, however, also expressed the fear that PLF technologies will lead to more industrialisation in livestock farming; that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and that PLF information may be inadequately communicated to consumers. The findings are used to formulate directions for strengthening the acceptance of PLF technologies among European consumers.
   Scholars in the fields of animal science and technology have investigated how precision livestock farming (PLF) can contribute to the quality and efficiency of animal husbandry and to the health and welfare of farm animals. Although the results of such studies provide promising avenues for the development of PLF technologies and their potential for the application in animal husbandry, the perspectives of consumers with regard to PLF technologies have yet to be the subject of much investigation. To address this research gap, the current study explores consumer perceptions of PLF technologies within the pork and dairy value chains. The investigation is based on results from six focus group discussions conducted in three European countries, each reflecting a different market environment: Finland, the Netherlands and Spain. The results indicate that consumers expect the implementation of different PLF technologies to enhance the health and welfare of farm animals, while generating environmental improvements and increasing the transparency of value-chain processes. The analysis further reveals three over-arching consumer concerns: (1) the fear that the integration of PLF technologies will introduce more industrialisation into livestock farming production; (2) the concern that PLF technologies and data are vulnerable to misuse and cyber-crime; and (3) the concern that PLF information is not communicated adequately to allow informed purchase decisions. The research findings provide directions for members of the animal-based food value chain to make informed decisions to improve their sustainability, social responsibility and credibility by endorsing the acceptance of PLF (technologies) amongst European consumers.

AB  - The energy sector needs to transform towards sustainability. The multi-level perspective on sociotechnical transitions is embracing an enactment perspective, which focuses on the agency of various actors in shifting transitions pathways but has yet to study local urban experiments from such an enactment perspective. Our empirical research examines an innovation intermediary's work in destabilising the regime rules in relation to the local energy incumbent company in Helsinki, Finland. Our paper seeks answers to the questions: How does the collaboration of the intermediary and the local energy company unfold? What are the impacts of the intermediary work on the local energy company in terms of enactment of transition pathways and what are the mechanisms causing the impact? Our research shows that the intermediary contributes to the transition by disturbing existing rules, structures, practices and networks by convening innovation champions from different constituencies, renegotiating regime rules and disrupting existing R&D alliances.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine physician burnout in association with individual factors, work characteristics and work-home interaction (job performance-based self-esteem, goal orientation, value congruency, workload, autonomy, work-home conflict and work-home facilitation). This two-wave panel study includes a sample of Norwegian physicians collected in 2003 (N = 683) and 2005 (N = 523). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to test the assumed effects in male and female physicians separately. The results imply that many of the assumed predictors play significant parts in physician burnout. A noticeable finding was that the pattern and strength of significant effects differed within the separate analysis of men and women. Work-home conflict was a particularly strong burnout predictor in female physicians whereas workload was the strongest burnout predictor in male physicians. The findings may have implications when planning future interventions. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To sustainably exploit a population, it is crucial to understand and reduce uncertainties about population processes and effects of harvest. In migratory species, management is challenged by geographically separated changing environmental conditions, which may cause unexpected changes in species distribution and harvest. We describe the development in the harvest of Svalbard-breeding pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) in relation to the observed trajectory and migratory behaviour of the population. In autumn, geese migrate via stopover sites in Norway and Denmark (where they are hunted) to wintering grounds in the Netherlands and Belgium (where they are protected). In Denmark and Norway harvesting increased stepwise during the 2000s. The increase in the population size only partly explained the change. The change corresponded to a simultaneous stepwise increase in numbers of geese staging in Denmark throughout autumn and winter; geese also moved further inland to feed which collectively increased their exposure to hunting. In Norway the increase in harvest reflected greater utilisation of lowland farmland areas by geese, increasing their hunting exposure. The study demonstrates how changes in migratory behaviour can abruptly affect exposure to hunting, which showed a functional response to increased temporal and spatial availability of geese. The harvest has now reached a level likely to cause a population decline. It highlights the need for flexible, internationally coordinated hunting regulations and reliable up-to-date population estimates and hunting bag statistics, which are rare in European management of migratory waterbirds. Without such information decisions are left with judgments based on population estimates, which often have time lags of several years between recording and reporting, hampering possibilities for the timely adjustment of management actions.

AB  - Supplementary feeding is a common, but controversial, tool in wildlife management, because it can benefit both humans and wildlife (e.g., increased wildlife densities), but has certain downsides (e. g., increased disease transmission). For species that are often involved in human-wildlife conflicts, two opposing paradigms with respect to supplementary feeding exist, i.e., (i) that supplementary feeding is efficient to lure animals away from undesired places (i.e., diversionary feeding; hypothesis 1), and (ii) that supplementary feeding stimulates 'nuisance' behavior (i. e., increased tolerance for humans and selection for human facilities; hypothesis 2). We formulated an alternative hypothesis (hypothesis 3); i.e., that behavioral variation among individuals dilutes population-wide, general patterns with respect to supplementary feeding. Based on GPS relocation data and resource selection functions, we show that neither of the two opposing management paradigms (hypothesis 1 and 2) hold in a particularly 'conflict rich' species, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), because individual variation in selection behavior with respect to supplementary feeding diluted population-wide patterns (hypothesis 3), even under very different environmental contexts (Sweden vs. Slovenia; i.e., different human and bear population density, history and intensity of supplementary feeding, topography, etc.). Our results emphasize that individual variation is an important component of behavioral ecology and should be considered in wildlife management and conservation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Although in Sweden the simultaneous use of forests for timber production and game hunting are both of socioeconomic importance it often leads to conflicting interests. This study examines forest stakeholder participation in improving game habitat to increase hunting opportunities as well as redistribute game activities in forests to help reduce browsing damage in valuable forest stands. The data for the study were collected from a nationwide survey that involved randomly selected hunters and forest owners in Sweden. An ordered logit model was used to account for possible factors influencing the respondents' participation in improving game habitat. The results showed that on average, forest owning hunters were more involved in improving game habitat than non-hunting forest owners. The involvement of non-forest owning hunters was intermediate between the former two groups. The respondents' participation in improving game habitat were mainly influenced by factors such as the quantity of game meat obtained, stakeholder group, forests on hunting grounds, the extent of risk posed by game browsing damage to the economy of forest owners, importance of bagging game during hunting, and number of hunting days. The findings will help in designing a more sustainable forest management strategy that integrates timber production and game hunting in forests.

AB  - Background: Forest management faces a climate induced shift in growth potential and increasing current and emerging new risks. Vulnerability analysis provides decision support based on projections of natural resources taking risks and uncertainties into account. In this paper we (1) characterize differences in forest dynamics under three management scenarios, (2) analyse the effects of the three scenarios on two risk factors, windthrow and drought stress, and (3) quantify the effects and the amount of uncertainty arising from climate projections on height increment and drought stress.
   Methods: In four regions in northern Germany, we apply three contrasting management scenarios and project forest development under climate change until 2070. Three climate runs (minimum, median, maximum) based on the emission scenario RCP 8.5 control the site-sensitive forest growth functions. The minimum and maximum climate run define the range of prospective climate development.
   Results: The projections of different management regimes until 2070 show the diverging medium-term effects of thinnings and harvests and long-term effects of species conversion on a regional scale. Examples of windthrow vulnerability and drought stress reveal how adaptation measures depend on the applied management path and the decision-maker's risk attitude. Uncertainty analysis shows the increasing variability of drought risk projections with time. The effect of climate projections on height growth are quantified and uncertainty analysis reveals that height growth of young trees is dominated by the age-trend whereas the climate signal in height increment of older trees is decisive.
   Conclusions: Drought risk is a serious issue in the eastern regions independent of the applied silvicultural scenario, but adaptation measures are limited as the proportion of the most drought tolerant species Scots pine is already high. Windthrow risk is no serious overall threat in any region, but adequate counter-measures such as species conversion, species mixture or reduction of target diameter can be taken. This simulation study of three silvicultural scenarios and three climate runs spans a decision space of potential forest development to be used for decision making. Which adaptation measures to counteract climate induced risks and uncertainty are to be taken is, however, a matter of individual risk attitude.

AB  - Earthworms, which contribute to important soil functions, suffer from intensive agriculture. Their response depends among other things on the earthworm ecological group (anecic, endogeic, epigeic) and the combination of the applied farming practices. To advice on methodological adaptations that enhance earthworm-mediated soil functions, effects of different practices on earthworms need to be studied in concert. We investigated the effects of tillage intensity (conventional, reduced, no tillage) and crop rotation diversity (simple = wheat, barley; diverse = wheat, peas, oil seed rape) on earthworm density and community composition in a Swedish long-term experiment. Furthermore, we calculated annual earthworm bioturbation to quantify the effects of farming practices on earthworm functions. Total earthworm densities did not vary between the different tillage intensities, but were on average 58% higher in the diverse than in the simple crop rotation. The pattern was mainly due to the response of the most abundant endogeic earthworms, which were not affected by tillage intensity, but were nearly two times more abundant in the diverse than in the simple crop rotation. Densities of anecic earthworms were 17 times higher under no tillage than conventional tillage. Anecic earthworms also benefitted from a diversified crop rotation, but the response depended on tillage intensity. The level of bioturbation reflected the response of anecic earthworms, and was more than four times higher under no tillage, 549 g dw m(-2) year(-1), than under conventional tillage. We conclude that highest earthworm bioturbation is best achieved with no tillage. However, earthworm densities and potentially bioturbation can be increased also by a diversified crop rotation, when reducing tillage intensity is not feasible.

AB  - Plant canopy optimization models predict that leaf nitrogen (N) distribution in the canopy will parallel the vertical light gradient, and numerous studies with many species have confirmed this prediction. Further, it is predicted that for a given canopy leaf area, a low vertical light extinction coefficient will promote rapid growth. Therefore, the ideal canopy of fast-growing plants should combine high leaf area index with a low light extinction coefficient; the latter being reflected in a flat vertical leaf N gradient throughout the canopy. Based on data from an experimental Salix stand (six varieties) grown on agricultural land in central Sweden, we tested the hypothesis that shoot growth is correlated with vertical leaf N gradient in canopies of hybrid willows bred for biomass production, which could have implications for Salix breeding.
   Tree improvement research requires screening of growth related traits in large numbers of plants, but assessment of canopy leaf N gradients by chemical analysis is expensive, time-consuming and destructive. An alternative to analytical methods is to estimate leaf N gradients nondestructively with an optical chlorophyll meter (SPAD method). Here we provide a specific calibration for interpreting SPAD data measured in hybrid willows grown in biomass plantations on fertile agri-Cultural land. Based on SPAD measurements, a significant and inverse relationship (r(2) = 0.88) was found between shoot biomass growth and vertical leaf N gradient across canopies of six Salix varieties.

AB  - We examined the community-environment relationships of lotic macroinvertebrates in near-pristine headwater streams, and the correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure at two regional extents. The across-ecoregion scale comprised five ecoregions spanning all of Finland, while the within-ecoregion scale comprised of north boreal and middle boreal ecoregions. We expected that taxonomic structure should exhibit stronger relationships than functional structure to spatial gradients, while the reverse should be true for local environmental factors. We found some support for this notion, because spatial variables were marginally more important for taxonomic than functional structure. Furthermore, within the two ecoregions, local environmental variables were slightly more important for functional than taxonomic structure. Geographical location (i.e. spatial variables) was more influential at the across-ecoregions extent than within the two ecoregions. Largely the same local environmental variables accounted for variation in both taxonomic and functional structure, including water pH, nutrients, colour, and stream size. Similar responses to local environmental features likely contributed to the significant correlation between patterns in taxonomic and functional structure. It has been suggested that functional traits may be rather insensitive to natural variation, yet our functional categorization showed distinct variation along local environmental, catchment, and spatial gradients across near-pristine streams. Thus, natural ecological filters should be accounted for prior to the examination of the effects of anthropogenic filters on stream macroinvertebrate community composition.

AB  - Since forestry is often allocated to soils with a low weathering capacity, reliable estimates of weathering rates are crucial in analyses of sustainability, e.g. of whole-tree and stump harvesting. In the present study, weathering rates (kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) for base cations were estimated using cation budgets in a replicated (n = 4) experimental Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) plantation situated on a nutrient-poor glacial till in south-west Sweden and aged 25-39 years during the study period. Weathering rates (central values) were 2.4, 1.4, 0.3 and 2.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Ca, Mg, K and Na, respectively. However, weathering was a minor flux in the overall cycling of these cations in the ecosystem, and the confidence intervals of the weathering estimates had amplitudes that generally were greater than the central values. The overall uncertainties were divided into (i) regular standard errors of the mean, expressing spatial variability, sampling errors and random method-related errors in data from measurements replicated over the experimental plots ('Type A' uncertainties), and (ii) estimated standard uncertainties accounting for systematic errors of methods, and of uncertainties in variables, functions and factors not replicated over the plots ('Type B' uncertainties). For Ca and K, bioaccumulation dominated the overall uncertainty. Most (>90 %) of this uncertainty, in turn, was of Type A (between-plot variability in measured stem diameters and cation concentrations); the remainder resulted from Type B uncertainties in allometric functions etc. Hence, regular standard errors over plots yielded a correct level of uncertainty of weathering estimates for these ions at the studied site. For Mg and Na, however, deposition and leaching were large terms in the cation budget. Whereas the uncertainty in deposition was mostly taken into account by plot-wise replicated measurements of throughfall (Type A uncertainty), Type B uncertainties were crucial to the estimates of leaching. Due to the fact that uncertainties accumulate when terms are added and subtracted in a cation budget, it is difficult to predict the sustainability of the pools of exchangeable cations from estimated weathering rates; it may be better to measure them directly in the soil. However, in the studied ecosystem these had a rapid turnover (mean residence time, 1-4 years), and underwent abrupt fluctuations over only a few years. A study performed during a limited time may therefore suffer from considerable temporal uncertainties, if the results are to be generalised for a longer period. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Agricultural landscapes have changed fast in Europe, which has led to steep declines in farmland biodiversity. While this has differentially impacted "farmland species", some of these seem to be able to use alternative man-made open habitats in forests, such as forest clear-cuts and powerline rights-of-way. We investigated the use of clear-cuts by two historically declining farmland birds, the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella) and the Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), to determine both local and landscape habitat characteristics of clear-cuts used for breeding. Among 101 clear-cuts visited in Scania, southern Sweden, 27% were occupied by Yellowhammers and 12% by Red-backed Shrikes. Yellowhammer occurrence in clear-cuts was positively related to local spruce cover (the planted tree species). There was also an interaction between clear-cut size and the proportion of farmland in the landscape, such that the positive effect of the proportion of farmland nearby was stronger for larger clear-cuts. Red-backed Shrike occurrence was positively related to clear-cut size and the local presence of piles of forest residues (tops and branches). The relation between occurrence and the proportion of clear-cuts in the landscape was positive for small clear-cuts and negative for larger ones. Yellowhammers and Red-backed shrikes are affected by both the local habitat structure in the clearcut and on the composition of the surrounding landscape, most likely because they use the clear-cut for nesting and the surroundings as complementary feeding habitat. To what extent clear-cuts as complementary breeding habitat to farmland may contribute to the conservation of Yellowhammers and Red-backed shrikes, as well as other farmland birds, is a promising path for future investigations.

AB  - This study answers the call for holistic assessments of events' sustainability through testing a model for measuring impacts of a sports tourism event from sustainability perspectives and in a common monetary metric. The aim is to achieve commensurability through integration of economic, sociocultural and environmental impacts. Concepts such as use- and non-use value, consumer surplus, direct economic impacts, ecological footprint analysis and shadow cost are applied to fulfil this aim. The model is tested on a three-day long European athletics indoor championship 2013 and the results demonstrate a possibility to produce a sustainability impact analysis in a uniform metric. Measured in monetary terms, sociocultural impacts carry more weight than economic impacts do, whereas environmental impacts have little importance for the total assessment. The assessment of event impacts in one common metric paves the way for destinations to trade-off alternatives and develop clear-cut strategies to increase social, economic and environmental welfare. It is suggested that prices on the market for emission rights severely underestimate environmental costs.

AB  - A European transect was established, ranging from Sweden to the Azores, to determine the relative influence of geographic factors and agricultural small-scale management on the grassland soil microbiome. Within each of five countries (factor 'Country'), which maximized a range of geographic factors, two differing growth condition regions (factor 'GCR') were selected: a favorable region with conditions allowing for high plant biomass production and a contrasting less favorable region with a markedly lower potential. Within each region, grasslands of contrasting management intensities (factor 'MI') were defined: intensive and extensive, from which soil samples were collected. Across the transect, 'MI' was a strong differentiator of fungal community structure, having a comparable effect to continental scale geographic factors ('Country'). 'MI' was also a highly significant driver of bacterial community structure, but 'Country' was clearly the stronger driver. For both, 'GCR' was the weakest driver. Also at the regional level, strong effects of MI occurred on various measures of the soil microbiome (i.e. OTU richness, management-associated indicator OTUs), though the effects were largely regional-specific. Our results illustrate the decisive influence of grassland MI on soil microbial community structure, over both regional and continental scales, and, thus, highlight the importance of preserving rare extensive grasslands.

AB  - Planning of transport infrastructure in Sweden has undergone successive legislative changes as well as neoliberal corporatization and marketization reforms in recent years, with a general aim to increase efficiency and effectiveness. This paper presents planning practitioners' experiences of far-reaching marketization of physical planning practice in line with a strategy within the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) to become a 'Pure Purchaser'. The strategy implies that all practical planning work should be carried out by procured consultants. The paper follows a qualitative, explorative approach based on document studies and interviews with practitioners actively involved in carrying out physical planning of road and rail investments. The concept of 'modes of governance' is applied to highlight and analytically interpret differences in perspectives on efficient and effective governance as expressed in the planning legislation, and the STA marketization strategy, respectively. The empirical results make evident that the recent marketization reforms are generally perceived as strongly and negatively affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of planning practices while also circumscribing professional discretion. The study highlights the importance of specific organization and management perspectives as explanatory factors in studying efficiency and effectiveness of planning practices.

TI  - Historiography of Swedish Building Types
T2  - KONSTHISTORISK TIDSKRIFT
LA  - English
AB  - This article investigates Swedish building type research as a methodological genre formed by the idea that architectural history is a history of construction tasks and functions. Departing from an analysis of 50 studies carried out mainly by art historians and ethnologists, we delineate the formation of a genre, its characteristics and changes over time. As the concept of building type can refer either to form or to function, we argue that it is necessary to pinpoint the scope of building type studies. Otherwise, when speaking of activity types as if they were synonymous with form types, there has been a tendency to omit from architectural history those buildings that were not planned to serve the function they eventually came to hold. The starting place of the methodology is the early twentieth-century mapping activities of Nordiska museet, initially covering peasant settlements and manors. Following this era, the Svensk stad project introduced function as the central point of departure for built environment studies. The third stage is the development of a professional conservation practice, which, in the 1960's, brought critique of the modernist post-war rebuilding programmes and emphasised sustainability. Finally, most building type studies have abandoned their buildings at the moment when they are ready for use, or even earlier. We suggest that, to comprehend a building's historical function and significance, we need to include reconstructions and modifications, both blueprints and usage. Such research may open doors to new possibilities, which will require a deepening of theoretical outsets and methodologies.

AB  - During the transition to a market economy, many countries with a planned economy in Central and Eastern Europe face similar challenges when the established socio-economic systems and infrastructures deemed inefficient in a market economy. Also new issues are being raised by the trends of globalization and the vision of sustainable development. In the energy sector the challenges raised by the Kyoto Protocol and its implementation mechanisms are especially interesting, because they are intertwined with other socio-economic sectors.
   This paper addresses the challenges in the energy sector for transition countries, taking the case of bio-energy in the Ukraine as a prime example of a country undergoing major changes in its economic structures. Given the large potential for bio-energy development in the Ukraine, the current dependence on imported energy resources which threatens the Ukraine's energy security, and the economic, social and environmental benefits associated with bio-energy, this paper investigates drivers and barriers to an increased use of bio-energy in the Ukraine.
   The paper was written by a group of MSc students of the International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University during a field trip to Kiev city and the Lviv region in Ukraine. The field trip has been supported by the Swedish Institute.

AB  - The unprecedented global environmental crisis we are facing nowadays is pushing the economic actors to rethink their approach to sustainable development. As a consequence, firms are increasingly adopting and implementing ecoinnovations in their processes in order to improve the management of scarce natural resources. This paper describes a method to assess the water footprint (WF) in the manufacturing industry. Data are collected from two manufacturing plants of Volvo (Umea and Tuve) in Sweden and constitute the baseline scenario against which seven new scenarios are tested. Such new scenarios describe the implementation of seven different technologies into the water management system of the organization. A combination of key performance indicators is instrumental to generate the WF of each scenario. Through this method, we are able to disentangle which technological change can pave the way toward a substantial improvement of the organizational WF.

AB  - An expanding body of research connects religiosity/spirituality (later R/S) with human well-being and health. While psychological and medical research lacks a common theoretical or theological framework, these dimensions are measured by instruments with a wide variation in quality. As the religious landscapes in Western societies are becoming increasingly plural and complex, the need for developing our understanding and assessment of the role of R/S in human health and well-being is as important as ever. This study, based on quantitative data (N = 529) from members of a church renewal oriented network in the Lutheran majority Church in Finland, measures the role of R/S in the subjective well-being of the participants through a multi-dimensional framework. While exploring Ellison's Spiritual Well-being Scale (1983), the study expands its scope to a more multi-dimensional approach to religion, spirituality and well-being. The results reveal that religious beliefs and practices do not contribute to the level of subjective well-being in the lives of the participants as much as the way in which these beliefs and practices are lived out and actualized in social contexts. The study identified several sources of both well-being and ill-being in the participants' lives. The article contributes to the terms of measuring the various ways in which R/S are connected to human well-being.

AB  - At present, the utilization of timber in the Northern part of the Scottish Highlands is low due to a lack of a wood utilizing industry. As a consequence, the majority of forest owners do not receive any income from timber and in some cases stumpage prices can even be negative. At the same time, increasing prices of oil, gas and electricity pose a great challenge for local industries and homeowners. The establishment of wood fueled heating systems is therefore expected to improve the situation and at the same time create a market for the local timber resources. Consequently, a local energy source to produce heat and electricity at a competitive price would have positive benefits for both local industries and forest owners. Due to the current lack of competition, roundwood could be chipped for fuel, which has many associated benefits compared to the harvesting and chipping of logging residues. It is the aim of this research to apply existing Finnish know-how in regards to wood fuel harvesting in order to develop and investigate the price level of sustainable and local wood fuel supply chains.
   To determine the most suitable supply chain for forest fuels, various research methods were applied. An estimation of the forest resources in the Wick area was the first step of the research. The different cost components of the supply chain such as cutting, forwarding and chipping were then calculated based on Finnish experiences and adapted to conditions in Northern Scotland. Detailed transportation distance calculations and cost of transportation were calculated using GIS tools.
   Of the various supply chain designs considered, chipping at the landing seems to be the most suitable option. Chipping the roundwood at a central terminal would also be feasible; however, a suitable site would have to be identified since chipping of the material at the heating plant is not an option. Calculations indicate that forest chips can be delivered starting from approximately 20 (sic)MWh(-1) within a 50 km transportation distance when chipping is at roadside. If the transportation distance is 100 km wood chips could be delivered at approximately 23(sic)MWh(-1). Results from the GIS analysis indicate that a sufficient supply of raw material will be available in the future. According to these calculations forest fuels can be a competitive energy source for heat and electricity production in Northern Scotland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Conventional pipeline and parlor milking expose dairy farmers and workers to adverse health outcomes. In recent years, automatic milking systems (AMS) have gained much popularity in Finland, but the changes in working conditions when changing to AMS are not well known. The aim of this study was to investigate the occupational health and safety risks in using AMS, compared to conventional milking systems (CMS).
   Methods: An anonymous online survey was sent to each Finnish dairy farm with an AMS in 2014. Only those dairy farmers with prior work experience in CMS were included in the final analysis consisting of frequency distributions and descriptive statistics.
   Results: We received 228 usable responses (131 male and 97 female; 25.2% response rate). The majority of the participants found that AMS had brought flexibility to the organization of farm work, and it had increased leisure time, quality of life, productivity of dairy work, and the attractiveness of dairy farming among the younger generation. In addition, AMS reduced the perceived physical strain on the musculoskeletal system as well as the risk of occupational injuries and diseases, compared to CMS. However, working in close proximity to the cattle, particularly training of heifers to use the AMS, was regarded as a high-risk work task. In addition, the daily cleaning of the AMS and manual handling of rejected milk were regarded as physically demanding. The majority of the participants stated that mental stress caused by the monotonous, repetitive, paced, and hurried work had declined after changing to AMS. However, many indicated increased mental stress because of the demanding management of the AMS. Nightly alarms caused by the AMS, lack of adequately skilled hired labor or farm relief workers, and the 24/7 standby for the AMS were issues that also caused mental stress.
   Conclusion: Based on this study, AMS may have significant potential in the prevention of adverse health outcomes in milking of dairy cows. In addition, AMS may improve the productivity of dairy work and sustainability of dairy production. However, certain characteristics of the AMS require further attention with regard to occupational health and safety risks.

AB  - Stakeholder participation in forest policy processes has over years received political and scientific attention. This empirical study brings in a dynamic element, exploring how and why participation change as policies evolve. Two Norwegian policy cases serve to contrast participation by environmental organisations (ENGOs) and forest owner organisations (FOs) over time. The policy arrangement approach (PM) is used as analytical framework, first, to explore changes in coalitions, rules of game, power constellations, and discourses for each of the policy cases. Second, an Initial exploration is offered on how changes in the PM dimensions affect the assessments of 'what's in it for me' for ENGOs versus FOs. The results indicate that when standards for sustainable forest management are implemented, the value for ENGOs to participate in standard revision is decreasing, while in forest protection, the ENGOs chose to participate in a coalition requesting more money for voluntary protection, even after being excluded from identifying interesting areas for protection. Combining evolving policies and participation based on 'what's in it for me' help explain why participation changes over time. The findings provide alternative perspectives on former work presenting continued participation as a challenge and important messages related to future forest policy analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper focuses on the possibilities of using satellite data for detecting and quantifying vegetation changes and the distribution of changes caused by an increased exploitation of the Swedish mountains. The methods outlined in this study are to give a basis for change detection of less sustainable mountain ecosystems by using lichen cover as indicator. Digital image analysis, Landsat 5 TM data, hyperspectral imaging scanner data and digital terrain models were used to study mountain vegetation in two test sites located, one in the southern part and one in the northern part of the Swedish mountains. The results show that mountain vegetation can be classified with good results into 12 classes with emphasis on dwarf shrub heath vegetation using Landsat TM data. The changes in lichen cover have been detected using lichen index differentiating technique. By estimation of the biomass of lichens using vegetation indices, Landsat TM data, can be used to map a decrease in lichen cover in 2 classes: 20-30% and 50-60%. The result is based on possibilities to differentiate "lichen cover" in 3 classes: high > 80%, moderate 50-80% and low 20-50%.

AB  - Small water bodies in cold climate respond fast to global warming, and species adapted to such habitats may be valuable indicators for climate change. We investigated the geographical and physiological temperature limits of the Arctic fairy shrimp (Branchinecta paludosa), which is common in cold water arctic ponds, but at present retracts its range in alpine areas along its southern outreach of Norway. Seasonal logging of water temperatures along an altitudinal transect revealed an upper temperature limit of 12.7 degrees C for its presence, which closely matched a calculated upper temperature limit of 12.9 degrees C throughout its entire Norwegian range. Field data hence point to cold stenotherm features, which would be consistent with its Arctic, circumpolar distribution. Lab experiments, on the other hand, revealed a linear increase in respiration over 10-20 degrees C. When fed ad libitum somatic growth increased with temperature, as well, without negative physiological impacts of higher temperatures. The absence of Branchinecta paludosa in ponds warmer than 13 degrees C could still be due to a mismatch between temperature dependent metabolism and limited energy supply in these ultraoligotrophic water bodies. We discuss the concept of cold stenothermy in this context, and the impacts of regional warming on the future distribution of the Arctic fairy shrimp. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review focuses on the lived experiences of chronic conditions among African communities in the Global North, focusing on established immigrant communities as well as recent immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking communities. We conducted a systematic and narrative synthesis of qualitative studies published from inception to 2022, following a search from nine databases-MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Social Science Citation Index, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, SCOPUS and AMED. 39 articles reporting 32 qualitative studies were included in the synthesis. The studies were conducted in 10 countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States) and focused on 748 participants from 27 African countries living with eight conditions: type 2 diabetes, hypertension, prostate cancer, sickle cell disease, chronic hepatitis, chronic pain, musculoskeletal orders and mental health conditions. The majority of participants believed chronic conditions to be lifelong, requiring complex interventions. Chronic illness impacted several domains of everyday life-physical, sexual, psycho-emotional, social, and economic. Participants managed their illness using biomedical management, traditional medical treatment and faith-based coping, in isolation or combination. In a number of studies, participants took 'therapeutic journeys'-which involved navigating illness action at home and abroad, with the support of transnational therapy networks. Multi-level barriers to healthcare were reported across the majority of studies: these included individual (changing food habits), social (stigma) and structural (healthcare disparities). We outline methodological and interpretive limitations, such as limited engagement with multi-ethnic and intergenerational differences. However, the studies provide an important insights on a much-ignored area that intersects healthcare for African communities in the Global North and medical pluralism on the continent; they also raise important conceptual, methodological and policy challenges for national health programmes on healthcare disparities.

AB  - In much of the world, compressed natural gas (CNG) has been a long recognized alternative transportation fuel due to the fact that it is domestic, one of the cleanest burning and most affordable alternative transportation fuel available - directly addressing three key issues of the countries: national security, global warming & air quality and the economy. However, due to the complex adoption dynamics and diffusion processes, most endeavors to introduce and build sustainable demand for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have been underachieved. This paper analyzes a wide range of policies to promote natural gas vehicles in new as well as in mature markets. In this paper, several success and failure factors for the introduction of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) are examined and compare the government policies for the adoption of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) throughout the world but majorly concentrated on twelve countries: China, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, India, Brazil, Thailand, Italy, United States, Germany, Sweden and South Korea. The paper examines the transition road map to CNG technology implantation and identifies lessons that could be useful to developed countries in their efforts to deploy natural gas vehicles.

AB  - Nearly all regional public bus services in Sweden have been competitively tendered for 30 years. The way to perform tenders has undergone significant changes since the first tenders were carried out in the late 1980s. The most important changes are: 1) pure gross cost contracts have been replaced with contracts that include bonus and malus clauses to safeguard the quality of the service or contracts with passenger incentives; 2) bundling of bus lines into larger networks; 3) requirements on operators to provide buses that use specific types of fuel, for example electricity or gas; and 4) bundling of bus and railway services into one contract.
   The case in Sweden for using incentives based on the number of passengers is to a high extent motivated by a national goal to double the market for regional public transportation and is partly motivated as a way to solve practical problems encountered by the PTAs.
   Building on previous research, the goal of this paper is to explore and compare how the contract design in tendered regional bus services in Sweden influences performance in terms of costs, passenger growth, and on the frequency of major conflicts between the contracting parties.
   The economic performance and other effects of the different contract types are measured using a database on all Sweden's regional bus services, collected by the government agency Transport Analysis, and national data on public bus services published annually by the same agency. The conflict aspects are studied using the annual reports of the PTAs procuring the bus services.

AB  - In the last few years, the newly opened Czech Arctic Scientific Infrastructure in Svalbard - Josef Svoboda Station - has closely collaborated with UiT - The Arctic University of Norway on very productive research related to climate change and the impact of the sea and land ice disappearance. Professor Josef Elster, the Head of the Czech station and a researcher in the diversity, ecology and ecophysiology of polar algae and cyanobacteria, and the glacial microbiologist Marie Sabacka and their team try to find the answer to questions concerning how the Arctic ecosystem responds to global warming and how global warming affects human activity. The results of their research can be used, for example, in the treatment and refinement of drinking and sewage water, the pharmaceutical industry and medicine, livestock nutrition including aquaculture and in the production of nutritional supplements for people. However, even the most exciting scientific information and results are not readily available to a nonprofessional audience. Interdisciplinarity and a suitable cultural framework can bring new life to the results of scientific research. If the presentation of science is interconnected with cultural disciplines such as literature, art, music or theatre, its account can be enriched and media interest can be increased. The scientific-cultural festivals AT HOME IN SVALBARD 2018 and ARCTIC FESTIVAL 2019 are just two good examples. The presentation of scientific research through culture is a very distinctive and innovative attempt. Moreover, the interest of the public can influence the stakeholders' approach to providing and increasing finances for further scientific research.

AB  - Ivan Agueli became a celebrated painter in Sweden, his native country. However, his pioneering role in the rapprochement between West and East in the early twentieth century has remained largely unexplored. Agueli's universal humanism, with Sufism as its main lever, is analysed and located within a transnational intellectual landscape through networks of people, ideas and print media. By attracting Western pilgrims, Sufism served as a nexus of cultural transfer from the Middle East to Europe, thus casting doubts on the prevailing paradigm of Western enlightenment as the backbone of global intellectual history. Sufism was presented by Agueli as a spiritual philosophy that dealt with the liberation of man from materialism and selfishness. The article deals with a number of issues: How did Agueli transform Islam and Sufism into a cosmopolitan vision? To what extent was his humanism nurtured by anarchist philosophy, which promoted a just society? Did Agueli reconcile the anarchist perception of human beings as free creatures with the Sufi perception of total submission to a Sufi master? Consideration of these questions will shed light on a moralist intellectual, whose own personal experience captured a defiant European mood, intertwining rationalism and esotericism, material progress and universal brotherhood.

TI  - The Gold of the Roman Emperors
T2  - GOLD IN DER EUROPAISCHEN HELDENSAGE
LA  - German
CP  - Conference on Gold and Heroic Saga
AB  - The advance of the Roman Empire into Northern Europe introduced a large influx of material goods to the Germanic tribes, especially gold. At the same time, the encounter with the Roman world stimulated an intensive intellectual exploration of central ideas, manifestations and cultural techniques stemming from Mediterranean high culture, which were then adopted by the Germanic tribes according to their own needs and ideas as well as adapted to their own culture. The gold of the Roman emperors, melted down and reprocessed, forms the material basis of numerous golden prestige and cult objects, a metamorphosis that lingers in the literary tradition of the Germanic tribes. An example of this is the reception of the consular processional road (processus consularis) on gold coins of the Constantinian era when the emperor assumed office. He demonstrates his generosity by distributing money among the people. Indeed, we have not only two literary testimonies from the reign of Chlodovech and Chilperich in Gregory of Tours' History of the Franks: this coin image was also taken up in the north and imitated around the same time on the front of the Norwegian medallion imitation IK 256 from Godoy. Additionally, the myth of the Danish King Hrolfr kraki can be read as a literary echo to the tradition, who scatters the just stolen gold on the run from his Swedish pursuers. The Swedes eventually stop the persecution over their greed for gold. Here a wide curve seems to connect the gold-spreading of the Roman emperor as an expression of his liberalitas to the imitation of the Frankish King Chlodovech and Hrolfr kraki's golden seed. At the same time, the Norwegian skald Eyvindr skaldaspillir (at the end of the 10th c.) makes an allusion in this context using the kenning frae Fyrisvalla 'seed of the Fyris field' for 'gold' in an imaginary complex that associates gold with grain, thereby attributing vegetative properties to the precious metal.

AB  - This paper analyses how local energy and climate actions can affect the use of water and land resources locally, nationally and globally. Each of these resource systems is linked to different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); we also explore related SDG interactions. A municipality in Sweden with the ambition of phasing out fossil fuels by year 2030 is used as illustrative case example. The local energy system is modelled in detail and indirect water and land requirements are quantified for three stylised decarbonisation scenarios of pathways to meeting climate and energy requirements (related to SDG13 and SDG7, respectively). Total local, national and global implications are addressed for the use of water and land resources, which relate to SDG6 for water, and SDG2 and SDG15 for land use. We find that the magnitude and location of water and land impacts are largely pathway-dependent. Some scenarios of low carbon energy may impede progress on SDG15, while others may compromise SDG6. Data for the studied resource uses are incoherently reported and have important gaps. As a consequence, the study results are indicative and subject to uncertainty. Still, they highlight the need to recognise that resource use changes targeting one SDG in one locality have local and non-local impacts that may compromise progress other SDGs locally and/or elsewhere in the world.

AB  - P>Telemetry was used to examine spawning migration of sea trout, Salmo trutta L. (n = 126), in two rivers in northern Sweden. The spawning areas defined by radio-tagged fish differed between the river systems. In the River Vindelalven, sea trout spawned in the main stem and 80% of tagged individuals returned to areas where hatchery-reared juveniles had been previously stocked. In the River Pitealven, 74% of tagged sea trout ascended tributaries for spawning. Tagged fish were categorised into three groups of migratory pattern. cart (classification and regression tree) analysis indicated that distance from tagging location to spawning site (S-dist) explained the migratory patterns. Large S-dist separated fish with stepwise upstream migration from those with up- and downstream migrations and one-directional direct migration. Fish tagged early in the season migrated the longest distance to spawning areas. Stocking locations and sex explained the large search behaviour up- and downstream in the rivers. The findings are important for the sustainable management of sea trout in the Gulf of Bothnia.

KW  - Primary health care
AB  - In 2015, the Swedish government initiated a national cancer reform program to standardize cancer care pathways. Primary aims included shortened waiting times among patients with suspected cancer, increased patient satisfaction and reduced regional variation. The implementation phase of the program is now more than half way through and both achievements and challenges have been identified.
   The ongoing evaluation demonstrates that professional engagement and adjustments on the meso- and micro-level of the system are essential to achieving sustainable improvements. Waiting times have shortened for the pathways launched first, and patients are satisfied with a more transparent process. Physicians in primary care are satisfied to inform patients about the pathways but point out problems with comorbidity and complicated diagnostic procedures related to unspecific symptoms. Mechanisms and ethical considerations behind possible crowding-out effects need to be thoroughly highlighted and discussed with staff and management. The results so far appear promising but meso- and micro-levels of the system need to be more involved in the design processes. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

KW  - ADAPTATION
KW  - GOVERNANCE
AB  - The need for climate change adaptation has been widely recognised and examples of successful adaptation are increasingly reported in the literature, but little attention has so far been paid to the potential negative impacts of implemented adaptation measures. As the agricultural sector is implementing measures to adapt to or cope with climatic variability and change, the potential negative consequences of these measures need to be explored in order to avoid increased vulnerability or (unintended) environmental impacts. This paper employs serious gaming and focus group methodology to study how agricultural stakeholders in Sweden and Finland frame and negotiate the unintended negative impacts of adaptation measures. The results of our interactional frame analysis suggest that the participants negotiated the potential maladaptive outcomes depending on: (1) whether they agreed that this was indeed a potential consequence of an adaptation measure, (2) whether they considered this to be a negative outcome, and if so whether it was (3) a negative outcome which they could adapt to, (4) a negative outcome that would make it preferable not to adapt at all (5) negotiable in terms of a trade-off with alternative outcomes. While it may be obvious that adaptation options that increase vulnerability should be avoided, this study illustrates the complex, value based, individual, yet dialogical processes and contextual basis for identifying and assessing maladaptation.

AB  - Blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) living in high salinity regions along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States are subject to infection by the parasitic dinoflagellate Hematodinium perezi with a prevalence that can exceed 50%. Infections are usually lethal, thus H. perezi infection represents a significant cause of mortality in many crab populations. Most studies of this host-parasite interaction have focused on epidemiology, host-pathogen dynamics, and pathogen transmission; little is known about the impact of the parasite on host behavior and population dynamics. We examined the effects of H. perezi on blue crab mortality from predation, activity patterns, and habitat use. Infected crabs suffered significantly higher predation than uninfected crabs when tethered in the field. Similarly, infected juvenile crabs were preyed upon significantly more often than uninfected conspecifics when exposed to a predatory adult crab in laboratory experiments. Laboratory experiments also revealed that the behavior of infected and uninfected crabs differed in ways that affected their risk of predation. Compared to infected crabs, uninfected juvenile crabs buried more frequently, moved less, and used oyster shell substrate more often when a predator was present. These differences do not appear to be driven by olfactory cues because chemosensory assays show that H. perezi infections do not affect detection of juvenile crabs by adult crabs, nor infected juvenile crab chemosensory responses to adult crabs. Our results indicate that H. perezi infection alters crab behavior in ways that enhance predatory culling of infected crabs, and this in turn may limit the spread of the parasite.

AB  - Renewable distributed generation and electric vehicles (EVs) are two important components in the transition to a more sustainable society. However, both pose new challenges to the power system due to the intermittent generation and EV charging load. In this case study, a power system consisting of a low- and medium-voltage rural and urban distribution grid with 5174 customers, high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) electricity and a fully electrified car fleet were assumed, and their impact on the grid was assessed. The two extreme cases of two summer weeks and two winter weeks with and without EV charging and a PV penetration varying between 0 and 100% of the annual electricity consumption were examined. Active power curtailment of the PV systems was used to avoid overvoltage. The results show an increased electricity consumption of 9.3% in the winter weeks and 17.1% in the summer weeks, a lowering of the minimum voltage by 1% at the most, and a marginal contribution by the EV charging to lower the need of PV power curtailment. This shows the minor impact of EV charging on the distribution grid, both in terms of allowing more PV power generation and in terms of lower voltage levels.

AB  - Cities undergoing rapid growth encounter tremendous challenges, not only in terms of providing services to meet demand, but also in ensuring that development occurs in a sustainable way. This research evaluates the potential contribution of the material and energy flow analysis framework to predicting future energy flows and corresponding CO2 emissions in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The research presents a generic material and energy flow analysis model and applies it to the housing stock in Riyadh to estimate future energy demand and to assess associated effects. As the country starts to adopt sustainability measures and plan its transition from a fossil fuel based energy system towards a renewable-based energy system, an understanding of future energy flows will allow early recognition of potential environmental impacts and provide information to enable accurate predictions of future demand for resources.

AB  - Compared with traditional inventory methods based on field plot sampling, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has the potential to assess forest structural properties with greater detail over space and time and at lower cost. Many national ALS survey programmes covering entire countries for topographic mapping are currently in progress and some have provided data that are in the public domain. Although the point density of these datasets is relatively low, there is an interest in developing methods that employ these types of data for categorizing different approaches to forest management. Using Finnish national ALS data with a point density of 0.91 pulses per square metre, we carried out a classification of 252 000 ha of boreal forests into silvicultural development classes (DC) used in practical forest management. Taking into account all eight DCs, the overall accuracy was 74.1 per cent and kappa = 0.70. We conclude that the dataset is adequate for discriminating multilayered forests from even-aged ones. This result was compared with a method based on mathematical rules, which succeeded in discriminating multilayered stands with regeneration of shade-intolerant species without the need of field data for training. However, the low point density may hamper the detection of shade-tolerant understories in mature high forests with closed canopies. We, therefore, recommend the use of this supervised classification in the presence of shade-tolerant species.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion produces renewable energy and recycled fertilisers, and thereby may improve energy and nutrient self-sufficiency and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy production, agriculture and waste management. Finland aims to increase bioenergy production and nutrient recycling from agricultural biomass, via digestion of non-food crops and side streams from food production. According to the national climate and energy strategy, the life cycle carbon balance of bioenergy must be accounted for to ensure its sustainability. However, all emissions and abatement potential are often allocated only for energy and not for digestate production and use. This emphasises climate impacts for energy, and fails to consider digestate-related emissions and credits. This study used different allocation methods to assess the climate emissions of the entire anaerobic digestion chain from feedstock procurement to both energy and digestate use in comparison to fossil energy and mineral fertiliser. Three feedstock scenarios with pig slurry and different co-feedstocks (separated solid fraction of slurry or grass from uncultivated fields or food industry side streams) were assessed. The climate emissions of energy were decreasing and the climate emissions of digestate were increasing when allocating all emissions from anaerobic digestion to energy and moving towards using economic allocation method and finally mass allocation method. With all allocation methods the three scenarios with different co-feedstocks led to lower climate emissions compared to the production of fossil fuels and mineral fertilisers. The climate emissions of anaerobic digestion were highest for the scenario that made use of grass as co-feedstock and lowest with food industry side streams as co-feedstock. The largest climate emissions of anaerobic digestion were from combined heat and power plant, and manure storage. When looking further the digestate storage, transportation and utilization as fertiliser on field the emissions were higher compared to mineral fertiliser utilization on field. However, when combining emissions of anaerobic digestion allocated for digestate and emissions of the digestate utilization on field, they were lower compared to mineral fertiliser production and use on field. The largest climate emissions of digestate were from digestate field use. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As a part of the renewable energy cycle, forest biomass resources are considered to be important renewable materials and energy sources in many countries. It is evident from international and local research into forest biomass utilization that several challenges must be addressed to ensure logging waste can be transformed into material of commercial value. Several logistical and supply chain challenges have already been identified, including uncertainty about the nature, amount, and quality of forest residues. In this context, this paper presents a summary review of estimation methods and techniques for managing forest and woody residue along the timber supply chain. The review examines both the opportunities and the challenges evident in the international forest residue estimation methods within each supply chain for primary and secondary forest resources. The review also discusses techniques for supply chain and management planning and highlights the limitations of existing information and communication technology (ICT) implemented for forest biomass research.

AB  - Mean trophic level (MTL) of landings and primary production required (PPR) by fisheries are increasingly used in the assessment of sustainability in fisheries. However, in their present form, MTL and PPR are prone to misinterpretation. We show that it is important to account for actual catch data, define an appropriate historical and spatial domain, and carefully consider the effects of fisheries management, based on results from a case study of Swedish fisheries during the past century.

AB  - Drawing on a hierarchical cognitive structure, the aim of this study was to compare forest values and beliefs in the general public and among forest owners in Sweden. Based on questionnaire data (n = 1,805), intergroup differences were identified on different cognitive levels. For example, while the forest owners emphasized production values more than the general public, the difference was smaller regarding more specific beliefs concerning profitability in forestry. In contrast, the general public emphasized recreation more than the forest owners, although the divide was mainly evident for certain recreation activities. While results demonstrated overlapping beliefs concerning owners' right to decide over their forest, larger differences were found regarding the rights of other actors (e.g., the general public). Furthermore, a cluster analysis based on forest values and forest-specific beliefs demonstrated heterogeneous groups cutting across the original group dichotomy. The implications for understanding underpinnings of forest conflicts are discussed.

AB  - Achieving sustainability often requires fostering changes in norms and behaviours through a combination of restrictions and aware-raising activities. The phasing out of lead in ammunition to reduce lead poisoning in waterfowl provides a case in point. Twenty years after the Parties to the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) committed to phase out lead shot in wetlands, such bans have been implemented in a third of Europe only. Furthermore, while evidence is scant, compliance varies widely where bans have been introduced. As a result, waterfowl are still suffering from lead poisoning. Here, I survey the use of different types of shot while practicing and when taking game in different habitats in Sweden, one of the Parties to AEWA. Furthermore, I test the hypotheses that mandatory shooter education, or stakeholder communication, influence compliance with existing restrictions in Sweden, as well as the voluntary phasing out of lead shot where its use still is permitted. More than half of the shooters practiced using lead and a third used lead shot over what they considered as wetlands, in both cases in violation of the current legislation. Furthermore, what constitutes a wetland appears to have been unclear to many shooters, especially in alpine areas. Both mandatory education and stakeholder communication were positively related to compliance. Only 12-15 % used lead free alternatives in shooting over habitats where the use of lead shot is permitted. There was a weak positive relationship between stakeholder communication and the voluntary phasing out of lead shot, but no effect from education. I suggest that the planned and ongoing phasing out of lead in ammunition should rest on a combination of legislation, enforcement, education and stakeholder communication in order to be successful. The findings add to our general understanding of how to turn environmental policy into sustainable management actions in practice.

AB  - Salmon aquaculture is a growing industry with increasing challenges of feed sustainability and availability. This global sustainability issue has led to calls for novel feeds. Aquafly, a Norwegian research project, has performed small-scale tests using the black soldier fly as an ingredient in salmon diet. However, in order for insect feeds to become a reality on the industrial scale, workable scientific, technical and political solutions have to be envisioned in tandem. In this study, we studied, elicited and assessed sociotechnical imaginaries in the Aquafly research consortium, using the approaches of concomitant ELSA research, the Ethical Matrix and Quantitative Story-Telling. We show how the sociotechnical imaginaries develop together with the scientific trajectory of the project, and how this also affects the assessment of the ethical and environmental impacts of the technology, including issues of food and feed safety and security, fish health and welfare, pollution and efficient use of waste streams. We show how there are intrinsic challenges when dealing with global sustainability issues in the research project. For instance, overcoming the problem of salmon feed scarcity may aggravate the challenges caused by intensive aquaculture. We report the results of a Quantitative Story-Telling exercise that indicates that Aquafly can be seen as part of a larger economy of technological promise, and discuss if and how this critique can be employed and integrated into scientific and technical imagination in a research project, contributing to Responsible Research and Innovation.

AB  - Following the recent mass migration of refugees to the European Union in 2015 and 2016, many EU countries took significant steps aimed at improving the socio-economic integration of the refugees. This study examines refugee entrepreneurship in rural areas in Sweden as evidenced in the agri-food industry. Entrepreneurship is often considered a sustainable activity that can promote refugees' economic independence and social integration. The rural setting offers promising employment opportunities for refugees with agricultural backgrounds or interest. Qualitative research methodology, based on 25 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with refugees, is used to examine refugee entrepreneurs' experiences in the various phases of the entrepreneurial process, from start-up and growth to success/exit. The study found that refugee entrepreneurs are motivated and challenged variously as they start and operate their entrepreneurial activities. For example, they are motivated by the discovery of niche markets, previous entrepreneurial experience, and the availability of family and government support. Challenges include legislative hurdles, management and technical problems, and insufficient financial and other support. Factors both within and outside their control influence the survival of their entrepreneurship.

AB  - Juvenile cannibalism may play an important role in population regulation of marine organisms with juvenile stages that aggregate in nursery habitats. I conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to assess whether three potential density-dependent mechanisms could regulate local recruitment of juvenile shore crabs Carcinus maenas in Swedish nursery areas: (1) intracohort cannibalism, (2) juvenile cannibals' functional response to smaller conspecific prey densities, and (3) juvenile cannibals' numerical effect on prey survival.
   Juvenile cannibals in mesocosms displayed a type III (sigmoid) density-dependent functional response, resulting in significantly higher proportional mortality of smaller conspecifics at high prey densities. Consistent with the laboratory result, cage-enclosed juvenile cannibals in a field experiment eliminated conspecific settlement peaks in mussel habitats and decoupled the relationship between larval and settlement abundance within three days. Density-dependent interference between cannibals in mesocosms decreased per capita predation rates, but conspecific prey mortality still increased with cannibal densities when the abundance of cannibals passed a critical threshold, suggesting that the recruitment success of consecutive cohorts may be negatively correlated. This was supported in a field experiment where the abundance of juvenile cannibals explained 71% of the variation in settlement loss from uncaged mussel habitats. Density-dependent cannibalism also occurred within juvenile cohorts even though food was provided in excess, but the resulting mortality was too low to eliminate initial density: patterns over a 30-day period.
   The results demonstrate that cannibalism between juvenile shore crabs can cause high and strongly density-dependent mortality at natural densities, and that both a functional response and a numerical effect of larger cannibals can regulate the recruitment of new cohorts within days of settlement. A coupling of cannibal and settlement densities on a regional scale is expected to decrease recruitment variability within and between local populations. Moreover, the interaction between the type III functional response, mutual interference, and density-dependent dispersal of cannibals is predicted to reduce cannibalistic rates at low prey and high cannibal densities, respectively, and stabilize local population dynamics in relation to the abundance of juvenile habitats, consistent with field observations of shore crab populations in the study area.

AB  - The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) (Anoplophora glabripennis) is an invasive insect pest that has established populations in Worcester County, Massachusetts as of 2008. ALB predominantly targets red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), which are prominent in New England hardwood forests, and Norway maple (Acer platanoides), which was planted in built environments as street trees in response to severe weather and invasive insect and pathogen disturbances. Mahalanobis Typicality models related presence locations of ALB presence-only locations in Worcester County towns from 2008 to 2012 to biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic variables to predict the potential distribution of ALB and to determine locations most characteristic of infestation, k-fold cross-validation and a continuous Boyce Index were employed to validate model performance and to identify threshold values at which continuous models of typicality could be reclassified into categorical maps. Distance-to-roads (r(2) = 0.19) and probability of maple presence (r(2) = 0.13) were the most important predictor variables in the ALB model. Locations that were most consistently susceptible to ALB infestation had significant high maple presence (p < 0.001) and significant low distance-to-roads (p < 0.001) compared to the whole study area, suggesting that ALB in Worcester County, MA, prefers maple-dominant edge habitats at the current stage of invasion. The localized ALB potential distribution model was consistently accurate (Boyce Continuous Index = 0.84) despite the lack of absence locations and incomplete knowledge of ALB niche breadth in both native and invaded ranges. The results from this study could be used as a baseline for effective adaptive management policies that could help prioritize the need for early detection/eradication measures and address the potential ecological and social ramifications of the current ALB outbreak in Worcester County. It is hoped that the model employed could be further tested for future outbreaks as they are discovered in the USA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, an updated distribution of Lophelia pertusa between the Porcupine Seabight and Norwegian shelf is presented. It seems unlikely that enigmatic mound structures observed at water depths of more than 570 m during acoustic seabed surveys, particularly to the west of the Shetland Islands, are related to the occurrence of L. pertusa. At these depths in the Faroe-Shetland Channel, the predominant influence of cold Arctic water precludes its growth. Iceberg dumpsites are also considered unlikely explanations for the origin of these mounds, and they are interpreted as most likely to be related to the release of fluids at the seabed. When mound structures were investigated, no scleractinian corals were recovered at water depths >500 m. This study shows the importance of seabed temperature as an environmental control on cold-water coral distribution. The significance of cold-water coral habitats in sustaining high levels of local-scale biodiversity is now becoming apparent in parallel with increased hydrocarbon extraction and fishing activity beyond the shelf edge. There is growing evidence that these areas have been marked by the passage of deep-water trawls. It seems likely that trawling activity has already reduced the extent of cold-water coral distribution in this region of the north-east Atlantic. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interviews with Swedish authorities reveal large variations in the time horizons and discount rates used in their policy decisions. The time horizon, i.e. the future time period for which effects are included in the analysis, is seldom longer than 40-50 years, and nuclear waste is the only area in which a time horizon longer than 100 years is used regularly. Discount rates for non-commercial purposes vary between 2 per cent and 4 per cent, with 4 per cent as the most common rate. The differences between policy areas appear to be unsystematic and insufficiently justified. We suggest that there may be a need for coordination and, possibly, harmonization, of the choices of time horizons and discount rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. We examine causes and consequences of natal dispersal within a metapopulation of house sparrows Passer domesticus in an archipelago in Northern Norway when a large proportion of the individuals is colour-ringed.
   2. Less than 10% of the fledglings dispersed, i.e. left their natal island.
   3. Dispersal was female biased and almost exclusively performed by juveniles.
   4. The probability of natal dispersal was not related either to the body condition or the body mass of the juvenile. Similarly, neither clutch size nor hatching date explained a significant proportion of the variance in the probability of dispersal.
   5. The probability of male natal dispersal was related to the rank of the fledgling in the size-hierarchy within the brood. Low ranking individuals that hatched early in the season were more likely to disperse.
   6. In both sexes, the survival of dispersers at the island of establishment was higher than among the residents on that island. Similarly, dispersers survived better than adults that remained on their island of birth.
   7. These results suggest that dispersal may be an adaptive strategy to avoid poor conditions in the natal area.

AB  - Due to conservation needs, reliable rapid-assessment methods for mapping of biodiversity are needed. One approach is to use surrogates, i.e. quantities that correlate strongly with the number of species, but are easier to obtain. The purpose of this paper is to test two polychaete surrogates, one for higher taxa and one for indicator groups, that will facilitate prediction of species richness in marine soft-bottom communities. Soft sediment is an important habitat which covers most of the ocean bottom. Data on polychaetes from the North Atlantic were used since polychaetes are often numerically dominant in the benthic assemblages, both with regard to the number of species and their abundance. In the polychaete assemblages along the Norwegian coast, richness at the genus, family and order level were significantly, linearly correlated to total species richness (r greater than or equal to 0.92). Polychaetes in the order Terebellida were found to be a good indicator of polychaete species richness and to a lesser extent also of whole benthic assemblages. The group Terebellida is potentially well suited as an indicator group, since it contains long-lived, large species that are easy to sort from the sediment and it is well defined taxonomically. Although promising as proxies for species richness in marine biodiversity studies, the use of lower taxonomic resolution and indicator groups requires further investigations in more local areas where there are conservation issues.

AB  - The analysis show how the Swedish iron ore producer, LKAB, in spite of mining its ore underground in an arctic climate at relatively high costs, has remained internationally competitive thanks to its large-scale operation with high grade magnetite ore, pelletization and relatively short distance to both its shipping harbour and its international markets. LKAB starts at a relatively high level on the supply curve with respect to mining costs, but as the analysis continues to describe, LKAB moves gradually downwards on the supply curve on delivered pellet costs. The analysis clearly shows that LKAB has successfully managed to find its comparative advantage and that its competitive strength is sustainable, primarily thanks to its rich deposits of magnetite ore.

AB  - In recent years, unquestionable warnings like the negative effects of CO2 emissions, the necessity of utilizing sustainable energy sources, and the rising demand for municipal electrification have been issued. Therefore, users are encouraged to provide off-grid and sustainable energy systems for their own homes and businesses, especially if they are located rurally and far from grids. Hence, this study aims to design an off-grid hybrid energy system, in order to minimize both the baseline cost of energy and the net current expenditure in the desired system. To construct such a system, wind generators (WG), photovoltaic arrays (PV), battery banks, and bi-directional converters are considered in the real case of a supermarket with a 20-year lifespan in Malmo, Sweden. Some significant assumptions, such as the usage of renewable energy resources only, electricity production close to the business location, and a maximum allowance of 0.1% unmet are incorporated. To optimize the considered problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach as developed to provide the load requirements and establish the number of WGs, PVs, and other equipment. Moreover, to verify the obtained results, the developed system was simulated using HOMER Pro software, and the results are compared and discussed. The results indicated that the designed hybrid energy system is able to perform completely off-grid, while satisfying 99.9% of the yearly electricity demand. The best results obtained by the proposed PSO offered 160, 5, and 350 PVs, WGs, and batteries, respectively, while the best solution found by the simulation method was the use of 384 PVs, 5 WGs, and 189 batteries for the considered off-grid system. This study contributes to decentralized local electrification by utilizing renewable energy sources that have the potential to revolutionize green energy solutions.

Actions are now underway to establish a permanent Guinea Current Commission (GCC) to oversee the sustainable development of the goods and services of the GCLME. The movement towards establishment of the GCC is provided with financial support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Technical support is provided to participating countries by four UN agencies (UNEP, UNDP, UNIDO and FAO). Additional support is provided by the World Bank and other international organizations in Norway, Sweden, Germany and the United States. The movement towards establishment of a permanent GCC is supported by a powerful political coalition of ministers of the 16 participating countries, along with a strong cadre of scientists and technical professionals from the region with proficiency in the LME approach gained from earlier phases of GEF regional projects. The GCC will be linked to an expanded scope of environmental protection provided to the region by the Abidjan Convention through a unique new "protocol" as decided at the 2nd Ministerial Meeting in the Osu Declaration that supports ecosystem-based assessment and management practices for sustainable development of the GCLME.

AB  - To study the feasibility of earthworm introduction for increasing the macroporosity and permeability of arable heavy clay, deep-burrowing earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L.) were inoculated into a tile drained experimental field in Jokioinen, S-W Finland in autumn 1996. Inoculation with the Earthworm Inoculation Unit technique was at the up-slope end of the field, in the field margins under permanent grass, and inside the four 0.46 ha plots of the field. The experiment was monitored on three occasions. In 1998 the L terrestris population had persisted in low numbers only in field and plot margins. By 2003, when the field had been under set-aside grass for three years, density had grown in the margins and L terrestris were also found inside the field at a very low density. The third monitoring was in autumn 2009, after a further four years as set-aside and a subsequent division of the field into no-till and ploughing management, and looked at the effects of management (margins, no-till, ploughing). distance from the inoculation and sub-drainage on L terrestris abundance. The abundance displayed a clear gradient over the field, declining from 14 ind. and 18 gm(-2) at 5-9 m from inoculation, to 1 ind. and 2 gm(-2) at 56-60 m distance. Margins had the highest abundances (16 ind. and 32 gm(-2)), followed by no-till (4 ind. and 4 gm(-2)) and ploughing (1 ind. and 1 gm(-2)). Abundances were significantly higher above the tiles than between them (P<0.05). The results demonstrate the importance of no-till and sub-drain line habitats as settlement supports for the inoculated population. Field margins proved to be decisive for inoculation success, by providing bridgeheads for population establishment and later by acting as source areas for the colonisation of the field. This finding highlights the general importance of field margins in the dispersal ecology of earthworms in arable landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The town of Kiruna, founded in 1900 in the northernmost part of Sweden, is nowadays in the middle of an impressive urban transformation: due to the impacts of mining activities a large part of the city center has to be moved or rebuilt. Among the buildings to be moved and kept in use are some of the so-called 'Blackhorn' timber houses, designed by Gustaf Wickman in the early 20th century as residential units for the workers of the mining company LKAB and part of the original core of Kiruna. This has raised several questions on the sustainability of renovating historic buildings in a sub-arctic climate. In order to explore the challenge of increasing the energy efficiency of the Blackhorn houses, data on their constructional and historical features as well as their thermal and energy performance have been collected. The paper addresses the following issues. Historic buildings are often blamed for their poor energy efficiency without considering their usually high constructional quality. What do we know about the real performances of these buildings? Energy retrofits in non-monumental and inhabited historic buildings are often guided by practical and operational needs rather than by their heritage significance. Can a value-based approach affect the improvement of energy efficiency? In a subarctic climate, even simple interventions can help to save a considerable amount of energy in historic buildings. To which extent the energy performances of the Blackhorn houses could be increased without affecting their heritage values?

AB  - Changes in habitat affect the distribution of species at different spatial and temporal scales. Our aim was to assess the use of several retrospective methods when determining habitat history and its influence on species distribution, using the pendent lichen Usnea longissima Ach. as a model organism. The study was carried out in a Norway spruce dominated forest, located in the middle boreal zone of northern Sweden. Historical sources (including forest inventories and maps) and dendrochronology were combined with field surveys to determine past stand characteristics with a high spatial precision. Also, present stand characteristics were thoroughly surveyed and the relationship between distribution of U. longissima and past and present habitat characteristics were evaluated. Our results showed that, despite the fact that historical logging was unevenly distributed within the study area, similarities in stand structure exist today. Several essential factors affecting the distribution of U. longissima could be related to changes in past stand structure, especially the extent and intensity of previous logging operations and the subsequent stand development during the last c. 150 years. Our results also showed that U. longissima was favoured by a continuous old age structure with canopy openness preserved. The importance of detailed reconstructions of specific habitat components is highlighted when relating species presence to habitat change. It is suggested that the use of retrospective methods presented in this study can be helpful in clarifying possible causes for the complex distribution of certain organisms.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the functioning of the event industry. This article aims to present the impact of infection control measures on the event sector. In addition, the article compares the infection control measures implemented in Poland and Norway. The COVID-19 infection measures analysis is the first stage of a project to build the resilience of the event sector. The study was conducted based on secondary data (analysis of documents and public statistics, with the support of the literature). The research used the descriptive method and comparisons. The results of the study confirmed the following research hypotheses according to which: (1) uncertainty is conducive to overreactions, both of the government and entities from the event sector; (2) mutual trust between government and society reduces the need for restrictions; and (3) the lack of mutual trust between government and society increases uncertainty. Furthermore, the inability to meet people, limited access to culture, and the need to work from home contributed to the deterioration of societies' quality of life and mental health. This means that the pandemic has an adverse impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 and 8).

AB  - Introduction Air pollution has been suggested to be associated with depression. However, current evidence is conflicting, and no study has considered different sources of ambient particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter below 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). We evaluated the associations of long-term exposure to PM2.5 from road traffic and residential wood combustion with the prevalence of depression in the Helsinki region, Finland. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis based on the Helsinki Capital Region Environmental Health Survey 2015-2016 (N=5895). Modelled long-term outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 were evaluated using high-resolution emission and dispersion modelling on an urban scale and linked to the home addresses of study participants. The outcome was self-reported doctor-diagnosed or treated depression. We applied logistic regression and calculated the OR for 1 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5, with 95% CI. Models were adjusted for potential confounders, including traffic noise and urban green space. Results Of the participants, 377 reported to have been diagnosed or treated for depression by a doctor. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 from road traffic (OR=1.23, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.73; n=5895) or residential wood combustion (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.41; n=5895) was not associated with the prevalence of depression. The estimates for PM2.5 from road traffic were elevated, but statistically non-significant, for non-smokers (OR=1.38, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.01; n=4716). Conclusions We found no convincing evidence of an effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 from road traffic or residential wood combustion on depression.

AB  - Wood is a complex hierarchical material. As a widely available renewable resource, it has been used throughout history to construct dwellings and transportation, tools, art and funerary objects. The desire to better understand cultural heritage and preserve it for future generations has long been a major driver in the study of wooden objects in the social sciences. This trend can also be associated with a recent strong push to create, low-cost, environmentally-responsible, sustainable housing solutions for rapidly expanding urban populations. Thus, interest in studying wood degradation and conservation from an engineering/materials science perspective has increased significantly. The study of degradation phenomena in wooden artefacts, along with methods to conserve or enhance their material properties and monitor changes over time is, not only, invaluable to archaeological science, but also to engineers and materials scientists concerned with the endurance of the wooden constructions of tomorrow. The aim of this review is to highlight recent developments in the characterisation, consolidation and monitoring of materials properties of archaeological wood. A specific focus will be placed on bio-sourced consolidants and multi-phase systems based on nano-fillers, recognising the contribution to archaeological science and underlining the impact this knowledge can play on future developments in wooden construction.

AB  - The Nordic Seas is a hotspot both in terms of climate related processes, such as Atlantic-Arctic heat exchange, and natural marine resources. A sustainable management of the marine resources within the Nordic Seas, including the co-existence between fisheries and petroleum industries, requires detailed information on the state of the ocean within an operational framework and beyond what is obtainable from observations only. Numerical ocean models applying data assimilation techniques are utilized to address this need. Subsequently, comprehensive comparisons between model results and observations are required in order to assess the model perforinance. Here, we apply a set of objective statistics to quantitatively assess the added value of data assimilation in numerical ocean models that are currently used operationally. The results indicate that the inclusion of data assimilation improves the model performance both in terms of hydrographic properties and volume and heat transports. Furthermore, we find that increasing the resolution towards eddy resolving resolution performs similarly to coarser resolution models applying data assimilation in shelf areas. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Mercury is transported globally in the atmosphere mostly in gaseous elemental form (GEM, ), but still few worldwide studies taking into account different and contrasted environmental settings are available in a single publication. This work presents and discusses data from Argentina, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Chile, China, Croatia, Finland, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Slovenia and Venezuela. We classified the information in four groups: (1) mining districts where this contaminant poses or has posed a risk for human populations and/or ecosystems; (2) cities, where the concentration of atmospheric mercury could be higher than normal due to the burning of fossil fuels and industrial activities; (3) areas with natural emissions from volcanoes; and (4) pristine areas where no anthropogenic influence was apparent. All the surveys were performed using portable LUMEX RA-915 series atomic absorption spectrometers. The results for cities fall within a low GEM concentration range that rarely exceeds 30 ng m(-3), that is, 6.6 times lower than the restrictive ATSDR threshold (200 ng m(-3)) for chronic exposure to this pollutant. We also observed this behavior in the former mercury mining districts, where few data were above 200 ng m(-3). We noted that high concentrations of GEM are localized phenomena that fade away in short distances. However, this does not imply that they do not pose a risk for those working in close proximity to the source. This is the case of the artisanal gold miners that heat the Au-Hg amalgam to vaporize mercury. In this respect, while GEM can be truly regarded as a hazard, because of possible physical-chemical transformations into other species, it is only under these localized conditions, implying exposure to high GEM concentrations, which it becomes a direct risk for humans.

AB  - A change from cultivated land to grassland generally increases soil organic matter (SOM) content and is a potential option to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. We investigated the effects of two-year perennial grass and mixed grass/legume leys in a six-year crop rotation on topsoil (0-0.25 m depth) carbon content and on grain yields of winter wheat over a period of 31 years. Different nitrogen fertilisation regimes were included and no manure was added to the experimental plots. We used data from long-term crop rotation experiments at three sites in southern Sweden: Saby (59 degrees 49' N/17 degrees 42' E), Lanna (58 degrees 20' N/13 degrees 07' E) and Stenstugu (57 degrees 36' N/18 degrees 26' E). At Saby, the reduction in topsoil carbon content was smaller in the ley crop rotations than in the crop rotation with only annual crops. There were no statistically significant effects of crop rotation on topsoil carbon at the other two sites. At Lanna, the grain yield increase in winter wheat over time was higher in the mixed legume/grass ley crop rotation than in the other two rotations. Together, these effects of ley on topsoil carbon and winter wheat yield suggest that replacing annual crops with leys in the crop rotation could reduce losses of soil carbon without decreasing total yield of annual crops on a regional scale. We also applied the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) to simulate topsoil carbon content at the three sites. Based on the results, measures to improve the model predictability are proposed.

AB  - Studies on predatory arthropods in agricultural areas seldom include Diptera other than hoverflies, partly because common sampling methods are less effective for capturing species that easily fly off when disturbed. To study the effect from this bias when describing the predator community, we compared traditional beat sampling of branches and suction sampling for describing the community of predatory arthropods in Swedish apple orchards, both organic orchards and orchards using integrated pest management (IPM). Our results indicate that the proportion of both predatory dipterans and parasitic hymenopterans increase dramatically when using suction sampling (Diptera: 32% vs. 20%, Hymenoptera: 25% vs. 7%). In fact, predatory dipterans were the most abundant predatory group when using suction sampling, in contrast to beat sampling where spiders were the most abundant group. One group of predatory flies that was particularly rich in both species and individuals in the surveyed apple orchards was dance flies in the family Hybotidae. Even though the bias of sampling method was evident, it was encouraging that the method choice did not affect the conclusions concerning management on predatory arthropod communities. With both methods, dipteran and coleopteran predators were more abundant in organic apple orchards whereas opilionids were more abundant in orchards managed according to IPM. The inclusion of landscape variables further indicated effects of landscape diversity and of deciduous forest cover, but the response varied in sign between predatory groups. Whereas both Coleoptera and Heteroptera were more abundant in orchards surrounded by more complex landscapes (high landscape diversity and/or high deciduous forest cover), spiders, opilionids and dipterans were rather less abundant in these orchards. To conclude, our study points to the potential importance of predatory dipterans in apple orchards, and we highly recommend future studies of arthropod predators in apple and other crops to actively include predatory Diptera.

AB  - Green-tree retention aims at maintaining biodiversity while harvesting timber, but knowledge of its efficiency is still limited. Green-tree retention may function as a 'life-boat' for organisms, maintain structural features, or create stepping-stones in the harvested landscape. The aim of this study is to determine whether larger retention-tree groups established in clear-cuts maintain forest species better than smaller ones. We posed hypotheses for different habitat affinity groups of spiders and carabids, and tested them in Eastern Finland with 11 retention-tree groups, 0.09 - 0.55 ha in size (47 - 385 trees per tree group). Although some of the analysed species responded as expected, we did not find unambiguous support for the hypotheses that (1) species requiring forest and/or (medium-) moist habitat should be more abundant in larger retention-tree groups, (2) species requiring (semi-) open and/or (medium-) dry habitat should be more common in smaller retention-tree groups, and (3) species indifferent with respect to light intensity and moisture should be caught in equal numbers in all retention-tree groups irrespective of their size. However, the mean numbers of individuals of many forest species and/or species requiring (medium-) moist habitat decreased over the 3 years after logging in all retention-tree groups, whereas the mean numbers of many species of (semi-) open and/or (medium-) dry habitat increased over the 3 years after logging. Furthermore, species composition changed from the pre-treatment year for spiders. We conclude that green-tree retention is justified because (1) retention-tree groups tend to maintain some forest species, thereby mitigating the effects of clear-cutting, at least in the short term, (2) they provide dead wood, large old trees, and other structural features, and (3) there are gaps in our ecological knowledge that warrant the adoption of the precautionary principle. However, as there are economic costs associated with the establishment of retention-tree groups, their ecological benefits as compared to other approaches aimed at maintaining biodiversity should be assessed carefully.

AB  - Fish biomass estimates in European coastal waters are necessary for several reasons, e.g., for meeting requirements in legislation and international agreements, for establishing sustainable outtakes of the resources, for developing management plans and for assessing the ecological and environmental status of coastal waters. This study estimated piscivorous and non-piscivorous fish biomass as well as total fish biomass in Kvadofjarden Bay on the Swedish Baltic Sea coast using dynamic foodweb modelling. Weight-per-unit-effort data from the coastal fish monitoring program in the area together with a range of abiotic variables (including salinity and total phosphorus) were used as drivers for the CoastWeb model. To further refine the estimates of fish biomass, we complemented the model by using data from nearby areas on the ratio of piscivorous to non-piscivorous fish for those size classes not representatively sampled by the monitoring gear (fish < 12 cm). Piscivorous fish biomass in the area was estimated at 10-14 tonnes (4.6-6.5 kg/ha), non-piscivorous fish biomass at 105-139 tonnes (47-62 kg/ha) and the subsequent total fish biomass was estimated at 115-154 tonnes (52-69 kg/ha). The estimated range of total fish biomass was comparable with findings from other investigations on the Swedish Baltic Sea coast which used a coarser methodology. The method presented in this paper can be used for making biomass estimates in other coastal waters where passive gears are used to monitor the local fish communities, and could thus serve a range of purposes for assessing the production and status of fish in coastal waters.

AB  - Feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates is significant in determining aquatic ecosystem functioning. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the distribution of feeding guilds, and in particular on the influence of climate on the feeding functions at large spatial and long temporal scales. In this study, lakes at different climatic zones are examined for modern abundances of midge (Diptera) feeding guilds to establish the relationships between the feeding functions and climate. In addition, 11,000-year and 700-year sediment core records are investigated for their midge feeding guilds to establish their long-term relationships with climate changes. The results indicated that feeding guilds had a significant relationship with air temperature in the modern dataset and similar climate-related patterns in trait abundances had also occurred during the important climatic intervals of the past. In addition, the long-term records agreed with the modern spatial dataset in that feeding guild diversity was decreased under warm and cold climate compared to intermediate climate conditions. The results of this study are significant in demonstrating the influence of climate on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and in providing valuable information on long-term variability in feeding functions that is needed to better understand future changes under the ongoing climate change.

AB  - According to the theory of island biogeography, species richness in island-like systems is determined by ecosystem size and isolation. However, there is only very little information about how this theory applies to microorganisms. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of local physicochemical variables, land use and geographical factors on diatom species richness and community composition in 50 boreal springs in Finland, and to test for species-area and species-isolation relationships. There were nonsignificant relationships between species richness and spring area and isolation. The best approximating generalized linear model suggested that variation in species richness was related to several local resource and stress factors such as water conductivity, pH, colour, temperature and nutrient concentrations. Based on Mantel tests, diatom community similarity was significantly correlated with environmental distance, but not with geographical distance. Analysis of similarities further showed that community compositions did not differ significantly between ecoregions. These results suggest that spatial factors are of minor importance for spring diatoms compared with environmental filtering. Patterns in spring diatoms do not concur with the theory of island biogeography as we found no support for species-area or species-isolation relationships. At these spatial scales, dispersal limitation does not seem to influence diatom communities.

AB  - Forty samples each of leaves, bark and wood of mountain birch (Betula pubeseens EHRH.) were collected along a 120 km long south-north transect running through Norway's largest city, Oslo. Concentrations of 26 chemical elements (Ag, As, An, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sr, Ti and Zn) as well as loss on ignition for the three sample materials are reported. By far the highest concentrations of most elements appear in the leaves. Prominent exceptions are An and Pb, both of which are enriched in wood, indicating the importance of root-uptake, and As which is enriched in bark. Bedrock lithology, ore occurrences, soil pH and urban contamination all have a visible influence on the element concentrations in mountain birch leaves, bark and wood. It is often impossible to differentiate between all the factors that can influence element concentrations in the three sample materials. Mountain birch bark shows the strongest anthropogenic impact of the city of Oslo for dust-related elements (Fe, La, Ti) and Sb. Even in mountain birch bark the influence of the city on element concentrations is no longer discernible from the background variation at a distance of less than 20 km from Oslo centre. Compared to terrestrial moss, mountain birch appears to be of little value as a biomonitor for urban contamination. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The first mile/last mile (FM/LM) problem in public transport refers to the spatial accessibility of public transport and is the most important factor determining whether an individual will choose public transport. The FM/LM problem in Stockholm County, Sweden, was evaluated using a Geographic Information System estimating distances to public transport for the years 2019 and 2035. Overall, the population in Stockholm County, have good access to public transport. However, access varies with abilities, with elderly having 50 percent and elderly impaired 15 percent of their area within walking distance to public transport compared with the average citizen. Planned developments can provide good access to public transport, with extensive improvements for the elderly. However, inadequate planning for population increase will likely decrease the perceived public transport accessibility. Apartments and commercial buildings in the study area have high access to public transport. Elderly people have good access within city and regional centers, while access could be improved in other areas. Inclusion of FM/LM in the planning support system used in Stockholm could help mitigate FM/LM problems and extend access to public transport to all people of different abilities. This is vital in creating sustainable mobility networks and achieving sustainable development in smart cities.

AB  - Stream-water samples were collected during a 4-year-period in two small streams, one whose catchment was ditched for forestry halfway through the sampling period and another nearby reference stream whose catchment was not ditched during this period. The main aim was to study the impact of forest ditching on stream-water quality. Whereas the artificial drainage did not change the hydrograph pattern, it had a large effect on stream hydrochemistry: the concentrations of suspended material, Mn, Ca, Mg and Al increased, the concentrations of total organic carbon decreased, and pH increased by approximately one unit, from an average of 4.4 to 5.4. The increase in suspended material, Mn and Al concentrations is explained by the physical mobilisation of mineral particulates/colloids from mineral soils (till) exposed on the ditch slopes beneath the peat layer, while the increase in Ca and Mg loads is explained by the release of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in exchange reactions in this same soil layer. The increase in pH and decrease in TOC concentrations after ditching are related to changes in hydrological flow paths in the catchments, and most likely to immobilisation of both hydrogen ions and humic substances in the near neutral till horizon exposed beneath the peat layer. Only the aquatic abundance of Fe was not significantly affected by the ditching.

AB  - When Kerstin Ekman's Skraplotter (Scratch Cards) appeared in 2003, the novel was read as representing an impoverished version of contemporary Sweden, viewed from the margin. This article questions such easy conclusions by reading the text in terms of narrative and narration, drawing especially on feminist narratology and Susan S. Lanser's notion of narrative voice. The analysis demonstrates how the narration helps authorise three characters on the margin of the Swedish welfare state, one of them Saami, female and elderly, another elderly and male, and the third a middle-aged female minister in the Lutheran State Church. With the novel's narrative voices approaching Lanser's 'communal voice', the reader is prodded to reconsider the concepts of centre and margin and the relationships between them. Viewed in light of Rosi Braidotti's notion of 'nomadic becoming', subjectivation in this novel extends into the rhizomic mode; in other words, it is Vans-personal [ ... ], ultimately collective'. The text's allegedly impoverished version of contemporary Sweden turns out to point boldly ahead, away from the welfare state as we have known it and towards more inclusive and sustainable communities.

   The increasing access to autonomously-operated technologies offer vast opportunities to sample large volumes of biological data. However, these technologies also impose novel demands on ecologists who need to apply tools for data management and processing that are efficient, publicly available and easy to use. Such tools are starting to be developed for a wider community and here we present an approach to combine essential analytical functions for analysing large volumes of image data in marine ecological research.
   New information
   This paper describes the Koster Seafloor Observatory, an open-source approach to analysing large amounts of subsea movie data for marine ecological research. The approach incorporates three distinct modules to: manage and archive the subsea movies, involve citizen scientists to accurately classify the footage and, finally, train and test machine learning algorithms for detection of biological objects. This modular approach is based on open-source code and allows researchers to customise and further develop the presented functionalities to various types of data and questions related to analysis of marine imagery. We tested our approach for monitoring cold water corals in a Marine Protected Area in Sweden using videos from remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs). Our study resulted in a machine learning model with an adequate performance, which was entirely trained with classifications provided by citizen scientists. We illustrate the application of machine learning models for automated inventories and monitoring of cold water corals. Our approach shows how citizen science can be used to effectively extract occurrence and abundance data for key ecological species and habitats from underwater footage. We conclude that the combination of open-source tools, citizen science systems, machine learning and high performance computational resources are key to successfully analyse large amounts of underwater imagery in the future.

AB  - An extensive literature is available on browsing preference for certain tree species. However, useful predictive tools for estimating the impact of deer on forests production and biodiversity can still be improved. A step in that direction is not only to rank preference among tree species but also to quantify the relative risk of being browsed. The foraging selectivity of moose was evaluated using three different statistical methods developed to study habitat utilization. The general pattern for the three methods was consistent. From the results, groups of forage species were clustered and a quantitative index of selectivity was calculated for the groups. The selectivity index showed that rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), willow ( Salix ssp.) and aspen ( Populus tremula) had a 14 times higher probability of being browsed than a group consisting of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris) and downy birch ( Betula pubescens), while juniper ( Juniperus communis) and silver birch ( Betula pendula) had a 3.5 times higher probability than Scots pine and downy birch. Since the most preferred species were the least abundant, one should be cautious about the generality of the index between areas, as it may indicate that preference depends on plant species composition. The method used can easily be applied in forest management. Information on quantitative selectivity indices may improve the possibility of managing moose in accordance with acceptable browsing damage.

AB  - Neva Bay is the shallowest and easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea). St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, occupies the coastal area where the Neva River debouches into Neva Bay. St. Petersburg has a protracted history of industrial, transportation and urban related activity that have affected Neva Bay. By the sealing off the bay from the eastern Gulf of Finland, the St. Petersburg Flood Protective Facility, which was constructed from the 1970's to 2011, transformed Neva Bay into a "technogenic" lagoon. Neva Bay sediments record a unique history of pollution near the metropolis. Heavy metal concentrations of most elements studied varied consistently throughout sediment cores. Temporal trends indicate that metals started to accumulate abruptly in the first half of the 20th century. Zinc, lead and copper were the first metals to reach contaminant thresholds implicating the regional base metal industry as a source. Significant increase in cadmium levels a decade or two later suggests pollution from the regional chemical industry. Comparison of geochemical data collected from sediment cores and recent annual sediment surveys highlighted the temporal history and potential sources of pollution in Neva Bay. Intensive dredging in 2007-2008 resuspended and redistributed contaminated sediment around Neva Bay causing a dramatic increase in benthic sediment heavy metal concentrations. Concentrations of all measured metals subsequently declined from 2009-2014 relative to the elevated values observed for 2007-2008. Pollution history of Neva Bay bottom sediments is closely linked with changing of sedimentation conditions. Analyses of sedimentological data collected by 20th and 21st century scientific surveys reveal dramatic shifts in Neva Bay sedimentation processes over the last three centuries. The western part of Neva Bay has transitioned from a sand-dominated system to one of mud accumulation with the aerial extent of mud deposition expanding significantly during the 20th century. This inventory coupled with an understanding of primary natural and anthropogenic processes can help inform decision makers to support the overall ecological health of the bay.

AB  - Co-processing is an industrial technique of using wastes as a substitute for raw materials and/or fuels, as a way to minimize the consumption of minerals and non-renewable fossil fuels. This paper presents a brief overview on such practices conducted by the cement industry in Latin America. The main issue addressed is co-processing as a contribution to develop a more sustainable scenario in cement production and as a valuable tool in waste management. Cement industries are particularly suitable for wastes co-processing, due to the high temperatures reached inside their kilns, which favor the degradation of toxic compounds formed upon burning of certain wastes. Developed countries, particularly in the European Union, have been replacing fossil fuels by wastes since the 1970's. In the Netherlands, the calorific substitution rate is higher than 80%, while in Austria, Germany and Norway it is over 60%. In Latin America, those values vary between 7 and 20% according to the country. This study has found that the main differences between European and Latin American regions are caused by distinct implementation degrees of waste management chain and by legal requirements and inspection practices of industrial activities. However, the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) estimates that until 2030, the substitution of fossil fuels by wastes in Latin America will reach 25 to 35%. This numbers are the same reached by Denmark, France and Sweden in 2010. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chironomidae (Diptera) pupal exuviae samples are commonly used for biological monitoring of aquatic habitats. DNA barcoding has proved useful for species identification of chironomid life stages containing cellular tissue, but the barcoding success of chironomid pupal exuviae is unknown. We assessed whether standard DNA barcoding could be efficiently used for species identification of chironomid pupal exuviae when compared with morphological techniques and if there were differences in performance between temperate and tropical ecosystems, subfamilies, and tribes. PCR, sequence, and identification success differed significantly between geographic regions and taxonomic groups. For Norway, 27 out of 190 (14.2%) of pupal exuviae resulted in high-quality chironomid sequences that match species. For Costa Rica, 69 out of 190 (36.3%) Costa Rican pupal exuviae resulted in high-quality sequences, but none matched known species. Standard DNA barcoding of chironomid pupal exuviae had limited success in species identification of unknown specimens due to contaminations and lack of matching references in available barcode libraries, especially from Costa Rica. Therefore, we recommend future biodiversity studies that focus their efforts on understudied regions, to simultaneously use morphological and molecular identification techniques to identify all life stages of chironomids and populate the barcode reference library with identified sequences.

AB  - The sustainable use of renewable resources has become an important issue worldwide in the move towards a less fossil-fuel-intensive future. Mainstream method for fulfilling this aim is to increase the share of renewable energy and materials to substitute fossil fuels and to become fully independent from fossil fuels over the long-term. However, the environmental sustainability of this endeavor has been questioned. In addition, economic and social sustainability issues are also much debated topics in this particular context. Forest resources are often thought to contribute partially to achieving a so-called "carbon-neutral society". In this review, we discuss sustainability issues of using forest biomass. We present several sustainability indicators for ecological, economic and social dimensions and discuss the issues in applying them in sustainability impact assessments (SIAs). We also present a number of tools and methods previously used in conducting SIAs. We approach our study from the perspective of the Finnish forestry; in addition, various aspects regarding the application of SIAs in a broader context are also presented. One of the key conclusions of the study is that although sufficient data are available to measure many indicators accurately, the impacts may be very difficult to assess (e.g. impact of greenhouse gases on biodiversity) for conducting a holistic SIA. Furthermore, some indicators, such as "biodiversity", are difficult to quantify in the first place. Therefore, a mix of different methods, such as Multi-criteria Assessment, Life-cycle Assessment or Cost-Benefit Analysis, as well as different approaches (e.g. thresholds and strong/weak sustainability) are needed in aggregating the results of the impacts. SIAs are important in supporting and improving the acceptability of decision-making, but a certain degree of uncertainty will always have to be tolerated.
   Highlights: Forest bioeconomy involves a range of multidimensional impacts.
   A variety of methods exist to assess and evaluate sustainability.
   Social sustainability is the most case-specific dimension to assess.
   Indicators used in SIAs need case-specific considerations.
   More consistency is needed regarding the concept and terminology of sustainability.

AB  - In this study, the distribution of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection in local bank vole Myodes glareolus populations in an area with low human PUUV infection (nephropathia epidemica [NE]) incidence in northern Belgium was monitored for 2 consecutive years. Bank voles were trapped in preferred habitat and tested for anti-PUUV IgG. Infection data were related to individual bank vole features, population demography, and environmental variables. Rare occurrence of PUUV infection was found and PUUV prevalence was low compared with data from the high NE incidence area in southern Belgium. Small-scale climatic differences seemed to play a role in PUUV occurrence, vegetation index and deciduous forest patch size both influenced PUUV prevalence and number of infected voles in a positive way. The data suggested a density threshold in vole populations below which PUUV infection does not occur. This threshold may vary between years, but the abundance of bank voles does not seem to affect the degree of PUUV seroprevalence further. We found indications for a dilution effect on PUUV prevalence, dependent on the relative proportion of nonhost wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus in a study site. In conclusion, we regard the combination of a dilution effect, a possible threshold density that depends on local conditions, and a higher fragmentation of suitable bank vole habitat in our study area as plausible explanations for the sparse occurrence of PUUV infection and low prevalence detected. Thus, beside human activity patterns, local environmental conditions and rodent community structure are also likely to play a role in determining PUUV infection risk for humans.

AB  - Context. Better techniques to detect small numbers of mammalian pests such as rodents are required both to complete large-scale eradications in restoration areas and to detect invaders before they become abundant or cause serious impacts on biodiversity.
   Aims. To evaluate the ability of certified rodent dogs (Canis familiaris) to locate Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and mice (Mus musculus) or their scent trails at very low densities in field conditions.
   Methods. We experimentally tested two rodent dogs by releasing small numbers of laboratory rats and mice in a 63 ha rodent-free forest sanctuary and then determining if the dogs and their handlers could find the rodents and their scent trails. We divided the enclosure into two halves, east and west of the midpoint, and alternated releases daily between the two areas to minimise residual scent between consecutive trials. Radio-tagged rats or mice were released a total of 96 times at random locations that were unknown to handlers, followed for 50-100 m, then caught and either placed in hidden cages at the end of the scent trail or removed from the forest. Handlers and their dogs had up to 6 h to search for rodents.
   Key Results. Despite the extremely low density of rodents in the effective research area of 32 ha, both dogs were highly successful at finding rodents, together locating 87% of rats and 80% of mice. Handlers reported few false positive detections. We found that well-trained dogs can effectively cover 30-40 ha of steep forested habitat in half a day (6 h).
   Conclusions. Despite the limitations of our study design, we conclude that well-trained rodent dogs may be able to locate wild rodents at low densities in forest situations.
   Implications. Our results support the ongoing use of certified dogs to detect rodent survivors and invaders in conservation areas in New Zealand and elsewhere. Additional research is required to trial dogs on experimentally released wild rodents and to compare the cost-effectiveness of dogs with other detection methods.

AB  - The aim of our study was to analyze the stability traits between 33 Norway spruce provenances tested in five field trials across different environmental conditions, in two major variants of the Romanian Carpathians: outside of the natural distribution range (ONR) and in the natural habitat (INR). To justify the early selection, we selected 40-year-old trees and measured tree height (Th), breast height diameter, pruning height, crown diameter, tree volume, tree slenderness (Ts), pruning height ratio, and crown slenderness, which were then compared on a time series with measurements from trees at 30 and 10 years old, respectively. All provenances reacted to the changes in the environmental conditions, presenting higher Th in the warmer ONR environments, compared with the results of the mountain INR trials, with negative consequences on the stand's stability. In all trials, highly significant differences resulted between, and especially within provenances, suggesting a high potential for adaptation in the future climate change scenario. An analysis of the stability traits suggests that we must avoid ONR afforestation with Norway spruce. All the elite provenances (Marginea, Gurghiu, Comandau, and Sudrigiu), together with Campeni and Turda, were highlighted, both for the stability and growth traits, whereas the local provenances and the standard IUFRO provenance were ranked below the average of the trials. The age-age significant correlations and the ranking of the provenances show that no major changes occurred in the last ten years, confirming the backward selection performed at the age of 30 years. The juvenile-mature correlations were also strong but the different evolutions in time of the elite provenances eliminate the possibility of a juvenile selection. The forward selection strategy, for the best trees belonging to the six mentioned provenances, according to Ts, can be applied in the INR trials.

AB  - Future climate development and its effects on forest ecosystems are not easily predicted or described in terms of standard probability concepts. Nevertheless, forest managers continuously make long-term decisions that will be subject to climate change impacts. The manager's assessment of possible developments and impacts and the related uncertainty will affect the combined decision on timing of final harvest and the choice of species for regeneration. We analyse harvest of a Norway spruce stand with the option to regenerate with Norway spruce or oak. We use simulated variations in biophysical risks to generate a set of alternative outcomes, investigating effects on decision making of three aspects of uncertainty: (i) the perceived time horizon before there will be certainty on outcome, (ii) the spread of impacts across the set of alternative outcomes, and (iii) the subjective probability (belief) assigned to each outcome. Results show that the later a forest manager expects to obtain certainty about climate change or the more skewed their belief distribution, the more will decisions be based on ex ante assessments suggesting that if forest managers believe that climate change uncertainty will prevail for a longer period of time, they may make sub-optimal decisions ex ante.

AB  - Land spread liquid manure from housed livestock is both a potential environmental pollutant and a valuable source of plant nutrients to replace chemical fertilizer, but typical farming practice neither minimises pollution nor maximises fertilizer value of manure. With view to providing decision support, a modelling approach has been adopted to study the effects of manure management options on two forms of pollution, that transported by surface runoff(overland flow), and nitrate leaching to field drains or deep groundwater. The Swedish weather-driven simulation models SOIL (soil water) and SOILN (soil nitrogen dynamics) have been adapted for this purpose, including implementation of drainage theory, and calibration/validation for site-specific soils and cropping in Scotland and Ireland.
   Ten year simulations were carried out with a range of management options in different climatic regions. Results show that surface runoff is minimised by confining spreading manure in winter to fields with low runoff susceptibility because of a high profile conductivity. There is limited scope for reducing runoff pollution by selecting days with suitable soil and weather conditions, and this is applicable only to fields with a narrow (intermediate) range of profile conductivities. Nitrate leaching (as well as N losses by volatilization and denitrification) increases non-linearly with organic and mineral N application and varies crucially with application date.
   Results have been incorporated into decision support software for managing manure in terms of selection of fields for spreading, the quantity and timing of field applications, and also applications of complementary mineral fertilizer. Fields are classified in terms of their susceptibility to surface runoff, with defined spreading windows plus daily decisions about conditions being suitable for spreading for fields with intermediate susceptibility only. Nitrate leaching is minimised by making decisions about the quantity of manure applied to match nutrients in the manure to the requirements of the crop. An accurate knowledge of the nutrient composition of manure is required for this, with the computer system communicating with a modified manure tanker equipped to carry out online sensing of nutrients and to give an even spread at a specified application rate.

AB  - Molybdenum mining at Knaben discharged more than eight million tonnes of tailings into two lakes in the upstream end of the Knabeana river, southern Norway, during the period 1918-1973. A dam was built downstream of the lakes in 1976 to stop the fluvial dispersion of tailings. Bulk samples were collected from the tailings pond (n = 30), natural sediment sources (n = 7), sandbars (n = 98), and overbank sediments (0-25 cm depth, n = 79) along the 55-km river reach downstream of the mining area. In addition, overbank sediment samples of 1 cm thickness were collected at depth intervals of 1-5 cm in 19 vertical profiles (n = 497). Sedimentological properties were recorded in 17 of the profiles. Chemical analysis (ICP-AES after hot nitric acid or aqua regia extraction) has shown that a minimum of 420000 tonnes of tailings with a median molybdenum content of 80 ppm are presently stored in the fluvial sediments. The major volumes are present in sandbars in a 6 km long, low-gradient reach that acts as a bedload trap under normal flood conditions. However, bedload may be flushed into the steeper reaches by repeated major events. On the floodplains, C-14-dating has shown that the average sedimentation rate in one profile has increased from 0.5 to 4.3 mm/year due to deposition of tailings. Since lateral channel instability has only been detected in a few locations, the floodplains are regarded as semi-permanent sinks for tailings. However, extreme floods that strip off vegetation or undercut the floodplains may increase the availability of tailings from these deposits. The results from the Knabeana-Kvina rivers indicate that construction of weirs may stop the dispersion of bedload-sized contaminated sediments, while construction of dams may be necessary to trap contaminated sediments transported in suspension. In each case the benefit and disadvantages of such constructions must be evaluated according to the local conditions.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to increase understanding about the causes of conflict in intercompetitor cooperation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The empirical part is based on two case studies within two different industries in Finland: the transportation industry and the natural products industry. Interviews with managing directors were carried out in 2003-2006.
   Findings - The findings of the study show that causes of conflict in intercompetitor cooperation can be related organisationally, relationally or externally Organisational causes of conflict in intercompetitor cooperation can be either operational or normative, while relational causes can be strategic or normative. On an external level there are several actors that may influence conflicts in intercompetitor cooperation: suppliers, salesmen, customers and political actors
   Research limitations/implications - The limitations of the study derive from the scarce possibilities for generalisations and the risk of a fairly case-specific study. Further research should focus on external network actors and their impact on conflict in business-to-business relationships. Another avenue for further study would be to investigate the extent to which the findings from this study can be related to vertical business relationships with minimum levels of competition.
   Practical implications - Cooperating competitors usually have a history, which is mainly based on competition. This history appears to be hard to forget since there is a tendency for competitors to act individualistically by focusing on what is best for their own company instead of the industry as a whole.
   Originality/value - The study focuses on two research areas, neither of which has been adequately researched in the existing literature about interorganisational relationships conflict and intercompetitor cooperation

AB  - The diversity and community structure of macrophyte vegetation was studied in 50 boreal lakes forming several upper reaches of lake chains around Lammi, southern Finland. Water chemical parameters and morphometry of the basins were included in a multivariate analysis. Floating-leaved vegetation was the dominant growth form, followed by emergent plants. In downstream lakes, the dominance of floating-leaved macrophytes declined, and emergent species increased in abundance. Species richness was highest in larger lakes, with a wider range of littoral habitats than smaller lakes. Electrical conductivity (range 18-151 mS cm(-1), 25 degreesC) of the water correlated well with patterns in diversity among lakes, but this was not the case for nutrient concentrations. As a whole, morphometrical characteristics of lake basins showed better correlations with vegetation structure than any of the measured chemical parameters. The macrophyte vegetation of neighbouring lake chains differed considerably, depending on the surrounding landscape properties, water quality of the lakes and immigration history of plant species.

AB  - Improving the energy performance of existing buildings is crucial for reaching both EU and national climate and energy targets. The main objective of this study was to map challenges that Swedish housing owners perceive when making energy-efficiency refurbishments. A secondary objective was to compare how well these challenges relate to national strategies. The study applied a combined methods approach with audience response meters and in-depth qualitative semi-structured interviews. The housing owners express the view that they have sufficient knowledge of national ambitions to improve the energy performance of buildings and welcome the new building regulations. Despite this supposed knowledge and the current economic situation with beneficial loans, the refurbishment rate still remains low. The housing owners explain that they are concerned about the 'performance gap' and request more accurate energy performance predictions. They are also waiting for proof that all sustainability goals can be reached in reality. Probably, too few projects fulfilling ambitions in all categories: economically, socially and energy-wise have been followed up and demonstrated nationally. The new national information centre on refurbishment of buildings may help to spread information about such projects, raise awareness and thus increase the refurbishment rate.

AB  - The article is devoted to the images of flowers, gardens and Chinese literary reminiscences in the work of the Finnish poetess Katri Vala, one of the most prominent members of the literary group "Tulenkantajat" ("The Flame Bearers"). The purpose of the work is to explore for the first time in Russian literary criticism the literary images in the poetry of Katri Vala in relation to the Chinese poetry throughout the entire career of the poetess. The subject of study is the lyrics of Katri Vala, which contains an alternation of poetic landscapes, sometimes overlapping, and sometimes sharply contrasting.
   Using the comparative typological and the historical-literary methods Vala's poems and translations are analyzed in the context of the convergence of Chinese and Finnish cultural traditions in two similar historical situations. The topic of the article is relevant both from a literary and historical points of view.
   Katri Vala was accused of aestheticism, of a love of the exotic. The author argues with such point of view, and contends that in this way the Vala's deep awareness of self-involvement in the tradition of the Tang era Chinese poetry was manifested. This was presented in Vala's works not only in the form of "ascension to flowers". The poetess was united with the great Tang poets by her civic position, sympathy for the common people, the formulation of social problems, and an appeal to the theme of humanism. The article introduces into scientific use letters stored in the archives of the Finnish Literary Society, articles from Finnish periodicals of the 1920s, which all testify to Katri Vala's thorough knowledge of Chinese poetry. Convincing examples prove that the translations made by Katri Vala give the Finnish readers a complete picture of the lyrics of Li Bo and Du Fu. In all situations, Katri Vala's poetry was optimistic, and literary Chinese reminiscences were forever preserved in it.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to initiate investigation on market potential of torrefied pellets in South-Savo region, Finland. The focus is on to small-sized residential heating. Torrefied pellet is an upgraded product with additional valuable features such as grindability and hydrophobicity. From the initial investigation, it was found that there is a substantial market in this region for pellets, including torrefied pellets. The phasing out of oil and direct-electric heating system, as well as increasing interest in biomass for heating are some of the indications that torrefied pellet could be potential player in the space heating sector. Furthermore, from the trial run of firing pellets in Ariterm Biomatic+ boiler, shows that torrefied pellets have slightly less CO2 emission compared to traditional white pellets. Further research is planned to study economics of torrefied pellet supply chain in South-Savo region as well as its environment sustainability.

AB  - Anthropogenic increase in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in nature areas results in nitrate leaching to groundwater, threatening its quality. Member states of the European Union are obliged to reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations and to monitor this reduction. The relationship between N deposition and groundwater nitrate concentrations is quantified using a field survey and geographical information. Nitrate concentrations of the uppermost metre of groundwater in nature areas in the sandy regions in 1990 were related to geographical data by means of regression analysis. In this way nitrate concentrations could be explained by potential ammonia deposition, soil type, vegetation and land use. We found that about 35% of 54 kg ha(-1) a(-1) atmospheric N deposition was leached to the upper groundwater as nitrate, resulting in a mean NO3 concentration of about 30 mg L-1. The critical N load for exceeding the EC limit value (50 mg L-1) in the sandy regions of The Netherlands composed of natural vegetation will be about 80 kg ha(-1) a(-1). Leaching is less than expected for nature areas but comparable with leaching of N surpluses in pastures in The Netherlands. A reduction in nitrate leaching by 25% or more can currently be detected via a new field survey.

AB  - This study aimed to test how the sex and reproductive status of Eurasian lynx influenced their use of 'attractive sinks' - habitats with high prey density and high mortality risks. Locations of 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were obtained by radio-telemetry in a mixed forest and agricultural habitat in south-eastern Norway. Roe deer, the major food source of lynx in the study area, occurred at higher densities closer to areas of human activity and infrastructure. Proximity of lynx locations to human activity and infrastructure was used as a risk index because the most common causes of death among Scandinavian lynx were of anthropogenic origin. This study shows that distances from lynx locations to human activity were significantly greater for females with newborn kittens than for males, but this decreased with kitten age. The data suggest that this response to human activity is influenced by the reproductive strategies of males and females, and might explain male-biased human-induced mortality in this study and in carnivores more generally.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the simultaneous recovery of industrial wood and raw material for energy wood from cuttings in Finland during the next 50 years. Two cutting scenarios (maximum and sustainable cuttings) and two climate scenarios (current and changing climate) were analysed to determine their impacts on harvesting potential. The analysis was carried out using sample plot and tree data from the ninth National Forest inventory and a management-oriented large-scale forestry model (MELA) into which the transfer functions based on physiological modelling were incorporated to describe the impacts of climate change. Depending on the climate scenario, the volume of potential recovery of industrial wood in the maximum cutting scenario during the period 2003-2013 varied from 103 to 105 million m(3) a(-1), while the amount of potential energy wood raw material was 35 Tg a(-1). During the period 2043-2053, in the current climate scenario, the potential recovery of industrial wood was 64 million m(3) a(-1) and energy wood raw material 22 Tg a(-1), and in the changing climate scenario, 85 million m(3) a(-1) and 29 Tg a(-1), respectively. In the sustainable cutting scenario, depending on the climate scenario used, the potential recovery of industrial wood during the period 2003-2013 varied from 74 to 76 million m(3) a(-1), while the amount of potential energy wood was 25 Tg a(-1). During the period 2043-2053, in the current climate scenario, the potential recovery of industrial wood was 80 million m(3) a(-1) and energy wood raw material 26 Tg a(-1), and in the changing climate scenario, 88 million m(3) a(-1) and 29 Tg a(-1), respectively.

AB  - The aviation industry contributes to more than 2% of global human-induced CO2-emissions, and it is expected to increase to 3% by 2050 as demand for aviation grows. As the industry is still dependent on conventional jet fuel, an essential component for a carbon-neutral growth is low-carbon, sustainable aviation fuels, for example alternative drop-in fuels with biobased components. An optimization model was developed for the case of Sweden to examine the impacts of carbon price, blending mandates and penalty fee (for not reaching the blending mandate) on the production of renewable jet fuel (RJF). The model included biomass gasification-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) jet fuel, Power-to-Liquid (PTL) jet fuel through the FT route and Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)-based jet fuel. Thus, this study aims at answering how combining different policies for the aviation sector can support the production of RJF in Sweden while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The results demonstrate the importance of implementing policy instruments to promote the production of RJF in Sweden. The blending mandate is an effective policy to both promote RJF production while reducing emissions. The current level of the penalty fee is not sufficient to support the fuel switch to RJF. A higher blending mandate and carbon price will accelerate the transition towards renewable and sustainable fuels for the aviation industry.

AB  - Science and technology parks (STPs) are curated locations where new technology-based firms (NTBFs) and other SMEs and firms can conglomerate and promote a culture of innovation. Overall, the aim is to construct a sustainable high-value tech entrepreneurship ecosystem, and to this end we present here some recent and novel concepts derived from approaches using a data-driven statistical foundation. This paper considers studies on the organic growth of young start-up science and technology parks by authors who have used big data, econometric analyses, panel data and computer simulations. The results and concepts are derived from industrialized countries, notably Sweden and the UK, and may well be applicable to many regions and emerging economies. The findings are of interest to regional development, technology entrepreneurs considering choosing an STP to inhabit, as well as those in STP central teams, specializing in management and enterprise development, including the sustainable growth of new parks.

AB  - Zinc isotope ratios were measured in the top sections of dated ombrotrophic peat cores in Finland to investigate their potential as proxies for atmospheric sources and to constrain post depositional processes affecting the geochemical record. The peat deposits were located in Hietajarvi, a background site well away from any point pollution source and representing 'background' conditions, in Outokumpu, next to a mining site, and in Harjavalta, next to a smelter. Measured total concentrations, calculated excess concentrations and mass balance considerations suggest that zinc is subjected to important biogeochemical cycling within the peat. Significant isotopic variability was found in all three peat bogs, with heavier zinc in the deeper and lighter zinc in the upper sections. Isotope ratios and concentrations correlated in the two peats located next to dominant point sources, i.e. the smelting and mining site, suggesting that zinc isotopes trace pollution sources. Concentration and isotope peaks were offset from the period of mining and smelting activity, supporting migration of zinc down the profile. The delta(66) Zn-JMC (where delta Zn-66 = [(Zn-66/Zn-64)(sample)/(Zn-66/Zn-64)(JMC-standard) - 1] x 10(3)) of the top section sample at the remote Hietajarvi site was 0.9%o and we suggest this represents the regional background isotope signature of atmospheric zinc. The deeper sections of the peat cores show isotopically heavier zinc than any potential atmospheric source, indicating that post depositional processes affected the isotopic records. The large variations encountered (up to 1.05%o for delta Zn-66) and Rayleigh modelling imply that multiple fractionation of zinc during diagenetic alterations occurs and nutrient recycling alone cannot explain the fractionation pattern.
   We propose that zinc isotopes are amenable to identify different atmospheric zinc sources, including zinc derived from anthropogenic activities such as mining and smelting, but multiple biogeochemical processes seriously affect the record and they need to be evaluated and assessed carefully if zinc isotopes are used in terrestrial paleorecords.

AB  - The dynamics of radioactive contamination of aquatic ecosystems (1986-1990) is considered on the basis of observational data in the near and distant zones of the Chernobyl fallout (the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) cooling pond, the Pripyat River, the Dnieper reservoirs, and the Kopor inlet of the Gulf of Finland). Radionuclide accumulation in aquatic biota is analyzed.
   The results obtained indicate that the radioecological conditions in the water. bodies under investigation were in a state of non-equilibrium over a long period of time following the Chernobyl accident. Reduction in the Cs-137 concentration proceeded slowly in most of the aquatic ecosystems. The effect of trophic levels which consisted of increased accumulation of radiocaesium by predatory fish was observed in various parts of the contaminated area.

AB  - Forest biomass is one of the main contributors to the EU's renewable energy target of 20% gross final energy consumption in 2020 (Renewable Energy Directive). Following the RED, new sustainability principles are launched by the European energy sector, such as Sustainable Biomass Partnership (former IWPB). We have a reference situation with existing national (forest) legislation and sustainable forest management (SFM) schemes (scenario 1) and a future situation based on additional SBP principles (scenario 2). Two country studies were selected for our survey: one in Finland with nearly 100% SFM certification and one in Leningrad province with a minor areal share of certification in scenario 1. The potential volumes reduce after new criteria from the SBP in scenario 2. The costs will also increase in scenario 2, both in Leningrad region and Finland.

AB  - Forest management has been considered a subject of interest, because they act as carbon (C) sinks to mitigate CO2 emissions and also as producers of woody litter (WL) for bio-energy. Overall, a sustainably managed system of forests and forest products contributes to carbon mitigation in a positive, stable way. With increasing demand for sustainable production, the need to effectively utilise site-based resources increases. The utilization of WL for bio-energy can help meet the need for renewable energy production. The objective of the present study was to investigate biomass production (including C sequestration) from the most representative forestry species (Pinus radiata D. Don and Ecualyptus globulus Labill) of Biscay (Spain). Data from the third and fourth Spanish Forest Inventories (NFI3-2005 and NFI4-2011) were used. We also estimated the potential WL produced in the forest activities. Our findings were as follows: Forests of Biscay stored 12.084 Tg of biomass (dry basis), with a mean of 147.34 Mg ha1 in 2005 and 14.509 Tg of biomass (dry basis), with a mean of 179.82 Mg ha-1 in 2011. The total equivalent CO2 in Biscay's forests increased by 1.629 Tg year-1 between 2005 and 2011. The study shows that the energy potential of carbon accumulated in the WL amounted to 1283.2 million MJ year-1. These results suggest a considerable potential for energy production.

AB  - The dinoflagellate cyst records in sediments from New Bedford Harbor and Apponagansett Bay demonstrate sensitivity to environmental change caused by human activity in the watersheds over the last 500 years. Changes in the species richness, as well as absolute and relative abundance of dinoflagellate cyst taxa reflect recent periods of development around the estuaries. Cyst taxa sensitive to these changes include Dubridinium spp., Polykrikos schwartzii, Lingulodinium machaerophorum, Operculodinium israelianum and Selenopemphix quanta. The greatest changes in the dinoflagellate cyst record occur during the 20th century, when New Bedford Harbor was exposed to both toxic pollution and heavy nutrient loading from point and non-point sources. Apponagansett Bay was not subject to industrial pollution and nutrient enrichment has been lower (from non-point sources). In Apponagansett Bay there is an increase in the dinoflagellate cyst species richness while species richness first increased, then declined in New Bedford Harbor. During the same period, the total dinoflagellate cyst concentration in New Bedford Harbor fluctuated over a wide range. The decline of species richness and the large fluctuations in the total cyst abundances signal the intensified anthropogenic disturbance in the watershed, notably a high degree of eutrophication and toxic pollution.

AB  - Resource subsidies in the form of allochthonous primary production drive secondary production in many ecosystems, often sustaining diversity and overall productivity. Despite their importance in structuring marine communities, there is little understanding of how subsidies move through juxtaposed habitats and into recipient communities. We investigated the transport of detritus from kelp forests to a deep Arctic fjord (northern Norway). We quantified the seasonal abundance and size structure of kelp detritus in shallow subtidal (0aEuro'12 m), deep subtidal (12aEuro'85 m), and deep fjord (400aEuro'450 m) habitats using a combination of camera surveys, dive observations, and detritus collections over 1 year. Detritus formed dense accumulations in habitats adjacent to kelp forests, and the timing of depositions coincided with the discrete loss of whole kelp blades during spring. We tracked these blades through the deep subtidal and into the deep fjord, and showed they act as a short-term resource pulse transported over several weeks. In deep subtidal regions, detritus consisted mostly of fragments and its depth distribution was similar across seasons (50% of total observations). Tagged pieces of detritus moved slowly out of kelp forests (displaced 4aEuro'50 m (mean 11.8 m +/- 8.5 SD) in 11aEuro'17 days, based on minimum estimates from recovered pieces), and most (75%) variability in the rate of export was related to wave exposure and substrate. Tight resource coupling between kelp forests and deep fjords indicate that changes in kelp abundance would propagate through to deep fjord ecosystems, with likely consequences for the ecosystem functioning and services they provide.

AB  - Spiders contribute considerably to diversity in agroecosystems and are important components of natural pest control. Farming system and adjacent habitats may influence spider diversity. In this study, diversity of the spider families Lycosidae and Linyphiidae was studied after spring sowing until the time when a common pest (Rhopalosiphum padi) colonizes cereal fields. The spiders were collected with pitfall traps at eight organically or conventionally managed farms around Uppsala, Sweden, in three different habitats at each site: field margin, crop field and the edge between the two. The effects of farming system and habitat type on diversity of lycosids and linyphiids were considered using three different measures (activity density, species richness and composition). The most dominant species of each spider family, Pardosa agrestis (Lycosidae) and Oedothorax apicatus (Linyphiidae), had higher activity density at organic sites, and farming systems also contained different species compositions of both lycosid and linyphiid spiders. Also, linyphiid species richness was higher on conventional sites and linyphiid species composition was influenced by habitat type, in contrast with lycosids. Activity density and species richness of lycosid spiders were, on the other hand, more associated with field margins than linyphiid spiders.

AB  - The vegetation and environmental conditions of south Swedish hornbeam Carpinus betulus forests are described with data from 35 permanent sample plots. The main floristic gradient of the ground vegetation is closely related to acid-base properties of the top soil: base saturation, pH and organic matter content. Other floristic differences are related to tree canopy cover and the distance of the sample plots to the Baltic coast. Species richness of herbaceous plants typical of forests increases with soil pH. The number of other herbaceous species, occurring in both forests and open habitats, and of woody species is not related to pH. Comparisons of vegetation data from 1983 and 1993 show relatively small compositional differences of the herbaceous forest flora. The number of other herbaceous species increased considerably in those plots where canopy trees had been cut after 1983. The number of new species in managed plots increases with soil pH. Species losses and gains of the herbaceous forest flora between 1983 and 1993 are generally lower as compared with other herbaceous species and woody species. However, the ground cover of herbaceous forest species, especially of Oxalis acetosella and Lamium galeobdolon, was considerably lower in 1993 as compared to 1983 in both unmanaged and managed plots. Possible explanations for this decrease are current soil acidification and drought during the growing season.

AB  - An integrated program, "Microbiological and ecological responses to global environmental changes in polar regions" (MERGE), was proposed in the International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 and endorsed by the IPY committee as a coordinating proposal. MERGE hosts original proposals to the IPY and facilitates their funding. MERGE selected three key questions to produce scientific achievements. Prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in terrestrial, lacustrine, and supraglacial habitats were targeted according to diversity and biogeography; food webs and ecosystem evolution; and linkages between biological, chemical, and physical processes in the supraglacial biome.
   MERGE hosted 13 original and seven additional proposals, with two full proposals. It respected the priorities and achievements of the individual proposals and aimed to unify their significant results. Ideas and projects followed a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach. We intend to inform the MERGE community of the initial results and encourage ongoing collaboration. Scientists from non-polar regions have also participated and are encouraged to remain involved in MERGE.
   MERGE is formed by scientists from Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Spain, UK, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam, and associates from Chile, Denmark, Netherlands, and Norway.

AB  - Studying abrupt ecological shifts under gradual environmental change caused, in particular, by human activity is important for understanding the fundamental aspects and underlying mechanisms of ecological resilience. One of the rare well-documented examples of an abrupt ecological shift is the delayed step transition of the population of a desert rodent, the midday gerbil (Meriones meridianus), from high-abundance (1994-2002) to low-abundance (2003-2017) regimes. This was in response to landscape transformation from desert to steppe caused by the drastic reduction of livestock in the rangelands of southern Russia after the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990s. In this study, we tested whether demographic parameters were correlated with the observed abrupt downward population shift. We found that reproductive activity (the percentage of breeding females, the number of litters, fecundity and the number of young recruited per female) showed no trend over time and did not differ between periods of high and low abundance. In contrast, the adult sex ratio (SR = males: females) decreased significantly with time and was as much as twice more female-biased for the low-abundance population regime. However, SR was not related to any reproductive parameter, including the percentage of breeding females. We conclude that proximate reasons for an abrupt population decline in M. meridianus are not associated with the changes in breeding patterns or mate limitation caused by the Allee effect but relate to the increased mortality as a result of the desert landscape being fragmented by steppezation. The mortality is expected to be higher for males as the mobile and dispersing sex.

AB  - Understanding the processes responsible for precipitation and its future change is important to develop plausible and sustainable climate change adaptation strategies, especially in regions with few available observed data like Congo Basin ( CB). This paper investigates the atmospheric circulation processes associated with climate model biases in CB rainfall, and explores drivers of projected rainfall changes. Here we use an ensemble of simulations from the Swedish Regional Climate Model ( RCM) RCA4, driven by eight General Circulation Models ( GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ( CMIP5), for the 1.5. C and 2. C global warming levels ( GWLs), and under the representative concentration pathways ( RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. RCA4 captures reasonably well the observed patterns of CB rainfall seasonality, but shows dry biases independent of seasons and large scale driving atmospheric conditions. While simulations mimic observed peaks in transition seasons ( March- May and September- November), the rain- belt is misplaced southward ( northward) in December- February ( June- August), reducing the latitudinal extent of rainfall. Moreover, ERA- Interim reanalysis driven RCM simulation and RCM- GCM combinations show similar results, indicating the dominance of systematic biases. Modelled dry biases are associated with dry upper- tropospheric layers, resulting from a western outflow stronger than the eastern inflow and related to the northern component of African Easterly Jet. From the analysis of the climate change signal, we found that regional scale responses to anthropogenic forcings vary across GWLs and seasons. Changes of rainfall and moisture divergence are correlated, with values higher in March- May than in September- November, and larger for global warming of 2.0. C than at 1.5. C. There is an increase of zonal moisture divergence fluxes in upper atmospheric layers ( > 700 hPa) under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. Moreover, it is found that additional warming of 0.5. C will change the hydrological cycle and water availability in the CB, with potential to cause challenges to water resource management, agriculture, hydro- power generation, sanitation and ecosystems.

AB  - Straw can become an important contributor to the biomass feedstocks of Europe and North America. In Norway, between 12 and 17% of a national target to increase the renewable energy share by 14 TWh can be sustainably met by mobilizing straw feedstocks. However, straw must compete in an energy market with a vast availability of forest-based woody biomass, and a clean electrical energy pool, 95% of which is derived from hydropower. The performance of seven local straw supply chains was monitored over a period of 3 years to estimate straw yields, supply costs, operating costs of the heating plants, and to synthesiz experiences on supply solutions. Storage facilities for bales constituted the largest single cost in the supply chain. Square bales were both more economical to use and required considerably less plant management time, making them more preferable than round bales for small-scale utilization. The total cost of straw firing averaged out in the range of 36-42 sic MWh(-1), which is 40-46% of the current cost of electric heating (similar to 90 sic MWh(-1)). The positive economic outcome provides a good incentive to roll out many more similar plants although heat pumps could be expected to reduce the margin in some applications.

KW  - Transport policy
AB  - Smart or intelligent mobility has been the founding concept to address new technologies needed to develop future transport systems. The development of intelligent mobility has traditionally been much driven by the automotive industry. Research in this domain has traditionally focused on providing safe, comfortable, and affordable mobility to drivers and passengers. As the awareness of the effects of emissions released to the environment by transportation has been increasingly acknowledged, transport systems have since then expected to be "intelligent" also in terms of sustainability. Furthermore, social issues, such as transport poverty and social exclusion, have emerged as key topics. By performing a bibliometric analysis of scientific literature, reviewing inter-governmental policy documents, and analyzing national (Finland) government programs, this paper shows how there has been a shift of thought at conceptual and semantic levels regarding what we perceive as smart mobility. The findings quite clearly suggest that the policy debate as well as research topics have taken the shift first from traffic safety toward technology orientation, and thereafter further toward a more holistic perception of sustainability. "Inclusiveness" appears to be the latest theme in the transport policy debate at the European Union level, although research on it is still marginal.

AB  - Municipal and regional leaders' achievements for synchronised sustainability transitions are still not enough. Systemic, systematic and strategic cross-sectoral collaboration and co-creation are needed. However, sectors isolated in silos leads to suboptimal measures and strategies, and a reductionist view on what hinders and enables joint action towards full sustainability. Consequently, methodological support for addressing the coordinative challenge is often not asked for. This study investigates the observed reductionist perspective as foundation for developing enhanced methodological support for strategic sustainable development (SSD) and further aimed to gain insight into how leaders can be better supported to understand their current reality of barriers and enablers for cross-sectoral SSD work and to prototype such support. Results from fieldwork with leaders in six municipalities and regions suggest that both frequency and depth of barriers and enablers in relation to elements for SSD are insufficient.

AB  - In several locations along Sweden's northern Baltic coast there are deposits of contaminated fibrous sediments that are known as fiberbanks. Historically, these anthropogenic fiberbanks and associated contaminants were formed outside pulp and paper factories because of unregulated waste discharges. Some of the fiberbanks are located on seafloor slopes that are unstable and may fail, which could result in large amounts of fiber and contaminant dispersion. Hydroacoustic surveys have revealed that some parts of the fiberbanks have been dispersed to a wider area by submarine landslides. However, the unusual nature of these cellulose-rich sediments makes it difficult to apply conventional techniques for assessing submarine slope stability. Therefore, a combination of investigation techniques and interpretation methods was tested to assess the stability and triggering mechanisms for submarine slope failure identified in fiberbanks from the Angermanalven river estuary on the Baltic sea coast. The integration of bathymetric data, sediment lithology and geotechnical characteristics from in-situ and laboratory measurements, enabled the characterisation of underlying natural sediments and the fiberbanks at two sites. Despite low densities, which indicate that the fiberbank material is near the buoyancy level, the fiberbank deposits seem to be relatively stable. Our results indicate the underlying natural sediments are also stable and would require an external triggering mechanism to generate the observed slope failures. We suggest that pore water pressure, potentially related to groundwater table fluctuations, may be an important trigger for submarine landslides in the study area.
   Management of fiberbanks and associated fiber-rich sediments, which are numerous along Sweden's north east coast, requires that sites are risk assessed and prioritized for remediation. To do so, under water slope stability should be considered as a possible dispersion pathway and therefore needs to be investigated. The study illustrates the value of using a combination of geophysical and geotechnical field and laboratory methods, together with empirical relationships, to assess relevant input parameters for slope stability calculations for this type of sediment.

AB  - This study examines the issue of electric and fossil car pricing in a 3-level supply chain including the government, Gasoline vehicle (GV) manufacturer, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and electric vehicle battery manufacturer, in which the manufacturers, in order to increase their profits, determine the price and take care the amount of improvement of their products And the government, as a leader, uses direct and indirect financial tools, including subsidies and car purchase taxes, fuel taxes and subsidies to battery manufacturers to cooperate in the research and development cost of battery production and reduce its price, in order to achieve various economic, social and environmental goals to make the transportation system sustainable. To reach the optimal solution of this problem, the approach of game theory and Stackelberg method has been used and the results have been obtained using the data of Norway. Examining the results provides a special approach to managers to make optimal decisions in different situations. In this matter, different scenarios have been considered according to the goals of the government and finally, using the TOPSIS method, the best decision has been introduced for the government. As a result, in order to attract more customers to buy EV and increase the range of electric cars and, to increase the profits of EV manufacturers and EV battery manufacturers, the government should give large subsidies to EV customers and, with the aim of reducing pollution and increasing its income, impose more taxes on fossil cars and fossil fuels.

AB  - In this article, we study how declining rural communities build political resilience in Finland. Community resilience is an adaptive process through which rural communities try to maintain their viability in changed circumstances. This process does not entail a submissive attitude, but rather active agency and an effort to influence matters concerning the community's well-being. We focus on the political dimension of resilience by identifying different local tactics that rural communities adopt to promote their own development following municipal mergers. We classify these tactics into three categories: cooperation, conflict and community-led development. The significant differences between them lie in how the community relates to the new municipality and communicates with its officials and decision-makers. However, none of the three tactics identified in our study are sufficient to ensure the viability of rural communities in the context of municipal mergers.

AB  - The web-spinning sawfly Cephalcia arvensis is a defoliator of the Norway spruce (Picea abies) in Northern Eurasia. Four outbreaks have been recorded in the last 15 years in Czech Republic and in Italy. A comparative analysis of the involved populations revealed noticeable differences in phenology, leading to a strong variation in life cycle and voltinism. A population already known as 'spring form' for the early emergence of adults, and morphologically distinguishable at the prepupal stage, has been found to be genetically different from populations emerging later, as far as allozymes and chromosomes are concerned. The high biological and genetic variability observed among populations of C. arvensis allows these sawflies to become adapted to a wide range of local conditions, contributing in this way to the differentiation of local races and species. In spite of this variability, all the outbreaks occurred in Norway spruce plantations characterized by about the same silvicultural parameters (50-to-100-year-old, high density and medium to high quality), located outside or on the border of the natural range of the host plant, and thus undergoing various environmental stresses. As the silvicultural conditions of the stressed stands may determine the risk of outbreak, the integration of cultural methods (selection of planting areas and of regeneration material, selective cutting of mature stands to increase diversity) in pest management seems to be very important. The management of the pest would also benefit from extending monitoring to cover all the phenological variants, because an early detection of the outbreak is essential for a successful application of the biocontrol techniques presently available.

AB  - Blue infrastructure is an important component of urban green infrastructure, due to its capacity for water cycle regulation and soil formation, as well as supporting unique biodiversity. Urban ponds, as part of urban blue, can harbour a diverse assemblage of aquatic macroinvertebrates. As yet, it is not clear how urbanisation affects macroinvertebrate diversity. In this study, we focus on diving beetles (Dytiscidae) in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, to investigate how urbanisation affects their diversity, as well as the effects of margin steepness and the presence or absence of fish on urban dytiscids. We sampled dytiscids using 1-L activity traps in 14 fishless ponds and 11 ponds with fish, at ten sites. We applied generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to analyse the effects on dytiscid assemblages. We found that urbanisation had a negative effect on species richness but not on abundance. Steepness of pond margins and the presence or absence of predatory fish, affected both species richness and abundance: dytiscids prefer ponds with gently sloping margins; they have 80% higher species richness and are 79% more abundant in fishless ponds, and medium to large-sized dytiscid species are more capable of coexisting with fish. Urban wetlands can support a diversity of dytiscids at the regional level, and the presence of ponds without predatory fish is beneficial for maintaining dytiscid diversity. We recommend maintaining a diverse range of ponds and wetland habitats for the maintenance of aquatic biodiversity in urban regions.

AB  - Norway is the largest producers of aquaculture salmon in the world, and the Bergen region is the centre of Norwegian salmon production. In this article we explore the opportunities and obstacles in introducing cell-based seafood as a new related industry niche in the region through coevolution with the established salmon farming industry. Introducing a new industry niche to this region could contribute to a comprehensive renewal of existing seafood-related activity and represent a major step towards sustainable seafood production. Cell-based seafood may eliminate sea lice, escapee and excess nutrient impacts on the surroundings by enabling highly controlled and contained seafood production. We found that coevolution between the cell-based seafood sector and the salmon industry in the Bergen region will be difficult to materialize at the present time. There are two main explanations. First, coevolution is challenging when the dominant path (i.e., salmon farming) is in a stable state. High profitability and a stable state mean that this industry absorbs investors, technology suppliers and research milieus that may otherwise have been on the lookout for alternatives and supplementary business opportunities. It also means that incumbents within the dominant path will not be looking for diversification alternatives. Secondly, there are distinct differences between the two industry paths when it comes to knowledge base, innovation mode and geographical configurations, making actor mobility, knowledge spillovers and resource sharing between the two industry paths challenging. We also find that coevolution may occur in the future through industrial convergent evolution mechanisms of downstream value chains as the cell-based seafood industry matures.

AB  - Microbiological investigation of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria has until now been restricted to wastewater species. The present study describes the enrichment and characterization of two marine Scalindua species, the anammox genus that dominates almost all natural habitats investigated so far. The species were enriched from a marine sediment in the Gullmar Fjord (Sweden) using a medium based on Red Sea salt. Anammox cells comprised about 90% of the enrichment culture after 10 months. The enriched Scalindua bacteria displayed all typical features known for anammox bacteria, including turnover of hydrazine, the presence of ladderane lipids, and a compartmentalized cellular ultrastructure. The Scalindua species also showed a nitrate-dependent use of formate, acetate and propionate, and performed a formate-dependent reduction of nitrate, Fe(III) and Mn(IV). This versatile metabolism may be the basis for the global distribution and substantial contribution of the marine Scalindua anammox bacteria to the nitrogen loss from oxygen-limited marine ecosystems.

AB  - Today it often happens that the protagonist in crime fiction is a journalist-for instance, in the globally spread sub-genre of Nordic noir. This article examines what readers can learn about journalism by comparing crime fiction (a widely popular genre fostering society critique) from Russia, Sweden, and USA. These countries with significantly different press traditions have in the post-1991 era been involved in transformations of the media landscapes which have led to a public distrust in traditional media. We approach these novels as a form of adult media education and thereby as a resource for the reader to develop a critical thinking about journalism. The novels under consideration are permeated with transnational understandings and provide a rich ground for reflections around challenges for finding the truth, such as news-making as a male-dominated activity, journalism as a publicity arena, and an accelerating news environment (i.e., information overload paired with a competition for immediate reporting) as a threat to investigative journalism. The struggling, truth-seeking protagonists can be understood as an answer to a widespread cultural anxiety about journalism's questioned authority as a truth-telling occupation.

AB  - There is a growing understanding of the potential of spatial planning to constitute a co-ordinating arena for sustainable development, and planning processes are expected to merge all dimensions of sustainability. Since the concrete manifestation of spatial planning takes place at a micro level, it all boils down to the need for bringing together stakeholders at municipal level in a well functioning planning processes. Alongside this viewpoint, there is also an increasing awareness of the need for a decentralization of such processes, bringing them closer to the grassroots. Communicative planning is a planning ideal and a theoretical stream that has developed from this new 'paradigm'. It is based on citizen participation as a win-win situation, where the planning process builds a social sustainability, in turn enhancing the likelihood of the process to be successful. However, global and national visions of sustainability and local implementation are in many ways separate from one another. Bringing it further, to the individual level, the gaps are even wider. These gaps make the daily job for the planner increasingly complex and difficult. This article aims to contribute to understanding the characters of these gaps by describing them as four threats. The discussion is purely theoretical and based on the eight proposals of Goodin and Dryzek (2006) on possible pathways from micro-level deliberation towards the macro political system. However, the seed of the discussion is based on the authors' joint experiences from a number of evaluations of planning processes carried out in a Swedish context.

AB  - A number of studies have evaluated the effects of forest harvest on mercury (Hg) concentrations and exports in surface waters, but few studies have tested the effect from forest harvest on the change in fish Hg concentrations over the course of several years after harvest. To address this question, mercury (Hg) concentrations in perch (Perca fluviatilis) muscle tissue from five lakes were analyzed for two years before (2010-2011) and three years after (2013-2015) forest harvest conducted in 2012. Fish Hg concentrations in the clear-cut catchments (n = 1373 fish specimens) were related to temporal changes of fish Hg in reference lakes (n = 1099 fish specimen) from 19 lakes in the Swedish National Environmental Monitoring Programme. Small (length < 100 mm) and large perch (length >= 100 mm) were analyzed separately, due to changing feeding habitats of fish over growing size. There was considerable year-to-year and lake-to-lake variation in fish Hg concentrations (-14%-121%) after forest harvest in the clearcut lakes, according to our first statistical model that count for fish Hg changes. While the effect ascribed to forest harvest varied between years, after three years (in 2015), a significant increase of 26% (p < 0.0001) in Hg concentrations of large fish was identified in our second statistical model that pooled all 5 clearcut lakes. The large fish Hg concentrations in the 19 reference lakes also varied, and in 2015 had decreased by 7% (p = 0.03) relative to the concentrations in 2010-2011. The majority of the annual changes in fish Hg concentrations in the clearcut lakes after harvest were in the lower range of earlier predictions for high-latitude lakes extrapolated primarily from the effects of forest harvest operations on Hg concentrations in water. Since the risk of forest harvest impacts on Hg extends to fish and not just surface water concentrations, there is even more reason to consider Hg effects in forestry planning, alongside other ecosystem effects.

AB  - Biofuels have received a lot of attention as an important source of renewable energy, with number of economic impacts. This study aims to investigate the economic potential of biofuels and then extract core aspects of how biofuels relate to a sustainable economy in order to achieve a sustainable biofuel economy. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of publications about biofuel economic research covering 2001 to 2022 experimenting with multiple bibliometric tools, such as R Studio, Biblioshiny, and VOSviewer. Findings show that research on biofuels and biofuel production growth are positively correlated. From the analyzed publications, The United States, India, China, and Europe are the largest biofuel markets, with the USA taking the lead in publishing scientific papers, engaging country collaboration on biofuel, and has the highest social impact. Findings also show that the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, and Spain are more inclined to develop sustainable biofuel economies and energy than other European countries. It also indicates that sustainable biofuel economies are still far behind those of less developed and developing countries. Besides, this study finds that biofuel linked to sustainable economy with poverty reduction, agriculture development, renewable energy production, economic growth, climate change policy, environmental protection, carbon emission reduction, green-house gas emission, land use policy, technological innovations, and development. The findings of this bibliometric research are presented using different clusters, mapping, and statistics. The discussion of this study affirms the good and effective policies for a sustainable biofuel economy.

AB  - Subsurface dams constitute an affordable and effective method for the sustainable development and management of groundwater resources when constructed on suitable sites. Such dams have rarely been constructed in crystalline rock areas and to best of our knowledge, geographic information system (GIS) has never been used in any methodology for locating suitable sites for constructing these dams. This paper presents a new methodology to locate suitable sites for the construction of subsurface dams using GIS software supported by groundwater balance modelling in a study area Boda-Kalvsvik, Sweden. Groundwater resources were calculated based on digitized geological data and assumptions regarding stratigraphic layering taken from well archive data and geological maps. These estimates were then compared with future extractions for domestic water supply using a temporally dynamic water balance model. Suitability analyses for subsurface dams were based on calculated topographic wetness index (TWI) values and geological data, including stratigraphic information. Groundwater balance calculations indicated that many of the most populated areas were susceptible to frequent water supply shortages. Of the 34 sub-catchments within the study area: ten were over-extracted, nine did not have any water supply demand at all, one was self-sufficient and the remaining 14 were able to meet the water supply demand with surplus storage capacity. Six suitable sites for the construction of subsurface dams were suggested in the vicinity of the over-extracted sites based on suitability analysis and groundwater balance estimates. The new methodology shows encouraging results for regions with humid climate but having limited natural water storage capacities. The developed methodology can be used as a preliminary planning step for subsurface dam construction, establishing a base for more detailed field investigations.

AB  - With the recent emphasis on carbon neutrality following COP27, many countries prioritise shifting to electric mobility as a crucial strategy to combat carbon emissions. A significant portion of this comes from transportation. Notably, countries such as Norway, China, and the United States have taken the lead in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, driven by their effective e-mobility policies. In contrast, the 10 member nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are still in the early stages of adopting this emerging trend. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the current e-mobility policies within the ASEAN region, employing the STEELUP (Sociocultural and demographic, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Legislative, Urban design, and Political) framework to provide a holistic perspective on the e-mobility landscape in the ASEAN countries. By critically assessing the implementation of e-mobility policies in each country, this paper aims to identify key gaps and challenges that hinder the acceleration of EV adoption in the region. The findings from the STEELUP framework, coupled with a thorough analysis of the current conditions in ASEAN, provide crucial insights for governments and policymakers to act upon. Through evidence-based recommendations, this study concludes by suggesting effective strategies to expedite the uptake of EVs in the ASEAN region.

AB  - The article identifies consumer perspectives related to the activities that facilitate circular economy transitions across major consumption domains. Building on insights from surveys on the circular economy, we review consumer perspectives in the key consumption domains of food, housing, and transport, as well as consumer electronics. Our focus is on the responsibility for organizing the reuse of products and services, the preferred procedures for extending the lifespan of products and services, and the ways to acquire products and services. Analyzing responses from a representative survey of the population in Finland in 2018 (n = 1555), we argue that consumers' perspectives vary significantly across the domains examined. The responsibility for reuse is attributed mainly to consumers themselves, particularly in housing and consumer electronics. Personal activities are also highlighted in the extension of product and service lifespans in the domains of consumer electronics and transportation. As for acquisitions, the respondents overwhelmingly favored ownership over services or sharing. Further, statistically significant differences due to gender, age, education, income level, and household size were observed. The results indicate that domain-specific strategies to promote circularity that consider consumers' backgrounds are likely to attract a better response from consumers than an all-encompassing approach.

AB  - Measures of geodiversity may provide a potentially useful surrogate for biodiversity patterns in insufficiently surveyed areas. However, their reliability in modelling the spatial variation in species richness is inadequately understood. We investigated whether the explanatory and predictive power of species richness models can be improved by considering explicit measures of geodiversity (variability of earth surface materials, forms and processes) in addition to climate and topography variables. Vascular plant species richness was modelled in two study areas in Northern Europe, Finland at the resolution of 500 or 1000 m, and as a function of three geodiversity (geological, geomorphological and hydrological diversity) variables, and six climate and topography variables. Variation partitioning was used to identify the independent and shared contributions of the geodiversity, climate and topography variable groups in explaining the spatial patterns of species richness. Generalized additive models were used to explore the ability of the different explanatory variables in predicting plant species richness within and between the study areas. In both the study areas, the inclusion of measures of geodiversity improved the explanatory power, predictive ability and robustness of the plant species richness models. In conclusion, the explicit measures of geodiversity appear to be promising surrogates of biodiversity, which reflect important abiotic resource factors, and may thus provide an equally, or even more reliable basis for transferring biodiversity models to new areas than models based on climate and topography variables.

AB  - Hedmark County is a large inland district in southeast Norway that represents the southern part of the Sami settlement area, and a Sami-Norse borderland. Centred on the municipalities Rendalen and Engerdal, the study investigates the long-term cultural and social processes involved in the construction and maintenance of a borderland using theories of ethnicity and cultural tradition. Over time, different groups of people have used the diverse landscapes, and two periods are highlighted: the Late Neolithic and the Bronze Age (2350-500 BC), and the Iron Age and the Middle Ages (500 BC-AD 1500). The focus is on how different groups of people used the landscapes as seen through variation in settlement, subsistence, borders and contact networks with neighbouring and distant regions.

AB  - In the context of the forest policy globalization, strategic planning becomes one of the most important tools for sustainable forest management. Forestry is characterized by a long growth period. It predetermines the need to develop long-term strategic forecasts and plans for the development of forest resources, protection and replanting, timber supply and demand. The development of forest markets requires to balance supply and demand of forest resources. A strategic approach to forest planning requires formulation of a development goal. It should be based on the analysis of external and internal factors. It demands alternative scenarios for developing the forest sector. Monitoring and adjusting the strategic plans should take into account changing conditions. Almost all developed economies have strategic plans for developing their national forest sectors. They provide linkage and coordination of forest development and other economic branches. The planning process is to be consistent with financing, legal and organizational regulation of the economy. The main strategic goal of forest planning is to increase its contribution to sustainable social, economic and environmental development of the nations. Achieving this goal involves the use of market leverage. As an example, two countries are compared - the USA and Finland. Their experience in forest strategic planning can be interesting and useful for other nations.

AB  - Diversification of phosphorus sources can bring substantial synergy effects within all the sustainable development domains: environmental, economic and social, and such an opportunity should not be overlooked. Urban sinks accumulate phosphorus and other elements and may serve as sources of secondary raw materials. This paper evaluates phosphorus sources based on their total material requirement (TMR). Resource requirements and emissions of the conventional phosphorus production from mining through the acid route processing have been quantified and have been used as a yardstick against which to measure the performance of two recycling options: spreading of sewage sludge and phosphorus recovery from municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWA). The sludge spreading had the lowest TMR. Phosphorus extracted from the MSWA had four-fold higher TMR than the conventional production. However, method modifications were suggested and are currently being tested, which reduce the methods TMR well below the TMR of the phosphorus production from the ore. The entire impact of the Swedish mineral fertilizer demand can be avoided by recycling urban sinks of phosphorus. Sweden can become self-sufficient in mineral fertilizer because the phosphorus quantities imported in food and later found in the urban sinks such as food waste, sewage sludge and MSW incineration residues cover the entire necessary quantity.

AB  - The immediate postwar in Europe was characterised by collective amnesia concerning where Jews had lived prior to the Holocaust. By the 1970s and mid-1980s, there was a revival of interest in residential areas, synagogues and cemeteries connected with a Jewish past, right throughout Europe, including former communist countries in the 1990s. This resulted in much renovation and the attempt to provide new uses for such sites as museums and cultural centres.
   My paper focuses on the shift in emphasis from the need to preserve such sites as places of memory to an increasing concern with other issues. Such issues range from tourism promotion to the promotion of multiculturalism. This emphasis on preparing the younger generation for a future in a new multicultural state provides much of the motivation for central and local government to lend support to such initiatives, whether in Sweden, Germany or Italy, for instance.
   The paper focuses on the Jewish Museum in Bologna, where I conducted fieldwork between 1999 and 2002. The study illustrates the mix of policy objectives involved, such as heritage preservation, urban regeneration, cultural policy and educational objectives. The theoretical discussion seeks to combine Clifford's notion of the museum as a contact zone ( Clifford, 1997) with Foucault's notions on discourse formation ( Foucault, 1972). In the process, the analysis of the museum's political economy extends beyond the four walls of the museum into the adjoining space of the ghetto and the city.

AB  - One fourth of the forests in Finland are growing on drained peatlands. Forestry operations such as ditch network maintenance increase the export of suspended solids and nutrients, and deteriorate water quality in lakes and rivers. Water protection presupposes an understanding of how forestry operations affect peatland hydrology. The objective was to study the hydrological impacts of ditch cleaning on the basis of water table level and runoff measurements from two pairs of artificially delineated catchments in drained peatland forests in Finland. Data from treated and control catchments indicated that ditch cleaning lowered the level of the water table in sites where a shallow peat layer was underlain by mineral soil. In sites with deep peat formation, the water table showed no detectable response to ditch cleaning. Runoff data suggested that annual runoff clearly increased after ditch cleaning, which was in conflict with the previously reported small impacts of ditch network maintenance. The hydrological model FEMMA was calibrated and applied to assess the conformity of the data and the experimental setup. In the model application, the catchments were assumed to behave as independent hydrological units. However, assessment of the model results and the measurements suggested that ditch cleaning had an impact on hydrological measurements in both treated and control catchments. It appeared that the independence assumption was violated and there was a hydrological connection between the artificial catchments and, therefore, the results of the data analysis were considered misleading. Finally, a numerical experiment based on the model simulations was conducted to explain how the assumed relationship between soil moisture and transpiration is reflected in the modelled runoff. Modelled runoff decreases and evaporation increases when ditches are cleaned in poorly drained sites, where the initial ditch depth is small and the depth of a highly conductive topsoil layer is low. The numerical experiment can be applied to assess when ditch cleaning does not improve evapotranspiration and is unnecessary.

AB  - Rapid changes are occurring in the natural and socio-cultural environments of the polar regions. A multitude of place-related values and meanings are affected by the current resource exploitation and human development of the Arctic. This poses challenges for management as well as research, particularly in the field of environmental impact assessment. The study explores the concept of sense of place among residents of the Svalbard (Spitsbergen) archipelago in the Norwegian high Arctic Effects of sense of place on perceptions of wilderness, environmental conditions and reactions to potential environmental impacts are analysed to examine whether sense of place can be a useful construct in environmental impact assessments. A typology of Svalbard residents based on the strength of their sense of place was developed. Pew differences were found in perception of environmental conditions among these segments, but sense of place discriminates among types of reactions to environmental impacts. Sense of place is treated as a broad, integrated concept which may be useful for tapping comprehensive views of the environment. Environmental impact assessments often do not capture a sufficient breadth of place meanings. Empirical measures of sense of place could contribute to improved assessments as indicators of salient symbolic and emotional meanings of place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - SOCIOLOGIA RURALIS
LA  - English
AB  - This paper is based mainly on research in rural Estonia during 1991 and 1992. With perestroika in the late 1980s and following Estonia's independence in 1991, several thousand new family farmers have recently been granted land from the collective and state farms. The effects of political and economic change on all kinds of agriculture have been severe. Predictably, conflicts of interest between state and collective farms and the new farmers have hindered the implementation of the reform programme - the restitution of expropriated land to the former owners and the reorganization of agriculture as an efficient productive and distributive system. Connected conflicts of interest are also emerging between new owners of relatively large and productive farms and claimants to former small holdings which are unlikely to be viable in modern conditions. It is significant that such smaller farms have largely disappeared in Finland and elsewhere under capitalism.

AB  - This paper describes the roadmap for a long term strategic internationalization project involving two key higher education institutions in Norway and Brazil. The project involves six different yet related areas of knowledge, namely collaborative design, ergonomics, rehabilitation, human computer interaction and rapid prototyping. One of the global grand challenges includes how to ensure dignified and independent living for the increasingly aging population as the body functions decay naturally with age. The aims are to generate new knowledge and produce highly skilled graduates that are able to work efficiently in multidisciplinary teams to support and orient solutions to real problems related to independent living for the population in general and assistive devices for people with disabilities in particular. The theoretical framework is based on pedagogical ideas on social learning and Hofstede's cultural analysis. The research design of the project involves case studies of real-world problems and practices where students are linked with a rehabilitation centre. To reach the goals new courses at both bachelor and master levels are developed, joint workshops are held, high volume student and teacher exchanges are conducted as well as student and teacher internships. This paper describes the project and discusses how cultural differences are likely to affect the collaboration.

AB  - Labour market activation policies aimed at those with multiple barriers to employment require inter-agency collaboration between local organizations providing social and employment services. This local collaborative context is shaped by different institutional logics (state, markets, professions and community) that are crucial for policy implementation. Using case studies of nine German, UK and Swedish cities, it is argued that different institutional logics help shape the form and operation of local collaboration between different agencies and actors and thus the concrete support for service users at the local level. Although all three countries are characterized by centralized employment policies, each city shows a prevalence, but not exclusivity, of certain institutional logics over others. These differences, partly reflecting the local context, are likely to lead to local variations in understandings of solidarity, policy implementation, inter-agency collaboration and networks of actors and national-local tensions. The paper suggests that an institutional logics approach provides a useful framework for helping to understand local variations and potential national-local policy conflicts.

AB  - Caligid sea lice represent a significant threat to salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Population genetic analyses have consistently shown minimal population genetic structure in North Atlantic Lepeophtheirus salmonis, frustrating efforts to track louse populations and improve targeted control measures. The aim of this study was to test the power of reduced representation library sequencing (IIb-RAD sequencing) coupled with random forest machine learning algorithms to define markers for fine-scale discrimination of louse populations. We identified 1286 robustly supported SNPs among four L. salmonis populations from Ireland, Scotland and Northern Norway. Only weak global structure was observed based on the full SNP dataset. The application of a random forest machine-learning algorithm identified 98 discriminatory SNPs that dramatically improved population assignment, increased global genetic structure and resulted in significant genetic population differentiation. A large proportion of SNPs found to be under directional selection were also identified to be highly discriminatory. Our data suggest that it is possible to discriminate between nearby L. salmonis populations given suitable marker selection approaches, and that such differences might have an adaptive basis. We discuss these data in light of sea lice adaption to anthropogenic and environmental pressures as well as novel approaches to track and predict sea louse dispersal.

AB  - Smoking was once defined as an appropriate recreational substance or life comfort, but is now understood as a serious health risk and a public health problem important enough to be controlled by society. In this article the changed social position and development of tobacco regulations in Finland are studied from a perspective of social constructionism. The emergence of recent tobacco controls can be seen as a process whereby tobacco came to be defined as a social problem. I will argue that there were three primary definitions which played a decisive role in this process. Put in historical order, these three definitions contained (1) claims about harms to smokers, (2) claims about harms to others, and (3) claims about tobacco as a highly addictive drug. These conceptions together drove a complementary and mutually reinforcing re-conception of tobacco harms. Consequently, the emergence of these definitions led to the founding of new institutions, practices, and treatments. The leading value in the claim-making process was public health, which transferred the state's interest away from fiscal revenues towards lowering the costs caused by tobacco diseases. Correspondingly, medical science and medical doctors gained a position as the leading authority in the defining the tobacco issue. The latest conceptual innovation is the idea of a tobacco-free Finland by 2040, representing a strategy of 'de-normalising' tobacco use. The reversal in the social and cultural position of tobacco, which in Finland went from one extreme to another, was not based on pressure created by any wider social movements or organised tobacco-specific citizens groups, as in some other countries, but rather by a state health administration supported by a relatively small network of tobacco control advocates.

AB  - There is an urgent need to understand and predict how extreme precipitation events (EPEs) will change at high latitudes, both for local climate change adaptation plans and risk mitigation and as a potential proxy anticipating the impact of climate change elsewhere in the world. This paper illustrates that a combination of non-stationary modelling approaches can be adopted to evaluate trends in EPEs under uncertainty. A large database of daily rainfall events from 281 sparsely distributed weather stations in Finland between 1961 and 2016 was analysed. Among the tested methods, Poisson distributions provided a powerful method to evaluate the impacts of multiple physical covariates, including temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs), on the resulting trends. The analysis demonstrates that non-stationarity is statistically valid for the majority of observations, independently of their location in the country and the season of the year. However, subsampling can severely hinder the statistical validity of the trends, which can be easily confused with random noise and therefore complicate the decision-making processes regarding long-term planning. Scaling effects have a strong impact on the estimates of non-stationary parameters, as homogenizing the data in space and time reduces the statistical validity of the trends. Trends in EPE statistics (mean, 90 and 99% percentiles) and best-fitted Generalized Pareto parameters in the tails of the distributions appear to be stronger when approaching the Polar region (Lapland) than away from it, consistent with the Arctic amplification of climate change. ACPs are key covariates in physically explaining these trends. In particular, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can explain statistically significant increases in extreme precipitation in Lapland, Bothnian and South regions of Finland, particularly during summer and fall seasons.

AB  - Constructing Sustainable Smart Water Supply systems are facing serious challenges all around the world with the fast expansion of modern cities. Water quality is influencing our life ubiquitously and prioritizing all the urban management. Traditional urban water quality control mostly focused on routine tests of quality indicators, which include physical, chemical, and biological groups. However, the inevitable delay for biological indicators has increased the health risk and leads to accidents such as massive infections in many big cities. In this paper, we first analyze the problem, technical challenges, and research questions. Then, we provide a possible solution by building a risk analysis framework for the urban water supply system. It takes indicator data we collected from industrial processes to perceive water quality changes, and further for risk detection. In order to provide explainable results, we propose an Adaptive Frequency Analysis (Adp-FA) method to resolve the data using indicators' frequency domain information for their inner relationships and individual prediction. We also investigate the scalability properties of this method from indicator, geography, and time domains. For the application, we select industrial quality data sets collected from a Norwegian project in four different urban water supply systems, as Oslo, Bergen, Stremmen, and Alesund. We employ the proposed method to test spectrogram, prediction accuracy, and time consumption, comparing with classical Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest methods. The results show our method better perform in most of the aspects. It is feasible to support industrial water quality risk early warnings and further decision support.

TI  - The structural dependency on car use for the Swedish urban population
T2  - URBAN TRANSPORT VIII: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY
LA  - English
CP  - 8th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century
AB  - Using GIS techniques, this project, financed by KFB The Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board, deals with the 45 Swedish towns with more than 20 000 inhabitants (those in the Stockholm region are excluded), and shows characteristic information about population, employees within different categories (retail shops, amusements, and care), car ownership etc. within a pedestrian zone (I kin from the centre point of each town), and a bicycle zone of 3 km.
   The findings show that most of the Swedish towns have a similar structure. High population density, many employees, many retail shops, small proportion green areas and low car ownership characterize the central parts. With increased distance from the town centre the population density, number of employees and number of retail shops decrease while the proportion of green area and the car ownership increases.
   However I consider that a great deal of the Swedish urban population have a convenient (maximum 15 minutes) distance by bicycle from their home to a large proportion of the town services and workplaces. In 1995, 65% of the population in the towns studied, Le. 1705 000 inhabitants, lived within a distance of 3 km from the town centre. Furthermore, a large proportion lived within convenient walking distance (maximum 15 minutes). In 1995, 18% of the population in the towns studied, i.e. 468 000 inhabitants, lived within a distance of 1 kin from the town centre. Since the proportion of short car trips is very high in urban areas, (70-80% are shorter than 4 km), there is a great potential for reduction of car use in towns. This reduction could probably take place without any serious losses in the economy of individuals, companies and society, which gives considerable freedom of choice for the Swedish government and local authorities when it comes to the design of a traffic policy for a sustainable society.

AB  - Nowadays, second homes are important for rural development and rural communities in many parts of the world. Second home owners are more committed to the place than tourists and other occasional visitors. However, they are not counted as full members of the local community, which is often seen as a coherent group of like-minded people. This study examines the concept of community in the context of second home owners in a popular tourist region of Finnish Lapland. The study is based on diaries kept for one year by ten second home owners. The diaries are analysed as narratives that record happenings that the writers see as worth narrating. They show that various social contacts as well as media and nature create the entirety of the attachment to the second home place. Social contact occurs in many places, from services to nature environments. Also residents' association seems to be an important forum of social influence. The authors suggest that more spaces for socialising are needed in order to have interaction between permanent residents and second home owners.

AB  - Many natural resources have degraded and collapsed despite being managed under rigorous institutional frameworks set up to ensure rational exploitation. Path dependency of dysfunction institutions has been suggested as an explanation for such undesired outcomes. We explore the role of path dependency in natural resource management by studying a 100-year evolution of Swedish fisheries. We rely on three main types of original longitudinal data collected for the period 1914-2016: (A) policy documents, (B) government spending on management and subsidies, and (C) catch and fleet data. Our analysis contrasts the periods before and after the Swedish entrance into the European Union (1995) because this marks the year when fisheries policy became beyond the direct influence of the Swedish government. We uncover four pieces of evidence suggesting the existence of a path dependent dynamic in the pre-EU period: (1) despite increasing insights on the vulnerability of fish stocks to overexploitation, national policy goals in relation to fisheries continuously promoted incompatible goals of social and economic growth but without any reference to the sustainability of the biological resources; (2) the same policy instruments were used over long periods; (3) actor constellations within the fisheries policy subsystem were stable over time; (4) neither political regime nor macroeconomic variables and fisheries performance (industry production, oil price, landing values) could explain observed temporal variation in subsidies. We conclude that key policy actors in the pre-EU period formed an "iron triangle" and thereby prevented necessary policy changes. These national reinforcing feedbacks have been weakened since EU entrance, and the indicators for path dependency show broader involvement of stakeholders, a shift in spending, and policy goals that now explicitly address ecological sustainability.

AB  - Introduction: the article examines the artistic originality of the novel "The Roller Merchant" by the Finnish writer of the late XIX century, Minna Canth. The novel is the first experience of psychological prose in Finnish literature; therefore, the subject of close attention is the expressive means and stylistic devices used by the writer to describe a person in a state of despair. The presented picture of Roller's inner state allows feeling the dramatism of the situation. However, in the play, there is a certain schematic and stereotyped nature in the depiction of the character, which is expressed in a unidirectional choice of lexical means that simplifies perception.
   Objective: to identify the artistic originality of the novel and to reveal the features that allows literary critics to attribute the novel by M. Canth to the initial stage of the formation of Finnish psychological prose as a genre.
   Research materials: the novella by M. Canth "The Roller Merchant".
   Results and novelty of the research: the scientific novelty of the research lies in the approach to the analysis of Canth's work from the standpoint of the genre of psychological prose. According to the previously established tradition, the works of the writer were considered by literary critics only in the perspective of critical realism. After the publication of this novel, interest to psychological prose increased among Finnish writers. In the subsequent works of M. Canth, as well as her fellow writers (for example, T. Pakkala, A. Jarnefelt, I. Kianto), much attention was paid to the spiritual world of the characters.
   In our opinion, the mature work of M. Canth is distinguished by the desire to understand the inner state of a person, the causes of his mental anguish and anxiety. The novel "The Roller Merchant" is an attempt to study a person who finds himself in a difficult psychological situation. Having achieved material prosperity, Roller became spiritually impoverished. Money does not bring the hero moral satisfaction. This is one of the negative aspects of the industrial development of society. The writer creates a wide system of artistic details, which we study in two generalized groups: subject and visual (landscape, interior, things), and intellectual and psychological (psychological and verbal portraits). The analysis of the character's internal speech allows understanding his inner world.
   There is a simplistic approach in the description of the individual psychology of the personality of Roller. Nevertheless, the experience of the psychological description of the character in the novella "The Roller Merchant" served as the beginning of a new period in the history of the development of Finnish realism.

AB  - This study explores the environmental orientation in Swedish local governments. Environmental concerns over potential risk factors have become more important and popular among public organizations and environmental improvement efforts are made to create a sustainable ecosystem for the actors doing business, living and working in the area. Prior research indicates that public organizations have started to become more environmentally oriented in order to take on more responsibilities for reducing their own environmental impact as well as influencing the citizens and local businesses in the direction of a more sustainable way of living and working. Through a survey of Swedish local governments we conclude that they are taking on a key role in developing a sustainable ecosystem through becoming more environmentally oriented. This includes developing a framework for setting environmental goals, identifying suitable environmental indicators and reporting to a wide range of stakeholders. A factor that explains the increasing environmental orientation in the public sector is the implementation of digitalized performance measurement systems. We find that the environmental performance measurements are used to motivate different internal and external stakeholders in the efforts to create a multi-actor ecosystem.

AB  - We present repeated tree measurement data from 63 permanent plots in mountain forests in France. Plot elevations range from 800 (lower limit of the montane belt) to 1942 m a.s.l (subalpine belt). Forests mainly consist of pure or mixed stands dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Silver fir (Abies alba) and Norway spruce (Picea abies), in association with various broadleaved species at low elevation and with Arolla pine (Pinus cembra) at high elevation. The plot network includes 23 plots in stands that have not been managed for the last 40 years (at least) and 40 plots in plots managed according to an uneven-aged system with single-tree or small-group selection cutting. Plot sizes range from 0.2 ha to 1.9 ha. Plots were installed from 1994 to 2004 and re-measured 2 to 5 times during the 1994-2015 period. During the first census (installation), living trees more than 7.5 cm in dbh were identified, their diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured and their social status (strata) noted. Trees were spatially located, either with x, y and z coordinates (40 plots) or within subplots 0.25 ha square (23 plots). In addition, in a subset of plots (58 plots), tree heights and tree crown dimensions were measured on a subset of trees and dead standing trees and stumps were included in the census. Remeasurements after installation include live tree diameters (including recruited trees), tree status (living, damaged, dead, stump), and for a subset of trees, height. At the time of establishment of the plots, plot densities ranges from 181 to 1328 stemsha(-1) and plot basal areas ranges from 13.6 to 81.3 m(2) ha(-1).

AB  - Relative sea level (RSL) changes and the palaeogeography of a Neolithic hunter-fisher-gatherer settlement site on the former shore of the Gulf of Finland in the city centre of Tallinn were reconstructed by implementing GIS in landscape modelling based on archaeological, sedimentary and shore displacement data. AMS radiocarbon dating of mammal bones from the cultural layer suggests the existence of the hunter-fisher-gatherer settlement around 5.1-4.8 cal. ka BP on a seaward inclining sandy beach of Tallinn palaeo-bay c. 100 m from the Litorina Sea shoreline and at about 2.4 m above the coeval sea level. The shoreline passed the study site at about 5.8 cal. ka BP and retreated towards northeast with an average speed of 13 m per century, while the RSL lowered by c. 2.5 mm annually. Combining radiocarbon dates of terrestrial and marine mammal bones from the Neolithic cultural layer, a marine reservoir effect of 350 C-14 years for the brackish-water Baltic Sea was calculated. By using high-resolution archaeological data in combination with RSL and other geological proxies, we demonstrate new possibilities to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment of deeply buried coastal settlement sites and to predict a possible continuation of the cultural layer in heavily built-up areas.

AB  - The minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) is subject to commercial whaling, but stock identification and assessment are still uncertain. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences were determined to examine the population structure of minke whales from the central and northeastern parts of the North Atlantic, as well as the Antarctic regions IV and V. The analyses include 345 nucleotide positions of the control region of 110 individuals, and 250 nucleotide positions of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 gene for a representative selection of North Atlantic minke whales. Maximum parsimony analyses and sequence divergence calculations did not reveal any genetic differentiation between individuals from the central and northeastern parts of the North Atlantic. These results do not support the International Whaling Commission's separation of minke whales in this area into different management units, and they are in conflict with previously reported results from allozyme analyses. Comparison-df minke whale control region sequences showed that the sequence diversity of North Atlantic minke whales is substantially lower (0.0065) than that of Antarctic minke whales (0.0166), and clearly demonstrated that individuals from these two areas represent genetically distinct populations.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutants (NOx, PM and SO2), together with a composite price-weighted total environmental burden (TEB), are considered in the analysis. The graphical tool, which has a similar appearance to a phase diagram, presents a map of energy use (or emission) of different transportation modes based on the values of the ratio of the transportation distances (R) and the absolute load (L). A freight transportation case study (Rotterdam to Antwerp and Genova) demonstrates the construction and application of the graphical tool. For this case study, the electric train is the transport mode that offers the lowest energy consumption and minimum TEB. The graphical decision tool can also indicate the next-best solutions when one or more options (e.g. electric train) are not available. In this scenario, general cargo shipping achieves the lowest GHG emission, but heavy lorry imposes the lowest TEB. The developed tool further demonstrates the impacts of possible future fuels and technology developments on transportation selection, including renewable biodiesel and transport electrification under different grid mixes (e.g. Latvia, Sweden and EU-28). Further criteria, including economics, can be included for future study using the proposed tool as a foundation. The graphical approach transforms the transport selection problem into an easily understandable format from which arises sound solutions.

AB  - The basic idea of a Swedish preschool is that it is a place where children can learn and experience growth in a variety of areas, not least in the social area. According to the Education Act all preschools must annually document and evaluate planned work to prevent and remedy abusive treatment. The aim of this article is to analyse if and how the discursive gap between the juridical and pedagogical assignments given to preschools in national policy documents becomes visible in local policy plans concerning the prevention and remedy of abusive treatment. The empirical material consists of 89 documents. The result makes it clear that the juridical and pedagogical discourses contain a gap in local policy plans, making it unclear whether a juridical perspective or a pedagogical perspective on abusive treatment is to be used when preventing and remedying abusive treatment in practice.

AB  - In this lecture, I discuss the role of academia in addressing "fast policymaking" on sustainability. I suggest that the co-productive turn, whereby universities are increasingly expected to engage with a diverse set of actors, including citizens, can provide checks and balances to top-heavy bureaucracy, political elites, and market power in sustainability processes. However, if research relevance continues to be defined in neoliberal terms as meeting the needs of the economy and industry, this potential will not be realized. Drawing inspiration from the "slow research movement", the call for more reflexive co-production in sustainability science, decolonial scholarship, and alternative debates on research impact, I propose a critical reconfiguration of research relevance that would respond better to the multiple imperatives of research to be critical, rooted, explanatory and actionable. However, this reconfiguration would be contingent on active scholarly engagement with the politics that condition relevance. Drawing on my experiences from participating in a collective named New University Norway, I end the lecture by offering some thoughts about the 'new' university in co-producing sustainable solutions.

AB  - The use of forest fuels has more than doubled in Sweden over the last 25-30 years. Almost a fifth of the utilized energy is now based on forest biomass. Concurrently, real prices of bioenergy have decreased to less than a third of what they were 25 years ago. Some principal driving forces behind this development are identified and discussed in this paper.
   The origin of this development was equally the result of a foreseen shortage of fibre and a reaction to this vulnerable position, made obvious through the 'oil crises'. Although Sweden has a long tradition of large-scale use of forest energy, 35 years ago she was almost totally dependent on imported oil. Forest mechanisation provided rational solutions to handling small diameter wood and stumps in conventional industrial processes, but also enabled the economical use of such wood for energy.
   During 3 decades of development, drivers and obstacles have shifted. What started to reduce dependence on fossil fuels was later driven by increased general environmental awareness. An emerging 'green' lobby blocked the development of nuclear power and expanded harnessing of hydropower which were alternative means of self-sufficiency.
   In the last 10-15 years, focus has changed again. Global concern for climatic change due to emissions of greenhouse gases is a powerful driver, endorsing increased use Of CO2-neutral energy sources. Sustainability, resource cycling and the welfare of future generations are seen as goals for continued development.
   Ideals and policies do not, however, automatically induce change in regular operations. A set of drivers is identified, that has played the decisive role in practice. These include the direct technical-operational drivers, as well as indirect drivers through market development, taxation and other legislation. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The complicated task of measuring environmental sustainability has often led to comparative evaluations of national performance using ranking lists and generic policy targets. In this paper, a set of national environmental indicators is determined through the deployment of a five-stage methodology, which includes the use of focus group research and formation of an expert team to guide the process, selection of an initial pool of pre-existing indicators, establishment of criteria to guide the selection process, and setting of appropriate policy or trend-based targets given the nation-specific context. The nations of Iceland and Norway are used as case studies to demonstrate an effective means of communicating indicator outcomes over time. National performance is first evaluated on an indicator-by-indicator basis and then summarised overall through a system of traffic lights and radar charts for trend and target-based indicators respectively. Via this analytical process, it also becomes clear that data shortages partially constrain the extent to which a nation's environmental sustainability performance can be deciphered. Improved data collection is necessary connected to the measurement of several environmental issues on a national scale, particularly the sustainability of fisheries, soil erosion and biodiversity.

AB  - Tree ring proxies are employed in dendroanalysis as a valuable tool for evaluating past anthropogenic contamination. A wide variety of analytical methods are used to quantify tree ring content for a broad spectrum of chemical elements. Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is often used to investigate element concentrations in the tree rings. However, several issues regarding the representativeness of laser ablation measurements for trace elements have to be addressed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. In this study, High Resolution (HR)-ICP-MS has been implemented to analyze the trace concentration of uranium (U) in annual growth rings of oak trees (Quercus petraea) using both laser ablation (LA) and solution modes. The three tree samples taken for the present study were located upstream (with respect to the hydrologic system) of a former uranium mine site at Rophin (Puy de Dome, France), where mining operations were performed between 1949 and 1958. According to the LA-HR-ICP-MS technique, two-dimensional quantitative (2D) mapping of uranium has developed to study the spatial distribution of uranium at the tree ring surface. A strong heterogeneity was observed, leading to an average uranium concentration with high uncertainty (50-66%). Pressed pellets of the standard reference material, NIST1570a spinach leaves and uranium doped cellulose powder were adopted as the uranium standards for quantification. No agreement was found between uranium concentrations measured after acid digestion and the values obtained by laser ablation. This comparison highlights the limitations of laser ablation technique; hence the solution mode should be preferred for quantifying uranium trace concentrations in tree rings. However, low uncertainty (< 9%) was found with the HR-ICP-MS solution, this result should be compared with the deviation observed both at the tree scale (approximate to 40%) and across the approximate to 10 m sampling area (approximate to 50%).

AB  - This article assesses the multi-actor co-innovation research that was carried out between 2010 and 2018 by researchers and apple production actors. The aim was to develop sustainable integrated pest management methods that, with the help of an agroecological whole system approach, would be both desirable and feasible to implement in practice. Whilst a novel pest management strategy based on semiochemicals arrived at and was rapidly adopted by growers, the enhancement of biological control through functional diversity required long-term learning. This is explained by substantial differences in the perception of the economic risk and the necessary knowledge behind the adoption of each method. The knowledge gap due to the reduced number of extension advisors and the conflict between the cost incurred when implementing low-impact pest control methods and reduced profitability of apple crops were pointed out as major contradictions by the actors. We suggest that strengthened regional agroecological infrastructure support along with the expansion of public advisory service personnel would reduce the farmer economic risk and share the responsibility for a safer environment and healthier food. Similarly, relevant authorities should be provided with resources to allow for safety assessments of candidate low-risk plant protection products at the regional scale. As a conclusion, we recognised that in our region sustainable agroecosystem management through feasible and desirable plant protection strategies could not be developed solely by focussing on the efficiency of the tools because the cost-effectiveness and thus the implementation of such tools depended greatly on the simultaneous co-innovation of the socio-technical system. Local stakeholders need to harmonise their vision and standpoints to engender long term socially and environmentally sound objectives providing a base to promote, finance and extensively adopt innovative plant protection strategies within the Skane region.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is emitted from various anthropogenic sources in urban areas affecting the local air quality. The aim of this study was to characterize the sources influencing air quality in detached house area in the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland, and secondly, to explore the additional value of new particle physical properties to assess the impact of residential combustion on air quality. Measurements were conducted in an urban detached housing area between January and April 2019. Measured particle physical properties were particle number (PN), particle mass (PM1) and lung deposited surface area (LDSA) concentrations and number size distributions. In addition, particle chemical composition was measured using a soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS; organic compounds, inorganic ions) and an aethalometer (black carbon (BC)). Concentrations of selected monosaccharide anhydrides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were analysed from the PM10 filter samples. The sources and characteristics of organic aerosol was investigated by applying positive matrix factorization to the mass spectra measured with the SP-AMS. Based on the variations in the measured particle physical parameters, chemical species and meteorology, the measurement period was divided into three sub periods dominated by urban background, wood burning and long-range transport (LRT) aerosols. Highest pollutant concentrations were measured during the wood burning and LRT periods. Wood burning increased the concentrations of all measured species, but the differences were most significant to levoglucosan, benzo(a) pyrene, BC and PM1 that had 12, 10, 6.4 and 3.6 times larger mean concentrations during the wood burning period compared to the urban background period, respectively. LRT affected significantly levoglucosan, PM1 and BC concentrations, since LRT pollutants partly originated from open biomass fires in Eastern Europe. The impact of local wood burning and LRT was quite small to particle number concentrations, whereas LDSA concentrations and size distributions were affected by traffic, wood combustion emissions and LRT. BC concentration correlated with the LDSA concentration during all periods suggesting a common origin. Particle number concentration was a good indicator of local combustion, especially traffic emissions, while the PM1 mass concentration together with secondary particle material was a good measure for the LRT pollutants. Benzo(a)pyrene was found to be a good indicator of local wood burning, but it was not detected in LRT biomass combustion particles.

AB  - Sustainability has become a major focus area within forest products industry. The European operational environment and national environmental steering in EU member states highlight the importance of sustainable development and the development of associated new management approaches to promote sustainability. This article reviews some key elements of sustainability management, covering examples of both Finnish forest products industry initiatives and public environmental steering at the European level. An assessment is made of the current situation and an outline of a future outlook for sustainability management, with special emphasis on bridging the gap between industry initiatives and environmental steering in the form of legislation, policies and strategies at the EU level.
   This study applied a hybrid approach comprising a review of EU sustainability initiatives, a policy and legal review and a questionnaire survey of forest industry actors. The results of the future outlook indicate that energy efficiency is perceived to be the most important focus area in addition to e.g. environmental and waste management and recycling. Less than half of the companies aim at applying sustainability management. Life-cycle management is also considered to be important whereas product-based approaches, climate change and local industrial symbiosis receive very little attention. All responding companies aim to integrate the principles of sustainability into their operations and most companies consider that life-cycle thinking, management and assessment are useful for them. Energy efficiency is identified as the most important focus area with energy and materials efficiency seen as the most crucial factors for the achievement of responsible competitive advantage and building of sustainable value-added. The findings indicate that sustainability and life-cycle management are not receiving enough management focus at the moment and neither is the industry receiving enough guidance at either the EU level or via national steering and regulatory frameworks.

AB  - The structural Eurocodes have been given the status of National Standards since 2007 and all conflicting National Standards previously used in member states of the European Union were withdrawn in 2010. The Eurocode has also been adopted in the design of long-span suspension bridges. However, the traffic load models in Eurocode EN 1991-2:2003 are only valid for bridge spans of less than 200 m. Traffic load models for loaded lengths greater than 200 m may be defined in the National Annexes or on a project-specific basis. This paper discusses the traffic loads for long-span bridges defined in BS5400, AASHTO LRFD,(1) Sweden TK BRO, Great Belt (East) Bridge Design Basis, the Superstructure Design of Honshu-Shikoku Bridge of Japan, and the Highway Bridge Design Code of China. Together, these codes have been adopted in the design of more than 20 long-span suspension bridges. This article proposes a traffic load model for long-span suspension bridges in the framework of Eurocode Load Model 1, in which multiple lane factors and impact factors are also taken into account. The recommended traffic load model was utilized in the design of a suspension bridge with a main span of 1550 m. According to the design load partial factors and resistance partial factor of the main cable, the margin of safety for the main cable was calculated. The results indicate that the recommended traffic load model for long-span suspension bridges is reasonable.

AB  - The positive adoption of digital technology within the food sector can boost sustainable development in Finnish Lapland. There is a need for a food system in the region to respond to current trends from consumers and ensure a better supply of local foods that are processed efficiently with minimal waste. In this article, a review of the literature on the benefits of digitalisation as a tool amongst food processors was carried out. The opportunities offered by digital technology are expected to make local food business operators more transparent, efficient and sustainable. Digitalisation can help to minimise the environmental impacts of food processing and ultimately improve sustainability. In meeting the demand of local consumers, distributed and localised manufacturing will help to add value to local food crops, lower transportation and storage costs. The adoption of food digitalisation will open up market accessibility for the locally produced food products in local communities. In the future, digitalisation is likely to have major impacts in the local food system of the Lapland region.

AB  - Road freight transport is a key function of modern societies. At the same time, road freight transport accounts for significant emissions. Digitalization, including automation, digitized information, and artificial intelligence, provide opportunities to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase service levels in road freight transport. Digitalization may also radically change the business ecosystem in the sector. In this paper, the question, "How will digitalization change the road freight transport landscape?" is addressed by developing four exploratory future scenarios, using Sweden as a case study. The results are based on input from 52 experts. For each of the four scenarios, the impacts on the road freight transport sector are investigated, and opportunities and barriers to achieving a sustainable transportation system in each of the scenarios are discussed. In all scenarios, an increase in vehicle kilometers traveled is predicted, and in three of the four scenarios, significant increases in recycling and urban freight flows are predicted. The scenario development process highlighted how there are important uncertainties in the development of the society that will be highly important for the development of the digitized freight transport landscape. One example is the sustainability paradigm, which was identified as a strategic uncertainty.

AB  - The presence of poorly sited wind farms raises concerns for wildlife, including birds of prey. Therefore, there is a need to extend the knowledge of the potential human-wildlife conflicts associated with wind energy. Here, we report on the movements and habitat use of post-fledging satellite-tagged white-tailed eagles in Finland, where wind-energy development is expected to increase in the near future. In particular, we examine the probability of a fledgling approaching a hypothetical turbine that is placed at different distances from the nest. We found that this probability is high at short distances but considerably decreases with increasing distances to the nest. A utilisation-availability analysis showed that the coast was the preferred habitat. We argue that avoiding construction between active nests and the shoreline, as well as adopting the currently 2-km buffer zone for turbine deployment, can avoid or minimise potential impacts on post-fledging white-tailed eagles.

TI  - A need for new methods in the paradigm shift from mobility to sustainable accessibility

AB  - Planning of the transport system is usually based on forecasting of future traffic volumes. The forecast is based on current trends in the society, predictions of future economic growth and costs of transport. In all parts of Europe these trends and models point towards further growth of transport and traffic volumes. The highest growth is predicted in the Eastern part where car ownership is getting closer to the levels in the Western part. Safety factors and seamless mobility can justify improved road network but the forecasts also indicate a need for larger roads with more capacity. These new roads not only induce more traffic and thereby more emissions of GHG but also larger energy use and emissions of GHG during construction, operation and maintenance. In the last report IPCC warns that infrastructure developments that lock societies into GHG-intensive emissions pathways may be difficult or very costly to change. This reinforces the importance of early action for ambitious mitigation.
   To reach the climate objectives there is a need for technical solutions in energy efficient vehicles partly or fully dependent on electricity and a replacement of fossil fuels with bio fuels. These solutions however are not enough. There is also a need to change direction in planning and development of society and infrastructure in accordance with behavioral changes. It is a clear paradigm shift from planning for more traffic with cars and trucks towards a more sustainable mobility with accessibility through walking, cycling and public transport with less cars and improved logistics and modal shift instead of more trucks. Under such conditions of paradigm shift forecast is a very unreliable method. So there is a need for other methods.
   This paper is a result of the work within the CEDR I4 group on mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Based on examples from Sweden, Norway, Hungary and Poland within the group the paper explores an alternative method for planning. The first step is to describe the current situation, what the trends are and what the drivers are, to get a general picture of the problem. A clear objective is also needed. Since most countries do not have precise GHG objectives for road transport example is given how national objectives can be translated to a road transport objective. Then the gap between the trend and the GHG objectives can be described for road transport. An inventory should be made of possible measures to reduce the GHG emissions. This has been done in many countries and by EU commission which can work as a basis, but update may be necessary and there should be space for new ideas. The measures can be clustered into packages. From them scenarios can be built and tested towards the GHG objectives and other targets. Backcasting from the scenarios that fulfill the objectives can be used to develop an implementation strategy with policy instruments and measures to move in the direction towards the objectives. Due to uncertainty check points are recommended some years in between to adjust the strategy. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rock type used in coastal engineering structures impacts biodiversity, but its effect has been understudied to date. We report here on whether different combinations of rock material and rock mass properties can improve habitat suitability and early phase ecological outcomes on coastal engineering structures. We examine two coastal engineering schemes that used different granites during construction. At site one, Shap granite boulders with a high number of cm-dm(2) surface features (e.g. ledges) were deliberately positioned during construction (called passive enhancement), to a) maximise the provision of cm-dm scale intertidal habitat and b) determine which scale of habitat is best for ecological enhancement. At site two, Norwegian granite boulders were installed without passive enhancement, allowing for a direct comparison. Passive positioning of Shap granite boulders led to an increase in limpet (Patella vulgata, Linnaeus, 1758) abundance within two years but few limpets were recorded on the nonenhanced Norwegian granite. Positioning of boulder thus exerts a strong control on the mm and mm-dm scale geomorphic features present, with clear ecological benefits when suitable features are selected for and optimally positioned (ie. passive enhancement) to maximise habitat features. An EcoRock scoring matrix was developed to aid in the selection of the most ecologically suitable rock materials for coastal engineering worldwide; this can help improve habitat provision on engineered structures in a rapidly warming world.

AB  - Over a 3-year period, we equipped 115 newly hatched capercaillie chicks in 29 broods with small radio transmitters in southeast Norway. Besides monitoring the fate of the chicks, we measured the abundance of microtine rodents and insect food and, together with weather records, we examined the observed mortality in relation to these factors. On average, 57% of the chicks died within the first month of life. Mortality was highest during the first 3 weeks, coinciding with the period when chicks feed almost exclusively on insects, depend heavily on their mother for maintaining body warmth, and cannot fly well. Predation was by far the most important proximate cause of mortality, accounting for 90% of all observed losses. Only 7% of the losses could be ascribed to direct effects of cold and wet weather, all recorded during the first 8 days of life. However, because predation losses were also quite high during and immediately after heavy rainfalls, adverse weather probably predisposed the chicks to mammalian predation. Most chicks were killed by mustelids, mainly pine martens; low numbers of red fox due to sarcoptic mange probably explains the low proportion taken by this predator. Among known predation losses (N = 40), goshawks accounted for a minimum of 25%. Chick mortality during the first month varied markedly (29%-83%) among the three years. It was highest in the year when June weather was exceptionally wet and cold; the same year when the density of microtine rodents and food abundance in terms of insect larvae were highest. Net production in late August was poorly related to chick loss during the first month posthatch.

AB  - Arctic birds migrating southwards face a multitude of challenges such as habitat loss, pollution, overexploitation of food resources and climate change impacts. Long-tailed Duck winter populations in the Baltic Sea have declined in recent decades. However, precise spatial data are lacking, especially from males. Thus, we aimed to identify the wintering grounds, timing of migration and stopover sites of males and females. We studied spatiotemporal distribution patterns of eight male and five female Long-tailed Ducks using implanted ARGOS satellite transmitters. Birds were tagged in the breeding season on Kolguev Island, Russia. After the breeding period, Long-tailed Ducks from Kolguev used three main post-breeding areas: most males undertook long distance eastward post-breeding migration to areas around the Yamal and Gydan peninsulas, while one male and four females moved short to the southeast coast of Kolguev, and one female moved to Mezhdusharsky Island in the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. Autumn migration included stopover sites in the White Sea, Lake Ladoga, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga, and all birds except one spent the winter in the southern part of the Baltic Sea, from the Pomeranian coast and Hoburgs bank to the Gulf of Finland. Only one female stayed in the White Sea for the winter. All but one bird used the White Sea as a stopover site in May, suggesting that this area is of special importance.

AB  - A criticism raised about mediatization research is that although the concept of mediatization presupposes a long-term temporal perspective, there are few projects that have studied the process methodologically over time. This article argues that a generational approach can serve as one suggested analytical solution to the problem of studying long-term social, cultural, and societal change. The article describes a recently finished project on media generations in Sweden and Estonia and discusses overcoming the problem of conducting research on mediatization as a long-term process. Through intergenerational and cross-cultural analysis, the article shows how media memories from childhood and the formative years of youth can reveal specific traits in the historical process and how the role of the media has changed over time in the minds of different generations. The article focuses on four generations that had their formative years during significant historical moments in the late 20th century; these formative moments were marked by specificities both in the respective national media landscapes and in the vast historical and geopolitical differences between the two countries.

AB  - Emerging recognition of two fundamental errors underpinning past polices for natural resource issues heralds awareness of the need for a worldwide fundamental change in thinking and in practice of environmental management. The first error has been an implicit assumption that ecosystem responses to human use are linear predictable and controllable. The second has been an assumption that human and natural systems can be treated independently. However, evidence that has been accumulating in diverse regions all over the world suggests that natural and social systems behave in nonlinear ways, exhibit marked thresholds in their dynamics, and that social-ecological systems act as strongly coupled, complex and evolving integrated systems. This article is a summary of a report prepared on behalf of the Environmental Advisory Council to the Swedish Government, as input to the process of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa in 26 August 4 September 2002. We use the concept of resilience-the capacity to buffer change, learn and develop-as a framework for understanding how to sustain and enhance adaptive capacity in a complex world of rapid transformations. Two useful tools for resilience-building in social-ecological systems are structured scenarios and active adaptive management. These tools require and facilitate a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of transport systems in remote areas, defined by a set of constraints deriving from a sparse population, infrequent transportation location means stops and cost-effectiveness of the system. Remote areas attractive to tourists additionally require transportation services designed with respect to changeable demand and the necessity to provide transportation solutions limiting detrimental influence on the environment. This paper aims to identify and assess the perspectives for developing innovative mobility solutions for residents and tourists in remote areas in line with sustainable development and evaluate factors supporting or hindering the development of the selected perspectives. The results of a Delphi study with 23 experts from seven EU Member States, Russia and Norway, enabled identification of factors shaping the future of mobility in peripheral areas, including IT-supported multimodal transport systems, demand-responsive transport and transport services tailored to the specific needs of different user groups.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), a serious pest of potato, is currently spreading north in Europe. We investigated the risk of CPB establishment in Finland and control methods for the case when beetle life history characters change due to global warming or as an adaptation to colder climate. Analysis with a spatially explicit simulation model supported the current management policy in Finland (efficient eradication and one year field quarantine) but changes in CPB viability, such as decreased winter mortality or increased number of offspring would render them inefficient. Longer quarantine times would be needed to effectively prevent the CPB establishment and spread. As an option we investigated Bt-potato cultivation integrated to other control methods and found that it was already efficient when used as a sole strategy but its benefits may be reduced by the adaptability of the Colorado potato beetle.

AB  - Marine mammals and coastal fisheries are two features commonly associated with thriving marine environments, but it is also a case of wildlife impact on human interests. This paper analyses the seal-fisheries encounter in a Swedish Baltic Sea fishery. The problem concerns seals eating fish from the fishing gear which causes considerable economic losses to small-scale fishermen. This mixed-method study addresses local attitudes towards management measures that might be introduced. A questionnaire was sent to all households in three traditional fishing villages and interviews were conducted with local stakeholders. The results show a consensus that something needs to be done or the local fishery cannot continue. Economic compensation for lost catches is viewed as a short-term strategy, while investment subsidies for seal-proof gear are considered positive but problematic due to low efficiency of the new gear. The management measure viewed as most positive in the local context is hunting. In general, a more active management is perceived as urgent for the survival of the small-scale coastal fishery in the studied area.

AB  - Catches of anadromous whitefish in the Gulf of Bothnia have declined since the early 1990s. It is generally assumed that the cause is overfishing. The professional fishermen interviewed in the present study were united in the opinion that it is necessary to set limits on the fishing of whitefish, but had differing views about the means of achieving this. These different arguments involved separate whitefish stocks, various types of gear and different motives for fishing. Most of the professional fishermen accepted a minimum mesh size for gill nets. Other means proposed included setting limits on non-professional fishing and sales of catches. There were conflicting attitudes about seasonal restrictions because their experiences with fishing restrictions for salmon had been negative. On the whole, decision-making requires more regional information on whitefish stocks and fishing, but also on the social and economic flexibility of fishermen.

AB  - Natural events such as floods and landslides can have severe consequences. The risks are expected to increase, both as a consequence of climate change and due to increased vulnerabilities, especially in urban areas. Although preventive measures are often cost-effective, some measures are beneficial to certain values, while some may have negative impacts on other values. The aim of the study presented here was to investigate two frameworks used for assessing the effectiveness and sustainability of physical and nonphysical flood and landslide risk reduction measures. The study is based on literature, available information from authorities and municipalities, expert knowledge and experience, and stakeholder views and values. The results indicate that the risks for suboptimization or maladaptation are reduced if many aspects are included and a broad spectrum of stakeholders are involved. The sustainability assessment tools applied here can contribute to a more transparent and sustainable risk management process by assessing strategies and interventions with respect to both short- and long-term perspectives, including local impacts and wider environmental impacts caused by climate change, for example. The tools can also cover social and economic aspects. The assessment tools provide checklists that can support decision processes, thus allowing for more transparent decisions.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Romania's forests are of globally significant value due to their natural characteristics, as similar forests in some other parts of the world have been lost forever. These types of forests, so-called "virgin" and "quasi-virgin (old growth)" forests, are also identified in the Buzau Mountains, which are part of the Eastern Carpathians in Romania (Curvature Region).
   Materials and Methods: To study and understand the structure and dynamics of primeval forest, four permanent one-hectare research plots were installed in the Penteleu Mountains, part of the Buzau Mountains. All trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) greater than 80 mm were measured and their main dendrometric characteristics (DBH, height and social position) registered. The forest structure was analysed by fitting different theoretical distribution functions (beta, gamma, gamma 3P, gamma 3P mixt, loglogistic 3p, lognormal 3P and Weibull 3p). The structural homogeneity of the permanent research plots was tested using the Camino index (H) and Gini index (G).
   Results: For the smaller DBH categories, Norway spruce was relatively shorter in height, but with increasing DBH, the heights of Norway spruce exceeded those of European beech. Stand volume varied between 615 and 1133 m(3) per hectare. The area of maximum stability where we encountered the lowest tree height variability was recorded between the 60 cm and 100 cm diameter categories. The Lorenz curve and the Gini index indicated that the studied stands have high structural biodiversity.
   Conclusions: The results showed that the studied forests have an optimal structural diversity, assuring them a higher stability and multifunctionality. Thus, these forests are models for managed forests.

AB  - Sustainability goals regarding biobased chemicals and fuels can lead to increased demand for cereal straw, which could lead to undesirable effects on soil organic matter (SOM) content. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of removing straw on SOM, using a life cycle approach based on agricultural statistics and soil carbon modelling. This regional evaluation in southern Sweden showed that the general restrictions on straw removal recommended in many European studies, with demands on the incorporation of at least half of the aboveground straw, is not an efficient means of SOM preservation. Unrestricted straw removal in combination with the cultivation of intermediate crops leads to a much higher SOM build-up. Such measures will increase the availability of removable straw 2.5 times, at little extra cost. The findings of this study demonstrate the necessity of regional evaluation, taking new findings on the impact of straw incorporation on SOM into consideration. This is important for both regional emerging biobased industries, where unnecessary restrictions on straw removal might hamper the development of new production pathways, and for future sustainability in agriculture, where well-intended but inefficient SOM preservation strategies might hinder the implementation of more efficient measures.

AB  - Introduction Cocreation, coproduction and codesign are advocated as effective ways of involving citizens in the design, management, provision and evaluation of health and social care services. Although numerous case studies describe the nature and level of coproduction in individual projects, there remain three significant gaps in the evidence base: (1) measures of coproduction processes and their outcomes, (2) mechanisms that enable inclusivity and reciprocity and (3) management systems and styles. By focusing on these issues, we aim to explore, enhance and measure the value of coproduction for improving the health and well-being of citizens.
   Methods and analysis Nine ongoing coproduction projects form the core of an interactive research programme ('Samskapa') during a 6-year period (2019-2024). Six of these will take place in Sweden and three will be undertaken in England to enable knowledge exchange and cross-cultural comparison. The programme has a longitudinal case study design using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Cross-case analysis and a sensemaking process will generate relevant lessons both for those participating in the projects and researchers. Based on the findings, we will develop explanatory models and other outputs to increase the sustained value (and values) of future coproduction initiatives in these sectors.
   Ethics and dissemination All necessary ethical approvals will be obtained from the regional Ethical Board in Sweden and from relevant authorities in England. All data and personal data will be handled in accordance with General Data Protection Regulations. Given the interactive nature of the research programme, knowledge dissemination to participants and stakeholders in the nine projects will be ongoing throughout the 6 years. External workshops-facilitated in collaboration with participating case studies and citizens-both during and at the end of the programme will provide an additional dissemination mechanism and involve health and social care practitioners, policymakers and third-sector organisations.

AB  - Electric vehicles and renewable energy sources in transportation played a significant role in promoting sustainable transportation systems. The overall performance of the electric vehicle is highly dependent on the electricity mix consumed during their production and use phase. Therefore, a comprehensive and dynamic assessment is necessary to provide accurate guidance to users and policymakers. Therefore, this study presents a comparative cradle to grave life cycle analysis of electric vehicles in 10 selected countries using the current and future electricity mix scenarios. We present the environmental footprint of vehicle production, transportation, and use phases. The results revealed that EVs in China with current (2019) and future 2025 electricity mix scenarios had a higher impact than all other EVs. In contrast, EV with 2030 Norway electricity mix was an optimal choice and has the least environmental impact in most of the selected categories. Moreover, it was also found that all EVs with 2030 electricity mix had lower environmental damages than EV 2019 electricity mix. Besides, this study outcome indicated that the use of clean energy could help to decrease the environmental impact and mitigate climate change all around the globe.

AB  - In Sweden the importance of sustainable development (SD) can be traced in political documents from the fundamental law down to the curriculum for different school levels. To investigate how this political objective is demonstrated in knowledge and activities among the teachers, eleven upper secondary school teachers from different subjects have been interviewed to map out their views of SD, their own beliefs and how they teach SD. The interviews have been analysed in terms of content with the Knowledge - Value - Practice model as theoretical frame. The results showed that among the interviewed teachers there existed a spectrum of views of what SD stands for, from a narrow view to a well-developed view. There were also differences in their teaching practice. All teachers stated that teaching for SD is of great importance and that they all did it in terms of their own personal definition. All of them also pointed out that even if the steering documents present SD as important, the local management of the issue is weak. The differences between the teachers' view of SD and the weak local management generate a fundamental problem. Depending on the teachers' own definition and content choice the pupils may get different content knowledge, perhaps not even consistent with the recognized definition of sustainable development. The schools cannot therefore be said to give the pupils an equal education in the area of SD. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article is an explorative investigation of a sample of advanced producer service (APS) companies located in Stockholm (the capital and main urban centre of Sweden). The discussion is centred on aspects of work practice and how this is conditioned by space-time constraints. These space-time constraints refer to coupling, authority and capability constraints which are concepts framed in a time-geography approach. Although time-geography is primarily engaged in mapping presence and locations in time-space, its concepts of constraints embrace physical, social and cultural factors. The article presents an empirical in-depth study of project work and work practice among a selection of APS companies. A micro-approach to work practice has been pursued using a multi-method strategy and time-geography methodology including time diaries, interviews and a questionnaire. The experiences among the investigated companies of time-geography constraints make the constant negotiations for the practice of work among these organizations intelligible. To the extent these investigated companies may be considered representative of advanced services more generally, the presence of pressing constraints helps to explain the more general structure of this industry of high labour turnover and rapid company re-structuring processes.

AB  - This paper describes on-going research efforts addressing the impacts of the European Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive. The present stage of the implementation of the Directive in Finland is discussed, and the WEEE recovery potential of Oulu region is outlined. It is presented that to prevent waste, we need to know the reasons of why electronic equipment became waste. This key question is analysed using a novel waste taxonomy. Development efforts and future research needs for mobile phone recovery, are summarized. Finally, a conceptual model of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment is introduced. This descriptive model describes patterns of waste generation and the state-of-the-art of its treatment. It is argued that this waste management model would perform as a producer responsibility support tool to aid enterprises in internalising environmental issues. It is asserted that continued research-industry-administrative collaboration is needed to build a sustainable WEEE recovery infrastructure.

AB  - In the present study, the actual levels and temporal changes of 34 major and trace elements were examined in 44 moss samples Hypnum cuppressiforme collected across Thrace region. The concentrations of Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Sb, V, and Zn were found to be higher than the local background in the vicinity of corlu, one of the most industrialized cities in Thrace region. The concentrations of Fe and Pb exceeded the local background level in the locations close to the Istanbul Airport construction. The highest concentrations of As, Cd, and Sb were found in Istanbul metropolitan area most probably due to intense traffic and industrial activities. Enrichment factors were calculated between 1.4 and 15.8, and Cd is the highest value among the investigated elements. The median levels of some significant anthropogenic elements including As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Sb in moss samples remained unchanged over sixteen years, suggesting that the actions were insufficient to reduce the release of these elements.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare earthworm communities in anthropogenous birch stands with different origin in Finland. A total of nine forest sites were investigated: three birch stands (Betula pendula) planted ca. 30 years prior to the study after clear-cutting of spruce stands ("Birch after Spruce", BS), three birch stands planted ca. 30 years earlier on arable soil that had been under normal cultivation until forestation ("Birch after Field", BF), and three "Natural Deciduous" forests (D). Earthworms were sampled in May and October 1999 using a combination of formaline extraction and modified wet funnels. There were conspicuous differences between replicates of similarly managed forests. Earthworms were totally tacking in one of the D sites, while another had an abundant and diverse community. Only Dendrobaena octaedra was present in one BS site, while the two others harboured also Aporrectodea caliginosa and three Lumbricus species. All these species were also present in the BF sites, where their total biomass (ranging from 70 to 1388 (f.w.)/m(2)) was 2.6 times the average in BS, and of the same magnitude as the average in natural deciduous stands. A separate experiment revealed that L. terresris and A. caliginosa, which are not found in the surrounding coniferous forest, are able to live and reproduce in the soil of the D site where they were absent. It was concluded that earthworm species survive and reproduce in birch stands established on arable soil, where they have invaded during the long cultivation. On the other hand, their possibilities to disperse from cultural landscapes determine their presence not only in birch stands established in earlier coniferous forests, but also in "natural deciduous" forests where source populations are not present in the surroundings.

AB  - A quite extended number of commercial flights are transiting today through the Arctic Ocean. In addition, activities like tourism, fishing and local communities' resupply needs, along with various planned and already existing maritime transport endeavors further point towards the direction of future higher demands on the Search and Rescue (SAR) infrastructure of the wider region. The "Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic" that coordinates international SAR coverage and response efforts in the region under discussion and establishes the area of (SAR) responsibility of each state party was the first legally-binding instrument negotiated and adopted under the auspices of the Arctic Council; this has been a very decisive step for the establishment and enhancement of SAR infrastructure in the Arctic. Through an exploratory review of various sources (resolutions and legislative documents of the International Maritime Organization, government policy documents of the Arctic Council Nations, academic literature) and primary data from institutions located in Norway and Russia, this paper aims to provide an overview of the existing SAR infrastructure of the countries in close proximity with the Northeast Passage, identify current deficiencies and propose ways forward for safe and sustainable voyages in the region. Valuable outcomes for policy-makers and relevant stakeholders come about from necessary investments in advanced SAR infrastructure to enhance safe and secure navigation in the Arctic, including the use of satellite-based Automatic Identification System (AIS) for monitoring vessel activities and improving awareness of their location and strengthened cooperation among the Arctic Council Nations to address the increased challenges of SAR operations in this remote geographical region.

AB  - Conflicts over wildlife and their potential impacts on human practices and livelihoods are widespread. Large carnivore predation on livestock often becomes a contested topic which has led to global declines in carnivore numbers over centuries. To minimise impacts of carnivores on human livelihoods and allow conservation, various interventions are used to prevent attacks. However, these interventions can only be effective if they are used and implemented. According to the Technology Acceptance Model, end user acceptance depends on perceived usefulness and ease of use. This study investigates the former as believed effect through a modified version of the Potential for Conflict Index. Using a web-based questionnaire we assess acceptance levels and believed effect of interventions intended to prevent carnivore predation on livestock, dogs, and reindeer among animal owners/keepers and members of the public in Sweden. The analysis shows that believed effect is a prerequisite for acceptance of an intervention, but not a guarantee. Interventions promoted by authorities are in some cases highly acceptable to users and the public, but in other cases believed contra-productive and are opposed by the end users. Active promotion of the latter may undermine mitigation efforts. Carnivore removal is generally more acceptable to animal owners than to members of the public. The results are useful to minimise conflicts within carnivore management and increase transparency and success of conservation. The results are discussed in relation to how similar questions may be approached in other systems using combined measures of believed effect, accept-intention, and the Potential for Conflict Index.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify relationships between meteorological and hydrological observations and sediment flux rate changes, in order to better understand catchment dynamics. The meteorological and hydrological observations included local air temperature, wind speed, water temperature, and ice cover, while the sediment flux rate was observed in the lake basin using a modified sediment trap technique. This study demonstrates the advantages of a new online methodology applied in conventional sediment trapping to obtain flux rate information with daily resolution. A prototype of a high-resolution online sediment trap was tested in Savilahti Bay, Lake Kallavesi, eastern Finland, during the period from 22 October 2017 to 6 October 2018. The daily resolutions of meteorological, hydrological, and sediment flux rate data were analyzed using statistical methods. The results indicate relationships between temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and sediment flux rate, but the urban site also showed erosional changes due to anthropogenic land use. Sediment flux ceased during winter season and spring floods were recorded as pronounced peaks in sediment flux, while the growing season showed generally higher sediment accumulation rates. This research also provides valuable information on the catchment response to short-term weather events. The influence of a storm led to larger sediment flux for several days. The importance of wind speed and frost formation on sedimentation, which has been difficult to address due to trap deployment times of typically several months, is now supported. Used together with varved sediment archives, online sediment trapping will facilitate the interpretation of paleoclimatic proxy records and modeling of detailed weather and erosion conditions that are related to climate change.

AB  - The publication aims to investigate the quantitative impact of linear earthworks in urban parks, e.g. during roads' and pavements' modernization in the old trees' root zones, on the increment in their external parameters (e.g. trunk circumference). Pilot studies (Warsaw, Poland) were carried out 2003-2019 in two historical parks: Ursynow and Krolikarnia. The dataset of trees' parameters is based on detailed dendrological inventories. Test groups consisted of trees exposed to damage and not exposed to damage (Ursynow) and the control group - trees growing in unchanged site conditions (Krolikarnia). Among the three most abundant species of dendroflora, Norway maples (Ater platanoides L.) show the most visible difference (>1.8 cm) between the normal and the inhibited growth in trunk circumference. Two other species - black locusts (Robinia pseudoacacia L) and small-leaved limes (Tilia cordata Mill.) - also revealed statistically significant differences in the increment of the trunk circumference (respectively: >1.3 cm and >1.4 cm). In general, the reaction of affected trees was a significant reduction of circumference increments from 2.6 to 4.0 times concerning trees not exposed to damage. The verification made with the resistograph in 2019 confirmed a statistically significant decrease in radial increments of trees remaining in the impact zone of the earthworks.

AB  - Bioenergy has an important role in the implementation of the Kyoto agreement in Finland. The main sources of wood residues for energy production are logging areas and sawmills. The use of forest chips can be of great significance in reducing carbon dioxide emissions by replacing fossil fuels. Increasing the use of forest chips has environmental benefits, but it also includes possible environmental disadvantages. Therefore, system research is needed to assess the forest chip utilisation prospects for their environmental quality to secure sustainable forest management. Life-cycle methodology was developed and applied to assess environmental burdens and impacts of the logging and sawmill residues throughout the whole fuel chain from the forest to energy production. According to the study, the energy efficiencies of the forest chip systems are quite high. Net CO2 emissions of the systems are low owing to the low input of external primary energy required to operate the systems. Although wood energy is renewable, it has many similarities with fossil fuels, e.g. as the emissions of the conversion phase are significant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dedicated to show climate leadership, Sweden has committed to cut 70% of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in the domestic transportation sector by 2030 compared to 2010 levels (except flights). This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three recent new car policies. Based on questionnaires and market supply data, multinomial logit discrete choice models were developed for private buyers and individuals with company cars for private use, denoted benefit cars. Estimates indicated that preferences among individuals with benefit cars were generally in favor of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) as compared to gasoline cars, in contrast with private consumers (ceteris paribus). Thus, the company car market seemed to be the main gateway for AFVs into the fleet; however, average GHG emissions per car sold were similar in both buyer segments, which was likely related to stronger preferences for larger and more expensive benefit cars. The results indicated that subsidies to private buyers would be influential only if they decreased the costs of AFVs as compared to conventional vehicles, and that none of the investigated policies had been very effective in shifting choices in favor of AFVs. Reduced fringe benefits tax for AFVs, annually worth up to (sic)1100, resulted in only 0.7% lower average carbon emissions. A `Super Green Car' premium, worth approximately (sic)2000-(sic)4000 at the time of purchase, decreased emissions by 0.4% among private consumers, twice the impact of a five-year tax-exemption for 'Green Cars'. It appears that more stringent policies are needed to more substantially reduce GHG emissions from new cars.

AB  - Aim Functional traits offer a window into how organisms are adapted, and might acclimate, to environmental pressures. Despite being important in ecosystem function, lichens are underrepresented in trait-based research; understanding how lichen functional traits vary with climate and habitat availability will be useful in predicting how communities will respond to climate change, for example, in wetter and warmer boreal and arctic ecosystems. Here, we assess the influence of macroclimate and forest availability on the spatial distribution of lichen traits across Norway. Location Norwegian mainland. Taxon Lichens. Methods We used relative trait frequency (RTF) data from LIAS gtm, a database combining trait information from LIAS (A Global Information System for Lichenized and Non-Lichenized Ascomycetes) and GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) species observations. The 20 traits included photobiont types, growth forms, cortical features and reproductive modes. Nonparametric multiplicative regression (NPMR) models were used to explore the relationships between the environmental predictors of precipitation, temperature and forest availability. Results All traits showed significant relationships with the three environmental predictors. Photobiont type and reproductive mode traits produced the strongest models and revealed ecologically meaningful biogeographical patterns. Trebouxioid species peaked in colder, drier upland regions, while trentepohlioid lichens displayed an affinity for wetter and warmer climates and had a western and southern distribution. Cyanolichens increased with increasing precipitation and were strongly coastal. Sorediate and isidiate lichens were positively related to temperature, the former also increasing with forest cover. The above responses were consistent with the physiological and habitat requirements of the associated lichens. The remaining traits had weaker responses. Main conclusions Discrete traits (i.e. photobiont type and reproductive mode) with relatively low ecological plasticity reflect clear functional environmental responses at the large scale. By contrast, growth form and thallus structural features-proxies for continuous variables-are too variable within each given category to show observable distribution patterns.

AB  - Sediments in ports, marinas and waterways around the world are often contaminated with metals arising from anthropogenic activities. Regular dredging is needed to achieve an appropriate water depth and reduce the environmental impact of pollutants. The aim of this study was to develop an integrated assessment method for comparing various management strategies for dredged sediments at six case study sites in Sweden. Short- and long-term environmental impacts were investigated for different management approaches, including landfilling, deep-sea disposal, metal extraction in combination with the two aforementioned, and natural recovery (no dredging). The potential value of metals in the sediments was estimated using sediment metal contents and current metal prices. Additionally, an assessment of how metal extraction could result in lower management costs was carried out. The cost of the different management approaches was calculated and evaluated together with the corresponding environmental impacts. This study shows that there is a monetary value in dredged materials, in terms of metal content, and that the materials can potentially be used for metal extraction. Metal extraction may also help to reduce the management costs, as cleaner materials are cheaper to handle. The choice of metal recovery method is important in both monetary and environmental terms, potentially contributing to a circular economy. In the future, metal recovery may become more profitable, as technologies are improved, and due to probable increases in metal prices and landfill costs. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Accurate information on population structure is essential for effective fisheries management. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in the North Atlantic is managed as four separate offshore stocks. We use Multivariate Autoregressive State-Space (MARSS) models to assess population structure by means of abundance and biomass trends in four regions (Norwegian Sea, Iceland, Southeast Greenland, and Northwest Atlantic) where three offshore stocks are recognized: (1) Baffin Bay-Davis Strait (Northwest Atlantic stock), (2) Southeast Greenland and Iceland (West Nordic stock (WNS)), and (3) the Barents and Norwegian Seas (Northeast Arctic stock). We formulated model alternatives, using bottom trawl survey data from each region for 1996-2019, to evaluate support for different population structures. Abundance and biomass observations from each region were linked to growth rate parameters in MARSS models and the impact of climate (North Atlantic Oscillation Index) and fishing (commercial catches) on stock dynamics was investigated. Top models identified the Northwest Atlantic as an independent population. Best-fit models treated Greenland halibut in the WNS as two independent populations (east and west), with potential connections between eastern Iceland and the western Barents Sea. These results suggest a mismatch between current stock perception and management boundaries in the Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Trade unions have received little attention in sustainability transitions research, despite their capacity to influence policy decisions. This article presents a study of how key unions in Norway a country with a large petroleum sector as well as high union level density - have moved their preferences on transition issues in the period 2007-2019. With a document-based process analysis of trade unions' changing policy preferences and interpretations of a just transition, a concept that aims to bridge the apparent gap between destruction and creation policies, we show how trade unions have used this concept to reconcile different positions among unions. While unions from petroleumrelated sectors are more opposed to phase-out policies compared to nonpetroleum unions, the solidarity principle among unions has caused some movement towards a joint support of a just transition. Yet, different unions promote different ideas of what a just transition means depending on their sector affiliation.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse shipping firms' reactions to environmental challenges and identify how significant reductions in energy consumption and air emissions can come about by implementing a variety of voluntary initiatives. The paper focuses on the various sustainability initiatives implemented by the Swedish short sea shipping operator, Stena Line, either on a purely voluntary basis as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy or as their chosen route for compliance with regulations. A conceptual model is developed based on stakeholder theory, the theory of planned behaviour and resource dependence theory to understand the main drivers of the firm's adoption of sustainability initiatives and the factors affecting the integration of CSR in maritime companies. According to our findings, the company operates within a strongly enforced regulatory environmental framework and needs to exceed this framework to differentiate its service and strengthen its relationships with its customers by addressing their social and environmental concerns. As the firm's competitive strategy focuses on service differentiation, a large pool of complementary resources is available for CSR and the implementation of sustainability practices. The results of this paper bring new insights to the potential of local private voluntary initiatives for the reduction of maritime air emissions. These include the provision of onshore power supply, the conversion of vessels to use methanol, ferry electrification, the construction of larger RoPax vessels and the implementation of an energy-saving program that focuses on crew involvement and continuous training. The environmental outcomes derived from a combination of local operational and technical energy efficiency measures are found to be significant and can contribute to the efforts for the achievement of sustainable maritime transport undertaken by international and regional organisations. The main barriers for the adoption of voluntary sustainability initiatives in the maritime sector are economic and technological. To encourage the wider adoption of these initiatives, the provision of economic incentives at national or regional level is crucial, as such initiatives usually imply high initial installation costs that should be somehow compensated for both vessels and terminals.

AB  - This paper discusses the chronology of the Jarrestad rock-art site in south-east Sweden. Drawing on recent developments in ship chronology, it argues that images were produced from the very beginning of the Scandinavian Bronze Age, c. 1700 BC, to the earliest Iron Age, c. 200 BC. The images are not randomly spread, however, but cluster in two phases: c. 1700-1100 BC and c. 900-200 BC, each with its different characteristics. It is argued that the later phase should be viewed against the background of central and western European Hallstatt cultures which affected not only the iconography of the Jarrestad panel but also the organization of the surrounding cultural landscape.

AB  - The moose Alces alces is the largest herbivore in the boreal forest biome, where it can have dramatic impacts on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Despite the importance of the boreal forest biome in global carbon cycling, the impacts of moose have only been studied in disparate regional exclosure experiments, leading to calls for common analyses across a biome-wide network of moose exclosures.In this study, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) to analyse forest canopy responses to moose across 100 paired exclosure-control experimental plots distributed across the boreal biome, including sites in the United States (Isle Royale), Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland), Norway, Sweden and Finland.We test the hypotheses that canopy height, vertical complexity and above-ground biomass (AGB) are all reduced by moose and that the impacts vary with moose density, productivity, temperature and pulse disturbances such as logging and insect outbreaks.We find a surprising convergence in forest canopy response to moose. Moose had negative impacts on canopy height, complexity and AGB as expected. The responses of canopy complexity and AGB were consistent across regions and did not vary along environmental gradients. The difference in canopy height between exclosures and open plots was on average 6 cm per year since the start of exclosure treatment (+/- 2.1 SD). This rate increased with temperature, but only when moose density was high.The difference in AGB between moose exclosures and open plots was 0.306 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (+/- 0.079). In browsed plots, stand AGB was 32% of that in the exclosures, a difference of 2.09 Mg ha(-1). The uniform response allows scaling of the estimate to a biome-wide impact of moose of the loss of 448 (+/- 115) Tg per year, or 224 Tg of carbon.Synthesis: Analysis of ALS data from distributed exclosure experiments identified a largely uniform response of forest canopies to moose across regions, facilitating scaling of moose impacts across the whole biome. This is an important step towards incorporating the effect of the largest boreal herbivore on the carbon cycling of one of the world's largest terrestrial biomes.

AB  - Catch-and-release (C&R) is a popular management tool that can support sustainable development of recreational fisheries, if anglers adopt scientifically informed "best practices." However, although the role of best practices is widely established in the academic literature, this knowledge is not always disseminated to anglers. In this paper, we investigated if and to what extent local management organizations provided best practice information to anglers. Based on a sample of 331 Swedish organizations, we reviewed the websites through which these organizations sold fishing licenses. Our review demonstrated widespread use of C&R as a management tool yet a general lack of best practice information. Among the small fraction of organizations that mentioned best practices, most mentioned only a single practice, with little consistency among practices that received attention. In addition, best practice information was particularly lacking for pike (Esox Lucius) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), which are by far the most landed and released species nationally. We discovered major knowledge deficiencies that provide insights about where and how to focus efforts for improving best practice information, in the context of local recreational fisheries management.

AB  - This article investigates to what extent spaces created in the language introduction programme (LIP) in Upper Secondary School in Sweden close or open up for students' varied linguistic resources, to create an understanding of the implementational spaces of the educational environments that the school represents, and of the ideological underpinnings that these imply. In the analysis, schoolscaping is used based on displayed language on the school premises in combination with language practices in classrooms. The material analyzed consists of photographs, both from classrooms and shared spaces, together with field notes from observations. The analysis made conflicting ideologies visible. Although students were invited to use their languages in classrooms, these were rarely made visible in written form, which is remarkable as written language is given great value in school. The relative invisibility of the LIP students' languages in the schoolscape, except for in their own classrooms, together with the physical separation from other students at the school, paints a picture of expectations of assimilation and of a monolingual ideology, where the goal is that students become Swedish-speaking. Thus, the conclusion is that there are implementational spaces in the partly closed space that constructs LIP, while ideological spaces are rather closed.

AB  - Congestion charging is widely considered an effective policy measure to regulate and reduce car traffic demand and associated environmental and health problems in cities. However, introducing restrictive measures to constrain individual choice and behaviour for the common good has often proven difficult. Using a specific case, the Gothenburg congestion tax introduced in 2013, we study the policy process behind the introduction of the tax and assess to what extent green values were compromised along the way. The tax was made possible by co-financing infrastructure investments, including roads, which seemingly contradicts stated goals of reducing car traffic and emissions. We show how the tax was 'muddled through' in a top-down political compromise by a grand coalition where different interests could legitimate their support in relation to the achievement of partially conflicting objectives and projects. However, to declare the regulatory goals fully neutralised would be to underestimate the scheme's direct environmental effects and restrictive potential. Finding a compromise with powerful political and economic interests was necessary to get it off the ground. Once launched, however, it can over time regain its restrictive properties and lead to more profound long-term effects.

AB  - We describe the soil microfungal communities in 30-year-old birch (Betula pendula Roth) stands planted either on former spruce forest soil (BS) or on former arable soil (BF) and compare these with the soil microfungal communities in spruce forests (S), arable fields (F) and old deciduous forests (D). Fungi were isolated from 0- to 3-crn and 3- to 6-cm samples collected in September 1997 and May 1998. Principal components analysis differentiated fungal communities in the S and BS sites from those in the other site types. The Morisita-Horn index of similarity indicated that fungal communities in the F and BF sites were less similar to those in the other site types. Fungal communities of the BS and S sites were more similar in the 3- to 6-cm layer than in the 0- to 3-cm layer, suggesting that it takes >30 years to replace the spruce litter and associated fungal community. Similarity between fungal communities in the F and BF sites was low, indicating significant changes in the fungal community composition following afforestation of field soil by birch. Fungal communities in the BS and BF sites were more similar to each other than those of their original site types. Fungal communities of the BS, BF and S sites were more similar to those of the D sites than those of the F sites were to the D sites. Differences between the fungal communities of the different site types were attributed primarily to litter quality, earthworm community, and secondarily to organic matter, pH, KCl-extractable NH4+, and PO43-.

AB  - This article presents a model to estimate the energy use and fuel consumption of cruise ships that sail Norwegian waters. Automatic identification system (AIS) data and technical information about cruise ships provided input to the model, including service speed, total power, and number of engines. The model was tested against real-world data obtained from a small cruise vessel and both a medium and large cruise ship. It is sensitive to speed and the corresponding engine load profile of the ship. A crucial determinate for total fuel consumption is also associated with hotel functions, which can make a large contribution to the overall energy use of cruise ships. Real-world data fits the model best when ship speed is 70-75% of service speed. With decreased or increased speed, the model tends to diverge from real-world observations. The model gives a proxy for calculation of fuel consumption associated with cruise ships that sail to Norwegian waters and can be used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions and to evaluate energy reduction strategies for cruise ships.

AB  - Background: Studies on allele length polymorphism designate several glacial refugia for Norway spruce (Picea abies) in the South Carpathian Mountains, but infer only limited expansion from these refugia after the last glaciation. To better understand the genetic dynamics of a South Carpathian spruce lineage, we compared ancient DNA from 10,700 and 11,000-year-old spruce pollen and macrofossils retrieved from Holocene lake sediment in the Retezat Mountains with DNA extracted from extant material from the same site. We used eight primer pairs that amplified short and variable regions of the spruce cpDNA. In addition, from the same lake sediment we obtained a 15,000-years-long pollen accumulation rate (PAR) record for spruce that helped us to infer changes in population size at this site.
   Results: We obtained successful amplifications for Norway spruce from 17 out of 462 pollen grains tested, while the macrofossil material provided 22 DNA sequences. Two fossil sequences were found to be unique to the ancient material. Population genetic statistics showed higher genetic diversity in the ancient individuals compared to the extant ones. Similarly, statistically significant Ks and Kst values showed a considerable level of differentiation between extant and ancient populations at the same loci.
   Lateglacial and Holocene PAR values suggested that population size of the ancient population was small, in the range of 1/10 or 1/5 of the extant population. PAR analysis also detected two periods of rapid population growths (from ca. 11,100 and 3900 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP)) and three bottlenecks (around 9180, 7200 and 2200 cal yr BP), likely triggered by climatic change and human impact.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the paternal lineages observed today in the Retezat Mountains persisted at this site at least since the early Holocene. Combination of the results from the genetic and the PAR analyses furthermore suggests that the higher level of genetic variation found in the ancient populations and the loss of ancient allele types detected in the extant individuals were likely due to the repeated bottlenecks during the Holocene; however our limited sample size did not allow us to exclude sampling effect.
   This study demonstrates how past population size changes inferred from PAR records can be efficiently used in combination with ancient DNA studies. The joint application of palaeoecological and population genetics analyses proved to be a powerful tool to understand the influence of past population demographic changes on the haplotype diversity and genetic composition of forest tree species.

AB  - Energy systems analyses are integrated elements in planning the transition towards renewable energy-based energy systems. This is due to a growing complexity arising from the wider exploitation of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) and an increasing reliance on sector integration as an enabler of temporal energy system integration, but it calls for consideration to the validity of modelling tools. This article synthesises EnergyPLAN applications through an analysis of its use both from a bibliometric and a case-geographical point of view and through a review of the evolution in the issues addressed and the results obtained using EnergyPLAN. This synthesis is provided with a view to addressing the validity and contribution of EnergyPLAN-based research. As of July 1st, 2022, EnergyPLAN has been applied in 315 peer-reviewed articles, and we see the very high application as an inferred internal validation. In addition, the review shows how the complexity of energy systems analyses has increased over time with early studies focusing on the role of wind power and the cogeneration of heat and power and later studies addressing contemporarily novel issues like the sector integration offered by using power-to-x in fully integrated renewable energy systems. Important findings developed through the application of EnergyPLAN includes the value of district heating in energy systems, the value of district heating for integration of VRES and more generally the importance of sector integration for resourceefficient renewable energy-based energy systems. The wide application across systems and development stages is interpreted as inferred validation through distributed stepwise replication.

AB  - This study demonstrates the importance of a hard mobile substratum (hermit crab shells) for Arctic biodiversity. Based on previous observations from other geographic regions we hypothesized that this niche at high latitudes would support a higher biodiversity of epifauna than might be predicted from similar substrata. We test whether the hermit crab epifauna is specific to that substratum providing unique biodiversity components to the local community. From four study sites in Isfjorden (78 degrees N), West Spitsbergen and two study sites in Northern Norway (69 degrees N) we collected approximately 50 each of hermit crabs, gastropods and pebbles, of visually similar surface area using SCUBA diving. Hermit crab shells were colonized by a larger number of epifaunal species than either gastropods or pebbles, even when they were of a larger size. Among 87 taxa found on all the three substrata, 22 occurred only on hermit crab shells. Except for two study sites hermit crab shells also supported more individuals. This study shows that the contribution of shells carried by hermit crabs to high-latitude, shallow-subtidal diversity is higher than might be predicted by their surface area alone and that hermit crabs modify, maintain and create a unique habitat. This is the result of a number of factors interacting positively on the presence of epifauna including shell surface heterogeneity and the complex influence of the crab host. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to examine job resources, work engagement and Finnish dairy farmers' preferences concerning methods to enhance overall well-being while working on farms.Methods: A postal survey yielded 265 completed questionnaires from 188 dairy farms. The sample was assessed as representative of Finnish dairy farmers. Exploratory factor analysis and a linear mixed model were utilized during the data analyzing process.Results: The variables lowering work engagement were stressors related to the workload and problems with health. Elevated work engagement was associated with the factors work with farm animals and family. The most important resource variables were child or children, own family, and animal health. Female dairy farmers considered resource variables related to the family, love, and work with cattle as significantly more important than male dairy farmers. Male dairy farmers experienced higher work engagement and, concerning the dimensions, especially higher dedication and absorption than male respondents in a reference sample of workers in difference occupations. A sustainable farm economy and the possibility to have a holiday period were the most important methods to improve overall well-being on dairy farms.Conclusion: The results indicate that the family, working with cattle, healthy farm animals, a reasonable workload, and a sustainable farm economy have the capacity to create positive impacts on well-being among dairy farmers. Well-being on farms is a part of sustainable food production.

AB  - The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis is the most important ectoparasite of farmed salmonids in the Northern hemisphere, having a major economic and ecological impact on the sustainability of this sector of the aquaculture industry. To a large extent, control of L. salmonis relies on the use of topical delousing chemical treatments in the form of baths. Improvements in methods for the administration and assessment of bath treatments have not kept pace with the rapid modernization and intensification of the salmon industry. Bath treatments present technical and biological challenges, including best practice methods for the estimation of the effect of lice treatment interventions. In this communication, we compare and contrast methods to calculate and interpret treatment effectiveness at pen and site level. The methods are illustrated for the calculation of the percentage reduction in mean abundance of mobile lice with a measure of confidence. Six different methods for the calculation of confidence intervals across different probability levels were compared. We found the quasi-Poisson method with a 90% confidence interval to be informative and robust for the measurement of bath treatment performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes a case of driving under the influence of the sedative-hypnotic-anticonvulsant drug chlormethiazole. The suspect, who was a physician, was driving dangerously on a busy highway and caused a traffic collision. When apprehended by the police, the man had bloodshot and glazed eyes and pupil size was enlarged. He could not answer the questions properly and his gait was unsteady. A roadside breath-alcohol screening test was positive but an evidential breath-alcohol test conducted about one hour later was below the legal limit for driving of 0.10 mg/L (10 mu g/100 mL or 0.021 g/210 L). Because of the special circumstances of the traffic crash and the man's appearance and behaviour, the police suspected that drugs other than alcohol were involved and obtained a venous blood sample for toxicological analysis. The blood contained 0.23 mg/g alcohol, which is above the legal limit for driving in Sweden 0.20 mg/g (20 mg/l 00 mL or 0.020 g/100 mL), and codeine was also present at a therapeutic concentration of 0.02 mg/L. The conflict between the clinical signs of impairment and the toxicology report prompted a reanalysis of the blood sample with major focus on sedative-hypnotic drugs. Analysis by capillary GC-NPD identified chlormethiazole at a concentration of 5 mg/L, the highest so far encountered in traffic cases in Sweden. In 13 other impaired driving cases over 10 years the mean (median) and range of concentrations of chlormethiazole were 1.6 mg/L (1.6 mg/L) and 0.3-3.3 mg/L. This case report underscores the need to consider clinical observations and the person's behaviour in relation to the toxicology report when interpreting and testifying in drug-impaired driving cases.

AB  - Common practices in current game management are wetland restoration and creation, as well as releases of quarry species. We studied the impact of releases of mallard ducklings on species richness of wild waterbirds and amphibians on three types of wetlands: natural, constructed and restored. Data on species richness, macrophyte cover and water characteristics (total phosphorous and pH) were collected at 32 sites in an agricultural landscape in southern Sweden. In total, 14 species of waterbirds were recorded, ranging from zero to seven per wetland and survey. Amphibians were present in 24 of the 32 wetlands; in total five species were found, ranging from zero to three per wetland. By using generalized linear modelling we found that wetland type best predicted waterbird species richness. Constructed wetlands had significantly more waterbird species, regardless of whether they were used for mallard releases or not. There were breeding amphibians in 62% of natural, 100% of restored and 77% of constructed wetlands. Breeding amphibians were present in 84% of wetlands without, and in 62% of wetlands with releases. However, included variables did not explain amphibian species richness in the wetlands. Releasing large numbers of mallards on a wetland and providing food ad libitum is likely to affect water quality, nutrient availability and predation pressure. Indeed, phosphorous levels were significantly higher in release wetlands, but no differences were found between wetland types.This means that mallard releases may increase nutrient loads in environments that are already eutrophied. However, in our study system releases did not influence species richness of waterbirds and amphibians locally. Constructing wetlands for mallard releases can thus have positive local effects on species richness.

AB  - This article aims to analyze the risk of waste-fires in Sweden, using the national data of fire anomalies (13,053 fire hotspots), remotely sensed by the NASA's VisibleInfrared-Imaging-Radiometer-Suite (VIIRS). Risk of fires was studied at 1,837 waste storage sites of eight different categories: (a) waste-collection (520); (b) pretreatment and sorting sites (194); (c) middle storage of waste (229); (d) recycling of electrical items (71); (e) other recycling activities (83); (f) combustion (348); (g) landfills (271) and (h) wood-related (121). In total, 143 waste-fires at 111 waste management sites, with fire radiative power (FRP) as high as 81 MW, were detected over a period of seven years 2012-18. Data shows that landfills and RCs are two major high-risk groups for instigation of secondary fires. It is concluded that risk of wastefires at all stages of waste management chain can be mitigated by controlling the challenges of structural over-capacities at the sites, functioning up-stream of waste management chain. Moreover, there is need to establish an increased number of property-close RCs to enhance quality of waste sorting. A novel technique for the analysis of risk of wastefires, using remote sensing and GIS modeling, is presented in this article. This technique can be extrapolated for other geographical settings for the assessment of risk of waste-fires.

AB  - The Energy Union' can be seen as the most significant policy idea that seeks to reform European energy governance, policy and regional cooperation. However, so far the concept is mostly an empty box in which every stakeholder tries to put whatever is on the top of their priority list. This article reviews three major theoretical approaches to the analysis of European integration and EU policy that can be used to study the ongoing process of Energy Union formation. It then tries to structure the discussion by showing the evolution of the Energy Union concept, focusing on proposals by D. Tusk, J-C. Juncker and the European Commission, followed by a comparative analysis of four country cases representing different energy mixes and energy policy directions: Germany, France, Poland and Norway. All of these proposals are described and assessed according to their emphasis on the three dimensions of energy policy: security, affordability and sustainability. We sketch two possible scenarios for the future of EU energy policy, as suggested by the intergovernmentalist and supranationalist approaches and emphasize the potential impact of the governance mechanism of the Energy Union, which could reach far beyond what is expected and provide welcome coherence in Europe's energy and climate policy.Policy relevanceThe article structures the policy debate on the Energy Union, discussing the different elements and instruments proposed by key EU actors and provides a useful overview of national interests of some important players, set in the context of their wider systemic conditions and policy goals. The framework for comparing the different proposals and national positions is built around the energy policy triangle'. The article concludes with a discussion of possible future scenarios, as well as an in-depth discussion of the potential role of the governance mechanism.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how a group of men relate to food celebrities in the contemporary Swedish food-media landscape, especially celebrity chefs on TV.
   Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 men in Sweden (22-88 years of age), with different backgrounds and with a variety of interest in food.
   Findings The paper demonstrates different ways in which the men relate to food celebrities. The men produce cultural distinctions of taste and symbolic boundaries, primarily related to gender and age, but also class. Through this, a specific position of just right emerged. This position is about aversion to excess, such as exaggerated gendered performances or pretentious forms of cooking. One individual plays a particularly central role in the stories: Actor and Celebrity Chef Per Morberg. He comes across as a complex cultural figure: a symbol of slobbish and tasteless cooking and a symbol of excess. At the same time, he is mentioned as the sole example of the exact opposite - as a celebrity chef who represents authenticity.
   Practical implications Scholars and policy makers must be careful of assuming culinary or social influence on consumers from food celebrities simply based on their media representations. As shown here and in similar studies, people relate to them and interpret their performances in a variety of ways.
   Originality/value This is one of the few studies that target the role of food celebrities in contemporary Western consumer culture from the point of view of the consumers rather than analyses of media representations.

AB  - The benefits of individual vessel quota (IVQ) management in terms of improved harvest strategy and profitability are well recognized, but there is less focus on how different components of a quota portfolio can influence decisions underlying the effort allocation and profit-maximizing behaviour of fishers. Variations in the components of the quota portfolio may create economic incentives that alter the optimal harvest strategy and profitability. Thus, we study the potential impact of different components of quota portfolio on the intra-annual harvest strategy and profitability in two segments of the Norwegian bottom trawl fleet. By developing a vessel-based spatio-temporal bioeconomic framework, we demonstrate and compare adopted harvest strategies and accrued profits for small and large trawl vessels under three scenarios regarding restrictive quotas in codfish fishery. Our analysis confirms that alternations in the components of the quota portfolio influence the spatio-temporal dynamics of the fishing effort for small and large trawl vessels in different ways, probably due to the differences in vessel-specific characteristics. We also demonstrate that the differences in profit between small and large vessels in part depend on the overall size of the quota portfolio. The economies of scale in the trawl industry are being eroded as the shares of higher-priced species in the quota portfolio decreases. The benefits of economies of scale cannot be reaped as trawlers respond to the reduction in profit by redirecting effort from offshore areas of the Arctic to nearshore waters or staying ashore. Likewise, having small quotas of high-priced species reduces the effectiveness of the IVQ system in meeting management objectives, and could in some cases undermine sustainability outcomes. Our results also demonstrate that both the intensity with which fishers react to the fluctuations in market price levels and fishers' perceptions of location attractiveness are influenced by the components of the quota portfolio.

LA  - English
AB  - In June 2009, the 5-year multi-national project EURANOS, funded by the European Commission in its 6th Framework Programme, reached its end, achieving most of the objectives addressed in the work programme. Partners from 23 European countries integrating 17 national emergency management organisations with 33 research institutes, aimed to enhance the preparedness for Europe's response to any radiation emergency and long term contamination. Three handbooks to assist national and local authorities in the management of contaminated food production systems, inhabited areas and contaminated drinking water resources in Europe were developed in conjunction with a wide range of European stakeholders. Further guidance was prepared to support the decision making team in the lifting of early phase countermeasures. A governance framework for the sustainable rehabilitation of long term contaminated territories was developed and tested in France and in Norway. Considerable progress was made in developing a consistent set of models for calculating the best estimate of the current radiological situation in both contaminated agricultural and inhabited areas. These models were integrated in both the ARGOS and the RODOS decision support systems. Decision aiding components were improved to support the selection of management options with the help of multi criteria decision analysis procedures. A mass consistent wind field model was implemented together with a particle model for complex terrain. The migration of RODOS (Real-time Online Decision Support System) to the operating system LINUX was completed. RODOS was completely re-engineered, taking into account the users' recommendations from the demonstration projects and feedback from its operational use. This new version will build the kernel for the operational RODOS release in 2010 and new research activities related to the future improvement of RODOS.

AB  - Standing timber volume in combination with the expected volume increment rates derived from volume functions are essential for developing sustainable forest management plans. Tree volume cannot be measured directly. It is derived from the diameter at breast height, tree height and a so-called form factor, which reduces the volume of a cylinder to the actual tree form. In this paper, we test four different types of form factor functions (Pollanchutz, Short Swedish, Meyer and F. Evert) for estimating total merchantable timber volume of nine commercial tree species in Bhutan: Abies densa, Picea spinulosa, Pinus wallichiana, Tsuga dumosa, Pinus roxburghii, Castanopsis tribuloides, Quercus glauca, Quercus lanata and Quercus lamellosa. The data for fitting the form factor functions come from 395 felled trees. The resulting functions are evaluated using independent validation data. Fitted statistics for evaluation include: root mean square error and mean absolute deviation. Although all form factor functions performed similarly, we suggest that the Pollanschutz function because of its consistency in the estimated form factors for all tree species. The evaluation of the calibrated form factor functions by species exhibited consistent and unbiased predictions.

AB  - The past decade's rapid expansion of a global market for organic food has set powerful economic and political forces in motion. The most important dividing line is whether organic food production should be an alternative to or a niche within a capitalist mode of production. To explore this conflict the article analyzes the formation of a market for eco-labeled milk in Sweden. The analysis draws on three aspects: the strategy of agri-business, the role of eco-labeling, and the importance of inter-organizational dynamics. Based on archival studies, daily press, and interviews, three processes are emphasized: the formative years of the alternative movement in the 1970s, the founding of an independent eco-label (KRAV) in the 1980s, and a discursive shift from alternative visions to organic branding in the early 1990s following the entry of agri-business.

AB  - Building practice in scale 1:1 as an educational tool has existed within Faculty of Architecture and Fine Art at the NTNU University for more than 15 years. This includes ten years of participation in Erasmus IP workshop "Tectonics in Building Culture". This way of learning to become an architect is growing fast and today it takes place both in Norway and around the world. Among these educational tools, we find different directions. One is cases where a location and the regional materials is generating a 1 : 1 construction with a minimum of planning on beforehand. Another is construction work based on already designed and planned project. Between these two practices, variations of educational tools are developed. The study is based on experienced knowledge leaning on theories from Plato (428-348 B.C.) and Aristoteles (384-322B.C.). This by a comparison between the two cases built in Norway: (1) a Protection Shed at the Erasmus IP workshop at 2007 at Hopsjo and (2) a Sauna at Vang in Valdres built during a master course in 2015 at the Faculty of Architecture and Fine Art at the NTNU. Based on the period between 2007 and 2015 the study will investigate the meaning of tectonic related to craftsmanship versus an experimenting approach, to industrial production versus the notion of local materials and to the question of sustainable development in a region in times of globalization.

AB  - Numerous European industries are heavily dependent on imported rare earth element (REE) raw materials. This has created a need for the European Union (EU) to ensure a sustainable supply of REE minerals, as well as develop from the ground up the currently non-existent European REE extraction and processing industry. In order to support this, the European Commission, through the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) scheme, funded the EURARE project which runs from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2017. Through the EURARE project, selected European REE deposits have been researched and in certain cases identified resources were successfully processed for REE production. Several REE deposits across Europe have been the focus of detailed geological field and laboratory work. Mineral concentrates obtained from the Norra Karr deposit in Sweden, the Kringlerne deposit in Greenland and the Kvanefjeld deposit in Greenland, Rodberg ore from Norway and bauxite residue from Greece were tested from laboratory to pilot scale by means of conventional and innovative metallurgical processing. The novel technologies developed provide efficiency and selectivity in various steps of the metallurgical processing, from ore beneficiation to metal production. A road map for sustainable REE production in Europe is now being developed, which includes an evaluation of the environmental benefits and risks of the EURARE technologies.

AB  - Environmental awareness and technological advances has spurred development of new monitoring solutions for the petroleum industry.
   This paper presents experience from a monitoring program off Norway. To maintain operation within the limits of the government regulations Statoil tested a new monitoring concept. Multisensory data were cabled to surface buoys and transmitted to land via wireless communication. The system collected information about distribution of the drilling wastes and the welfare of the corals in relation to threshold values.
   The project experienced a series of failures, but the backup monitoring provided information to fulfil the requirements of the permit. The experience demonstrated the need for real time monitoring and how such systems enhance understanding of impacts on marine organisms. Also, drilling operations may improve by taking environmental information into account. The paper proposes to standardize and streamline monitoring protocols to maintain comparability during all phases of the operation and between drill sites. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large-scale disturbances in forests are becoming more frequent due to a changing climate. Biotic disturbances can have cascading effects and therefore have a significant economic impact in forestry. It is therefore important to gain an understanding of the drivers of forest pest outbreaks in epidemic situations after large-scale disturbances and the implications for forest management. We investigated the influence of drivers on the bark beetle outbreaks following a large-scale ice storm in 2014 in Slovenia. A country-wide survey was done on the variables affecting ice storm damage to spruce trees. Additionally, the influence of the drivers of bark beetle attacks on outbreak intensity was assessed and compared under epidemic and endemic situations, and the effectiveness of forest management measures was assessed. Spruce trees were either uprooted or snapped, or the crown was lightly to severely damaged. The outbreaks under endemic situations were potentiated by the increasing amount of spruce and reduced by increasing slope. After the ice storm, the amount of sanitary felling because of outbreaks increased in areas with more steeper slopes, where the ice storm took place. An increase in the level of disturbance and a higher availability of dead and weakened trees positively affected bark beetle populations. The removal of dead trees alone in,the first year after the ice storm was found to be an insufficient measure for preventing bark beetle outbreaks. The ineffectiveness of current practices suggests that bark beetle management should be reconsidered with regard to large-scale disturbances. When defining measures against bark beetle outbreaks, drivers in epidemic situations should be prioritized over those that are important in endemic situations. The results imply that the known factors that affect bark beetle attacks are not necessarily the same as those that drive bark beetle attacks after extraordinary disturbance events. Mixed stands should be promoted in forests for sustainable management.

AB  - Temperature and egg viability data from an Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus hatchery covering a period of 28 years were analysed. During the study period, there was a significant increase in the mean water temperature in May, July, August and September of c. 2 degrees C. Independent of year, the egg viability showed a negative correlation with the mean monthly temperatures in July, August and September as well as with the temperature difference between October and November. The negative effect of high summer temperatures was further supported by a comparison of egg viability from replicate brood-stock reared at two sites differing mainly in summer water temperature. The eggs from the colder site were, on average, significantly larger (4.4 mm compared with 4.0 mm) and had higher hatching rates (57% compared with 37%). These results suggest that unfavourable temperature conditions during the summer and autumn can explain much of the excessive egg mortality experienced at the main facility used for the Swedish S. alpinus breeding programme. The main effect was supra-optimal temperatures during the period July to September, but there also appears to have been an effect from the temperature regime before and during spawning (October to November) that was unrelated to the summer temperatures. These findings emphasize the importance of site selection and sustainable management of aquaculture hatcheries in the light of the ongoing climate change.

AB  - Defensive chemicals produced by plants can travel up the food chain by being sequestered by herbivores, and then in turn being sequestered by their parasitoids. Insect species with wide host ranges are predicted to perform poorly in the face of specific chemical defence. However, a species at a high trophic level is expected to have a wide host range. This creates a conflict for hyperparasitoids, many of which depend on specialized hosts. We studied the performance of two hyperparasitoids, Lysibia nana and Gelis agilis, both of which have wide host ranges, on two host species, one chemically defended and the other not. We predicted that both hyperparasitoids would perform better using the undefended host Cotesia glomerata than the defended host C. melitaearum, which sequesters terpenoid allelochemicals (iridoid glycosides). Furthermore, we expected that the progeny of G. agilis collected from an area where hosts defended by iridoid glycosides are absent (the Netherlands) would perform poorly using C. melitaearum in comparison with G. agilis collected from an area where C. melitaearum is a common host (angstrom land, Finland). In a series of laboratory experiments we found that, contrary to prediction, both hyperparasitoids performed well on both hosts, reaching a larger size on C. glomerata, but having a higher conversion efficiency and developing more quickly on the chemically defended C. melitaearum. Lysibia nana metabolized the plant derived iridoid glycosides, which are chemicals that it does not normally encounter. Cells agilis retained some of the iridoid glycosides. But whereas Finnish G. agilis retained both aucubin and catalpol, Dutch G. agilis mainly retained aucubin, illustrating that though generalists, local populations still cope differently with toxic allelochemicals.

AB  - 1. Wildlife managers often rely on resource users, such as recreational or commercial hunters, to achieve management goals. The use of hunters to control wildlife populations is especially common for predators and ungulates, but managers cannot assume that hunters will always fill annual quotas set by the authorities. It has been advocated that resource management models should account for uncertainty in how harvest rules are realized, requiring that this implementation uncertainty be estimated. 2. We used a survival analysis framework and long-term harvest data from large carnivore management systems in three countries (Estonia, Latvia and Norway) involving four species (brown bear, grey wolf, Eurasian lynx and wolverine) to estimate the performance of hunters with respect to harvest goals set by managers. 3. Variation in hunter quota-filling performance was substantial, ranging from 40% for wolverine in Norway to nearly 100% for lynx in Latvia. Seasonal and regional variation was also high within countryspecies pairs. We detected a positive relationship between the instantaneous potential to fill a quota slot and the relative availability of the target species for both wolverine and lynx in Norway. 4. Survivor curves and hazards with survival time measured as the time from the start of a season until a quota slot is filled can indicate the extent to which managers can influence harvest through adjustments of season duration and quota limits. 5. Synthesis and applications. We investigated seven systems where authorities use recreational hunting to manage large carnivore populations. The variation and magnitude of deviation from harvest goals was substantial, underlining the need to incorporate implementation uncertainty into resource management models and decisions-making. We illustrate how survival analysis can be used by managers to estimate the performance of resource users with respect to achieving harvest goals set by managers. The findings in this study come at an opportune time given the growing popularity of management strategy evaluation (MSE) models in fisheries and a push towards incorporating MSE into terrestrial harvest management.

AB  - This paper discusses the value creation process of sustainable public transport and tries to develop the debate concerning the question value for whom in the context of public transport. The empirical foundations are collected in two case studies of Swedish Public Transportation Authorities (PTA) and a public transport hydrogen bus project of Hamburg in Germany. Our arguments follow the service centred logic (Vargo and Lusch, 2004) which is a dynamic and flexible approach. Instead of talking about the dichotomy of common good and customer value we talk about creating stakeholder value from a stakeholder view which also includes the business ethic question, value for whom? Triple Bottom Line (TBL) issues (Environment, Society, and Economy) (Elkington, 1998) is better understood having a more holistic, open and integrative lens. We will see transportation and the environment, economy, society and safety as part of the value creating processes for creating a sustainable public transport.

AB  - How cities can become more conducive to sustainable travel patterns is a pressing matter in urban research. In the built environment-travel literature, several features potentially promoting sustainable mobility remain under-researched. One concerns the precise role of local accessibility - in terms of the number, variety and specific types of amenities - in promoting the slow modes of walking and cycling and in reducing car use. Another is the possibility that the standard assumption of a linear relationship between density and (un)sustainable travel is flawed. To fill these gaps, we explore specific local amenity supply types that stimulate a large share of residents to walk or cycle, avoiding long drives, to accomplish their daily activities. In a case study of the Vastra Gotaland region in Sweden, we analyse a combination of high-quality micro data from registers and the national travel survey using a stepwise statistical approach. We find evidence of non-linear discontinuities and significant geographical variation in how local accessibility affects travel behaviour. While more neighbourhood amenities contribute to more walking/cycling, the effect of establishing additional amenities varies amongst neighbourhood types and travel variables. Local everyday services, for example, grocery stores and preschools, are critical in triggering change. The findings inform urban planning by showing how a basic supply of essential amenities could contribute to better prerequisites for walking or cycling and reduced car dependence by inducing residents to choose local options.

AB  - Forest biomass plays an important role in the production of renewable energy, particularly in northern Europe. During recent decades, tree stumps have also been increasingly used for energy production. The environmental impacts of stump removal on the functioning of forest ecosystems, for example on soil processes and biodiversity, are still inadequately understood. To investigate the separate impacts of tree stump and logging residue removal on soil and plant variables, we conducted a large-scale replicated experiment in clear-felled stands in three geographical areas. Four energy wood harvesting levels were combined with patch mounding (organic and mineral soil layer turned upside down) as a site preparation method. The harvesting treatments were: (1) no energy wood harvesting, (2) 70% logging residue removal, (3) 25 stumps per hectare left at site and 70% logging residue removal (maximum level in official recommendations), (4) complete stump and 100% logging residue removal. Soil disturbance in terms of mineral and organic soil cover increased with the increasing harvesting level, but complete stump removal did not increase the mineral soil cover more than partial stump removal (on average 95% removed). Despite the increase in soil disturbance, stump removal did not have an overall impact on plant species richness or vegetation composition in the second growing season after harvesting. However, an increasing trend in Betula spp. biomass with increasing harvesting intensity was seen in two of three study areas in four years. Our results underscored the high site-dependency of the effects of stump removal on ecological variables, thus the initial stand structure and vegetation type need to be considered when planning harvesting treatments.

AB  - The vulnerability of the built environment will be influenced by global-scale climate change. However, there are large uncertainties associated with the future performance of buildings due: to changes in regional- and local-scale climatic impact. The use of modern risk-management theories is discussed for developing cross-disciplinary strategies to meet the challenges of future climate change. It is shown that there are benefits to be gained from the introduction of risk-management strategies within a greater extent of the construction industry. Cross-disciplinary risk-based management strategies (ensuring cooperation along vertical decision-making lines), together with design guidelines that account for both historical local climatic conditions and scenarios for future changes, can be an important step towards a more active and dynamic way of ensuring a high-quality construction process and a sustainable built environment. Reducing the potential for defects or damage through the development of technical and organizational preventive measures (a risk-based management strategy) while at the same time applying the precautionary principle and discursive strategies in the design, construction and geographical localization of buildings, is likely to increase the robustness of the built environment in the light of the unknown risks of future climate change.

AB  - In a warming climate, permafrost is likely to be significantly reduced and eventually disappear from the sub-Arctic region. This will affect people at a range of scales, from locally by slumping of buildings and roads to globally as melting of permafrost will most likely increase the emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane, which will further enhance global warming. In order to predict future changes in permafrost, it is crucial to understand what determines the presence or absence of permafrost under current climate conditions, to assess where permafrost is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and to identify where changes are already occurring. The Tornetrask region of northern sub-Arctic Sweden is one area where changes in permafrost have been recorded and where permafrost could be particularly vulnerable to any future climate changes. This paper therefore reviews the various physical, biological, and anthropogenic parameters that determine the presence or absence of permafrost in the Tornetrask region under current climate conditions, so that we can gain an understanding of its current vulnerability and potential future responses to climate change. A patchy permafrost distribution as found in the Tornetrask region is not random, but a consequence of site-specific factors that control the microclimate and hence the surface and subsurface temperature. It is also a product of past as well as current processes. In sub-Arctic areas such as northern Sweden, it is mainly the physical parameters, e.g., topography, soil type, and climate (in particular snow depth), that determine permafrost distribution. Even though humans have been present in the study area for centuries, their impacts on permafrost distribution can more or less be neglected at the catchment level. Because ongoing climate warming is projected to continue and lead to an increased snow cover, the permafrost in the region will most likely disappear within decades, at least at lower elevations.

AB  - Question
   Can we reliably estimate grazing intensity, indicators of grazing intensity (i.e. field-layer height and shrub-cover), and vascular plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands from high spatial resolution satellite data?
   Location
   The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden).
   Methods
   Fieldwork included the on-site description of grazed and ungrazed areas and shrub-cover within 107 semi-natural grassland sites. Field-layer height and vascular plant species richness (total within-site and mean small-scale species richness) were recorded within the sites. Digital classification of QuickBird data was performed to identify grazed and ungrazed areas and shrub-cover. Vegetation indices were generated to analyze the performance of satellite data for estimating field-layer height, and the spectral heterogeneity was used to characterize the within-site environmental heterogeneity.
   Results
   The proportion of digitally classified grazed area explained 45% of the variation in field-layer height and 43% of the variation in shrub-cover. Field-layer height was significantly related to vegetation indices. A linear model with three explanatory variables (spectral richness(red), spectral richness(NIR), and shrub-cover) explained 47% of the variation in total within-site species richness.
   Conclusions
   High spatial resolution imagery may assist in the monitoring of the processes that follow the cessation of grazing, on the scale of individual grassland sites. Measures of spectral heterogeneity acquired by high spatial resolution imagery can be used in the assessment of total within-site vascular plant species richness in semi-natural grassland vegetation.

AB  - Increasing the amount of dead wood in managed forests is one of the prerequisites for the successful preservation of various organisms. Dead wood and its associated fungi with it provide resources for many insects. Various methods have been used to artificially enhance the quantity of dead wood in managed forests. Creation of high stumps in connection with the final logging of the stand and leaving living trees, especially deciduous trees, are two frequently used methods. Most of these stumps are made from spruce attacked by root rot fungi. Another method is to save reasonable amounts of wind-filled trees. There is, however, a conflict between saving wind-felled trees and the recommendations concerning protection against the damage caused by bark beetles. The result of an increasing interest in utilising windfalls as firewood is a reduction in the amounts of this type of dead wood. One of the intentions of the Swedish National Board of Forestry is to increase the amount of dead wood by 50 percent during this decade. How this can best be accomplished is discussed in this paper. One path for future research concerning insects and dead wood in managed forests would be to investigate the number of insect species using the stumps of different tree species saved on logged areas. Such studies must extend over several decades. Because many species are dependent on various fungi associated with dead wood it would be desirable to study insect communities associated with the species of fungi not yet investigated. Many insects seem to be dependent on slow-growing trees, a substrate that disappears quickly in the managed forest For several reasons. We therefore need more research on these species.

AB  - Controversies over the return of large carnivores (e.g. wolves) are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural communities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modernization increases their diversity. However, the popular image is one of rural communities united against vermin and urban romantics. An important reason for this is probably the successful construction of the anti-carnivore front as a last line of defence against destructive forces threatening rural life. Drawing on examples from a study in circle dividesterdalen, Norway, the struggle against wolf protection is discussed as an instance of symbolic construction of community Images of a threatened community are vital to the self-understanding of the wolf adversaries, but cleavages run through the alliance. Three principal groups may be identified: sheep farmers, landowners who lease hunting, and people with strong ties to traditional land use practices (primarily hunting) and a rural working-class culture. These groups have not always been allies, and conflicts of interest run through the 'resistance front. The task here is to identify the social forces that now bring them together, and to explain why the carnivore issue is well suited as a significant component in their symbolic construction of community.

AB  - The first aim of the study was to present the methodology applied by the model WOody biomass and Carbon ASsessment to compute the past potentially available residues (RA; branches and tops only; t center dot yr(-1) of dry matter, DM), potentially generated heat and electricity (TE, EE, respectively; GJ center dot yr(-1)) and potentially avoided CO2 emissions into the atmosphere (EM; t center dot yr(-1) CO2) for the final combustion process. The available residues are computed at the forest stand level through a recovery rate based on six technical parameters. The methodology was applied to the public stands of Valle Camonica district (Italy) (total area: 3.67 center dot 10(4) ha; period: 1984-2016). The mass of residues calculated for that period was used to estimate the current supply, i.e. 2.15 center dot 10(3) +/- 6.04 center dot 10(2) t center dot yr(-1) DM. By assuming that this mass was used in an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) unit of a local centralized heating plant, TE = 2.06 center dot 10(4) divided by 2.41 center dot 10(4) GJ center dot yr(-1) and EE = 5.08 center dot 10(3) divided by 5.95 center dot 10(3) GJ center dot yr(-1). By assuming that: (i) heat generated by the ORC replaced heat produced by conventional natural gas-based plants; (ii) electricity generated by the ORC replaced electricity generated by Italian natural gas-based plants-mix (combined heat and electricity production) EM = 1.85 center dot 10(3) divided by 2.17 center dot 10(3) t center dot yr(-1) CO2.

AB  - To adapt to climate change, forest managers request information on management options for obtaining environmental, societal and economic goals. In this study, we assess the potential of adaptive forest management to influence the productivity and storm sensitivity of nemoral and boreal forest. The forest growth across Sweden over the 21st century was simulated by the ecosystem model LPJ-GUESS, comparing four management options: 1) default forest management, 2) shorter rotation period 3) increased fraction of broadleaved trees and 4) continuous cover forestry. The simulations indicated that a management strategy implemented by a majority of forest owners can have a large-scale effect on the standing volume and risk taking. The modelled risk of storm damage, expressed as the combined effect of tree properties, ground frost and wind load, was higher in the southern than in the northern part of the country due to latitudinal variations in all three components. We conclude that whereas the probability of a significant volume loss increase with the age of a forest, the calculated economic loss can be as high in young and mid-age forest stands. To reduce the risk of storm damage and fulfil a variety of management goals, a portfolio of adaptation strategies is needed. It should include active measures such as tree-species mixtures to spread the risks and shorter rotation periods of highly exposed stands, as well as reactive measures such as salvage and sanitary cutting to reduce the risk of subsequent spruce bark beetle outbreaks.

AB  - The high Arctic is considered a pristine environment compared with many other regions in the northern hemisphere. It is becoming increasingly vulnerable to invasion by invasive alien species (IAS), however, as climate change leads to rapid loss of sea ice, changes in ocean temperature and salinity, and enhanced human activities. These changes are likely to increase the incidence of arrival and the potential for establishment of IAS in the region. To predict the impact of IAS, a group of experts in taxonomy, invasion biology and Arctic ecology carried out a horizon scanning exercise using the Svalbard archipelago as a case study, to identify the species that present the highest risk to biodiversity, human health and the economy within the next 10 years. A total of 114 species, currently absent from Svalbard, recorded once and/or identified only from environmental DNA samples, were initially identified as relevant for review. Seven species were found to present a high invasion risk and to potentially cause a significant negative impact on biodiversity and five species had the potential to have an economic impact on Svalbard. Decapod crabs, ascidians and barnacles dominated the list of highest risk marine IAS. Potential pathways of invasion were also researched, the most common were found associated with vessel traffic. We recommend (i) use of this approach as a key tool within the application of biosecurity measures in the wider high Arctic, (ii) the addition of this tool to early warning systems for strengthening existing surveillance measures; and (iii) that this approach is used to identify high-risk terrestrial and freshwater IAS to understand the overall threat facing the high Arctic. Without the application of biosecurity measures, including horizon scanning, there is a greater risk that marine IAS invasions will increase, leading to unforeseen changes in the environment and economy of the high Arctic.

AB  - Background: Distributed Research Infrastructures are gaining political traction in Europe to facilitate scientific research. This development has gained particular momentum in the area of biobanking where cross-national attempts have been made toward harmonizing the biobanking standards across the European Union through the establishment of the organization BBMRI (BioBanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure). BBMRI exists as separate national nodes across several European countries, although Sweden took on a pioneering role in its early stages. Thus, the Swedish node, BBMRI.se, was set up in 2009. Purpose: To document publications addressing the current debate on large-scale distributed medical and/or biobank Research Infrastructures and identify the most pressing issues discussed by these articles through a narrative review. Methods: The Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed databases were searched to find prior studies of large-scale medical Research Infrastructures, with no limits set with regard to study design and/or time period. All identified articles published up until March 2016 were included in the initial review. Results: A total of 145 articles were retrieved from WOS and PubMed, though merely 17 ultimately made it past the final exclusion criteria. About two-thirds of the articles listed a first author affiliated to a European country. The articles most commonly discussed the need for developing and expanding the use of infrastructures. Practical implications: The future of scientific research will call for a deeper and more widespread multidisciplinary collaboration. This will emphasize the need of research seeking to optimize the preconditions of securing sustainable scientific collaboration. Future investigators will thus need to understand the components and mechanisms of Research Infrastructures in addition to acquiring knowledge of how to build, manage, brand, and promote them as well.

AB  - In order to determine the metal-bearing phases with special emphasis on Cu, a sequential extraction has been carried out on seven soil samples from a sulphide-bearing spodosol profile in Liikavaara Ostra, close to the Aitik Copper Mine in northern Sweden. A reference spodosol profile with very low abundances of sulphides located far from anthropogenic emissions was also studied. Five fractions were selected for the extraction: (1) CH3COONa-extractable (exchangeable/adsorbed/carbonate); (II) Na4P2O7-extractable (labile organics); (III) 0.25 M (NH2OHHCl)-H-.-extractable (amorphous Fe oxyhydroxides/Mn oxides); (IV) 1 M (NH2OHHCl)-H-.-extractable (crystalline Fe oxides); and (V) KClO3/HCl-extractable (organics and sulphides). The distribution of trace elements (Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the profile in Liikavaara Ostra is different from that in the reference profile. Possible explanations for these differences are (i) the presence of sulphides in the soil, (ii) atmospheric deposition of dust derived from mining activities at the Aitik Copper Mine, and (iii) mineralogical heterogeneities inherited from the deposition of the till. There is no straightforward correlation between the amount of the extracted phases and the metal extractability in the soils. This fact indicates that other factors are important for the retention of trace metals as well. The data presented in this study suggest that Co, Cr and Ni, to a fairly large extent, are associated with the organic matter in the B-horizon in both profiles, while in the C-horizon in Liikavaara Ostra, sulphides are probably the more important carriers of these elements. For Co and Ni, Fe oxyhydroxides seem to be important. Most of the Cr occurred in the residual remaining after the leaching procedure. Copper and Zn seem to be associated with the organic matter to some extent in the B-horizon. The concentration of Cu in the C-horizon in Liikavaara Ostra is high (2310 ppm), but only a very small fraction is likely to be hosted by sulphides. It is concluded that the major part of Cu in the C-horizon and a prominent fraction in the B-horizon in Liikavaara Ostra are associated with some secondary phase that is extractable during extractions III and IV. Possible candidates for this phase are goethite and inclusions of native Cu in weathered biotite. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Population models that assume logistic growth and a constant flux of recruits predict the recovery of depleted stock once a moratorium on capture is imposed. Despite long-term closure or strict regulation, many fisheries hardly show any recovery after the stocks have been brought to low levels, which suggest that other mechanisms may be responsible for such behavior. Here we show, using a coupled stock-recruitment - age-structured model that the increasing fishing mortality on the North Sea cod (Gadus morhua) has pushed the cod population into the region where depensatory dynamics prevails. The declining trend of the North Sea cod population, which had reached its lowest historical level in the last decade, has recently been showing improvement. We show that the future sustainability of the cod population depends highly on the change in fishing mortality within the next few years. We found a fishing mortality limit of 0.86, consistent with the ICES estimates, beyond which stock extirpation is assured. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem structure and stability is challenging, espe-cially in high latitude regions that are predicted to experience the largest increases in ambient temperature. Global warming is likely to be a key driver of ecosystem change in freshwater lakes. Increased temperature can positively or negatively affect lake community composition through the loss of cold adapted taxa and the arrival of temperate or eurytopic taxa. Here, we analyse the likely effects of temperature-induced changes in taxonomic richness and compositional turnover of environmentally sensitive chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) across three regions northern North America, Norway, and Russia using existing datasets. Structural parameters (beta diversity, compositional disorder, and network skewness) were applied to model-simulated and empirical chironomid datasets across a large spatial temperature gradient. The analyses of empirical datasets showed changes in community structure across temperature gradients, suggesting varying states of ecosystem stability or instability. The comparison with null models enabled assessment as to whether these stresses agreed with expected patterns due to covarying summer temperature conditions or whether they deviated from expectations suggesting additional stress on the ecosystems. For all three regions, lakes in the mid-temperature range showed most evidence of relative ecosystem stability, with greater beta diversity, compositional disorder, and skewness, unanticipated by the modelled simulations. This is most likely due to more diverse habitats across the ecotone boundaries and additional factors that can influence ecosystem structures. Thus, we show that structural changes typical for ecosystem stability can be detected through changes in community structure across temperature gradients. This is important for understanding how lakes may change under current and future climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nature contacts are recognized as positively contributing to humans' health and well-being. Although there have been projects to green daycare or schoolyards, yard greening and microbial biodiversity have never been studied simultaneously. We asked whether simultaneously increasing biodiversity exposure and greening urban daycare yards affects 3-5 years-old children's physical activity and play, their environmental relationships, and their perceived well-being. For transforming six daycare yards in Finland, we used a forest floor with high biodiversity, sod, peat blocks, and planters for vegetable and flower growing. We used qualitative interview and survey-based data collected from the daycare personnel and parents to analyze how green yards encourage children's engagement with their everyday life-worlds. We identified the functional possibilities provided by the yards and the dynamic aspects related to the greening. Green, biodiverse yards were considered safe, and inspired children's play, diversified their activities, and increased physical activity. The greenery offered embodied experiences of nature and provided the children with multi-sensory exploration and diverse learning situations. The dynamic and emotional ways of engaging with the natural environment increased their well-being. The activities related to caring for the yards and exploring them promoted the development of environmental relationships. The results can be used for designing health-enhancing yards

AB  - Geotourism can be defined as visits to locations that fall within the "geoheritage" category, whether natural or man-made. This underscores all the definitions of this phenomenon in the literature. The notions of the role and agency of typical geotourist motivations are much discussed in the definition of geotourism (i.e., cognitive orientation aimed at acquiring or expanding knowledge of geoscience, the history of Earth and geomorphological processes, and the like). Among the conceptual approaches in the field are those that emphasize more the final cognitive results of travel to geosites (in the form of the acquisition of knowledge on geoheritage by tourists) than the potential initial geotourist motivations of tourists. This article considers the picturesque esthetic of a landscape as the sole, main, or an important pull factor for geotourism and even whether this esthetic is necessary to transform a geosite into a tourist attraction. The picturesqueness of a landscape has varying importance for different categories of geotourists, from "unaware geotourists" to "geoexperts." The iconic role of geotourist landscapes is illustrated by the Cretaceous landscape of the north-coast cliffs of Rugen (Germany), the rauks of Gotland and Faro (Sweden), and the Trotternish Ridge with the Old Man of Storr on the Isle of Skye (Scotland).

AB  - A major fraction of fine particle matter consists of organic carbon (OC) but its origin is still inadequately known. In this study the sources of OC were investigated in the northern European urban environment in Helsinki, Finland. Measurements were carried out over one year and they included both filter (PM1) and online methods. From the filter samples OC, elemental carbon (EC), water-soluble OC (WSOC), levoglucosan and major ions were analyzed. Filter data together with the concentrations of inorganic gases were analyzed by Positive matrix factorization (PMF) in order to find the sources of OC (and WSOC) on an annual as well as on a seasonal basis. In order to study the diurnal variation of sources, OC and EC were measured by a semicontinuous OC/EC analyzer and major ions were determined by a Particle-into-Liquid Sampler coupled to ion chromatographs. According to PMF, OC concentrations were impacted by four sources: biomass combustion, traffic, long-range transport and secondary production. On an annual basis the OC concentration was dominated by secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Its contribution to OC was as high as 64% in summer, which besides anthropogenic sources may also result from the large biogenic volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions in the boreal region. In winter biomass combustion constituted the largest fraction in OC due to domestic wood combustion for heating purposes. Traffic contributed to OC from 15 to 27%. Regarding the diurnal variation, the contribution from traffic was higher from 08:00 to 18:00 on weekdays than on weekends. The contribution from long-range transport to OC was 24% on average. All four sources also influenced the WSOC concentrations, however, the contribution of SOA was significantly larger for WSOC than OC.

AB  - The demand for mineral resources is increasing mining activities worldwide. In Norway, marine tailing disposal (MTD) is practiced, introducing mineral particles into fjord ecosystems. We investigated the effects of two concentrations (high and low) of fine tailings from a CaCO3 processing plant on early life stages of the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus. Results show that the exposure did not significantly impact hatching success or development in non- and early feeding life stages. However, feeding stage nauplii ingested tailings, which caused a significantly slower development in later nauplii stages in high exposure groups, with most individuals being two stages behind the control group. Further, high mortality occurred in late nauplii and early copepodite stages in low exposure groups, which could be caused by insufficient energy accumulation and depleted energy reserves during development. Individuals exposed to high exposure concentrations seemed to survive by arresting development and potentially by reduced activity, thereby conserving energy reserves. In nature, slower development could affect lipid storage buildup and reproduction.

AB  - Understanding the effects of major hydrogeological controls on hyporheic exchange and bank storage is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water-groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2-D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river-aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity < 0.001 m d(-1) significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio was positively related to wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. Discharge oscillations with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations. Based on these results, river regulation strategies can be improved by considering the effect of certain wave event configurations on hyporheic exchange to ensure harmonious hydrogeochemical functioning of the river-aquifer interfaces and related ecosystems.

AB  - Poaching may threaten population viability and can occur in both non-harvested and legally harvested populations. Telemetry facilitates the determination of the fates of individual animals, and the resultant mortality scenarios can be used to evaluate the role of poaching in population changes. Finland's legally hunted wolf (Canis lupus) population fluctuated between 100 and 300 animals during 1998-2016, and this cannot be explained by the rates of legal hunting and other known mortalities alone. We examined the role of poaching in wolf population changes. We created different scenarios based on multi-source information on poaching among 130 collared wolves. Poaching has been the primary cause of death followed by legal hunting. We calculated the survival rate and cause-specific mortality risk; wolves whose fates were unknown were censored. As one of the event alternatives (unknown fate or known mortality cause), censoring was related to social status; breeding adults were more often poached, whereas dispersers were censored. We created two sets of scenarios based on the censoring procedure (random and non-random), and for both sets, we created 4 scenarios ranging from high to no poaching based on decreasing confidence in the data. Annual survival ranged from 0.11-0.24 (high poaching scenario) to 0.43-0.60 (no poaching); survival dropped in mid-winter. The poaching rate varied between years from less than 0.09-0.13 up to 0.31-0.43. We consider poaching to be a regulatory factor; it focused on breeding adults and seemed to escalate as a response to increased population size. We conclude that tolerance for carnivores cannot be promoted by legal hunting alone, so more comprehensive conservation efforts are needed.

   Top predators are increasingly recognized as important regulators of ecosystem structure. Elmhagen et al. in this issue show how a recolonizing population of lynx in Finland is in the process of imposing control of the abundance of a mesopredator, the red fox and relaxing predation pressure on a prey species. Their study shows how ecological restoration programs could use the power of top predators to limit mesopredator populations and control total predation pressure on prey species.

AB  - In September 2010, an exceptionally large cooking-pit site was discovered by means of geophysical prospection at Lunde in Vestfold County, Norway. The site contains in excess of 1000 cooking-pits and is, to date, one of the largest of its kind discovered in Scandinavia. Features known as cooking-pits are ubiquitous on Northern European archaeological sites. Despite research spanning decades, however, the true function and role of this rather non-descript feature type is still debated. Using the results from geophysical prospection, soil analysis, ground-truthing and excavation, this article aims to better understand this phenomenon by evaluating the physical properties revealed from the data, and setting this exceptional site in a wider cultural-historical context. The wider, landscape context is accessible from the large-scale, high-resolution, landscape archaeological prospection case-study approach conducted by Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology (LBI ArchPro). The results suggest that the multi-method approach is essential in such cases, as it is able to challenge the assumptions of the blanket interpretations often applied, and put the site in a cultural and environmental context.

AB  - Cultural heritage, which emerges in the flow of social life and includes the reflections of the collective memory/action which is shaped/transformed within the process, reflects the civilization, beliefs and cultures of people living in the past. Architectural elements of tangible cultural heritage appear as temporary/permanent spaces of intangible cultural heritage. The safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage is as important as the protection of tangible cultural heritage. In this context, the evaluation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage elements together with a holistic approach will increase the awareness of the 'values and the unity of values' and will guide the conservation efforts to be made. In this study, bridges from tangible cultural heritage elements were selected; the value in the unity of tangible and intangible cultural heritage is focused through Dicle (Ten Eyed) Bridge, which is one of the important works in Turkey, and the rituals that continue to be performed on the bridge. As the method of the study, literature review in local and foreign oral and written sources, documentation and photography with on-site observation method was determined. Thus, a theoretical infrastructure was created for the coexistence of tangible and intangible cultural heritage, based on the samples in countries in different continents of the world and in Turkey. Within the scope of the study, Mostar Bridge in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Khaju Bridge in Iran; Charles Bridge in the Czech Republic; London Bridge in the United Kingdom; Rialto and Vecchio Bridges in Italy; Love Bridges in France, Italy, Germany and Finland; and Irgandi and Gelin Bridge in Turkey, where rituals are kept alive effectively in the world, were explained. The strong rituals which have been kept alive on these structures from the past to the present are the subject of the study. In this study, the centuries-old swallow dives from Mostar Bridge; the sounds of the songs rising from the bridge used as a dam in Isfahan; wishes made by touching the statues in Prague; high state officials participating in the parade of sheep and little children dressed in lamb costumes in London; architectural configurations of arasta, which is home to craftsmen in Venice, Florence; the authentic rituals on which padlocks are hung and keys are thrown from love bridges to rivers in Paris, Rome, Cologne and Helsinki; and on which the newlyweds throw stones into the river, which is the subject of a folk song named 'Kopruden Gecti Gelin' in Samsun were described. Dicle (Ten Eyed) Bridge, in Turkey, is located just outside Surici region, the first settlement area of Diyarbakir, on the foothills of the Kirklar Mountain which is the subject of legends, located three kilometers south of the Mardin Gate one of the four gates of the city and connects the two banks of Dicle River. Within the scope of the study, the aspects of intangible cultural heritage lived on Dicle Bridge as tangible cultural heritage elements; the role of the bridge in recording traditions, beliefs, cultures, rituals and expressions, social memory, habits and transmitting them to future generations have been provided. Visitors make wishes by throwing papers from the bridge on holy and special days, they play local folk dances (halay) with drums and shrill pipe (zurna) on the bridge, the bridge and its surroundings are used in photography on special days in four seasons, they watch the scenery from the bridge and the sitting areas around the bridge, they go fishing and keep the rituals alive for centuries.
   The aim of this study is to investigate the contribution of the intangible cultural heritage to the cultural heritage by the more effective using of Diyarbakir historical Dicle Bridge, was closed to traffic after the restoration works and turned into a recreation area for the people of the city and opened to the visit of local people and tourists. It is thought that defining the value added by tangible and intangible elements reflecting this unity and transferring it to future generations will be effective in directing the studies on conservation and social projects and enriching tourism activities.

AB  - A sustainable building sector with a more energy-efficient and decarbonized building stock is important for mitigating climate change. This paper contributes to knowledge on how to increase energy efficiency investments by presenting a nationwide survey on the perception of barriers and drivers for energy efficiency among 216 professionals in the Swedish building sector. This study explores economic, behavioral, and organizational conditions and analyzes the conventional dependencies on (1) type of ownership and (2) size of the organization, but also adds analysis on (3) degree of urbanization, (4) climate zones and (5) profession. Together these dependencies enhance a custom design of policies and measures. The findings show that hidden costs and bounded rationality were prominent barriers due to problems to acquire and analyze information, which needs to be addressed. In addition to the economic driver to reduce cost, several behavioral and organizational drivers were emphasized. There were distinct economic differences depending on the type of ownership and size of the organizations. Well-developed organizational structures were important factors for energy efficiency, which policies and measures should address. Differences were seen between organizations operating in rural areas and more densely populated areas. An improved indoor climate was important in northern climate zones.

AB  - This study explores features of food system transformations towards sustainability in the Farm to Fork Strategy in relation to perspectives of Swedish food system practitioners. Transformations towards sustainable food systems are essential to achieve the United Nations' 2030 Agenda and the need for more sustainable food systems has been recognised in the European Green Deal and its Farm to Fork Strategy. The Swedish ambition to act as a global leader in achieving the 2030 Agenda and the European Commission's aspiration for Europe to lead global food system transformations offer a critical opportunity to study transformational processes and agents of change in a high-income region with externalised environmental and sustainability impacts. Drawing on theories of complex systems transformations, this study identifies features of food system transformations, exploring places to intervene and examines the roles, responsibilities, and agency related to these changes. The results of this study provide three main conclusions highlighting (i) alignment of high-level policy and the perspectives of national practitioners at the paradigm level, especially concerning how food is valued, which is a crucial first step for transformational processes to come about (ii) a lack of clarity as well as diversity of pathways to transform food systems although common objectives are expressed, and (iii) governance mechanisms as enablers for a diversity of transformations. Moreover, these processes must acknowledge the contextual and complex nature of food systems and the level of agency and power of actors.

AB  - The mining industry generates a notable amount of mine tailings (MTs). Disposal of MTs creates environmental impacts such as air pollution and the release of heavy metals into surface and underground water. The European Union (EU)-funded project "Integrated mineral technologies for more sustainable raw material supply" (ITERAMS) includes an effort to produce eco-friendly backfill materials to enhance operation and mine safety and covers for surface deposits of tailings based on geopolymerization technology. This paper investigates the effects of activator concentration, curing temperature and time on alkali-activated materials based on low-alumina MTs from the Cu/Ni mine in Northern Finland. Alkaline activators containing sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) at different concentrations were used and two different curing temperatures, 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C, for periods of 7, 14, and 28 days were considered. Scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were performed to investigate the structure, morphology and phase compositions of the alkali-activated products. The effect of curing temperature and alkaline solutions on mechanical strength and water absorption were investigated. The results indicate that the alkalinity and curing temperature affect the mechanical and microstructural properties of the compositions of alkali-activated MTs. The 30 wt% Na(2)SiO(3)addition enables the alkali activated MT to improve the compressive strength with a highest value of 6.44 and 15.70 MPa after 28 days of curing at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. The results of this study deliver useful information for recycling and utilization of MTs as sustainable material through the alkali activation. Graphic

AB  - Independence and having control over one's own life are important factors for residential satisfaction. In rural areas, the mobility of people is based on owning a private car, due to the lack of public transport. Furthermore, planning in rural municipalities is highly car oriented. Small municipalities with shrinking and aging populations have many challenges to ensure access to services for their residents. This paper focuses on a case study of a small municipality with less than 2000 inhabitants. The objective of the study was to enhance sustainable change in shrinking rural areas and maintain them as good places to live even in the future. Access to local services and social activities is a major challenge for older people, who no longer have the possibility to use their own car. The problem with relocation is the lack of suitable apartments for older people. A dense and walkable municipal centre with accessible apartments may help municipalities provide for their older populations. Moreover, in Finland, second homeowners are an important resource for small municipalities. Spaces for social intercourse between residents and between permanent residents and second homeowners may enhance vitality and community building in these municipalities.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles are absolutely vital in maintaining sustainable food systems. Human activities disturb the natural balance of these cycles by creating enormous additional nutrient fluxes, causing eutrophication of waterways and pollution in land systems. To tackle this problem, sustainable nutrient management is required. This paper addresses sustainable nutrient management in two countries: The Netherlands and Finland. We adopt a critical perspective on resource politics, especially towards opportunistic policy strategies for the pollutant management of N and P. Two research questions are considered. First, what are the key systemic and policy failures that occurred in the N and P systems in the Netherlands and Finland between 1970 and 2015? And second, which lessons can be drawn when addressing the policy responses in the two countries to cope with these failures? The cases are analyzed within Weber and Rohracher's framework that addresses failures preventing sustainable transitions. The results show that a number of failures occurred, besides market failures (over-exploitation of the commons, externalization of costs): lack of directionality, policy coordination, institutions, capabilities, infrastructure, demand articulation, and reflexivity. Policy responses in both countries resulted in ponderous policy frameworks that were adequate to tackle nutrient problems from the industrial sector and municipalities. However, both countries provided only a moderate response in terms of system-wide integrated policy frameworks to cope with sectoral-transcending issues. The agricultural use of N and P, in contrast to detergents, has not been subjected to strong regulatory measures.

AB  - Fungi are a megadiverse group of organisms, they play major roles in ecosystem functioning and are important for human health, food production and nature conservation. Our knowledge on fungal diversity and fungal ecology is however still very limited, in part because surveying and identifying fungi is time demanding and requires expert knowledge. We present a method that allows anyone to generate a list of fungal species likely to occur in a region of interest, with minimal effort and without requiring taxonomical expertise. The method consists of using a cyclone sampler to acquire fungal spores directly from the air to an Eppendorf tube, and applying DNA barcoding with probabilistic species identification to generate a list of species from the sample. We tested the feasibility of the method by acquiring replicate air samples from different geographical regions within Finland. Our results show that air sampling is adequate for regional-level surveys, with samples collected >100km apart varying but samples collected <10 km apart not varying in their species composition. The data show marked phenology, and thus obtaining a representative species list requires aerial sampling that covers the entire fruiting season. In sum, aerial sampling combined with probabilistic molecular species identification offers a highly effective method for generating a species list of air-dispersing fungi. The method presented here has the potential to revolutionize fungal surveys, as it provides a highly cost-efficient way to include fungi as a part of large-scale biodiversity assessments and monitoring programs.

AB  - The groundwater in a shallow, unconfined, low-lying coastal aquifer in Santala, southern Finland, was chemically characterised by integrating multivariate statistical approaches, principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), based on the stable isotopes delta H-2 and delta O-18, hydrogeochemistry and field monitoring data. PCA and HCA yielded similar results and classified groundwater samples into six distinct groups that revealed the factors controlling temporal and spatial variations in the groundwater geochemistry, such as the geology, anthropogenic sources from human activities, climate and surface water. High temporal variation in groundwater chemistry directly corresponded to precipitation. With an increase in precipitation, KMnO4 consumption, EC, alkalinity and Ca concentrations also increased in most wells, while Fe, Al, Mn and SO4 were occasionally increased during spring after the snowmelt under specific geological conditions. The continued increase in NO3 and metal concentrations in groundwater indicates the potential contamination risk to the aquifer. Stable isotopes of delta O-18 and delta H-2 indicate groundwater recharge directly from meteoric water, with an insignificant contribution from lake water, and no seawater intrusion into the aquifer. Groundwater geochemistry suggests that local seawater intrusion is temporarily able to take place in the sulfate reduction zone along the freshwater and seawater mixed zone in the low-lying coastal area, but the contribution of seawater was found to be very low. The influence of lake water could be observed from higher levels of KMnO4 consumption in wells near the lake. The integration of PCA and HCA with conventional classification of groundwater types, as well as with the hydrogeochemical data, provided useful tools to identify the vulnerable groundwater areas representing the impacts of both natural and human activities on water quality and the understanding of complex groundwater flow system for the aquifer vulnerability assessment and groundwater management in the future.

AB  - This paper presents models based on empirical data which can be used to predict the patterns of species richness of vascular plants at the poorly explored mesoscale. Using generalized linear modelling, multiple regression models of species richness in the Kevo Nature Reserve, North Finland, are built with a training set of 257 grid squares and 33 environmental variables. We validated the accuracy of the derived models with an independent test set of 100 grid squares. Two different modelling approaches are used: one where species richness is treated straightforwardly as the response variable, and another where it is tentatively stratified into two groups according to taxon types, i.e. alpine taxa versus wide-spread and silvine (forest) taxa. However, the latter approach only marginally improved the accuracy of the predictions of total number of species. Linear altitudinal variables were among the best predictors of vascular plant richness at the mesoscale. Bs variables involving altitude are crude surrogates for energy-related factors, the results support the available energy hypothesis and advocate its significance in richness-environment relationships. Other important predictors of species richness included length of rivers and brooks, abundance of cliff walls, occurrences of steep-sided gorges and valleys, and relative abundance of gabbro in bedrock. However, the accuracy of the predictions in the derived models is relatively modest. This points towards the necessity of field work as a final guarantee to identify local hotspots of vascular plant species in a subarctic landscape.

AB  - Using a hermeneutical method, this study seeks to understand Christian Zionism as a meaningful practice in late modern Sweden. We visited four Christian Zionist conferences where we observed, analysed the sermons, and conducted interviews. The conferences are almost entirely attended by elderly people and the style is characterized by an old-time revivalist nostalgia. Results show that Israel is seen as a key to understanding a general conflict that the informants experience in late modern Swedish society and in relation to the majority church. Supporting Israel is intertwined with support for conservative values and theology and Israel becomes a nodal point that puts the greater conflict in a new perspective: identifying with Old Testament prophecies and God's dealings with Israel gives hope and a sense of continuity to a revivalist movement that has become out of date. In Israel, Christian Zionists connect with both the past and the future, personally and as a movement.

AB  - Transformation of landscape with symbolic art does not only mark a space as sacred. Such demarcations also serve as symbols of other social functions, such as the delineation of territories and exchange of information. As enduring monuments to the past, they symbolise a territory of time; as part of a cultural landscape, they symbolise a territory of space. A distributional study of evidence of symbolic territoriality in the landscapes of three rock art sites from the Neolithic - Early Metal periods in Finland, this work utilises GIS spatial analysis to locate prehistoric dwelling sites and sacred sites (red ochre burials, cairn burials, cremation burials, and cup-stones) within 5 and 10 km catchment zones of the pictographs sites. The results are interpreted with explanatory models from Information Exchange Theory and territorial analysis. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

The role of this kelp detritus in fueling deep-sea communities adjacent to healthy kelp forests was investigated in a region in the north of Norway by comparing the community structure and biodiversity of meio-, macro-, and megafauna in two deep (450 m) areas with different expected input of kelp detritus: a deep fjord basin surrounded by kelp forests and the adjacent continental shelf 15 km offshore from the kelp forests. The results showed that, although the fjord received a significantly higher amount of large kelp detritus (i.e. blades) than the shelf area, the amount of small kelp detritus available on the sediment was similar in both areas. There were significant differences in the multidimensional scaling analyses on the community structure for meio-, macro-, and megafauna between the fjord and the shelf. Significant differences were also found in biomass, abundance and biodiversity indices for some groups. However, no clear pattern emerged in the community structure and biodiversity between the fjord and the shelf, and the observed differences could not be linked directly to kelp detritus availability. The similar amounts of small particles of kelp detritus in the fjord and shelf area suggest that kelp detritus can provide organic matter to ecosystems further away than initially hypothesized, thus potentially shaping the structure and functioning of deep benthic communities distant from the kelp forests. Yet, the direct (trophic) links of kelp detritus and the studied benthic fauna need to be further analysed. The results are discussed in relation to current global changes in kelp forest, including regime shifts from healthy kelp reefs to turfs or barren areas, which reduce drastically the amount of macroalgal detritus produced and exported.

AB  - Due to structural and hydraulic deterioration, urban water pipe networks have annual rehabilitation needs. Worldwide, these needs are often significantly larger than the actual amount of rehabilitation being performed, leading to increased risks of serious failures, lower performance and a growing techno-financial burden for future generations. It is well accepted that, in order to limit the multiple impacts of utility works in the urban envi-ronment, rehabilitation projects should be coordinated between water, transport, energy and telecommunication infrastructures. In practice, such coordination means that public utilities must rehabilitate assets earlier or later than technically needed, in order to engage in joint projects in which digging and resurfacing expenditures are shared. Hence, at the municipal scale, such coordination influences two variables that are key to strategic de-cision support: average costs (euro/metre) for asset rehabilitation, and the service lifetimes of those assets. However, current models for strategic asset management do not enable practitioners to estimate how changes in the co-ordination process may influence the long-term financial and environmental impacts of infrastructure rehabil-itation. The present study aimed at addressing this methodological gap by introducing the concept of a coordination window that quantifies to what extent utilities compromise asset rehabilitation times in order to join multi-utility projects. An algorithm for modelling the influence of the coordination window size on long-term sustainability costs is presented and applied to one Swedish municipality. The results suggested that total capital costs and carbon emissions can be lowered by 34% and 16% with a coordination window of 35 and 25 year, in comparison to the no-coordination case.

AB  - Citizens are called upon to become active participants in creating a more sustainable food system. As food citizens, people participate in defining and constructing their food systems according to their needs and values. In food policies, the concept of food citizenship is often left undefined or with reference only to individual activities. In the food citizenship literature, the role of nonhuman agency in constituting food citizenship needs more examination. Here we investigate food citizenship activities in a citizen-led community-supported agriculture group and explore the role of materiality in constituting food citizenship. We ask (1) what is the role of material-discursive arrangements in community-supported agriculture activities, and (2) how does materiality constitute food citizenship? We analyze semi-structured interviews, as well as observation and visual material, using qualitative content analysis. Our findings indicate that materialities, such as the field, time, and body, play a central role in community-supported agriculture activities. With materialities, food citizenship is understood as collective and active doing, aiming to change the food system. Instead of endorsing food citizenship as a human trait or status, we claim that it is more productive to regard it as a phenomenon, produced in intra-action with(in) material-discursive arrangements. Acknowledging nonhuman agency emphasizes the political, collective, and responsible nature of citizenship as well as the power relations behind the constitution of citizenship. We conclude that in food policies more attention should be paid to collective ways of civic participation and to the materiality of becoming a food citizen.

AB  - The effects of moose browsing in young Scots pine stands were studied in southern Finland during 1993-94. The influence of moose on tree species composition starts during the early development of young plantations. A considerable proportion of small pine seedlings was damaged, and hence the future development of the stand was retarded. The average biomass consumption of pine was relatively low increasing slightly with the density of pine seedlings. Browsing of pine was common in the patches with high density of preferred and highly utilized deciduous tree species, aspen and rowan. As elucidated by means of exclosure studies, the availability of tree species preferred and highly utilized by moose, e.g. rowan, is likely to be reduced also by early silvicultural cleaning. Removing excess birches by cleaning appears to be needed even in high-density moose areas to regulate the competition between tree species, especially the birch/pine height ratio. At the present average moose density of 0.4-0.6 km(-2) forest rand, considerable depletion of highly palatable tree species occurs locally in high-density moose ranges. When optimizing the development of young stands, silvicultural treatment timing and browsing by moose should be taken into account. It is considered important when combining forest and wildlife management to identify the conditions under which damage, overconsumption and possible long-term effects on forest ecosystems take place.

AB  - Of the many sacred springs in Norway, most dedicated to St. Olav, several have disappeared. Two of the sacred springs that still exist are located in Bempty set in Telemark, Southern Norway, and have been surveyed for their sedimentology and hydrology. The springs are embedded in a cultural landscape with several ancient monuments. The aquifers have been mapped by drilling, monitoring wells, and ground penetrating radar and analyzed by GIS models. The area is at the marine limit and most of the sediments have been deposited in the sea. The aquifer of the first spring occurs in subglacial and submarine sediments covered by a series of moraines. The aquifer of the other spring is above the confining till layer, bounded by moraines and located inside a 20 m thick glacial delta deposit. Both aquifers have documented properties that produce springs which under normal climatic conditions never dry and show stable temperatures close to the yearly mean air temperature. The residence time of the water is long for both of the aquifers. Both springs are point features and are not parts of large seepage faces. The locations of the springs may indicate a sacred position in an area of prehistoric farmland, Iron Age burial mounds, stone monuments of unknown age, and cup mark carvings. The springs are contaminated from old landfills, but are reverting, and one of them is under threat from sand pit expansion. (C) 2014 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - In hard rock terrain the assessment of groundwater resources is often complicated due to the heterogeneity of the hard rock milieu and the fracturing system responsible for storing and transmitting water. An overview of the most applicable techniques in the assessment of groundwater reserves in hard rock areas has been done for the Municipality of Tanum in Sweden as a case study. This assessment embodies the techniques employed to determine aquifer parameters and the quality of the water present. The quantification of the resource and its chemical characterization is of vital importance for the effective monitoring and the sustainable management of the groundwater resources.

AB  - There is an increased interest for battery electric vehicles in multiple sectors, including agriculture. The potential for lowered environmental impact is one of the key factors, but there exists a knowledge gap between the environmental impact of on-road vehicles and agricultural work machinery. In this study, a life cycle assessment was performed on two smaller, self-driving battery electric tractors, and the results were compared to those of a conventional tractor for eleven midpoint characterisation factors, three damage categories and one weighted single score. The results showed that compared to the conventional tractor, the battery electric tractor had a higher impact in all categories during the production phase, with battery production being a majority contributor. However, over the entire life cycle, it had a lower impact in the weighted single score (-72%) and all three damage categories; human health (-74%), ecosystem impact (-47%) and resource scarcity (-67%). The global warming potential over the life cycle of the battery electric tractor was 102 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1) y(-1) compared to 293 kg CO(2)eq.ha(-1) y(-1) for the conventional system. For the global warming potential category, the use phase was the most influential and the fuel used was the single most important factor.

AB  - Nuclear power continues to offer the potential to be a major, worldwide, scalable, carbon-free energy sourceif the challenges of safety, nonproliferation, waste management, and economic competitiveness are addressed. The international community has spent decades attempting to find a pragmatic approach to address waste-management concerns. Along the way, the advocates of open and closed nuclear fuel cycles have engaged in a running debate. For those who favor an open cycle, Sweden and Finland serve as excellent models today for successfully navigating both technical issues and public opinion to dispose of their spent nuclear fuel in a permanent repository that does not allow used fuel to be retrieved. But these successes have yet to be replicated elsewhere. For closed-cycle advocates, economically convincing technology solutions have yet to surface; as a result, leading reprocessing advocates claim that the future value of accumulated waste material can provide the economic justification for nuclear recycling. The authors discuss a middle-ground path that encourages research and development on advancements in fuel cycle technology while providing for safe waste storage on a century-long, or intermediate, timescale. Acknowledging the risks of pursuing such a venture, the authors also write on the importance of establishing performance metrics that would support nuclear energy as a sustainable, secure, and safe energy choice. The authors argue that the most important metric is the establishment of a surety index that could capture the nonproliferation and security risks of alternate fuel cycles.

AB  - Introduction
   Previous studies have demonstrated increased suicide rates on holidays such as New Year, nationally and internationally. Comparable to New Year's Eve, Swedish Midsummer is a major holiday, linked to high levels of alcohol consumption in the population. We, therefore, hypothesized that suicides and deaths with undetermined intent would increase during the Midsummer celebration.
   Methods
   We used a retrospective death registry design to investigate all suicides that occurred on Midsummer's Eve (ME), Midsummer's Day (MD) and 28 adjacent days (AD) during 1980-2018. Data were stratified by diagnosis type, sex and age, and was analyzed with paired t-tests, Poisson regression, and time-series charts with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results
   During the 30-day investigation period, the observed average was 4.3 deaths per day (23.3% cases with undetermined intent). ME, but not MD, was associated with significantly fewer suicides compared to AD (-1.08 deaths, p < .01). ME, but not MD, was simultaneously associated with more deaths with undetermined intent (+0.58 deaths, p = .007). No moderating sex or age effects were found. Descriptive statistics showed that poisonings, drownings and traffic-related injuries were common among the undetermined ME cases.
   Discussion
   The study found that suicide decreases and deaths with undetermined intent increases on ME. The findings are interpreted considering that substance use may affect both suicidal intentions and diagnosis classifications. Social and cultural support and holiday anticipations might also account for suicidal behaviors on ME.

AB  - Hunting of game animals needs to be regulated, either through the number of permits or the bag size allowed per hunter. Such regulations may, however, jeopardize hunter satisfaction, on which game managers depend. Consequently, finding the optimal hunting intensity is not straightforward. Using data from Norwegian grouse hunting, we show that an integrated approach combining sociology and bioeconomics can give markedly different priorities than an optimization based exclusively on bioeconomics. Three grouse hunter typologies with contrasting stated preferences regarding bag size and crowding were used to account for varying hunter behavior. Omitting the social constructs from the model pushed the hunter density towards its upper limit, because the gain of selling one more permit generally superseded the loss in hunter satisfaction (expressed as willingness-to-pay). Although this strategy multiplied the overall profit, it produced a daily bag size that would be unacceptable to practically all hunters. We conclude that biosocioeconomic modeling is a valuable tool in the pursuit of sustainable game management. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Air Traffic Control System in Ireland, known as COOPANS, has been developed in conjunction with an industry partner Thales Group, is deployed in five European countries - Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, is unique as all countries operate the same software version and by 2020 will be responsible for 3,559,000 flights within European airspace. These systems are designed to detect and alert critical situations such as conflict between aircraft, between aircraft and terrain and between aircraft and areas where there is a risk to flight within that airspace. COOPANS provides three different safety alerts to warn Air Traffic Controllers of system safety events, including Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) which indicates potential for a loss in either required lateral or vertical separation between aircraft; Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) which indicates that an aircraft is operating at an altitude which may not be terrain safe; and Area Proximity Warning (APW) which indicates that an aircraft is projected to enter airspace which is segregated due to military or security operations. 77 participants out of a total Air Traffic Control cadre of 375 rated Air Traffic Controllers took part in the trial. 38 participants completed Trial A - traditional audio alert and 39 participants completed Trial B enhanced audio alert. The results demonstrate that the enhanced audio alert improved air traffic controller performance and efficiency across all three critical incident situations STCA, MSAW, APW regardless of air traffic controller experience. This improved performance resulted in faster response times by the air traffic controllers to the critical alerts presented. Training for air traffic controllers in the use of these new audio alert presentations can be harmonized and no distinctions need be made between experts and novices. This represents substantial benefit to air navigation service providers in avoiding increased costs in designing separate training programs for expert and novice air traffic controllers.

AB  - Although ecological restoration generally succeeds in increasing physical heterogeneity, many projects fail to enhance biota. Researchers have suggested several possible explanations, including insufficient restoration intensity, or time-lags in ecological responses that prevent detection of significant changes in short-term monitoring programs. This study aims to evaluate whether benthic macroinvertebrate communities responded to an expanded set of stream restoration measures within a study period of one to five years after completion of the restoration project. We studied 10 forest streams in northern Sweden that were channelized in the past for timber floating. Managers subjected six of these streams to habitat restoration, on each of these we selected two reaches, located in close proximity but differing in restoration intensity. In basic restored reaches, the restoration managers broke up the channelized banks and returned cobbles and small boulders to the main channel. In enhanced restoration reaches, they added additional large wood and boulders to reaches previously subjected to basic restoration, and rehabilitated gravel beds. The remaining four streams were not restored, and thus represent the baseline impacted (channelized) condition. We surveyed stream benthic assemblages before the enhanced restoration (year 2010) and three times afterward between 2011 and 2015. Five years after restoration, macroinvertebrate assemblages at the enhanced restored reaches were more differentiated from channelized conditions than those at basic-restored reaches. This reflected increased relative abundances of the insect orders Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera and the bivalve molluscs Sphaeriidae and decreased relative abundances of Chironomidae (Diptera). Analysis of functional traits provided further insights on the mechanistic explanations driving the recovery, e.g., indicating that the augmented channel retention capacity at enhanced restored reaches favored taxa adapted to slow flow conditions and more effectively retained passive aquatic dispersers. The increased restoration intensity in enhanced restored reaches has resulted in shifts in the composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, including increases in more sensitive taxa. These shifts became fully apparent five years after the enhanced restoration. Our results emphasize the value of longer-term monitoring to assess ecological responses following restoration, and of undertaking additional restoration as a valuable management option for previously restored sites that failed to achieve biotic recovery.

AB  - Rooftops represent a considerable part of the impervious fractions of urban environments. Detaining and retaining runoff from vegetated rooftops can be a significant contribution to reducing the effects of urbanization, with respect to increased runoff peaks and volumes fromprecipitation events. However, in climates with limited evapotranspiration, a non-vegetated system is a convenient option for stormwater management. A LECA (lightweight expanded clay aggregate)-based roof system was established in the coastal area of Trondheim, Norway in 2016. The roof structure consists of a 200 mm-thick layer of LECA (R) lightweight aggregate, covered by a concrete pavement. The retention in the LECA-based roof was estimated at 9%, which would be equivalent to 0.27 mm/day for the entire period. The LECA-based configuration provided a detention performance for a peak runoff reduction of 95% (median) and for a peak delay of 1 h and 15 min (median), respectively. The relatively high moisture levels in the LECA-based roof did not affect the detention performance. Rooftop retrofitting as a form of source control may contribute to a change in runoff characteristics from conventional roofs. This study of the LECA-based roof configuration presents data and performance indicators for stormwater urban planners with regard to water detention capability.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems are generally nitrogen (N) limited with low rates of N mineralization. Herbivory may affect N cycling and N losses and thus long-term productivity of ecosystems.
   Using a controlled grazing experiment in a low-alpine region at Hol, southern Norway, with three density levels of sheep, we determined effects of grazing on in situ availability of inorganic N, potential N mineralization, and mobility of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and dissolved organic N (DON) in soil water of O-horizons in grazing-preferred grassland habitats. In addition, we studied the within-season and spatial variation of these processes.
   The low alpine grasslands at Hol were characterized by small rates of N mineralization and relatively large plant demands for N. Significantly greater rates of potential N mineralization were found at sites with high sheep density compared to those with low density or no grazing. Effects of grazing on bioavailable N (as determined by buried PRS (TM) exchange resins) were greater at low as compared to high altitudes. At low altitudes, low sheep density reduced amounts of bioavailable N. Nitrogen concentration of plants as a proxy of N availability in soils revealed, however, no significant effects of grazing. There was a strong seasonal effect on inorganic N and DIN:DON ratios of the soil water, with decreasing values in the course of the growing season, probably due to increasing nutrient demand of plants and/or microbes.
   We conclude that grazing may significantly stimulate N-cycling, but not sufficiently to release the system from its strong N deficiency, as we found no evidence for short-term increased risk in N loss via soil water due to herbivore activity. Nitrogen removal through grazing is small compared to the total soil N pool and at high sheep density is about half of the N deposition. This suggests that grazing in grassland habitats in this low alpine ecosystem is sustainable from a nutrient point of view.

AB  - EMSO (The European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water-column Observatory, www.emso-eu.org) is forging ahead through the next challenge in Earth-Ocean Science: How to co-ordinate ocean data acquisition, analysis and response across provincial, national, regional, and global scales. The coordination, analysis, and dissemination of ocean data continue to be a challenge across international boundaries. EMSO is a large-scale European Research Distributed Infrastructure (RI) of the ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) roadmap, and is composed of fixed-point, seafloor and water-column observatories with the basic scientific objective of (near)-real-time, long-term monitoring of environmental processes across the geosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere. It is geographically distributed in key sites of European waters, from the Arctic through the Atlantic and Mediterranean, to the Black Sea. EMSO ended its Preparatory Phase, EU Framework Programme 7 (FP7) funded project in 2012, and is now in the Interim phase transitioning to the formation of the legal entity for managing the distributed infrastructure: the EMSO European Research Infrastructure Consortium (hereinafter EMSO-ERIC). A phased implementation will characterize EMSO site extension, construction and operation. Countries currently participating in EMSO are: Italy, France, Ireland, Spain, Greece, United Kingdom, Portugal, Romania, Norway, Sweden, Turkey, Germany, and the Netherlands. The user community is open to all, and will be coordinated through an association called ESONET-Vi (European Seafloor Observatory NETwork-The Vision), following on the extensive scientific community planning contributions of the ESONET-NoE FP6 project. The most striking characteristic of observatory design is its ability to address interdisciplinary objectives simultaneously across temporal and spatial scales. Data are collected from the surface ocean through the water column, the benthos, and the sub-seafloor. Depending on the application, in situ infrastructures can either be attached to a cable, which provides power and enables data transfer, or operate as independent stand-alone benthic and moored instruments. Data, in both cases, can be transmitted realtime through either fibre optic cables, or through cable and EMSO provides power, communications, sensors, and data infrastructure for continuous, high resolution, (near)-real-time, interactive ocean observations across a truly multi-and interdisciplinary range of research areas including biology, geology, chemistry, physics, engineering, and computer science; from polar to tropical environments, down to the abyss. Such coordinated data allow us to pose multivariate questions in space and time, rather than focusing on single data streams. Continuous data are required to document episodic events, such as earthquakes, submarine slides, tsunamis, benthic storms, biodiversity changes, pollution, and gas hydrate release. Longer term time series are relevant for monitoring global change. EMSO not only brings together countries and disciplines, but allows the pooling of resources and coordination to assemble harmonised data into a comprehensive regional ocean picture which it will then make available to researchers and stakeholders worldwide on an open and interoperable access basis.

AB  - Among invasive alien species, squirrels are prominent because of their popularity as pets and their positive perception by the general public. In Europe, populations of five alien squirrel species are reported. The pet trade represents a high-risk pathway for the introduction of rodents, which are likely to become invasive because of their reproductive biology and wide native distribution ranges. In the European Union, a trade ban has been imposed on some particularly impacting species, such as the eastern grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Eradication and numerical control is needed for most introduced squirrels in Europe (including the Siberian chipmunk), according to European Union Regulation 1143/2014 on alien species. We summarise the current distribution of the ground-dwelling Siberian chipmunk Eutamias sibiricus, one of the most common pet squirrels in Europe and Asia, in its invasive range. Established populations of Siberian chipmunk, in most cases composed of small numbers of individuals, currently occur in France, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Russia. The species was present in Austria, Sweden, and Hong Kong, and unsuccessful introductions occurred in Spain and the British Isles. The first records from Greece are also reported. Most introductions took place during the 1990s, when individuals were intentionally released (67% of extant populations result from such releases). Population size was correlated with the proximity to urban areas. Human risk of infection with the agent of Lyme borreliosis seems to be the highest where populations of alien Siberian chipmunk occur. Other impacts have never been reported. Competition with native rodents (e.g. the red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and dormice, Gliridae) has been speculated on, as well as predation on nests of native warblers (Sylvidae). Impacts by alien Siberian chipmunks have been overlooked for a long time. Despite this, given that the species may affect native biodiversity and human health, eradication of established populations is recommended.

AB  - This paper examines the social and organizational innovation processes undertaken by small-scale producers engaged in short food supply chains in the North Swedish region of Vasterbotten. The study uses the notion of proximity to empirically analyse and conceptually explore these phenomena. The paper illustrates the 'new associationalism' mobilized by producers in order to promote knowledge exchange and learning and highlights the role of translocal practices in sustaining this transition. The study found that open and trusted interactions with consumers are central to the development of 'quasi-organic' practices, and that producers belong to numerous motley associations of food professionals facilitating the creation of collective meanings about near-produced quality food. The paper contributes to the rapprochement between agri-food studies and human geography to understand the formation of local food systems from an evolutionary and relational perspective.

AB  - Retaining trees in small patches at final harvest is a common forest conservation measure to maintain structural and biological diversity through the young forest phase. Long-term studies of coarse woody debris (CWD, breast height diameter >= 10 cm) changes in retention patches remain uncommon, especially in relation to different types of patches with varying tree species composition, ground moisture, size, shape, and exposure. In the present study we re-inventoried CWD three times (1-3, 5-7 and 18-20 years after harvesting) in 60 small tree retention patches (0.03-0.54 ha) of six commonly created retention patch types, in central boreal Sweden. Most retention patch types, despite being very small (<0.55 ha) and exposed, did not experience severe tree mortality and input of CWD over the two decades. Average total volumes of CWD did not change significantly over time, although volumes of downed CWD generally increased whilst standing CWD decreased. Volumes of different decay classes were dynamic over time, but all retention types supported a variety of decay stages after 18-20 years. The volume of CWD varied significantly between the six retention patch types, with buffer zones to mire having the lowest average volume of 9 m3 ha-1 and buffer zones to rocky outcrop the highest average volume of 32 m3 ha-1, when summarised over the whole study period. Very few patch-level environmental variables (except type) related to the amount of CWD in retention patches; only the retained living tree volume of patches during creation was clearly positively correlated with higher post-harvest CWD volumes. Patch characteristics such as size and shape index did not relate to the CWD volumes in retention patches, and patch exposure only related to higher CWD volumes within the first 1-3 years after harvest. Retention patches generally supported a variety of living trees, CWD volumes and qualities over time. Several retention patch types; such as free-standing coniferous and deciduous patches, rocky outcrop buffers, wet forest patches and buffers to water, supported average CWD volumes between 19-41 m3 ha-1 after 18-20 years, under remaining canopy cover. Our findings challenge the traditional management principles aimed at minimizing severe windthrow and CWD input (i.e., creating larger patches (>0.5-1 ha), choosing topographically sheltered areas, selecting specific tree species and ground conditions). However, our study was too small in scale to investigate multiple within-patch-type interacting environmental variables. Future larger-scale studies over extended time periods are needed to disentangle such interactions for the dynamics of CWD and associated biodiversity in retention patches.

AB  - The ratio between the effective and the census population size, N-e/N, is an important measure of the long-term viability and sustainability of a population. Understanding which demographic processes that affect N-e/N most will improve our understanding of how genetic drift and the probability of fixation of alleles is affected by demography. This knowledge may also be of vital importance in management of endangered populations and species. Here, we use data from 13 natural populations of house sparrow (Passer domesticus) in Norway to calculate the demographic parameters that determine N-e/N. Using the global variance-based Sobol' method for the sensitivity analyses, we found that N-e/N was most sensitive to demographic variance, especially among older individuals. Furthermore, the individual reproductive values (that determine the demographic variance) were most sensitive to variation in fecundity. Our results draw attention to the applicability of sensitivity analyses in population management and conservation. For population management aiming to reduce the loss of genetic variation, a sensitivity analysis may indicate the demographic parameters towards which resources should be focused. The result of such an analysis may depend on the life history and mating system of the population or species under consideration, because the vital rates and sex-age classes that N-e/N is most sensitive to may change accordingly.

AB  - The concepts of efficiency and resilience are important in complex adaptive systems. Efficiency and resilience have been compared in complex systems, but the data and materials have mainly been derived from natural ecosystems. The actual environmental impacts of this comparison with data and materials from human economic systems is an important research theme for ecological economics. Furthermore, efficiency defined as eco-efficiency is missing from resilience research. This paper studies resilience and eco-efficiency in societal energy systems. Eco-efficiency is defined as energy produced per CO2 emissions and incineration ash generated. For resilience, we use the diversity of fuel types in energy systems, in particular the evenness of fuels in each fuel type category. Empirical materials from the district heating energy system of Southern Lapland in Finland encompassing six municipalities are presented. What if-scenarios show that, in general, diversity and eco-efficiency seem to support each other, i.e., there is a correlation. This is different from food web studies in ecology where the material flows are primarily biomass. In human energy systems, lithosphere derived materials are used alongside biomass, in our case study fossil coal, oil as well as peat, which is a semi-fossil fuel. The difference might also be explained due to the role of technology in human economic systems. For policy and business strategy implications, it is important to study the case system with two interdependent system boundaries; the subsystem level of the capital city Rovaniemi and the larger six municipality regional system to which Rovaniemi belongs. Policy planning and business strategy development would gain if the actors involved would approach the system with enlarged spatial and temporal system boundaries. Long-term strategic thinking and inter-municipality cooperation may help the region to mitigate the risks related to the development of the district heating energy system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sweden's cultural diversity generates considerable challenges for occupational therapists. The aim of this study was to explore experiences and perceptions of occupational therapists working with immigrant psychiatric clients from the Middle East region. The study included interviews with eight occupational therapists employed in mental health care and working in a variety of settings. The data collection and analysis were carried out in accordance with the grounded theory approach. One core category, ""the challenges of the multicultural therapeutic journey--a journey on a winding road"" was identified. The core category included three categories: dilemmas in clinical practice, feelings and thoughts, and building cultural bridges, in turn comprising sub-categories and components. The results showed that the many dilemmas influencing effective multicultural occupational therapy were cultural, societal, and professional in nature. The dilemmas influenced feelings and thoughts, in turn influencing both motivation for seeking cultural knowledge and choice of adequate strategies in which the multicultural therapeutic relationship could develop. The results imply that culturally congruent occupational therapy practice needs to be further developed and more research is needed on how cultural issues can be met in occupational therapy practice.

AB  - This study explores policy makers', health-care professionals' and senior volunteers' perceptions of senior volunteers. Two Norwegian government white papers regarding older adult care and welfare services, which were published over a period of 19 years, were selected for close examination. Furthermore, focus group interviews with a purposeful sample of five senior volunteers and 15 health-care professionals were conducted. The study explores the discursive formations of senior volunteers in the government white papers and how they are negotiated in the senior volunteers' and the health-care professionals' narratives. Two dominant discourses were presented in the white papers: a prevention discourse (in which volunteering was presented primarily as a means to prevent volunteers' loneliness and need for care services) and a sustainability discourse (in which the volunteers were presented as instrumental in future sustainable care services). Both discourses echo a common overarching discourse about a capacity crisis due to the ageing population. The senior volunteers were positioned as partners and active agents in both their own narratives and the health-care professionals' narratives. Their position as independent and as spokespersons for the less empowered were evident only in the senior volunteers' own narratives. Only the health-care professionals referenced the prevention discourse and capacity issues. The senior volunteers presented themselves as competent, efficient political actors, and they resisted both the prevention and sustainability discourses. In the senior volunteers' narratives, social and political participation were interrelated. The study demonstrates that new discursive landscapes must be created to capture the diversity among senior volunteers and their efforts. While senior volunteers must be meaningfully involved in decision making, planning and design, their positions as independent and active agents must also be ensured. Authentic partnerships between senior volunteers and public care services involve a balance between involvement and independence.

   This paper is based on a contemporary Norwegian-Romanian project where sustainable tourism is used to counteract an ongoing extinction of an extremely valuable natural resource, the Beluga sturgeon (Huso Huso). This fish is the world's biggest freshwater fish and it has been appreciated by humans since ancient times due to the good fish meat and the fish eggs, better known as the world's most expensive food commodity, the Beluga (also called 'Russian') caviar. The decline of the species has several reasons, among them the building of river dams and irrigation systems. During the last decades the most important threat has been intensified fishing. One of the places left to find it is in the lower Danube and the Black Sea, where a ban on fishing was introduced in 2006, but so far with limited success. The project has selected the village Sfantu Gheorghe for a case study. The present trends point to a probable outcome known as The Tragedy of the Commons', where the result inevitably is the destruction of the common resource. By approaching this particular community the project is trying to convince the locals from fishermen villages along the whole Danube to start protecting this resource against poaching and thus avoid that the most valuable potential tourist attraction in their neighborhoods is destroyed forever. The project uses 'constructive sociology' together with high-tech biological research to bring tourists closer to 'the pregnancy road' of the sturgeon. It also tries to work with authorities in the environmental and fishery sectors to set up a fishery regime that might give a base for long-term survival for both the fish and these fishing dependent communities. And not least, it works broadly with the local communities in a transparent way that should benefit most of the stakeholder groups.

AB  - Many forestry practitioners need information on the amount of dead wood for various purposes, often at the level of individual stands. Our aim was to compare four simple dead-wood inventory methods of which systematic circular plot inventory is a well-known method, while relascope plot inventory (using the ordinary horizontal angle relascope also for downed trees), diameter class counting and total inventory are new methods. Seven surveyors tested the methods in four stands in southern Finland. All the methods produced rather accurate volume estimates. Mean percent error was the smallest (-5.7%) in total inventory and the largest (-12.4%) in diameter class counting. Precision differed significantly between the methods. Variation among individual measurements, expressed as percentage SD, was 15.9% in total inventory, 24.8% in diameter counting, 36.6% in relascope inventory and 43.0% in circular plot inventory. Diameter counting was by far the fastest method. Relascope inventory and circular plot inventory took about twice as much time, and total inventory over three times as much time as diameter counting. In conclusion, diameter class counting is a cost-effective dead-wood assessment method, if the purpose is to get an estimate of the total volume of dead wood within a forest stand with a reasonable precision.

AB  - Height growth and productivity of forests depend on temperature, water and nutrients. Ellenberg indicator values that summarize vegetation response to growth factors are suited to predict site fertility. Macronutrients (NPK), as represented by N-values, are a crucial component of site fertility and susceptibility towards biomass extraction. Based on 1,500 vegetation plots from an inventory stratified over all important forest types of the Bavarian Alps we regionalized Ellenberg N-values against area-wide soil, climate and relief predictors including a spatial effect at a scale of 1 : 25,000, resulting in a general additive model (GAM) with eight predictors and an explained deviance of 53 % on test data. The N-value layer was combined with other regionalized indicator values (temperature, reaction, moisture) to predict height of Norway spruce at reference age (site index) of an independent forest inventory data set, resulting in a GAM with an explained deviance of 35 %. After temperature the nutrient value was the second most important predictor of site index and clearly superior to soil reaction. It can be concluded that forest growth is sensitive to reductions of NPK-availability through whole tree harvesting and that maps of N-values deliver important information for planning sustainable harvesting.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate antecedents of using non-travel-specific social media (specifically Facebook) for travel decision-making before a leisure trip. Design/methodology/approach Based on an online survey of 426 young travel consumers from Italy and Sweden, this work applies structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis. Findings The study finds support for most of the conventional TAM-related constructs: perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and intention, while ease of use is not found relevant in this context.
   Research limitations/implications - Results shed light on the antecedents of using non-travel specific social media in two countries. Future research might focus on validating the factors identified and add others that might shape usage in the selected countries. Future studies could further investigate possible differences arising from culture, country of origin and age. The analysis can also be extended to other countries.
   Practical implications - The analysis might help managers in the hospitality and tourism sector by providing an understanding of the cognitive factors which determine travelers' decision to use Facebook for trip planning. Thus, managers should get to know these factors in their effort to influence social media in hospitality and tourism settings.
   Originality/value - The findings offer interesting perspectives on the applicability of conventional models to the context of non-travel-specific social media platforms. The exploration of cross-cultural differences also adds to the extant body of knowledge.

AB  - Background Travel surveys show that the amount of private car driving in Norway has increased significantly since the mid-1980s. Private car driving has for a long time been the main mode of transport for retail and service trips, and grocery shopping trips represent over 60% of the retail and service travels. Despite the growing number of studies addressing accessibility to daily destinations, to the best of the authors' knowledge there are no studies examining these issues over time. Methods This paper aims to investigate changes in accessibility to grocery stores over time and use two counties in Norway as examples. Based on GIS data at a detailed level, distances from dwellings to nearest grocery store has been examined. Findings The results from the spatial analyses reveal significant changes from 1980 to 2019: The share of the population living within 500-m from a grocery store has decreased from 55% to 34% in one of the counties examined and from 36% to 19% in the other. This indicates that the share of people living within walking distance to a local grocery store has nearly halved. With such changes in accessibility to grocery stores, increased car driving for grocery shopping should not come as a surprise. Contrary to the frequent statements about sustainable urban development and active transportation, it seems that Norway still is developing as a country that in the future will be more and not less dependent on private cars.

AB  - Due to the recent climate change, organizations all over the globe are developing plans for reducing carbon emissions by developing clean energy technologies and energy efficient devices. However, the path for transition to green energy system is still unclear and in general, the representation of green energy supply for transition pathways is limited. Therefore, this study outlines a plan for getting Swedish energy sector completely carbon neutral by 2050. The approach can also be applicable to the majority of nations worldwide. Computer based simulations are performed on Energy PLAN software for making clean, green and sustainable energy system that can balance every component of entire energy system during the study period 2022 to 2050. This study takes into account the sustainable use of renewable sources for all economic sectors as well as the interchange of energy with nearby nations under the two scenarios. Additionally, the energy system works in tandem with other industries to create a fully carbon-free environment. The results revealed that, 50% de-carbonization is possible till 2035 and 100% de-carbonization is possible till 2050. This enables a discussion of how ambitious 10-year goals might serve as a first step toward the mid-century elimination of fossil fuels from the energy sector.

AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide was utilized as a sustainable alternative to solvent extraction of waxes from the waste needles of two spruce species, namely Norwegian and Sitka spruce. These extracts were rich in nonacosan-10-ol, an organic compound with hydrophobic properties that lends its use in the preparation of superhydrophobic coatings. The highest crude yields were 1.7% w/w of needles obtained at 400 bar and 60 degrees C, while nonacosan-10-ol was selectively extracted at 200 bar and 60 degrees C (8070 +/- 91.1 mu g/g of needles). Purification of nonacosan-10-ol from the wax extracts was conducted using a simple rapid green recrystallization technique. This yielded a recovery of 44.6% +/- 2% and 48.4% +/- 2% of the total nonacosan-10-ol from the original crude Sitka (3600 mu g/g of needles) and Norwegian wax (1920 gig of needles) respectively. Application of nonacosan-10-ol to a filter paper led to the formation of highly hydrophobic surfaces, with preliminary contact angles of up to 149 degrees. This sustainable production method may develop opportunities to valorize forestry waste within a holistic biorefinery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate how and to what extent structural network properties affect dyadic negotiation behavior in tourism destination ecosystems. Specifically, this study addresses negotiation behavior in terms of problem-solving and contending, because these two key strategies reflect the integrative and distributive aspects of dyadic interactions. Design/methodology/approach This study relies on network data and dyadic survey data from nine mountain tourism destinations in Southeastern Norway. The structural network properties the authors research are triadic closure - the extent to which a dyad has common ties to other actors - and structural equivalence - the similarities in networking patterns that capture firms' competition for similar resources. In addition, the authors also study a possible effect of relationship duration on negotiation behavior. Findings Triadic closure and relationship duration have positive effects on problem-solving, and structural equivalence tends to decrease problem-solving, although the effect is inconsistent; none of these three independent variables was found to affect contending negotiation behavior. Research limitations/implications This study shows that a dyad's structural network embeddedness has implications for negotiation behavior. Further research is encouraged to develop this theoretical perspective. Originality/value This study is a pioneering investigation of how structural network properties affect dyadic negotiation behavior in ongoing coproducing relationships in real-world destination ecosystems.

AB  - Synthetic fuels based on electricity, water, and carbon dioxide (CO2) may be necessary to cover the fuel demand in a sustainable transport sector based on renewable energy sources. The aim of this paper is to compare hydrogen, methane, methanol and diesel produced in this way. The main parameters for the analysis are well to wheel energy efficiency and costs, and the fuels are analysed in a Swedish context. The results indicate that methane and diesel could have the potential to be cost competitive in the near term, at least if common incentives for renewable transportation fuels are applied. Moreover, that hydrogen is the best option in terms of well to wheel energy efficiency, and that it in the longer term also may be cost competitive to the other fuels. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - This article is an ecocritical reading of the Swedish television series Jordskott. I discuss the effects in the series produced by the combination of the Nordic Noir's style and narrative techniques with elements of other genres, especially Gothic horror. I argue that through the contemporary reworking of the centuries-old Nordic mythology, Jordskott demonstrates how the aggressive powers of nature in Gothic narratives can no more be conventionally explained by referring to the pagan, pre-Christian beliefs, but need to be reconceived in light of the relentless environmental devastation brought about by humankind. The link unveiled between natural ecology and cultural mythology allows the series to surpass the limitations of the regionally informed folkloric story and to evolve into an ecological cautionary tale of global significance.

AB  - Modern electrical power system is evolving to a smarter and agile system, which will support society's sustainable development. The low voltage grid should be capable of withstanding new challenges such as reverse power flows and voltage unbalance (VU) caused by distributed generation. In this paper, the mitigation possibilities of the VU caused by single-phase-connected photovoltaics (PV) are analysed with Tesla Powerwall 2 battery energy storage systems (BESS) added to the grid. Three different BESS phase connection strategies are modelled and the VU is assessed with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). A low voltage distribution grid in Sweden is considered with different PV and BESS penetration levels and the applied method for VU assessment is validated. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of VU mitigation by connecting PV and BESS to the same phase.

AB  - In the RRIL (Responsible Research and Innovation Learning) ERASMUS+ project, learning material are developed/under development by the partner universities (Finland, Poland and Spain). One of the key aspects is the public engagement as it goes far beyond the researchers activity and requires the direct involvement of the stakeholders at local/regional/national level (non-profit organizations, cities, companies, trade-unions...), and includes small players (neighbourhoods associations, social actors...). Responsible Research & Innovation (RRI) is a concept developed by the European Commission for the governance of research and innovation processes with a view on the (ethical) acceptability, sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products. It aims to shape, maintain, develop, coordinate and align existing and novel research and innovation-related processes, actors and responsibilities with a view to ensuring desirable and acceptable research outcomes. The RRIL project pretends to fulfil this gap through the co-creation of higher education modules involving different research and innovation actors. The RRIL project focus its activity in three domains: economics, social sciences and energy management. The material will be tested in formal education (BSc, MSc, PhD and/or training of staff) and in non-academic environments (entrepreneurships in start-up incubators). The modules will focus in three of the dimensions of RRI: engagement, gender and ethics, were training is multidisciplinary and transversal.

AB  - Mounting climate emissions pose critical questions for mobility and travel practices. Particularly problematic are the emissions caused by aviation. Consequently, an emerging theme of discussion has been rail travel as a more sustainable practice. This has coincided with the discourse of "flight shame" and the recent emergence of the youth climate movement. The article studies the travel practices of young climate activists in relation to the large-scale changes in mobility that they argue for and envision, and how the two are interconnected. Analysis is based on multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork and interviews (n = 18) conducted with young climate activists in Finland in 2020. The results reveal that the interviewees avoid flight travel and instead prefer travelling by ground. This has become a norm among climate activists, and they argue that it is not just a more sustainable form of travel but can be more meaningful, too. Furthermore, young climate activists argue for societal and cultural changes in mobility and travel and demand action from decision-makers. Mobility and travel are inseparable features of everyday life in the contemporary world. Thus, overland travel, and especially train travel, constitutes an "everyday utopia" - a shared transformative practice and an act of activism in itself.

AB  - Objective: Many people now die in community care, and, considering the aging population, all healthcare staff members must be prepared to provide palliative care. Our objectives were to describe the total staff working in different care organizations in a rural community in Sweden and to explore palliative care competence, to describe educational gaps and the need for support and reflection, and to determine whether there are differences in care organizations, professions, age, and gender.
   Method: A 4-section 20-item questionnaire was distributed to 1686 staff (65% response rate): in nursing homes (n = 395), home care (n = 240), and group residential settings (n = 365). Registered nurses (n = 70), assistant nurses (n = 916), managers (n = 43), and paramedics (n = 33) participated. Descriptive and correlational statistics were employed.
   Results: Significant differences were found, and 40% (53% among men) lacked palliative care education, Fewer than 50% lacked education in the spiritual/existential areas, and 75% of those aged 20-66 (75% women, 55% men) needed further education. More women than men and staff aged 50-59 had an increased need to reflect.
   Significance of Results: Our study may provide guidance for managers in rural communities when planning educational interventions in palliative care for healthcare staff and may support direct education with content for specific professions.

AB  - For many years, the oil and gas industry has strived to develop environmentally friendly organophosphorus-based scale inhibitors. The natural polymer chitosan has recently gained significant importance for various upstream oil and gas applications. We earlier reported the synthesis of phosphonated chitosan (PCH) under conventional conditions in a two-step pathway via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction. This earlier work showed that PCH displayed good performance against calcite scaling and weak efficiency for barite scaling using a high-pressure dynamic tube-blocking rig at 80 bar and 100 degrees C using a produced water composition from the Heidrun oilfield, Norway. The mechanochemical synthesis approach has recently emerged as a powerful, green, and sustainable protocol in several industrial and academic applications. Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of PCH via the Moedritzer-Irani reaction using the ball-milling technique under liquid-assisted grinding conditions. The static inhibition performance of PCH is investigated, for the first time, against the gypsum scale and the calcite scale based on the NACE Standard TM0374-2007 protocol. The results are compared to the commercial polysaccharide, carboxymethyl inulin, (CMI), and aminotrismethylenephosphonic acid (ATMP) scale inhibitors. Furthermore, PCH was screened against the Heidrun calcite scale using static jar tests. The thermal stability and calcium compatibility properties of the mechanochemically synthesized PCH were investigated. The polymer exhibited an outstanding inhibition efficiency against both oilfield scales. It was also found that PCH showed excellent thermal stability after 7 days at 130 degrees C and excellent calcium compatibility properties at high calcium ion concentrations. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were carried out to gain atomic insight into the interaction of PCH, CMI, and ATMP with the mineral surface.

AB  - Leptospirosis, an emerging infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira, is thought to be the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world. A first step in preventing the spread of Leptospira is delineating the animal reservoirs that maintain and disperse the bacteria. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods targeting the LipL32 gene were used to analyze kidney samples from 124 House mice (Mus musculus), 94 Black rats (Rattus rattus), 5 Norway rats (R. norvegicus), and 89 small Indian mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) from five cattle farms in Puerto Rico. Renal carriage of Leptospira was found in 38% of the sampled individuals, with 59% of the sampled mice, 34% of Black rats, 20% of Norway rats, and 13% of the mongooses. A heterogeneous distribution of prevalence was also found among sites, with the highest prevalence of Leptospira-positive samples at 52% and the lowest at 30%. Comparative sequence analysis of the LipL32 gene from positive samples revealed the presence of two species of Leptospira, L. borgpetersenii and L. interrogans in mice, detected in similar percentages in samples from four farms, while samples from the fifth farm almost exclusively harbored L. interrogans. In rats, both Leptospira species were found, while mongooses only harbored L. interrogans. Numbers tested for both animals, however, were too small (n = 7 each) to relate prevalence of Leptospira species to location. Significant associations of Leptospira prevalence with anthropogenic landscape features were observed at farms in Naguabo and Sabana Grande, where infected individuals were closer to human dwellings, milking barns, and ponds than were uninfected individuals. These results show that rural areas of Puerto Rico are in need of management and longitudinal surveillance of Leptospira in order to prevent continued infection of focal susceptible species (i.e. humans and cattle).
   Author summary Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease that recently has shown an increase of human cases in many regions, Puerto Rico being one of them. To decrease human Leptospira infections it is necessary to ascertain the role of animal reservoirs to maintain the pathogen in the environment. However, no studies of wild mammal reservoirs in Puerto Rico have been done since 1963. We addressed the prevalence of Leptospira in four species of introduced wild mammals, which included three commensal rodent species (Mus and Rattus spp.) and the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) on dairy farms in Puerto Rico. Pathogen prevalence ranged from high to moderate in mice and mongooses, respectively. We also found that the pathogen is not distributed homogeneously among the sites we sampled and that landscape features, both natural and manmade, can play a role in the distribution of Leptospira. Our study provides an initial exploration of wild mammal reservoirs for Leptospira in Puerto Rico, and our data highlight the need for management of these species to potentially decrease pathogen transmission rates in both humans and cattle.

AB  - A novel high-resolution (2-4 m source and receiver spacing) reflection and refraction seismic survey was carried out for aquifer characterization and to confirm the existing depositional model of the interlobate esker of Virttaankangas, which is part of the Sakylanharju-Virttaankangas glaciofluvial esker-chain complex in southwest Finland. The interlobate esker complex hosting the managed aquifer recharge (MAR) plant is the source of the entire water supply for the city of Turku and its surrounding municipalities. An accurate delineation of the aquifer is therefore critical for long-term MAR planning and sustainable use of the esker resources. Moreover, an additional target was to resolve the poorly known stratigraphy of the 70-100-m-thick glacial deposits overlying a zone of fractured bedrock. Bedrock surface as well as fracture zones were confirmed through combined reflection seismic and refraction tomography results and further validated against existing borehole information. The high-resolution seismic data proved successful in accurately delineating the esker cores and revealing complex stratigraphy from fan lobes to kettle holes, providing valuable information for potential new pumping wells. This study illustrates the potential of geophysical methods for fast and cost-effective esker studies, in particular the digital-based landstreamer and its combination with geophone-based wireless recorders, where the cover sediments are reasonably thick.

AB  - During the past 60-70 years, contaminated sediments from local rivers have been settling in the harbour basin of Oslo. This contamination, combined with that from other harbour activities, has developed into a serious pollution problem with both organic and inorganic contaminants. Since 1992 dredging activities have been restricted until the effect of dredging was determined and a safe disposal was found for the sediments. Because of this restriction, a conflict situation arose in terms of decreasing sailing depths, and dispersal of large quantities of contaminated sediments into the water column each day from ship traffic. A complete plan of action to remediate Oslo Harbour was started in 1994 and delivered to the State Pollution Control Authority (SFT) in August 1996. An evaluation of environmental risks connected to the remediation work has been carried out along with the determination of the requirements for the monitoring programme during and after the work. Preliminary evaluation of dredging techniques indicates that mechanic/hydraulic equipment will cause the least dispersion of sediment. Several options for treatment of the sediments have been evaluated. Study results point out that conditioning prior to disposal of the sediments in a confined disposal site in the harbour area, is the most cost effective solution. Seven disposal sites with a capacity of 0.5 mill. m(3) have been identified. Two of the sites are integrated with a subsea road tunnel crossing the harbour basin. The other disposal sites will serve as new dock area after closure. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In the Nordics, transportation accounts for almost 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions, a higher share than most European countries. The International Energy Agency identifies modal shift as pivotal for a sustainable transition of the transport sector. This study analyses the role of modal shift in the decarbonisation of the Scandinavian energy system with TIMES-Nordic, the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) model depicting the national energy systems of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. For the first time, passenger and freight modal shift is modelled through substitution elasticities for a real case study. Transport elasticities from the literature are discussed in light of the modelling environment, and long-term direct elasticities are identified as suitable for the purpose. The results obtained with TIMES-Nordic and its version equipped with modal shift are compared under an increasing CO2 tax. For passenger, car is mainly substituted by rail and non-motorised modes, while for freight, rail replaces truck and ship. Modal shift results in a cost-effective mitigation measure, responsible for 26 PJ of lower fuel consumption in 2050, and 2.2% lower cumulative CO2 emissions from transport. A sensitivity analysis on the investment costs for electric cars reveals the ineffectiveness of the CO2 tax in stimulating car substitution in a future where electric cars are more competitive and the power sector almost decarbonised. Estimates of modal shift potentials from alternative methodologies are comparable to the results obtained, highlighting the methodology solidity. Lastly, a well-balanced technology characterization among modes is identified as crucial when enabling modal shift.

AB  - The most common tool to predict future changes in species range are species distribution models. These models do, however, often underestimate potential future habitat, as they do not account for phenotypic plasticity and local adaptation, although being the most important processes in the response of tree populations to rapid climate change. Here, we quantify the difference in the predictions of future range for Norway spruce, by (i) deriving a classic, occurrence-based species distribution model (OccurrenceSDM), and (ii) analysing the variation in juvenile tree height and translating this to species occurrence (TraitSDM). Making use of 32 site locations of the most comprehensive European trial series that includes 1,100 provenances of Norway spruce originating from its natural and further beyond from its largely extended, artificial distribution, we fit a universal response function to quantify growth as a function of site and provenance climate. Both the OccurrenceSDM and TraitSDM show a substantial retreat towards the northern latitudes and higher elevations (-55 and -43%, respectively, by the 2080s). However, thanks to the species' particularly high phenotypic plasticity in juvenile height growth, the decline is delayed. The TraitSDM identifies increasing summer heat paired with decreasing water availability as the main climatic variable that restricts growth, while a prolonged frost-free period enables a longer period of active growth and therefore increasing growth potential within the restricted, remaining area. Clear signals of local adaptation to climatic clines spanning the entire range are barely detectable, as they are disguised by a latitudinal cline. This cline strongly reflects population differentiation for the Baltic domain, but fails to capture the high phenotypic variation associated to the geographic heterogeneity in the Central European mountain ranges paired with the species history of postglacial migration. Still the model is used to provide recommendations of optimal provenance choice for future climate conditions. In essence, assisted migration may not decrease the predicted range decline of Norway spruce, but may help to capitalize on potential opportunities for increased growth associated with warmer climates.

AB  - Background: Restoration aims at reversing the trend of habitat degradation, the major threat to biodiversity. In Finland, more than half of the original peatland area has been drained, and during recent years, restoration of some of the drained peatlands has been accomplished. Short-term effects of the restoration on peatland hydrology, chemistry and vegetation are promising but little is known about how other species groups apart from vascular plants and bryophytes respond to restoration efforts.
   Results: Here, we studied how abundance and species richness of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) respond to restoration. We sampled larvae in three sites (restored, drained, pristine) on each of 12 different study areas. We sampled Odonata larvae before restoration (n = 12), during the first (n = 10) and the third (n = 7) year after restoration and used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the effect of restoration. Drained sites had lower abundance and species richness than pristine sites. During the third year after restoration both abundance and species richness had risen in restored sites.
   Conclusions: Our results show that Odonata suffer from drainage, but seem to benefit from peatland restoration and are able to colonize newly formed water pools already within three years after restoration.

AB  - A bloom of the fish-killing haptophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri in northern Norway during May and June 2019 was the most harmful algal event ever recorded in the region, causing massive mortalities of farmed salmon. Accordingly, oceanographic and biodiversity aspects of the bloom were studied in unprecedented detail, based on metabarcoding and physico-chemical and biotic factors related with the dynamics and distribution of the bloom. Light-and electron-microscopical observations of nanoplankton samples from diverse locations confirmed that C. leadbeateri was dominant in the bloom and the primary cause of associated fish mortalities. Cell counts by light microscopy and flow cytometry were obtained throughout the regional bloom within and adjacent to five fjord systems. Metabarcoding sequences of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene from field material collected during the bloom and a cultured isolate from offshore of Tromsoy island confirmed the species identification. Sequences from three genetic markers (18S, 28S rRNA gene and ITS region) verified the close if not identical genetic similarity to C. leadbeateri from a previous massive fish-killing bloom in 1991 in northern Norway. The distribution and cell abundance of C. leadbeateri and related Chrysochromulina species in the recent incident were tracked by integrating observations from metabarcoding sequences of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Metabarcoding revealed at least 14 distinct Chrysochromulina variants, including putative cryptic species. C. leadbeateri was by far the most abundant of these species, but with high intraspecific genetic vari-ability. Highest cell abundance of up to 2.7 x 107 cells L -1 of C. leadbeateri was found in Balsfjorden; the high cell densities were associated with stratification near the pycnocline (at ca. 12 m depth) within the fjord. The cell abundance of C. leadbeateri showed positive correlations with temperature, negative correlation with salinity, and a slightly positive correlation with ambient phosphate and nitrate concentrations. The spatio-temporal succession of the C. leadbeateri bloom suggests independent initiation from existing pre-bloom populations in local zones, perhaps sustained and supplemented over time by northeastward advection of the bloom from the fjords.

AB  - Key message The application of material selection principles uncovered eight possible alternative tree species (two deciduous and six coniferous species) to substitute Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and potentially prevent economic loss in European forest.
   Context Climate change is a major challenge for the Central European forest and timber industry. Increasing biotic (e.g. beetle damage) and abiotic (e.g. drought) calamities have led to major losses in forest value, especially on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) stands. Therefore, a transition to climate change adapted forest management is necessary. Concurrently, neophytes (e.g. tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco), grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.) and Paulownia (Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.) Steud.)) are increasing their dominance in forest communities and causing additional adaption of the forest ecosystem. Both factors will lead to significant changes in wood species distributions in Central European forests, mainly at the expanse of Norway spruce, over the next decades.
   Aims Choosing the "right" tree species for afforestation will become ever more complex and will require a holistic approach that combines forestry and technological aspects alike. Therefore, this review presents a selection approach based on available wood material data from literature and the material selection principles proposed by M. Ashby with the aim to identify suitable alternatives for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and further concisely assess their silvicultural relevance.
   Methods For this wood species comparison and selection process, dry and raw density, bending strength and modulus of elasticity were chosen as key properties. Beam- and plate-like components subjected to a bending load were chosen as representative use cases.
   Results European birch (Betula spp.), grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) were identified as suitable alternatives for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) from a technological as well as silvicultural point of view. In addition, Paulownia (Paulownia tomentosa (Thunb.) Steud.), Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere), yellow pine (Pinus strobus L.), western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don in Lambert) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) offer a technological advantage but currently lack relevance in the forest sector.
   Conclusion The proposed selection process offers an evaluation of technical performance, and in combination with an assessment of the silvicultural relevance, it will be possible to optimize the wood-supply chain and prevent future economic loss of Central European forests.

AB  - A short-core paleolimnological investigation was carried out to acquire knowledge of the recent history of Lake Pihlajavesi, Saimaa Lake complex, and define its natural state before cultural disturbances. In the natural state, with negligible human interference, the basin was oligotrophic and oxygen-rich. The bioproductivity in the littoral zone was low and the profundal benthic quality was good according to Wiederholm's Benthic Quality Index.
   Based on diatom analyses, no significant changes have taken place in the phytoplankton communities during the past decades. Sedimentary chironomid communities reveal, however, slight changes on profundal life in the Pihlajavedenselka basin, near the main pollution sources, whereas there were no significant changes in the outer basin. Three stages could be distinguished in the pollution history of Pihlajavedenselka: (1) 'The natural state' up until the 1960s, (2) 'the period of increasing loading' during the 1960s and 1970s, and (3) 'the recovery of the basin' during the past two decades.
   Untreated municipal waste water from the town of Savonlinna was partly responsible for the commencement of eutrophication in the Pihlajavedenselka basin in the 1960s. The paper and pulp industry in Varkaus, some 40 kilometres upstream from Lake Pihlajanvesi, has also increased eutrophication, especially during the worst period of water quality in the 1960s and 1970s. More effective waste water purification has markedly reduced effluent loading and led to a general recovery of the area. Neverthless the effects of slight nutrient loading can still be seen, especially in littoral bioproductivity.
   Our paleolimnological data indicate that the present ecosystem will offer living conditions for the endemic Saimaa ringed seal population that are similar to those that existed prior to human disturbances.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. Although LCA is traditionally a site-independent tool, there is currently a trend towards making LCA more site-dependent if not site-specific. For Europe, site-dependent impact factors have been calculated on a country basis for acidification, terrestrial eutrophication and toxicological impacts. It is, however, an open question whether this is the Optimum level for site-dependent factors. The aim of this paper is to develop site-dependent characterisation factors for different parts of Sweden for air emissions of NO., SO and particulates regarding ecosystem and human health impacts. Based on experiences from a case-study, the usability of the site-dependent factors for LCA are discussed, as well as the appropriate level of site-dependency for ecosystem and human health impacts.
   Methodology. The Ecosense model is used for calculating site-dependent factors for some atmospheric pollutants. Characterisation factors are calculated for four different places in Sweden with two different stack heights.
   Results and Conclusions. The characterisation factors for ecosystem impacts show fairly small differences between different parts of Sweden (within a factor of two). For health impacts, the differences between different parts of the country were larger and more significant (up to one order of magnitude). Also the difference between low and high stack heights may be relevant, especially in densely populated areas. These results suggest that for ecosystems, site-dependent characterisation factors for the considered atmospheric pollutants on a country level may be sufficient for most applications. However, for health impacts, site-dependent factors on a country level may be inappropriate. Beside LCA, the calculated factors and the methodology used should also be useful for other environmental system analysis tools, such as Strategic Environmental Assessment, Cost-Benefit Analysis and Environmental Management Systems.

AB  - The challenges for society presented by climate change are complex and demanding. This paper focuses on one particular resource of utmost necessity and vulnerability to climate change: namely, the provisioning of safe drinking water. From a critical perspective on the role of expertise in risk debates, this paper looks at how Swedish experts understand risk to drinking water in a climate change scenario and how they reason about challenges to risk management and adaptation strategies. The empirical material derives from ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with experts, employed both at government agencies and at universities, and with disciplinary backgrounds in a variety of fields (water engineering, planning, geology and environmental chemistry). The experts understand risk factors affecting both drinking water quality and availability as complex and systemically interrelated. A lack of political saliency of drinking water as a public service is identified as an obstacle to the development of robust adaptation strategies. Another area of concern relates to the geographical, organizational and institutional boundaries (regulatory, political and epistemological) between the plethora of public actors with partly overlapping and sometimes unclear responsibilities for the provisioning of safe drinking water. The study concludes that climate change adaptation regarding drinking water provisioning will require a new integration of the knowledge of systemic risk relations, in combination with more efficient agency collaboration based on a clear demarcation of responsibility between actors.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the quality of management practices of public hospitals in the Australian healthcare system, specifically those in the state-managed health systems of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW). Further, the authors assess the management practices of Queensland and NSW public hospitals jointly and globally benchmark against those in the health systems of seven other countries, namely, USA, UK, Sweden, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.
   Design/methodology/approach - In this study, the authors adapt the unique and globally deployed Bloom et al. (2009) survey instrument that uses a "double blind, double scored" methodology and an interview-based scoring grid to measure and internationally benchmark the management practices in Queensland and NSW public hospitals based on 21 management dimensions across four broad areas of management - operations, performance monitoring, targets and people management.
   Findings - The findings reveal the areas of strength and potential areas of improvement in the Queensland and NSW Health hospital management practices when compared with public hospitals in seven countries, namely, USA, UK, Sweden, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. Together, Queensland and NSW Health hospitals perform best in operations management followed by performance monitoring. While target management presents scope for improvement, people management is the sphere where these Australian hospitals lag the most.
   Practical implications - This paper is of interest to both hospital administrators and health care policy-makers aiming to lift management quality at the hospital level as well as at the institutional level, as a vehicle to consistently deliver sustainable high-quality health services.
   Originality/value - This study provides the first internationally comparable robust measure of management capability in Australian public hospitals, where hospitals are run independently by the state-run healthcare systems. Additionally, this research study contributes to the empirical evidence base on the quality of management practices in the Australian public healthcare systems of Queensland and NSW.

AB  - Fatal motor vehicle intersection crashes occurring in Norway in the years 2005-2007 were analyzed to identify causation patterns among their underlying contributing factors, and also to assess if the data collection and documentation procedures used by the Norwegian in-depth investigation teams produces the information necessary to do causation pattern analysis. 28 fatal accidents were analyzed. Causation charts of contributing factors were first coded for each driver in each crash using the Driving Reliability and Error Analysis Method (DREAM). Next, the charts were aggregated based on a combination of conflict types and whether the driver was going straight or turning. Analysis results indicate that drivers who were performing a turning maneuver in these crashes faced perception difficulties and unexpected behavior from the primary conflict vehicle, while at the same time trying to negotiate a demanding traffic situation. Drivers who were going straight on the other hand had less perception difficulties but largely expect any turning drivers to yield, which led to either slow reaction or no reaction at all. In terms of common contributing factors, those often pointed to in literature as contributing to fatal crashes, e.g. high speed, drugs and/or alcohol and inadequate driver training, contributed in 12 of 28 accidents. This confirms their prevalence, but also shows that most drivers end up in these situations due to combinations of less auspicious contributing factors. In terms of data collection and documentation, there was an asymmetry in terms of reported obstructions to view due to signposts and vegetation. These were frequently reported as contributing for turning drivers, but rarely reported as contributing for their counterparts in the same crashes. This probably reflects an involuntary focus of the analyst on identifying contributing factors for the driver held legally liable, while less attention is paid to the driver judged not at fault. Since who to blame often is irrelevant from a countermeasure development point of view, this underlying investigator approach needs to be addressed to avoid future bias in crash investigation reports.

AB  - Through his metaphor of landscapes of meaning, Reed provides a way of looking at meaning in terms of how it explains action, with the assumption that action occurs within landscapes of meaning. However, my ethnographic evidence suggests that Reed's metaphor needs to enlarge its scope. In doing this I use my research on immigrant girls in Sweden. The aim is to demonstrate that people can and do live across, within and between landscapes of meaning. This interstitiality can both produce extreme hardship and possibilities of freedom and agency. I share the story of one person, Nazira, who is negotiating with different social and cultural worlds. This allows her to criticize different cultural contexts and to work towards emergent cultural forms. I conclude by arguing that my ethnographical accounts could be used in support and as a critique of the theoretical understanding of landscapes of meaning within Reed's interpretivist sociology.

AB  - The article examines academic leaders' conceptions of research profiling. Global science policies, including the Finnish governmental policy, promote the identification of areas of research excellence and recommend resource concentration on them. However, as active agents, leaders may have competing, even conflicting views on the pros and cons of the institutional norm of selective research excellence and research steering. Drawing on the ideas of micro-level institutionalism, this study seeks answers to the following questions: What kinds of conceptions of research profiling do the academic leaders have? How are these connected to the goals that the leaders are trying to achieve with profiling? The data comprised 15 interviews with leaders at different organisational levels in two Finnish research universities. Two general conceptions of research profiling were identified: profiling as an instrument of strategic management and profiling as symbolic management. The conceptions were connected to various rationales, such as strengthening research and communicating to the external environment. By emphasising the variability and incoherence of leaders' conceptions and the underlying rationalities, the study contributes to understanding how academic leaders make sense of the complex issues they face and how they cope with various demands.

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as storms, may cause material damage, injuries, and interfere with day-to-day operation of societies. Earlier research on natural hazards and climate change adaptation has found that demographic and socioeconomic factors influence the way individuals prepare for and are affected by natural hazards. However, research often focuses on areas with high exposure and vulnerability and research on low exposure and vulnerability areas is scarcer. To address this gap, we ask: do socioeconomic and demographic factors matter in how individuals prepare for and are affected by storms in Finland? Our data consist of an internet survey (n = 1014) conducted after a severe winter storm hit Finland in the beginning of 2019, and we analyze the data with Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions. Our results show that respondents? education level or employment status are not connected to whether they took preparedness measures or whether they experienced harm. Instead, the type of residential property does play a part. In addition, respondents who had experienced storm-related harm during recent years are more likely to prepare than those who have not. In conclusion, socio-demographic factors seem to have only marginal influence on storm preparedness or experienced impacts in Finland, which contradicts earlier research. This may stem from the relatively equal distribution of well-being among the population.

AB  - Planted forests are seen as a means to meet increasing demand for timber and environmental services and thus to achieve sustainable forest development. In this paper, we use the Faustmann-Hartman silvicultural investment model to demonstrate how policy instruments influence planted forest development and review such a development in China, the U.S., Brazil, and France. We find that planted forests emerge because of scarcity in timber and environmental services and develop in response to economic and policy and institutional instruments, including secure property rights, stumpage price policy, and efficient forestry governance and administration.

   Research Question/Issue:
   Examining how corporate boards can create a sustainable competitive advantage is an understudied area of research in corporate governance. This area of research is advanced in this study, which examines: How can boards improve the performance of their strategic tasks by using their information advantages?
   Research Findings/Insights:
   The study examines 318 responses of CEOs from survey data collected in the years 2003 and 2005 from Norway. We found differences between using diverse information and possessing diverse information. Using diverse information has a higher impact on the board's current strategic tasks performance than possessing diverse information. However, possessing diverse information is more likely to improve both the board's current and future strategic tasks performance than using diverse information.
   Theoretical/Academic Implications:
   First, this study has extended the analysis of board capital by including a dynamic dimension of using diverse information. Second, this study links a resource-based view with a perspective of information biases in a diverse group. Diverse information is valuable for improving the quality of group decision-making; however, improper use of diverse information due to information biases could reduce the quality. We thus suggest examining possible behavioral biases in using information in a diverse board, specifically through each of the three practices of open discussion, effective leadership, and active search.
   Practitioner/Policy Implications:
   Controlling sampling, repetition, and evaluation biases is necessary in a diverse board. It helps to reduce behavioral biases, and therefore ensure the quality of using diverse information. Consequently, it improves the board's current strategic tasks performance that may not necessarily be achieved by merely having a diverse board.

AB  - This article discusses the construction details of the mounds erected over large Viking ship burials in Norway and shows that they form an integral part of mortuary practice. Moreover, elements of the construction that are potentially unique to this type of monument are repeated, suggesting a knowledge of the properties of materials and their inter-relationships within the mounds. Here, referencing between and within the mounds is considered alongside the connections these soils, sediments, and other earth-sourced materials contained in relation to the cultural landscape. The selection of such materials and the location of the burials in the landscape were fundamental to the creation of a performative scene for the burial rites, and for establishing a desired, interlinked, social memory.

AB  - Virtual meetings (VMs), i.e. audio-, video- and web-conferencing, could be used to decrease the environmental impact of business activities, reduce travel costs, increase business mobility and collaboration, and improve flexibility and productivity of the employees. Swedish national policy supports the implementation of VMs as one of the solutions towards low carbon infrastructure and sustainable transportation. There are, however, uncertainties and disagreements about the organisational effects of the increased VM use. This article explores the potential effects that VMs may have on an organisation. It does so by examining the presence and strength of these effects in a number of public and private organisations in Sweden. Data has been collected through a literature review and 23 in-depth interviews complemented by a survey in three organisations. The results are analysed with a special focus on seeking explanations for diverging opinions among the respondents and in the literature. The findings indicate that organisational effects of VMs depend on the following factors: organisational perception of the virtual toolbox, behaviour and rebound effects, and the organisation's virtual maturity. The later refers to the penetration and diversity of the collaborative tools used in the organisation and is divided into three stages: substitution, diffusion and integration. As the use of VMs grows in the organisation, different effects will emerge and eventually subside. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The moose (Alces alces) is a dominant large mammalian herbivore in the world's boreal zones. Moose exert significant browsing impacts on forest vegetation and are therefore often at the centre of wildlife-forestry conflicts. Consequently, understanding the drivers of their foraging behaviour is crucial for mitigating such conflicts. Management of moose in large parts of its range currently largely ignores the fact that moose foraging is influenced by increasing populations of sympatric deer species. In such multispecies systems, resource partitioning may be driven by foraging height and bite size. Feeding competition with smaller species might replace larger species from the field layer and drive them towards higher foraging strata offering larger bites. This bite size hypothesis has been well documented for African ungulate communities. Based on a large diet DNA metabarcoding dataset we suggest that feeding competition from three smaller deer species (red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama, and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) over Vaccinium shrubs in the forest field layer might drive moose towards increasing consumption of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Sweden. We found that in areas of high deer density, moose diets consistently contained less Vaccinium and higher proportions of pine over three spring periods. Utilization of these food items by the smaller deer species was either unaffected by deer density or, for Vaccinium showed the opposite pattern to moose, i.e., increases of proportions in the diet of roe and red deer with increasing deer density. Availability of pine and Vaccinium, measured as proportion of available bites, did not explain the observed patterns. Our results suggest that managing key food items like Vaccinium and the populations of smaller deer may play an important role in controlling browsing impacts of moose on pine.

AB  - Management by objectives (MBO) is a technique for integrating ecological concerns into national political and administrative structures. Politicians determine environmental objectives and interim targets to be implemented and assessed by civil servants in national, regional, and local contexts. Well-developed organizational communication is a prerequisite for MBO. However, communication-related obstacles can arise when using MBO in public environmental management. We examine communicative aspects of environmental MBO, looking specifically at the implementation, administration, and assessment of Swedish environmental quality objectives. Our argument is illustrated by quotations from individual and focus group interviews. We conclude that communicative problems may arise, because different actors interpret messages from different perspectives, depending on their agendas, prior knowledge and experience, and positions in the administrative system. It is crucial to recognize the dialogical aspects of communication, by involving the receiver of a message in a process of response. In addition, the different timeframes underlying different arguments could contribute to misunderstandings between actors involved in handling environmental issues. In assessing the achievement of environmental objectives, indicators are used as communicative tools. It is important to investigate whether and how these indicators contribute to the de- and recontextualization of environmental objectives.

AB  - The fashion industry faces major challenges in reducing its environmental impacts along the textile value chain, from fibre production, via various processing steps, use phase and to the end-of-life stage. A major challenge is how to shift from the current linear industry to a circular one, where textiles are both sustainably produced, and after the full life length, recycled into new fibres with high value applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the environmental impacts of post-consumer textile fibre-to-fibre recycling by cellulose carbamate technology, in terms of climate impact, water scarcity impact, cumulative energy demand and land use impact. By performing life cycle assessment, it was shown that the chemically recycled cellulose carbamate fibre has a climate impact of about 2.2 kg CO2-eq per kg fibre, water scarcity impact of 1.6 m3 H2O-eq per kg fibre, cumulative energy demand of 90 MJ-eq per kg fibre and land use impact of about 92 Pt per kg fibre (when applying mass allocation of co-products). Hotspots identified during the fibre production technology were electricity use and production of sodium hydroxide. In a sensitivity analysis, it was shown that the choice of electricity has a major influence on the results, and by using a renewable electricity mix over an average Finnish electricity mix, the impact could be decreased for all impact categories, except when using bioenergy, which would increase the land use impact. Compared to primary fibres like viscose and conventional cotton, these impacts are in the lower to middle range, showing potential to lower environmental impacts when moving towards an increased amounts of recycled post-consumer textile fibre with high value applications, that can replace primary fibres.

AB  - The glacier system covering Europe's highest mountain, Elbrus, has exhibited an accelerated retreat since 1980. Some studies have related this retreat to a significant summer temperature increasing trend. Relief- and aspect-related parameters for the glacierized area have an important impact on glacier changes. In this paper, the changes in glacier area are identified, quantified and correlated with relief parameters for the period 1985-2007. Spatial analysis was performed using the GLAM-CD (Glacier Mapper Change Detector) algorithm. The input data for this algorithm were Landsat 5 images, the Aster Global Digital Elevation and the glacier outlines from the GLIMS project (Global Land Ice Measurements from Space). Regression analyses between glacier area losses and relief-related parameters indicate a significant positive relation with the altitude and a significant negative relation with the glacier surface area. In this context, we used a correlated component regression to model these relations. The model explains >50% of the total variation.

AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) are playing an increasingly important role in energy markets around the world. It is necessary to evaluate the benefits from a higher level of RES integration with respect to a more active cross-border transmission system. In particular, this paper focuses on the sustainable energy transitions for Finland and Italy, since they have two extreme climate conditions in Europe and quite different profiles in terms of energy production and demand. We developed a comprehensive energy system model using EnergyPLAN with hourly resolution for a reference year for both countries. The models include electricity, heat and transportation sectors. According to the current base models, new scenarios reflecting an RES increase in total fuel consumption have been proposed. The future shares of renewables are based on each nation's potential. The outcomes of the new scenarios support the future national plans, showing how decarburization in an energy system can occur in relation to the European Roadmap 2030 and 2050. In addition, possible power transmission between Italy and Finland were investigated according to the vision of an integrated European energy system with more efficient cross-border activities.

AB  - Most investigations of human impacts on biodiversity have been conducted within 1-3 years post-disturbance, although many biological responses develop over a longer period of time and annual community variation cannot be fully controlled. We therefore conducted a follow-up of carabid beetles over ten years in Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated forests in Southern Finland, harvested using replicated logging treatments of different intensities. We collected carabids using pitfall traps in 1995 (prior to logging) and during four post-harvest seasons, 1996-98 (three first post-harvest summers) and 2006 (ten years after harvesting). The treatments were clear-cutting (no retained trees), modified clear-cutting (retention of three groups of 20-30 trees within a one-hectare plot) and gap cutting (three 0.16-ha openings within a one-hectare plot), and control (mature unharvested forest). (1) Total species richness and open-habitat carabids increased in gaps and in the two clear-cutting treatments, whereas forest carabids were slightly less abundant in clear-cuts than in the other treatments in 1997. These patterns were most evident in the second and third post-harvest summers. (2) Open habitat carabids were less abundant and less speciose in both cleared and retained patches of gap cuts than in clear-cuts, Pterostichus adstrictus was more abundant in clear-cuts than in retained patches of modified clear-cuts or gap cuts, and carabid assemblage was more altered in both types of clear-cut than in gap cuts. (3) Ten years after logging, open-habitat carabid numbers were still elevated, whereas Calathus micropterus was less abundant, in the two types of clear-cut than in gap cuts or control stands. (4) We also found remarkable annual variation in carabid assemblages, such that was independent of logging. We conclude that even modest retention provides long-term support for forest carabids, but also that their full assemblage recovery takes longer than 10 years.

AB  - In high-income countries such as Finland, personal healthcare is organised around the management of lifestyle risks and minimisation of such risks forms a key part of public health policy. While the scientific development of the lifestyle risk model has been thoroughly studied, there has been less research on the history of popular experiences of the model. In this article, I examine lay people's response to a pioneering heart disease prevention programme in north-eastern Finland in the 1970s, the North Karelia Project, which promoted the lifestyle risk model. I use archival data from early 1970s that recorded the project interactions with the local population and their reactions to the project. I show that although local residents in North Karelia responded positively to the project, they did not necessarily subscribe to its preventive and risk minimising objectives. In an area of limited health resources, the project provided local residents with access to medical expertise. Local reactions indicated a clash of a cultural notion of illness embedded in the social life-world of Karelians with a specific rationality of government emphasising individual responsibility vis-a-vis heart conditions. Local residents who were critical of the public health risk model tended to minimise the role of lifestyle risk factors in cardiovascular disease causation or subsumed these factors into a more encompassing explanation that stressed the effects of the on-going structural social change in the area, highlighting the sense of loss caused by the waning of traditional small farm existence and their anxiety about the resulting economic and social insecurity.

KW  - Scandinavia
KW  - Carrot pest
AB  - Cultural control methods in integrated pest management (IPM) refer to practices that modify the agricultural environment in ways that favour crop protection to the detriment of pest performance. Trap cropping is one of these practices and involves luring insect pests away from the main crop to a more attractive host plant growing beside or around the crop. The trap crop can then be destroyed, and the pest killed. The carrot psyllid, Trioza apicalis Forster (Homoptera: Triozidae), is one of the most important carrot pests in Scandinavia, and cultural control of this pest could be achieved through the introduction of more attractive cultivars of carrots in the trap crop at different sowing times than used for the main crop. In a multichoice bioassay and a field experiment, T. apicalis females oviposited the highest numbers of eggs on the most developed carrot plants in the trap crop, while different carrot cultivars did not play any role in females' choice, In the field experiment, probability of damage was highly correlated with number of eggs counted on the plants, which was highest on the most developed plants. The cultivar Bolero was used as trap crop in subsequent trials in three commercial carrot fields in different regions of Sweden. The trap crop concentrated the egg laying to the field edges and it decreased with increasing distance within the main crop from the first row of carrots, while this pattern could not be observed in control plots. These first results are promising, but further trials to better quantify efficacy and to evaluate the spatial design of the trap crop in field, at different sites and population pressure, are needed before trap cropping can be a reliable strategy for carrot psyllid control.

AB  - To help move society towards more sustainable states, policies have been developed in various countries to create a circular bioeconomy (CBE) in biobased sectors such as forestry and agriculture. In operationalizing CBE, initiatives must be created in which feedback loops between life-cycle stages are established to enable a "stock" of resources to be recirculated in the economy. By creating such feedback loops, CBE aims to decouple economic growth from natural resource depletion and degradation. However, few CBE initiatives have been developed. This implementation gap has partly arisen because policies to promote CBE are somewhat theoretical and do not seem to be informed by the practical realities of implementing CBE initiatives on the ground. While CBE policies do not and should not set out detailed implementation plans to address these issues, they do need to better account for how favourable circumstances and contexts can be created for the development of CBE initiatives. In response, this paper critically examines how possibility spaces can be created for the development of CBE initiatives. Assemblage thinking is used in longitudinal case study research focused on a major CBE initiative situated in the south of Sweden: Foodhills. Assemblage thinking is both an approach and method widely used in geography to study how spaces for action such as the construction of CBE initiatives are created. As such, the paper identifies and unpacks multiple issues arising in the development of CBE initiatives on the ground including geographical relations, actor networks and power.

AB  - Logging residue ("slash") left on clear-cuttings may affect the microhabitat complexity, and thereby indirectly the beetle (Coleoptera) populations. In three regions (West, North and East) of south and central Sweden, we studied short-term effects of slash removal on species richness and abundance of beetles, collected by pitfall trapping in 16 clear-cuttings (<1 year old) in coniferous and mixed forests. The sites were managed in two alternative ways, either slash was removed (SR), or slash was left (SL). Overall, the number of morphospecies per trap was significantly higher on SL sites than on SR sites. Species richness differed significantly between the regions, the Western region being the poorest in number of species per trap. Rarefaction plots of species richness in four sites suggested that accumulation rate of species differed between two SR sites but rates were similar for two SL sites. Microhabitat structure was measured by aboveground height of slash heaps. Slash height was positively correlated with the number of sticks in slash heap and fractal dimension, respectively. There was a positive relationship between the number of individuals per trap and slash height in SR sites in the Western and Eastern regions, but not in the Northern one. We concluded that extensive slash removal leads to impoverish species richness of Coleoptera. at a local scale. Slash heaps left on site may provide important refuges for ground-active beetles. Moreover, our results supported the general theory that microhabitat structure affects arthropod abundance and diversity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using national and international research survey data and applying a combination of models and mapping tools, this study revealed temperature and depth as the crucial environmental drivers of both the distribution and the abundance of four benthopelagic chondrichthyans inhabiting Norwegian and Icelandic waters: rabbitfish (Chimaera monstrosa), velvet-belly lanternshark (Etmopterus spinax), blackmouth catshark (Galeus melastomus) and spurdog (Squalus acanthias). C. monstrosa and E. spinax seem to prefer similar spatial and ecological habitats, that is deep and cold waters. In contrast, G. melastomus and S. acanthias both prefer similar ecological habitats, that is warmer and shallower waters; nonetheless, they exhibit a different spatial distribution pattern. The species' varied habitat and spatial preferences may lead to different levels of exposure to fishing activities and associated by-catch risks. Findings of the species' spatial distributions and their driving forces are expected to inform the sustainable management of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit.

AB  - The controlled upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water in oligotrophic coastal regions has been proposed as a means of increasing phytoplankton and, subsequently, bivalve aqua culture production. This was tested as part of a large-scale upwelling experiment in an oligo trophic environment (Lysefjord, Norway). The mean chlorophyll a concentration in the upwelling area was consistently higher than at the control site (mean +/- SD: 3.3 +/- 1.9 and 1.5 +/- 0.6 mg chl a m(-3), respectively) during the 4 mo of controlled upwelling. After 2 mo with upwelling, the dry flesh weight of 1 yr old and 2 yr old mussels was 95% and 24% higher, respectively, than that of the mussels at the control site. The 1 yr old mussels (Mytilus edulis) at the upwelling site achieved up to 2.4-fold higher dry flesh weight compared to the control. Reproductive output was also higher at the upwelling site and only there, spawning of 1 yr old mussels was detected. Standardized clearance and respiration rates showed maximum values during the most intense period of tissue growth. Average ingestion rates were 40% higher at the upwelling than at the control site. Tissue growth and clearance rates were not correlated with the measured seston parameters, suggesting that food acquisition was responsive to other exogenous parameters and/or to increased endogenous energy demands. It was concluded that the sustained upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water in an oligotrophic fjord can increase phytoplankton biomass, resulting in improved mussel growth performance and increased aquaculture production carrying capacity. Thus, controlled upwelling represents a simple but effective ecosystem engineering approach for enhancing human food production.

AB  - Fisheries contribute to food and nutrition security, livelihoods, and poverty alleviation for billions of people globally. However, human-environmental interactions in fisheries are rarely assessed locally, regionally, and globally at the same time, limiting social-ecological resilience in fisheries management. We evaluated worldwide catches of a keystone forage fish (Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus) over 65 years (1950-2014); modeled local, regional, and global interactions among industrial, artisanal, subsistence, and recreational fishing sectors; and predicted future catches using a multifaceted and multilayered human-nature coupling framework for assessing social-ecological interactions within and across adjacent and distant fisheries (termed "metacouplings"). Across 17 exclusive economic zones (EEZs), catches by nations in their own EEZs (7.1 x 10(7) metric tons [MT]) outweighed those in adjacent EEZs (5.3 x 10(7) MT). However, adjacent-EEZ fishing was the largest-tonnage fishing type in more EEZs (53 %), reflecting the proximity of Northern/Western European fishing nations and regulations conducive to fishing in neighboring waters. Catches in distant (non-adjacent) EEZs were relatively small (1.2 x 10(7) MT). Fishing-sector interactions were generally positive but notably negative for artisanal fishing, which declined with increasing industrial and recreational catches in five EEZs (29 %). Combined with projected declines in artisanal and subsistence catches in parts of Germany, Norway, and Sweden, metacoupling interactions could elicit harmful financial, food-supply, and food/nutrition security outcomes for small-scale fishers if metacouplings remain absent from management programs. However, quantitative and conceptual tools developed herein enable fisheries managers to identify where, when, and how to maximize positive and minimize negative metacoupling interactions and thereby ensure continued ecological, economic, nutritional, and sociocultural benefits for fisheries stakeholders, locally to globally.

AB  - It is foreseen that distributed power generation, using biogas and natural gas as fuel, will play increasingly important role in the future European energy market. These technologies are presenting controllable power generation capacity as complementary to the installed intermittent renewable power generation in terms of wind and solar.
   A nationally funded project was initiated in Stavanger, Norway in 2010, led by the Center for Sustainable Energy Solutions (cenSE), to investigate use of existing small scale energy conversion technologies developed for natural gas, using as much as possible biogas mixed with natural gas without any hardware modifications to the energy conversion units. Three test setups with a micro gas turbine (100 kWe), a gas engine (11 kWe) and a short stack of solid oxide fuel cell consisting of six cells (30-40 We) were installed for experimental studies, providing necessary data for model validation and development of data driven models for engine performance monitoring.
   This paper reports the results of the project, concerning mapping the operational window for use of mixture of simulated biogas (50% methane, 50% CO2) and natural gas for each technology as an enabler of biogas utilization with natural gas as fallback solution. The CO2 reduction potential, when natural gas is replaced with biogas, is also presented. Moreover, the capability of using data driven models based on artificial neural network for online monitoring and control of the engine performance at various operational conditions is shown.
   Detailed reporting on various aspects of fuel composition and technology impact has been conducted earlier. This paper provides a total overview and a comparison of performance of the technologies tested in this study.

AB  - Sweden is a decentralised country where local managers, who are key actors in water management, often deal with relatively difficult prioritisations, tradeoffs and conflicting goals. Many of these challenges relate to the effective implementation of the European Union Water Framework Directive. As an input to these challenges, the present paper elicits and analyses local and semi-local citizens' preferences for water quality attributes related to the European Water Framework directive in a river basin located in southeast of Sweden. Based on a choice experiment tailored to the case study area, the paper analyses preferences for selected attributes based on real criteria for ecological water status in the implementation of the directive. The target population lives in the municipalities through which the river passes, or in municipalities neighbouring those. Despite this spatial proximity to the river, the analysis reveals limited knowledge and interest in matters related to the environmental quality of the river. There is no evidence that preferences differ between respondents with regard to experience or knowledge about the water basin, nor with regard to recreational habits in the area. These results offer input to local water management by providing information about preferences for explicit water quality attributes.

AB  - Increased numbers of great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) in the Baltic Sea may have local impacts on fisheries and salmonid hatcheries. We studied spatial and temporal variability in cormorant diet, and potential consumption of hatchery salmonids, by analysing knee subcutaneous adipose tissue fatty acids (FA) of specimens (N = 77) collected along Swedish and Finnish coasts in different seasons during 2013-2017. The FA profiles of the subspecies sinensis and carbo were similar, with large individual variation. The proportion of C18 polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) was the largest in the north, whereas the proportion of C20-22 monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) increased towards the south, reflecting diminishing freshwater and increasing marine food web characteristics towards the south. As an exception, the C20-22 MUFA percentage was high in sinensis collected in June 2017 from the northern Baltic Sea. The source of C20-22 MUFAs was probably hatchery salmonids, raised on ocean fish hatchery feed and released 10 days before, near the cormorant capture site. The FA profiles of northern and southern cormorants differed from each other both in early and late summer samples, suggesting spatially different diets. The largest individual variation was found in 22:1n-11, characteristic of ocean zooplanktivorous fish, and likely originating from Atlantic wild or Baltic Sea hatchery-reared fish. This study shows that adipose tissue FA profiles can be used as proxies for seabird diet monitoring and indicators of predation on hatchery-reared fish. Obtaining quantitative estimates on the proportions of dietary fish species requires future feeding experiments, allowing calibration between the FA compositions and diet.

AB  - Anthropogenic environmental stressors (like atmospheric deposition, land use change, and climate warming) are predicted to increase inorganic nitrogen and organic carbon loading to northern boreal lakes, with potential consequences for denitrification in lakes. However, our ability to predict effects of these changes is currently limited as northern boreal lakes have been largely neglected in denitrification studies. The aim of this study was therefore to assess how maximum potential denitrification and N2O production rates, and the relationship between the two (relative N2O production), is controlled by availability of nitrate (NO3), carbon (C), phosphorus (P), and temperature. Experiments were performed using the acetylene inhibition technique on sediments from a small, nutrient poor boreal lake in northern Sweden in 2014. Maximum potential denitrification and N2O production rates at 4 C were reached already at NO3 additions of 106-120 fig NO3-N/L, and remained unchanged with higher NO3 amendments. Higher incubation temperatures increased maximum potential denitrification and N2O production rates, and Q10 was somewhat higher for N2O production (1.77) than for denitrification (1.69). The relative N2O production ranged between 13% and 64%, and was not related to NO3-concentration, but the ratio increased when incubations were amended with C and P (from a median of 16% to 27%). Combined, our results suggests that unproductive northern boreal lakes currently have low potential for denitrification but are susceptible to small changes in NO3 loading especially if these are accompanied by enhanced C and P availability, likely promoting higher N2O production relative to N-2.

AB  - Wolves' attacks on hunting dogs are a major conflict between wolves and hunters in Northern Europe. The reasons affecting the risk of wolves' (Canis lupus) attacks on hunting dogs are poorly known. We examined whether the number of wolves in territory, the territory size, and the space use of GPS-collared wolves affected the risk of fatal attacks during hunting season in Finland. We found that attacks were more frequent within the periphery than core of the territory. Based on locations of GPS-collared wolves, wolves spent 8% (range 2-12%, n = 17) of time within the border zone (11% of the territory area) of their territory. Forty-five percent of all attacks considered (n = 11) took place within this zone which was high proportion as compared to the distribution of wolf locations. This result might reflect wolves' motivational status to eliminate potential competitors when they are moving near territory boundaries.

TI  - Staging Henrik Ibsen's and Jon Fosse's Mental Landscapes: Myth, Allegory, and Mise-en-Scene in <i>The Lady from the Sea </i>and <i>Someone is Going to Come</i>

LA  - English
KW  - Norwegian theatre
KW  - Henrik Ibsen
KW  - Jon Fosse

KW  - symbolist theatre
KW  - allegory
AB  - Norway's best-known contemporary playwright Jon Fosse has often been compared to Henrik Ibsen, no less because of the two dramatists' common emphasis on their native physical landscape as a mirror of the protagonists' emotional and existential conflict. In Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea (1888) and in Fosse's Someone is Going to Come (1996) in particular, characters and actions - although generated within specific geographical and cultural co-ordinates - rise to the level of archetypes and acquire timeless significance.
   This comparative study traces a continuum from the modernist Ibsen to Fosse's humanistic postmodernism in so far as the authors' treatment of psychology, structure, and landscape exposes ideas and endorses themes and images, which in turn account for similar patterns of staging. In a context whereby myth and allegory are projected against a background defined b y the ocean and unfamiliar horizons, the markedly schematic representation of existential dread in both plays reveals strong visual conceits that are uncannily similar to the effect that one cannot really read or direct Fosse without making a mental note of Ibsen's drama. The "haunted" nature of the spectator's experience notwithstanding, both texts seem to be a director's ideal material, hosting the natural environment so intensely so that it becomes an extension of the characters, punctuating the important stations in their lives and adding emotional and sensory texture to their words and their actions. From the point-of-view of a theatre director, decoding the plays' imagistic identity becomes primarily an immersive experience in the Nordic landscape - of both nature and the mind.

AB  - This paper explores arrangements and conditions enabling and constraining teacher collaboration to extend classrooms through Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). It draws implications from a participatory action research project in three small, rural Finnish schools funded by the European Social Fund (2015-2017). Data were mainly collected through discussions and interviews with five teachers. The theory of practice architectures serves as a theoretical and analytical framework. The collaboration challenged and enabled cultural-discursive, material-economic, and social-political arrangements on three levels. On a classroom level, the VLE enabled new teaching practices (e.g., student collaboration, formative assessment). However, a lack of digital competence among teachers and students hindered the cross-classroom collaboration. On a school level, the school leaders enabled or constrained the arrangements depending on the provided support or lack thereof (e.g., schedules, faculty involvement). On a regional level, the infrastructure (e.g., transportation) for collaboration would require arrangements developed in dialogue with the schools (e.g., digital systems). The paper concludes that changing teaching practices in relation to VLEs requires slowly evolving previous and new architectures simultaneously on all three levels.

AB  - Streamside forests are preserved from clear-cut logging in production forests and protected with uncut buffer strips in many countries. However, buffer strips often remain narrow due to economic reasons and, therefore, provide weak protection against adverse edge effects of clear-cuts and are vulnerable to windthrow. Selective logging of buffer strips is sometimes allowed to reduce their costs, but the decreased tree density may expose the buffer to higher occurrence of windthrow. We used a replicated two-factor experiment to assess the effects of buffer width (15 m or 30 m) and selective logging (0% or 30% of the basal area removed) on the risk of windthrow in boreal streamside forests in Finland. We examined the windthrown trees 12 years after experimental logging at 29 sites and at seven unlogged control sites. In addition, we studied the influence of topography and the extent of clear-cut logging in the surrounding forests on windthrow risk. The proportion of windthrown spruces at sites with 15 m buffer strips was, on the average, six times higher than at control sites and 2.5 times higher than at sites with 30 m buffer strips. In contrast, the proportion of windthrown spruces did not differ between sites with 30 m buffer strips and control sites. Selective logging did not increase the risk of windthrow strongly. However, sites with selectively logged 30 m buffers were slightly more prone to windthrow than control sites. The proportion of windthrown trees tended to increase with the extent of the adjacent clear-cut areas on both sides of the stream. We conclude that a 15 m buffer strip is not wide enough to protect streamside forests from substantial windthrow, while a 30 m buffer strip is sufficient in most cases. Selective logging of 30 m buffers may be undertaken at sites that are not under a high risk of windthrow. If selective logging enables a wider buffer strip, it may be a better option for protecting the streamside habitat from substantial windthrow than leaving a narrow buffer strip. Moreover, clear-cut harvesting on both sides of the stream should be avoided if the aim is to prevent excessive windthrow.

Thus, risking scarce resources to be over-spent on ineffective health systems. In particular, when stakeholder views on new information technologies vary from ideal to no view at all development, whether for a single unit, a region or a nation, might cause conflict in the cross-sector of healthcare and IT. That is a challenge for healthcare management. The aim of this study was therefore to contribute to the creation of public value by investigating what frame of reference is needed for management to address critical issues of person-centred healthcare. We thus, inquired what alignment dimensions must be addressed to advance person-centred healthcare? A qualitative approach was chosen as it provided opportunity to explore the situation. The theoretical frame was based on a literature study covering person-centred healthcare and alignment dimensions. Primary data were collected through four interviews in Swedish healthcare. Secondary data were used to strengthen the primary data. The first report was a study, based on a process analysis of healthcare and homecare in Sweden. The second report by the national centre for e-health presents objectives for the period 2013-2018 on the subject of citizen's future means for participating and engaging in his/her healthcare. Data were analysed according to the theoretical frame and summarized in table form. Result illustrate that alignment is not just fit between IT and business. Moreover, alignment is a non-stop activity of value creation through synchronization of the enterprise and IS/IT. For the wider good of healthcare, we argue for alignment in terms of grouping of persons, their parties and powers. To cover their issues, infological and sociocultural dimensions must be effectively brought into account by healthcare management.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the type of mobilities and subjects that are being promoted and constituted through bike-sharing systems. This is done through an analysis of the bike-sharing system in the city of Lund in Sweden. The analysis utilises Bacchi?s What is the Problem Represented to be? framework and develops it through adding a spatial perspective. Departing from a critical velomobilities perspective, we argue that urban transport policies cannot merely be regarded as one specific and delimited reaction to well-defined policy problems. Instead, the ways that BSSs are, described, motivated ? but also spatially organised ? constitute which mobilities are produced. The analysis is based in an analysis of relevant policy documents, maps and observations. It is concluded that bike sharing is not seen as cycling and is rarely linked to cycling as such, but rather is seen as part of the public transport system. Further, it is concluded that the motivation behind the location of the stations is to facilitate the flow of workers to public transport, and promote attractiveness and tourism, thus constituting a strong belief in a win-win situation between sustainability and growth. Here prioritisation between different values, and the possible tensions between different social and environmental dimensions of sustainability is down-played.

AB  - Research into Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) has criticised the process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as a tool for protecting cultural heritage, claiming that assessments of impacts on cultural heritage become marginalised and fail to inform key decisions during EIA processes. Many suggestions have been made for optimising the process and providing a platform to improve the understanding of cultural heritage. This article aims to enrich this discussion by challenging established ideas about what constitutes an 'actor' in a planning context, arguing that there is a need to expand this term to encompass the bureaucratic production of knowledge and thus to analyse the impact of the production and shape of knowledge on the alleged marginalisation of cultural heritage. This article examines the relevant knowledge production process and the limitations of current practices and in doing so highlights how the knowledge production aspect of an EIA process seems to stabilise cultural heritage as a fact, making it equivalent and comparable to other environmental subjects. A central finding is that this similarity in some cases causes cultural heritage to become invisible in an EIA process, causing it to slip through the net in final decision-making. The empirical starting point for this article is the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA/Statens Vegvesen) and its in-house EIA manual, the Handbook on Impact Analyses (Handbook V712), while the theoretical resources are derived mainly from Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Actor-Network Theory (ANT).

AB  - Habitat fragmentation and the abandonment of former agricultural practices have led to extremely low dispersal rates for plant species growing in traditionally managed hay meadows in Sweden. Historically, seed dispersal between populations was maintained by hay movement, grazing animals, and farmers sharing their equipment. Because these means of dispersal typically are no longer occurring, artificial dispersal using seeds and plug-plants is tested here as a restoration tool. In this study, we chose two perennial herbs commonly occurring in meadows as test species, viz, Hypochoeris maculata L. (Asteraceae) and Succisa pratensis Moench. (Dipsacaceae). We found that plug-plant transplants were twice as effective as seed sowing for both species. The seed collection site was found to be important for seed-based establishment and survival; consequently, the choice of donor meadow is important when acquiring seeds used for restoration. We also found that survival of plants introduced as seeds was generally lower at sites harboring species favored by nitrogen as well as at sites in later successional phases. Both methods of introducing meadow species worked well, even though long-term establishment may well be more successful with the plug-plant method due to higher plug-plant establishment 2 years after introduction in the field.

AB  - Sediment cores, covering the period from ca. 1835 to 1988 AD, were retrieved from Lake Haubi, located in a severely eroded area in the Kondoa District, central Tanzania. The results of mineral magnetic analyses undertaken on the sediment cores reflect two distinctly different depositional environments. Before ca. 1902 AD the basin formed a seasonally inundated swamp, which subsequently turned into a lake. The swamp sediment is black, uniform, and extremely clay-Rich. It contains antiferromagnetic minerals (e.g. haematite) but lacks ferrimagnetic minerals (e.g. magnetite) due to post-depositional dissolution. The lake sediment is also very clay-rich but laminated. Here ferrimagnetic minerals (magnetite) dominate the magnetic assemblage. The soil erosion history of the catchment has been reconstructed using results based on the mineral magnetic analyses and on the sedimentation rates obtained from Pb-210 datings, whereby variations in magnetic concentrations and ratios, attributed to variations in sediment influx, are assumed to reflect soil erosion within the catchment. The results from the magnetic analyses are in general agreement with the sedimentation rates. High sediment accumulation occulted around the turn of the century, and increased generally since 1935, with particularly high rates between ca. 1945 and 1950, and from ca. 1955 to the present. The reconstructed soil erosion history has been compared to both historical records of anthropogenic activity in the Kondoa District and to rainfall data. From this comparison we infer that effects on soil erosion from variations in rainfall are subordinate to those induced by man. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: the work is devoted to the designations of landscape objects of anthropogenic origin located in rural areas. The urban landscape nomination system is not considered. The article is a linguistic analysis of the subject of the study. Objective: to establish the systemic features inherent in the studied branch of the landscape vocabulary of the Komi language, the stages of its formation and development from ancient times to the present day.Research materials: vocabulary of the literary Komi language related to the landscape vocabulary. Comparative examples were talen from other the Permian and Finno-Ugric languages.Results and novelty of the research: for the first time in Komi linguistics, a linguistic analysis of the designations of landscape objects of anthropogenic origin, which are an integral part of the landscape vocabulary of any natural language, including the Komi-Zyryan, was carried out. In the course of the research, the structural organization of this lexical-thematic group and its features that distinguish it from other categories of the main vocabulary are determined. The main distinguishing feature of the objects of the nomination of this microsystem is that their appearance and existence are not connected with the spontaneous forces of nature, but are caused by purposeful human activity. The study showed that the microsystem of landscape vocabulary of anthropogenic origin has ancient origins and its basis is the names of the native origin. The earliest native words date back to the Proto-Finno-Ugric era. Further replenishment of this group of designations occurred at the subsequent stages of the evolution of the Komi language - in the Proto-Finno-Permian, Proto-Permian and Proto-Komi periods. The latest and most numerous layer consists of lexical units that arose during the period of independent existence of the Komi-Zyryan language, after its separation from the Komi-Permian one. The formation and development of landscape vocabulary of anthropogenic origin occurred not only at the expense of internal resources, but also as a result of the use of external sources. The foreign-language component consists of four groups of borrowings: Old Bulgarian (1 word), Baltic -Finnish (1 example), Russian (39 names).

AB  - Economic disparity between ethnic groups is sometimes supposed to be the main driver of ethnic conflict. Understanding the extent and the sources of such disparity is then important to help formulate policies that aim at avoiding further conflict. This paper analyzes economic disparity between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan. These groups were involved in violent clashes in the recent past. Using household survey data from 2005, we show that, in contrast to the public perception, Kyrgyz households have slightly higher expenditure than Uzbek households in urban areas and about the same level in rural areas. The gap in urban areas is mostly due to smaller households and higher education among the Kyrgyz. We also find that Uzbek households are better off than Kyrgyz households in terms of the value of housing property. We argue that the house value gap can be explained by the Uzbeks having larger houses, which are home to larger families and serve as a basis for running small businesses.

AB  - Woody debris decay rates have recently received much attention because of the need to quantify temporal changes in forest carbon stocks. Published decay rates, available for many species, are commonly used to characterize deadwood biomass and carbon depletion. However, decay rates are often derived from reductions in wood density through time, which when used to model biomass and carbon depletion are known to underestimate rate loss because they fail to account for volume reduction (changes in log shape) as decay progresses. We present a method for estimating changes in log volume through time and illustrate the method using a chronosequence approach. The method is based on the observation, confirmed herein, that decaying logs have a collapse ratio (cross-sectional height/width) that can serve as a surrogate for the volume remaining. Combining the resulting volume loss with concurrent changes in wood density from the same logs then allowed us to quantify biomass and carbon depletion for three study species. Results show that volume, density, and biomass follow distinct depletion curves during decomposition. Volume showed an initial lag period (log dimensions remained unchanged), even while wood density was being reduced. However, once volume depletion began, biomass loss (the product of density and volume depletion) occurred much more rapidly than density alone. At the temporal limit of our data, the proportion of the biomass remaining was roughly half that of the density remaining. Accounting for log volume depletion, as demonstrated in this study, provides a comprehensive characterization of deadwood decomposition, thereby improving biomass-loss and carbon-accounting models.

AB  - Recent environmental footprint comparisons between meat and plant-based meat analogues do not consider nutritional density holistically, nor the high carbon opportunity costs (COC) of land requirements, which are critical in terms of climate stabilisation targets. We performed an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) of a 100 g serving of cooked protein balls (PPBs) made from peas (Pisum sativum), and Swedish-style beef meatballs (MBs) made from Irish or Brazilian beef. Per serving, PPB production and consumption was associated with lower environmental burdens across all 16 categories assessed. Global warming, acidification, and land use burdens of PPBs were at least 85%, 81%, and 89% smaller, respectively, than MBs. The scale of environmental advantage was sensitive to the allocation method, with biophysical allocation across cattle co-products decreasing MB burdens by at least 35%, 38%, and 46% in the acidification, climate change, and land use categories, respectively. Furthermore, PPBs have a higher nutritional density than MBs, and hence their environmental footprint per unit of nutrition was considerably lower across all 16 impact categories. Per Nutrient Density Unit, global warming, acidification, and land use burdens of PPBs were at least 89%, 87%, and 93% smaller, respectively, than MBs. Results were tested with Monte Carlo simulations and a modified null hypothesis significance test, which supported the main findings. Finally, when COC of land was factored in, the climate advantage of PPBs extended greatly. Assuming MBs equivalent to just 5% of German beef consumption are replaced by PPBs, total carbon savings including COC could amount to 8 million tonnes CO(2)e annually, an amount equal to 1% of Germany's annual GHG emissions. Therefore, this study highlights the potential of PPBs to meet health and climate neutrality objectives. Crown Copyright (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental variation across space and time can strongly influence life-history strategies in vertebrates. It has been shown that the reproductive success of birds of prey is closely related to food availability. However, relatively little is known about intraspecific differences in reproductive success of birds in relation to varying ecological conditions across environmental gradients. We investigated the reproductive performance of Tengmalm's Owls Aegolius funereus in a temperate (Czech Republic, 50 degrees N) and a boreal (Finland, 63 degrees N) population in relation to long-term variations in the abundance of their main prey (small rodents). Prey densities at the northern site were much higher, but there were also large inter-annual fluctuations and years with steep summer declines of vole densities. Northern owls laid larger clutches but offspring production per nest was similar at both study sites. This resulted from higher nestling mortality in the northern population, especially in nests established later in the season. Despite much greater nesting losses due to predation by Pine Martens Martes martes, productivity at the population level was about four times greater at the temperate site, mainly due to the much higher breeding densities compared with Finland. Tengmalm's Owls at the temperate study site may benefit from relatively stable prey abundance, a more diverse prey community that offers alternative prey during vole scarcity, longer nights in summer that allow more time for foraging, and a lower level of interspecific competition with other vole-specialized predators.

AB  - We describe the relationship between macroinvertebrate community composition, the physicochemical environment and anthropogenic impacts, in running water sites across a range of water qualities in England and Wales. We have also investigated the degree of spatial structure present in both the macroinvertebrate community and the measured environment. Selected explanatory variables could account for 26% of the variation in lotic macroinvertebrate assemblage composition across England and Wales. The explanatory power of the CCA model was based predominantly on a combination of local scale variables (substrate, alkalinity, urban run-off) and regional scale variables (discharge category, northing). The physicochemical gradient associated with changes in stream type from headwaters to estuary dominated assemblage composition. The influence of pollution and habitat modi. cation were of secondary importance. There was a substantial level of spatial structure to both the physicochemical (47% of its explanatory power spatially structured) and anthropogenic stress data (63% of its explanatory power spatially structured), which resulted in a high level of predictable spatial structuring in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Almost 40% of the variation in assemblage composition accounted for by the explanatory model exhibited spatial structure. Positive spatial autocorrelation in macroinvertebrate community composition extended to sites up to 150 km apart. As a consequence, community composition could be described from northing and easting with 75% of the explanatory power of the eight physicochemical variables. Our study has confirmed the importance of the longitudinal gradient within catchments, as well as the geographical position of the catchment to macroinvertebrate communities. We have also demonstrated how quantifying the spatial structure in the dataset can improve our understanding of the factors influencing macroinvertebrate community structure.

AB  - In the surveyed anthropogenic acidified Lake Gjerstadvann with pH approximate to 5.2 situated in southern Norway, spatial and temporal distribution of three characteristic planktonic cladocerans inhabiting acidified boreal biotopes, Bosmina longispina, Holopedium gibberum, and Diaphanosoma brachyurum, were studied over a period of one year. The major pelagic predator was Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis. The local perch probably balanced the cladoceran community and facilitated co-existence of all three species of cladocerans by removing significant portions of B. longispina, which could also be the case in similar types of boreal lakes. Invertebrate predators such as the dipteran larvae Chaoborus flavicans and carnivorous copepods did not seem to influence the cladoceran community. B. longispina was perennial, whereas both H. gibberum and D. brachyurum were recorded only during the ice-free period. The life cycle of these free-living pelagic species ranged from 2-3 in D. brachyurum, 3 in H. gibberum to approximately 6 annual generations in B. longispina. Wintering took place as resting eggs in D. brachyurum and H. gibberum, while B. longispina produced resting eggs in addition to an active planktonic stay. The warm water tolerant D. brachyurum was mainly distributed above the thermocline, whereas H. gibberum also inhabited deeper strata, and B. longispina most vertical strata of the lake. Maximum seasonal clutch volume of B. longispina coincided in time with peak in food abundance and may be a useful parameter to identify planktonic food availability in such lakes. Knowledge of the autecology and life history of species is fundamental for understanding ecosystem stress, such as anthropogenic acidification and recovery through liming or by natural causes. Seasonal depth isoplots combined with life history studies of commonly co-occurring cladoceran species from natural acid and anthropogenic acidified lakes on the Northern Hemisphere seem to be uncommon, and similar type of data is needed to filly understand the processes of acidification and recovery.

AB  - One-year-old seedlings of nine different white birch seed origins (Betula pendula Roth, Betula platyphylla Sukatchev var. japonica Hara, two crossings of plus trees of B. pendula, and five two-way hybrids between B. pendula, Betula resinifera Britt., and B. platyphylla) were exposed to ambient ozone (control) and 1.3 x ambient ozone concentrations over two growing seasons. At the end of each growing season, the plants were measured for leaf, stem and root growth; visible leaf injuries; leaf senescence; and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase, starch, soluble protein, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and nutrient concentrations to determine the differences in ozone sensitivity among these species and hybrids and the relationship of ozone sensitivity to changes in growth pattern and tolerance to other abiotic stresses. There was a large variation in growth among seedlings of different birches (species and hybrids). In most birches, elevated ozone exposure resulted in altered resource allocation at the expense of roots, leading to reduced root/shoot ratio. In fast-growing birches, stimulated stem height and foliage growth in the second growing season indicated compensatory growth, which was accompanied by accelerated senescence of old leaves. Seedlings of B. platyphylla and those from crossings with Finnish plus trees (bred for growth) showed highest susceptibility to ozone. The hybrids between Alaskan B. resinifera and Finnish B. pendula were intermediate in ozone sensitivity, whereas the hybrids between Japanese B. platyphylla and Finnish B. pendula genotypes were of improved tolerance compared with parents. The results suggest that ozone-induced disturbances in carbon allocation favouring shoot growth pose a real risk factor for birch establishment, production, and sustainable forestry because of potential deteriorating belowground processess and long-term tree vitality.

AB  - Background: Despite the breadth and diversity of research and policies on care transitions, research studies often report similar components that affect the quality and safety of care, including communication across professional groups and care settings, transfer of information, coordination of resources or training of healthcare personnel. In this article, we aim to deepen our understanding of care transitions by proposing a heuristic research framework that takes into account the components and factors influencing the quality and safety of care transitions in diverse settings.
   Methodology: Using a pragmatic qualitative narrative meta-synthesis of empirically grounded research studies (N 1/4 13) involving 31 researchers from seven countries (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK), we conducted a thematic analysis to identify the components analysed in the included studies. We then used these components to create a framework for researching care transitions.
   Results: Our narrative synthesis found that the quality and safety of care transitions are influenced by a range of patient-centred, communicative, collaborative, cultural, competency-based, accountability-based and spatial components. These components are encompassed within a broader set of dimensions that require careful consideration: (1) the conceptualising of the care transition notion, (2) the methodology for researching care transitions, (3) the role of patients and carers in care transitions, (4) the complexity surrounding care transitions, (5) the boundaries intertwined in care transitions and (6) care transition improvement interventions. These six dimensions constitute an analytical framework for planning and conducting research on care transitions in diverse settings.
   Conclusion: The proposed six-dimensional framework for researching quality and safety in care transitions offers a roadmap for future practice and policy interventions and provides a starting point for planning and designing future research. Superscript/Subscript Available

AB  - As a result of a rapidly changing climate the resilience of forests is an increasingly important property for ecosystem management. Recent efforts have improved the theoretical understanding of resilience, yet its operational quantification remains challenging. Furthermore, there is growing awareness that resilience is not only a means to addressing the consequences of climate change but is also affected by it, necessitating a better understanding of the climate sensitivity of resilience. Quantifying current and future resilience is thus an important step towards mainstreaming resilience thinking into ecosystem management. Here, we present a novel approach for quantifying forest resilience from thinning trials, and assess the climate sensitivity of resilience using process-based ecosystem modeling. We reinterpret the wide range of removal intensities and frequencies in thinning trials as an experimental gradient of perturbation, and estimate resilience as the recovery rate after perturbation. Our specific objectives were (i) to determine how resilience varies with stand and site conditions, (ii) to assess the climate sensitivity of resilience across a range of potential future climate scenarios, and (iii) to evaluate the robustness of resilience estimates to different focal indicators and assessment methodologies. We analyzed three long-term thinning trials in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests across an elevation gradient in Austria, evaluating and applying the individual-based process model iLand. The resilience of Norway spruce was highest at the montane site, and decreased at lower elevations. Resilience also decreased with increasing stand age and basal area. The effects of climate change were strongly context-dependent: At the montane site, where precipitation levels were ample even under climate change, warming increased resilience in all scenarios. At lower elevations, however, rising temperatures decreased resilience, particularly at precipitation levels below 750800 mm. Our results were largely robust to different focal variables and resilience definitions. Based on our findings management can improve the capacity to recover from partial disturbances by avoiding overmature and overstocked conditions. At increasingly water limited sites a strongly decreasing resilience of Norway spruce will require a shift towards tree species better adapted to the expected future conditions.

AB  - The research objective was to demonstrate the economic impact of using, in afforestation, forest reproductive materials (FRMs) obtained from seed trees selected in the most valuable Norway spruce populations of the FGRs' (forest genetic resources') category. The values obtained for the main growth traits (diameter at breast height (Dbh), tree height (Th), and tree volume (Tv)), both in the FGR and in the closest population (with the same age and growth in similar environmental conditions), were compared. Three comparative trials were analyzed, each belonging to different breeding levels: Open-pollinated (Brecu, 40 years old), half-sib (Mneciu, 25 years), and full-sib (Comandu, 23 years). The difference in volume/hectare between the FGR and an unimproved neighbor population was economically quantified (Euro), based on the average price per cubic meter (m(3)) of spruce wood in Romania; the profit at the end of the rotation period (110 years) was projected taking into account the genetic gain that will result from the use of FRM collected from the FGRs. The average FGR growth results were superior to the unimproved neighbor populations, with 8%-13%, 14%-25%, and 26%-79% for Dbh, Th, and volume/ha, respectively, and the differences increased if the best 10% seed trees of the trials were used. For Th, a five times higher family mean heritability was registered for the pendula trees (compared to pyramidalis) in the half-sib trial, while in the full-sib experiment, the pendula trees (both full and half pendula) again registered higher heritability, but for Dbh, which recommends the pendula selection for different traits in the two trials. These results have led to a rate of profitability between 540 and 3366 Euro/ha, a value that is predicted to increase until the end of the rotation period, when the genetic gain could generate a profit of 7560 Euro/ha.

AB  - To study the migratory behaviour in wild northern European silver eel Anguilla anguilla during sea entry and early marine migration, 32 individuals were tagged with acoustic transmitters and registered at four automatic listening station arrays from the mouth of the north Norwegian River Alta and throughout the Alta Fjord. The A. anguilla entered the fjord during all parts of the tidal cycle and did not seem to utilize the outgoing tidal currents. They migrated mainly during the night, in both the river mouth and the fjord. On average, they spent 2.7 days travelling from the river mouth to the outermost array, 31 km from the river mouth, corresponding to an average migratory speed of 0.5 km h(-1). The A. anguilla generally migrated in the central part of the fjord and in the uppermost 10-25% of the water column, but with frequent dives to greater depths. Already 4 km after sea entry, A. anguilla were observed diving deeper than 130 m within 20-30 min periods. Hence, this study demonstrated that A. anguilla may perform an active diving behaviour during the early marine migration. The study took place in a pristine area with a minimum of anthropogenic interventions and by individuals from a population still uninfected by the introduced parasite Anguillicoloides crassus. The results may therefore be used as a baseline for future studies of the A. anguilla early marine migration.

AB  - This study offers a scene-by-scene translation of the works of nineteenth-century experts Julius Maak, Frantiek Kavan, and Antonn Slavek. The mid-twentieth century photographs of the eskomorayska vrchovina (Bohemian-Moravian highlands) by Josef Jambor were used for a comprehensive comparative investigation at the territory level. The relationship between Landscape painting and national and cultural identity will be investigated. The artistic depiction of the landscape has profoundly impacted the establishment of cultural identities in both China and Europe. In China, landscape depiction has a thousand-year history, but in Europe, it has only lately emerged. Shan Shui (landscape art) has always existed. Style-and function-wise, it has changed little since the Song era. Landscape depictions have profoundly impacted the development of social and public character throughout Europe. Identities and informing consumers about their country of origin. Here, Holland, England, Norway, Finland, and China are analyzed to demonstrate how landscape depictions contributed to the formation of their respective nations. Advocates of a particular conception of Chinese culture have had a limited political impact in China, in contrast to the United States. In Europe, landscape art has been developed in several situations, including to express support for various causes, national identity determination, and nationalism. This study intends to use painting as an interpretative tool to demonstrate how our interpretation of a scene has evolved over time. Fine arts faculties require a greater emphasis on the quality and amount of philosophy training, as well as its methodology, under the scope of "art philosophy." In arts education, various procedures and strategies must be utilized, and students must be capable of analyzing and comprehending works of art through multiple lenses. This study examines the contemporary experience of the panorama from historical, political, social, cultural, and aesthetic viewpoints. It contains various levels of significance, as opposed to just referring to gardens and agricultural areas or the Kantian conception of landscape as a distinct category within the field of visual arts. As a result of industrialisation, the discovery of new places, and advancements in science, botany, and geography, the landscape began to change in the nineteenth century. In addition to scientific, cultural, and social improvements, the 20th century saw the incorporation of immaterial components. It has become a social construct as an expression of thoughts, memories, imagination, and emotions. As opposed to a static and seen work, the panorama is today understood as an interdisciplinary and collaborative creation. Comparing maps and photographs of the same websites during different time intervals is a common way of determining landscape change. Landscape paintings, which have a lengthy and renowned history in the Czech Republic, can also be rented in this manner.

AB  - Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., is found throughout the North Atlantic, with thousands of rivers having spawning populations. In Greenland, spawning is limited to one river in West Greenland, the Kapisillit River (64N), and the salmon are limited to the lower few kilometres of the system. Using mark-recapture, it was estimated the parr population was 5,953 individuals, and that the population size has declined by 52% since 1959. In spite of this decline, parr density remains high, being between 0.26 and 0.62parr/m(2). Using a historical age-length key, an estimated minimum of 635 smolt will have descended to the sea in 2017. These will be caught in a fishery currently subject to no regulatory measures and fishing remains the most likely driver of the population decline. The genetically distinct population is endemic to Greenland, and managers should implement measures to conserve this genetic integrity and local biodiversity.

AB  - Population connectivity is an increasingly important focal area for the understanding of how marine fish populations respond to anthropogenic pressures like climate change and fisheries. Our model species, the saithe Pollachius Wrens (Linnaeus, 1758), was chosen because genetic analyses have documented a mismatch between the assessed stocks and the biological populations. We combined laboratory experiments of saithe egg buoyancy and temperature-modulated development time, genetic field data, and high-resolution oceanographic models to disentangle the mechanisms causing isolation and mixing between the management units and the biological populations. Saithe egg buoyancy and development data were included in an individual-based model to simulate transport from all known spawning grounds in the Northeast Atlantic. The results show that interannual variability in the transport of early life stages is strongly influenced by wider climate systems (e.g. the North Atlantic Oscillation). One sample (Rockall) showed genetic differences from the other samples, and this finding was supported by the model showing low mixing with other populations and strong local retention. Strong retention of early life stages around Iceland could indicate an isolated population; however, this possible isolation is counteracted by active migration of adults westward from the Norwegian coast, and no genetic differentiation from other populations was found. Overall, the dispersal modeling supports the genetic analysis, showing a large and well-connected Central Northeast Atlantic population distributed across several management units. This mismatch between population structure and management units can potentially increase the risk for overexploitation of saithe.

AB  - Logistics processes are in the core of transportation, providing a structure for distributing products on an international scale. This research was conducted as a commissioned research for a Finnish pharmaceutical wholesaler. In wholesale, logistics process is an important part of the core competencies and optimizing this process can provide significant competitive advantages. The objective of this research study was to investigate the causes of supply chain fragmentations and the ways to mitigate these effects. The central concepts are used as sustainable logistics process that minimizes carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, offers supply chain visibility, lean distribution channel, offers discrete event simulation and supply chain modelling. The empirical research employs a mixed research method consisting of both qualitative and quantitative data. Quantitative data is collected from the inbound deliveries of a Finnish pharmaceutical case company and qualitative data is gathered from a questionnaire survey within the case company. This study investigated the current inbound processes of the case company and compared to the developed model of the centralized pipeline system. The objective of this study was to investigate how a centralized logistic system minimizes travel cost to support environmental damage and can provide benefits to the inbound process of the case company. The research results indicated that a centralized pipeline system can provide improved information flow, higher freight capacity and reduced CO2 emissions to support environmental friendly and sustainable supply chain and logistics processes.

AB  - This paper seeks to use life cycle assessment to investigate the comparative environmental impacts of two proposed bridge designs for the new Mjosa Bridge over Lake Mjosa in Norway. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has designed one timber and one concrete alternative for the 1650 m 4-lane highway bridge. If the timber bridge design is chosen, it will be the longest timber bridge in the world once constructed.
   The main motivation for building the timber bridge is to utilize local industry and to reduce environmental impacts in road infrastructure. This study aims to determine the expected emissions from both construction designs by using life cycle assessment. Life cycle assessment studies on smaller timber bridges have been carried out in the past with favorable results towards timber designs, but no bridge of this scale has been built and therefore a more comprehensive study is required to confirm if a timber bridge of this size is a sustainable choice for transport infrastructure.
   The results of the study show that the timber bridge has significantly lower emissions than the concrete bridge across all impact categories included in the scope of this study. Additional environmental gains can be made from end-of-life treatment of materials. This study shows that large scale timber bridge designs should be considered for future road projects.

AB  - Global mining generates a large amount of mine tailings, which can produce negative effects on the environment. To counteract this, government guidelines and scientific interest have emerged to reuse tailings deposits in innovative ways, converting them from an environmental liability to an economic asset. Thus, the characterization of a tailings deposit is of great importance to analyze the content of critical raw materials, as well as for a possible revaluation of the deposit, facilitating the mining process to be carried out in a more sustainable way. To characterize their chemical composition, information from drilling campaigns can be used. However, the evaluation of resources in tailings deposits has several complexities such as the poor grade spatial continuity and its narrow geometry, reasons for which traditional geostatistics is not adapted to model this type of deposit. In contrast, transitive geostatistics can be an opportunity to tackle this taking advantage of the fully delimited domain in a tailings dam and a different structural analysis. By achieving a better characterization of tailings composition, it is possible to make better decisions for their reprocessing, thus supporting cleaner mining production.This study aims to provide a framework for the geostatistical modeling and prediction of remaining metal resources of the Haveri tailings in southwestern Finland. The modeled variables are the gold, cobalt, copper and iron grades, with cobalt being of special interest as a critical material. The grades have been measured at 165 drill holes, totaling 1201 samples composited at 1 meter.An exploratory data analysis is performed first to clean the database and to identify the statistical and spatial distributions of the data. Then a structural analysis is applied to model the grade spatial continuity. Leave-one-out cross-validation is subsequently used to validate the fitted model and to quantify the prediction errors. Finally, 3D block models of the gold, cobalt, copper and iron grade are constructed with ordinary kriging and transitive kriging and are compared.Cross-validation shows that both kriging methods yield a good precision of the predictions and perform equally well for copper and iron, but transitive kriging significantly outperforms ordinary kriging for gold and cobalt and also provides less smoothed block models than ordinary kriging. Transitive kriging thus appears as an effective alternative for assessing resources in tailings and other narrow deposits. Recommendations on the sampling design to optimize the coverage of the target area and to ease the covariogram inference are also given.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health and humanitarian crisis that catastrophically affects many industries. To control the disease spread and restore normal lives, mass vaccination is considered the most effective way. However, the sustainable last-mile cold chain logistics operations of COVID-19 vaccines is a complex short-term planning problem that faces many practical challenges, e.g., low-temperature storage and transportation, supply uncertainty at the early stage, etc. To tackle these challenges, a two-stage decision-support approach is proposed in this paper, which integrates both route optimization and advanced simulation to improve the sustainable performance of last-mile vaccine cold chain logistics operations. Through a real-world case study in Norway during December 2020 and March 2021, the analytical results revealed that the logistics network structure, fleet size, and the composition of heterogeneous vehicles might yield significant impacts on the service level, transportation cost, and CO2 emissions of last-mile vaccine cold chain logistics operations.

AB  - Rapid atmospheric warming since the mid-twentieth century has increased temperature-dependent erosion and sediment-transport processes in cold environments, affecting food, energy and water security. In this Review, we summarize landscape changes in cold environments and provide a global inventory of increases in erosion and sediment yield driven by cryosphere degradation. Anthropogenic climate change, deglaciation, and thermokarst disturbances are causing increased sediment mobilization and transport processes in glacierized and periglacierized basins. With continuous cryosphere degradation, sediment transport will continue to increase until reaching a maximum (peak sediment). Thereafter, transport is likely to shift from a temperature-dependent regime toward a rainfall-dependent regime roughly between 2100-2200. The timing of the regime shift would be regulated by changes in meltwater, erosive rainfall and landscape erodibility, and complicated by geomorphic feedbacks and connectivity. Further progress in integrating multisource sediment observations, developing physics-based sediment-transport models, and enhancing interdisciplinary and international scientific collaboration is needed to predict sediment dynamics in a warming world.
   Anthropogenic warming is causing cryosphere degradation, which is increasing erosion and sediment transport. This Review describes changes in sediment fluxes and explains how peak sediment will be reached as a result of deglaciation and permafrost thaw.

AB  - Grassland biodiversity, including traditional rural biotopes maintained by traditional agricultural practices, has become threatened worldwide. Road verges have been suggested to be complementary or compensatory habitats for species inhabiting grasslands. Species co-occurrence patterns linked with species traits can be used to separate between the different mechanisms (stochasticity, environmental filtering, biotic interactions) behind community structure. Here, we study species co-occurrence networks and underlying mechanisms of ground beetle species (Carabidae) in three different managed grassland types (meadows, pastures, road verges, n = 12 in each type) in Central Finland. We aimed to find out whether road verges can be considered as compensatory to traditional rural biotopes (meadows and pastures). We found that stochasticity explained over 90% of the pairwise co-occurrences, and the non-random co-occurrences were best explained by environmental filtering, regardless of the grassland type. However, the identities and traits of the species showing non-random co-occurrences differed among the habitat types. Thus, environmental factors behind environmental filtering differ among the habitat types and are related to the site-specific characteristics and variation therein. This poses challenges to habitat management since the species' response to management action may depend on the site-specific characteristics. Although road verges are not fully compensatory to meadows and pastures, the high similarity of species richness and the high level of shared species suggest that for carabids road verges may be corridors connecting the sparse network of the remaining traditional rural biotopes.

AB  - It is expected that climate change as well as abiotic and anthropogenic disturbances will strongly influence temperate forests. Besides changes in the main climate variables, various disturbance factors may significantly worsen conditions for mesic Slovenian forests (SE Europe) dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and European silver fir (Abies alba). In Slovenia, the climate has warmed in recent decades, with an average annual rate of increase of about 0.4 degrees C per decade or even more than 0.5 degrees C per decade in summer. In addition, disturbances have caused considerable damage to trees in the most extensive forest types in Slovenia, starting with a widespread ice storm in 2014, followed by bark beetle outbreaks, windthrows and salvage logging interventions. After 2014, salvage logging increased from about one third to two thirds of the total annual felling. Over the last two decades, we have observed a decline in Norway spruce growing stock, with the highest rate of decrease in areas below 500 m a.s.l., and an increasing trend for European beech. Overall, the three dominant species (beech, spruce, silver fir), which together account for more than 70% of the total growing stock, have shown a declining trend over the last 20 years. The patterns observed are broadly consistent with earlier predictions developed for different climate change scenarios and with those reported in many other European countries. Adaptive forest management, which implements close-to-nature silviculture, has been traditionally practised in the region under study and has the potential to play an important role in reducing the risks associated with the impacts of climate change and disturbances in the future.

AB  - P>1. Degradation of stream habitat because of anthropogenic activities (e.g. channelisation) has had a dramatic impact on fluvial environments and their biota, and as a consequence, increasing effort has been directed towards the restoration of degraded rivers. However, a major problem is that the success (or failure) of restoration has been rarely tested using a well-designed monitoring programme to allow reliable detection of an impact, if any exists. We used a spatially and temporally replicated, balanced Before-After-Control-Impact design to assess the impact of stream habitat rehabilitation on the densities and growth of brown trout of three age-classes in North Finnish forest streams.
   2. Three separate sections in each of six streams were selected for the study. After 3 years of pre-rehabilitation monitoring, two randomly selected sections in each stream were restored; one using large woody debris and boulders and the other using only boulders. A third section remained as an unmodified control. Monitoring of fish densities continued for 3 years after rehabilitation.
   3. Rehabilitation clearly increased streambed complexity, but did not have detectable effects on brown trout stocks in either of the rehabilitation schemes (LWD or stones), except for age-2+ and older fish which decreased in abundance compared to control reaches. A severe drought after rehabilitation in late summer 2002 reduced densities of trout to a low level in all streams, overriding any local effects of rehabilitation. Rehabilitation structures seemed to provide some safeguard against drought for age-2 and older, but not for the younger age-classes.
   4. Our results add to the growing body of literature suggesting that large-scale regional factors may overwhelm local management efforts. To be successful in the future, stream rehabilitation schemes must include drought refuge areas for fish and other stream biota.

AB  - Annual Scottish salmon production rose from 520 to 162,817 t over the years 1979-2016. This production growth is modelled using a logistic population model. Factors limiting production capacity include social, economic, regulatory and environmental factors (which change with time), while the growth in production is the product of changes in number of farms and productivity per farm. The model identifies fundamental differences occurring relatively abruptly around 1992. Pre 1992 the growth was extensive in nature with the number of farms increased exponentially (35% per year, 1979-1989) but productivity per farm increased relatively slowly (11% per farm per year) giving overall growth rate and with a relatively high 31.2% loss of fish. Since 1992 growth has been through intensification as the number of farms has fallen but productivity per farm increased rapidly in association with lower 20.3% loss of fish, which is in turn associated with a rapid uptake of anti-bacterial vaccine use. This simple model fails to predict a drop in production during 2004-2008 associated with a period of high exchange rate ( pound/$) and intense competition from Chile and Norway. After 2008, production resumes the pattern of increase predicted by the model as fitted from 1992 to 2003. Production is now approaching the historically fitted capacity, so further increase requires changes within the aquaculture industry that will increase carrying capacity such as increased productivity per unit biomass (better health, faster growth). For major increases in salmon production more substantial changes will be required, potentially off-shore production will allow for more farms farm with larger biomasses, but this requires technical advances.

AB  - Mining activities for mineral resources over the years have resulted in major soil damage. Due the removal process of desired mineral materials, soil textures have been destroyed, various nutrient cycles have been disturbed, and microbial communities have been altered, affecting vegetation and leading to the destruction of wide areas of land in many countries. Therefore, soil restoration of abandoned mining lands became a very important part of sustainable development strategies and also prescribed by law in several countries. The main aims of this study were to develop an ecological land restoration strategy to the degraded lands due former kaolin, quartz sand, and iron mining located in Aghiresu and Cpusu Mare in Cluj County, in the Northwestern part of Transylvania from Romania and monitor soil quality changes over 40 years. To assess the effectiveness of soil reclamation of mine lands, 30 soil profiles were examined and 450 soil samples were collected from three depths (0-20 cm, 20-50 cm, and 50-80 cm) and subjected to physical and chemical analyses, and compared for their sustainable and beneficial use. All the proposed plant covers (natural grassland, pasture cover, black locust, Norway spruce, and scots pine) significantly improved the overall soil quality with the increasing years of reclamation following various patterns. Pasture cover most significantly enhanced the soil's microbial activity, organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content followed by natural grassland. The results of this study show that considerable changes in soil quality was reached by revegetation of these abandoned mine lands restoring their ecological integrity and self-sustainability.

AB  - In this essay I discuss artworks by a sample of young people with a Muslim background who participated in the Numur-Islam and I exhibition, which was organised as part of the Young Muslims and Resilience (2016-2018) research project. Art exhibitions were staged in November 2017 and March 2018 with eighteen young adult participants/co-researchers. Their artworks included video and textile installations, photo collages, paintings, calligraphy and poetry, dealing with issues such as faith, dialogues between religious communities, gender, belonging and sexual diversity. Here I concentrate on some works by the participants who stated that they leaned on Sufism or spirituality in their working processes, or whose works expressed qualities that may be reflected through the spectrum in which rhizomes of Sufi ways of understanding human existence in the world are present. In their artworks, the participants created fresh ideas about possible encounters, which I interpret as being linked to modern and postmodern ideas of relationships between spaces and "becoming communities." Likewise, these ideas can be traced to our common philosophical heritage, which is partly based on spiritual mystic thought and practices of different religions. By using art, the participants could embody this legacy, create spaces for themselves and open landscapes for discussions between Muslim believers and people with different religions and worldviews.

TI  - Obtaining access to coastal areas for large-scale mussel farming: Obstacles and possibilities
T2  - AMBIO
LA  - English
AB  - Eutrophication in the coastal waters of the northern part of the Swedish west coast is causing structural and functional changes to the coastal ecosystems. Large-scale mussel farming is proposed in the Program of Measures, required by the EU Water Framework Directive to reduce the nutrients in the coastal water and improve water quality over a transition period of 10-20 years. Ownership, land parcelling, conflicts of interest, and the protection of coastal water are obstructing accessibility to suitable water areas for the establishment of mussel farming plants. This paper studies the obstacles and possibilities in the relevant laws and legal regulations governing the accessibility to coastal waters for large-scale mussel farming. Alternative ways to solve the problem are shown and discussed, within the framework of the Planning and Building Act, the Environmental Code and the laws concerning land-parceling and property. It is shown that the Planning and Building Act, when used in a proper manner, can provide useful instruments for society to gain access to coastal water for mussel farming plants with the purpose of improving the ecological status of the water.

AB  - The competition interactions between trees and species have already been thoroughly studied, but most often for mono-species and even-aged forests. Several recent studies have been undertaken, prompted by changes in forest management objectives, which now favour mixed-species forests to increase biodiversity. However, there have been no studies focused on the competition interactions for the mixed-species forests in the Western Carpathians. Recently, the single tree-based growth simulator SIBYLA has been developed for use in the forests of this area. The development of this model was based upon the growth simulator SILVA. Since there were no data available from long-term experiments for the Western Carpathian forests, SIBYLA was only calibrated using large-scale data from the Slovakian forest monitoring network. The aim of this study was (i) to define the potential maximum radial growth of silver fir (Abies alba L), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) in mixed forests, (ii) to test the above-ground competition effects on the radial increment of these species using a competition index based on competition light cone, and (iii) to evaluate the simulator SIBYLA using seven long-term experimental plots established in the 1960s, in the mixed-species uneven-aged forests of the Western Carpathians. These plots were repeatedly measured between five to eight times at intervals of 5-16 years, from 1967 to 2010. Long-term climatic records were obtained to allow simulation of tree growth in real climatic conditions. The results showed the differences in potential maximum radial growth between the species. The results also suggested that the competition effect on radial increment predicted by the SIBYLA is an overestimate compared to the real observed effect on silver fir, Norway spruce, and European beech. This, together with other factors, is suggested to be the cause of the observed bias between measurements and SIBYLA simulations, which ranged from -2.2% to -11% for silver fir, -0.2 to -3.7% for Norway spruce, and 0.9% to 13.9% for European beech (average bias for the measurement periods).

AB  - In order to tackle the current biodiversity crisis, a plethora of tempting shortcuts, such as the surrogate species approach, have recently been used to pinpoint important areas for protection. At the same time, species-specific conservation programmes are implemented in order to ameliorate the status of target threatened species. In the cases where species-specific programmes are evaluated and found to provide no apparent benefit to the target species, it is important to evaluate whether such conservation efforts may benefit other taxa sharing the same landscape with the target species. Here we assess the surrogacy potential of white-tailed sea eagle (WTSE) nesting habitat as indicator of biodiversity richness (using vascular plants and fungi as surrogated taxa) on islands of the Archipelago Sea in South-western Finland. We compared species richness on islands with and without a WTSE nest. We found weak evidence that islands with a WTSE nest support higher richness of vascular plants than islands without a nest. Conversely, we found no evidence that WTSE nests could be valid surrogates for fungi species inhabiting old-growth forests. Within the spatio-temporal and ecological limits of the present study, we suggest that the nesting habitat of WTSE may hold some surrogate potential for taxa, such as vascular plants, that may indicate high habitat diversity. This finding however remains to be confirmed. At the same time, it appears evident that the WTSE nesting habitat has poor surrogate potential with regards to old-growth forests. Overall, our findings line up with a growing body of other studies calling for caution and careful evaluation of the surrogacy efficiency of single species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The desire to guide research and innovation in more 'responsible' directions is increasingly emphasised in national and international policies, the funding of inter- and trans-disciplinary collaborations and academic scholarship on science policy and technology governance. Much of this growth has occurred simultaneously with the development of nanoscale sciences and technologies, where emphasis on the need for responsible research and innovation (RRI) has been particularly widespread. This paper describes an empirical study exploring the potential for RRI within nanosafety research in Norway and Denmark. It identifies three different ways nanosafety scientists relate to core RRI criteria, demonstrating areas of both convergence and divergence between their views and those of academics and policymakers currently defining and working to promote RRI. The paper identifies a range of practical barriers and cultural differences that are creating such divergences and inhibiting the enactment of RRI within the particular site of research laboratories. It concludes that the identified differences and challenges demand critical reflection on both the appropriateness and applicability of RRI characteristics for enactment at the level of individual research scientists. Significant changes are therefore advocated as required if RRI, as currently imagined and promoted, is to become an integral mode of scientific culture.

AB  - Recycling of plant nutrients in sewage products to arable land is considered to be a step towards a more sustainable society. Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today, but the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has been questioned as regards hazardous substances. In this respect, blackwater from separating systems seems to better fulfil agricultural requirements regarding fertiliser products.
   The objective of this paper was to analyse the environmental impact and resource use in a life cycle perspective for three systems, each including both wastewater handling and agricultural production. In the reference system, food waste disposers were installed in houses. Milled food waste and wastewater were treated in a wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for producing a soil conditioner. In the sludge utilisation system, food waste from households was composted, wastewater was treated conventionally and sewage sludge was used in oat production. In the blackwater system, toilet water from low-flush toilets and milled organic waste were digested together and spread in growing oats. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE.
   The blackwater system required slightly more primary energy than the other two systems. In particular, construction of storage facilities contributed considerably to energy use. The emissions of greenhouse gases and SO2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems, while the eutrophying emissions were reduced significantly in the blackwater system. As regards NH3 and NOx, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system.
   High substitution of mineral fertiliser, optimal spreading technique and well-designed collection and storage facilities were important factors for the environmental outcome in the blackwater system. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The technology of remote sensing-assisted tree species classification is increasingly developing, but the rapid refinement of tree species classification on a large scale is still challenging. As one of the treasures of ecological resources in China, Arxan has 80% forest cover, and tree species classification surveys guarantee ecological environment management and sustainable development. In this study, we identified tree species in three samples within the Arxan Duraer Forestry Zone based on the spectral, textural, and topographic features of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data as classification variables to distinguish among birch, larch, and nonforest areas. The best extracted classification variables were combined to compare the accuracy of the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) methodologies for classifying species into three sample strips in the Arxan Duraer Forestry Zone. Furthermore, the effect on the overall classification results of adding a canopy height model (CHM) was investigated based on spectral and texture feature classification combined with field measurement data to improve the accuracy. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the RF was 79%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.63. After adding the CHM extracted from the point cloud data, the overall accuracy was improved by 7%, and the kappa coefficient increased to 0.75. The overall accuracy of the CART model was 78%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.63; the overall accuracy of the SVM was 81%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.67; and the overall accuracy of the RF was 86%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.75. To verify whether the above results can be applied to a large area, Google Earth Engine was used to write code to extract the features required for classification from Sentinel-2 multispectral and radar topographic data (create equivalent conditions), and six tree species and one nonforest in the study area were classified using RF, with an overall accuracy of 0.98, and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. In this paper, we mainly integrate active and passive remote sensing data for forest surveying and add vertical data to a two-dimensional image to form a three-dimensional scene. The main goal of the research is not only to find schemes to improve the accuracy of tree species classification, but also to apply the results to large-scale areas. This is necessary to improve the time-consuming and labor-intensive traditional forest survey methods and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of survey data.

AB  - Pollen productivity estimates (PPE) are one of the critical parameters for a quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation from fossil pollen records. Modern pollen and vegetation data were collected in traditional landscapes of southern Sweden to derive PPE for the most characteristic plant taxa. The 42 selected sites are assumed to be good analogues of historical to prehistorical grasslands. A sampling method of vegetation, designed to produce plant abundance data in different distance classes, allowed the use of distance-weighted plant abundance around the surface pollen sites. PPE for 11 herb taxa and Juniperus communis were estimated by extended R-value (F RV) models, using the distance-weighted plant abundance and surface pollen data. Results using three ERV submodels, data sets from open and semi-open landscapes, and two distance-weighting methods are generally consistent. The herb taxa analysed have higher PPE than Poaceae except Cyperaceae and Compositae (sub-family) Cichorioideae. Calluna vulgaris, Rumex acetosa type, Juniperus communis is and Plantago lanceolata have the highest PPE. Most of the common tree taxa in the region produce 6-8 times as much pollen per unit area as Poaceae. The present set of PPE covers most of the common herb taxa of northwest Europe and will be useful for simulating pollen dispersal and deposition in heterogeneous landscapes of open and forested vegetation, which will help in future research project design and in the interpretation of fossil data.

AB  - Environmental archives such as peat bogs, sediments, corals, trees, polar ice, plant material from herbarium collections, and human tissue material have greatly helped to assess both ancient and recent atmospheric lead deposition and its sources on a regional and global scale. In Europe detectable atmospheric lead pollution began as early as 6000 years ago due to enhanced soil dust and agricultural activities, as studies of peat bugs reveal. Increased lead emissions during ancient Greek and Roman times have been recorded and identified in many longterm archives such as lake sediments in Sweden, ice cores in Greenland, and peat bogs in Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. For the period since the Industrial Revolution, other archives such as corals, trees, and herbarium collections provide similar chronologies of atmospheric lead pollution, with periods of enhanced lead deposition occurring at the turn of the century and since 1950. The main sources have been industry, including coal burning. ferrous and nonferrous smelting, and open waste incineration until c.1950 and leaded gasoline use since 1950, The greatest lead emissions to the atmosphere all over Europe occurred between 1950 and 1980 due to traffic exhaust. A marked drop in atmospheric lead fluxes found in most archives since the 1980s has been attributed to the phasing out of leaded gasoline. The isotope ratios of lead in the various archives show qualitatively similar temporal changes, for example, the immediate response to the introduction and phasing out of leaded gasoline. Isotope studies largely confirm source assessments based on lead emission inventories and allow the contributions of various anthropogenic sources to be calculated.

AB  - In the last twenty years, different countries of the European Union have implemented reforms in favour of a greater decentralisation for local governments: increasing their responsibilities, a priori controls removed, tax autonomy consolidated, decreasing in the level of earmarked financial transfers in favour of general transfers, creation of new local government tiers.
   A number of these reforms concerned the regional level. This general move towards a consolidation of regions was undertaken with several goals in mind, such as the improvement of country planning or better living standards for local inhabitants. The scope, the conditions and the degree of achievement of these reforms vary from one country to another.
   There are three main "local governments models", depending on the State organisation (unitary, federal or "regionalized"). However, the specific characteristics of some countries sometimes make it difficult to classify them in one of the three "models".
   The local government territorial organisation in the EU countries varies a lot, with each country finding its own balance between the need to manage local matters at local level and the necessity of having local governments large enough to be able to provide and manage local public services.
   In some countries, local governments of a same level are homogenous, while in others, as the federated States and some unitary States such as Spain, Italy, Ireland or the United Kingdom, they are diverse. There are currently 74000 local governments in
   The first local government tier, known as "municipalities", is responsible for the management of local community based services: water supply and sewerage, collection and household waste treatment, culture, urbanism local road network, social welfare, school upkeep, etc. The countries with the highest average number of inhabitants per municipality are the United Kingdom (more then 130000), Ireland (47 200), Portugal (36000), the Netherlands (31500) and Sweden (30700). In the European Union, there is an average of 5200 inhabitants per municipality.
   In most countries the second local government tier is generally responsible for road network, education, social welfare (the disabled, child care, etc.) and for environmental protection. In countries with two-tier local government system the second local government tier is generally responsible for sectors such as local development and country planning, generally the responsibility of regional local governments in countries with a three-tier local government system. In countries with a three-tier local government system, the position of the second local government tier varies from one country to another. French departments have more extensive responsibilities than Spanish provinces, which only have a limited number of responsibilities and which continue to lose ground to the increasingly powerful third local government tier. The third local government tiers generally have responsibilities in country planning, economic development, vocation training, transport, education and health. In Ireland, the regional local government responsibilities are less extensive than in other countries with a three-tier local government system; Irish regional authorities are mainly responsible for the coordination of local public services and the management of the European Union structural funds. Italian and Spanish regions differ from the third-tier local governments in other countries by both having legislative powers an by being responsible for more or less extensive responsibilities, depending on the region geographical, cultural or historical particularities [2].

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) has been at the centre of controversy for many decades. Recent evidence of its profound disturbance-induced dam-age and consequent stock depletions across forest landscapes in Europe has reinforced doubts regarding the sustainability and prospects of this tree species in the future. Like many other European countries, Slovenia has expe-rienced significant Norway spruce mortality and a decrease in growing stock primarily as the result of several disturbance agents (bark beetle outbreaks, an ice storm, windthrows). We investigated a countrywide spruce growing stock decline based on data between 2010 and 2018. Particular focus was placed on identifying the main ecological drivers of this decline, namely geo-logical conditions, climatic parameters, soil attributes, topographic factors and forest stand characteristics. The effects of potential predictors on the relative change (%) in spruce volume (m3 ha-1) during the period 2010-2018 were ana-lysed with Generalized Additive Models. Based on a national dataset including forest compartments (n = 6355) with a spruce growing stock decline > 10%, we found mixed support for ecology-based hypotheses. While spruce decline re-sponded to bedrock type as predicted (i.e., greater relative decline in carbon-ate compared to silicate compartments), higher forest naturalness (preserva-tion of tree species composition) was not associated with a lower decline. Spruce decline was amplified by higher potential evapotranspiration and soil clay content but showed a strong negative relationship with spruce proportion in the year 2010. General trends along the gradients of other selected predic-tors (stoniness/rockiness and heat load index) were less pronounced. The re-sults suggest that most of these ecological predictors interact with geology and forest naturalness in affecting Norway spruce decline. Our analysis reveals that bedrock type can play an important role due to its mitigating effects. However, forest naturalness is of secondary significance as intensified large-scale forest disturbances likely override its buffering potential.

AB  - Latvian folklore, folk ornament, and mythology were an established symbolic capital upon which the second generation of ethnic Latvian artists built a national particularity of visual art during the fin de siecle decades. The construction of national art represents artistic and discursive processes of exchange and conflict between the imperial centre and the local periphery, the Baltic German elite and ethnic Latvian artists, international styles and local particularities. The idea of national art developed within the framework of free discussion, borrowing models of identity from more mature art scenes abroad as well as from other areas of cultural representation, like folklore and ethnography. As a result, several coexisting versions of national art identity are distinguished in the given period. Visual arts were 'nationalised' through form - developing particular ethnographic patterns of ornamentation - or through content, the latter ranging from local landscapes and people to motifs of ancient history, folklore, and mythology. Although developments in visual arts follow the international pattern, the application of conclusions emerging from a wider field of studies on cultural nationalism shows that folklore has played a special role due to the particular setting of cultural production in Latvia.

AB  - The economic sustainability of agricultural production is a crucial concern for most farmers, especially for pig producers who face dynamic changes in the market. Approaches for economic sustainability assessment found in the literature are mainly focused on the short-term economic viability of the farm and rarely take a long-term perspective. In this paper, we propose and test a new, innovative assessment and aggregation method, which brings about a broader view on more long-term aspects of economic sustainability. This wider view on economic sustainability, in addition to classical concepts such as technical efficiency, labor productivity, and farm profitability, incorporates the assessment of the levels of entrepreneurship, risk management, and the resilience of the invested resources. All indicators were scaled and aggregated using scaling and weighting procedures proposed by experts into subthemes and themes. The methodology was tested on a sample of 131 pig farms located in 6 EU countries: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland, and Austria. We hypothesized that closed-cycle farms might be economically more sustainable than those farms that are specialized in pig breeding or finishing. The results showed that closed-cycle farms do indeed have advantages in terms of raising healthy animals and having slightly better overall resilience of resources, however specialized breeding and finishing farms appeared to be more sustainable in the areas of profitability, risk management, and reproductive efficiency. Our approach supports evidence-based economic sustainability assessments of pig farms and provides a tool that can be used for economic sustainability improvement strategies for farms.

AB  - The emergence of new industrial development paths is an important topic in economic geography. However, current perspectives emphasizing the constraining forces of historical trajectories on innovation and change have shortcomings in accounting for how and where new industries arise. This article argues that more attention needs to be paid to agency, and that agency must be seen as inter-temporal in the sense that actors' activities and strategies are framed by combinations of experiences and expectations. As such, the article combines insights from economic geography, transitions studies and the sociology of expectations (SoE) literature to expand extant theory on path creation. A brief analysis of the emerging Norwegian offshore wind power (OWP) sector serves to illustrate how experience (the past) and different types of expectations (the future) have tangible effects on agency, and in effect on path creation processes. These insights have methodological implications, essentially favouring qualitative approaches over quantitative ones to understand formative phases in industrial development.

AB  - This paper addresses the link between the environmental permitting of mining operations and economic development in mineral-rich regions. The purpose is to investigate how uncertainty about the permitting outcomes facing a mining company could affect its subcontractors. A key conceptual point of departure is that this influence can be related to both withheld investments and a lower demand for key inputs, including labor, but also to a reduced overall attractiveness of the community, in turn making it difficult to recruit skilled labor. These issues are illustrated in the empirical context of a Swedish iron ore producer, which for over two years faced the risk of having its existing environmental permit revoked. The results suggest that in this specific case, the main challenge for the affected subcontractors was increased difficulties in recruiting skilled personnel. At a general level, the findings indicate the need to devote increased research attention to the link between government regulation on the one hand, and business growth and regional development on the other, including reputational effects. The paper also discusses the implications for the reform of existing environmental permitting process, nevertheless arguing against the incorporation of additional dimensions of sustainability in this process.

AB  - This paper examines the degree to which tree-associated Coleoptera (beetles) and pollen could be used to predict the degree of 'openness' in woodland. The results from two modern insect and pollen analogue studies from ponds at Dunham Massey, Cheshire and Epping Forest Greater London are presented. We explore the reliability of modern pollen rain and sub-fossil beetle assemblages to represent varying degrees of canopy cover for up to 1000 m from a sampling site. Modern woodland canopy structure around the study sites has been assessed using GIS-based mapping at increasing radial distances as an independent check on the modern insect and pollen data sets. These preliminary results suggest that it is possible to use tree-associated Coleoptera to assess the degree of local vegetation openness. In addition, it appears that insect remains may indicate the relative intensity of land use by grazing animals. Our results also suggest most insects are collected from within a 100-200 m radius of the sampling site. The pollen results suggest that local vegetation and density of woodland in the immediate area of the sampling site can have a strong role in determining the pollen signal.

TI  - Maritime culture in an inland lake?
T2  - MARITIME HERITAGE
LA  - English
CP  - 1st International Conference on Maritime Heritage
AB  - The definition of maritime culture will be discussed in this paper. The noun mare, and its adjective derivates marinus or maritimus in Latin indeed refer only to the sea. To the author, however, this is only formalist semantics. The only reasonable starting point for a humanistic approach would be the cultural contents of the definition. In this case the salient question would be whether the conditions of the Swedish lake Vanern do resemble the conditions of the salt water coasts and archipelagoes so much that they can be compared with them, or not. The scale of lakes in general would be important. A definite answer to the question is not sought, rather a discussion. The perspective is the Braudelian longue duree.
   The source material of the analysis will be multidisciplinary, place names, folklore, wrecks and other remnants, the social background of fishing by way of small-scale farmer shipping to a possible ownership and management of larger vessels, maintenance of lighthouses, sea marks etc. The similarities are as important as the peculiarities. Similarities are supposed to introduce the influences of general maritime culture. Peculiarities may show the richness of the local heritage. The mixture of these two gives the balance. Some emphasis will be put on the ritual landscape with its manysided evidence since this is one of the latest research areas of the author.

AB  - Two Emergy Assessments (EMA) were conducted to evaluate the ecological performances of novel eco-intensification innovations for the treatment and valorisation of sludge and fish mortalities from finfish aqua -culture, including upstream directly and indirectly used resources such as energy, materials, and labour. One innovation consists in a novel process to filter and dry particles from the reject water out of a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS), with dried nutrients and biomass being reused as organic fertiliser or as an energy source. The other process concerns the disposal of fish mortalities, which are mixed with by-product from the brewery industry and dried. The resulting product can be used in the pet food industry or as an energy source. Both innovative solutions were tested on a RAS for smolt production in Norway. A set of standard Unit Emergy Values and emergy indicators was selected and calculated, including specific emergy (sej/kg), environmental loading ratio, and emergy sustainability index, among others. The results are compared with Life-Cycle Assessment values derived from the same innovations and with other emergy values obtained for other aqua -culture processes. All in all, the novel solutions imply higher impacts related to water and technological inputs, yielding savings in the other indicators, thus confirming overall positive performances, yet requiring either some trade-off to be addressed and assessed more widely, or more efforts to possibly abate the factors that are responsible for increased impacts.

AB  - This study explores the association of 24 polychaete species with sandy and muddy habitats located in a sub-arctic fjord, and across Atlantic Canada including Labrador, Newfoundland, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Key characters used to facilitate species identification are also summarized. Within Bonne Bay, distinctive polychaete assemblages were associated with specific sediment types and polychaete species richness and density were significant both predictors of corresponding total (infaunal) density and species richness. Polychaetes were denser and more diverse in sandy sediments, partly because sandy locales were associated with the outer portion of the bay, and therefore were closer to the more productive and diverse Gulf of St. Lawrence. In general, species that occupied both sediment types were more widely distributed within Bonne Bay and across the region. The biogeography of most species also suggests that the Bonne Bay fauna is transitional between Labrador and Acadian biogeographic provinces.

AB  - Road accidents and their consequences are a significant social problem. This topic can also be considered to be one of the indicators of the sustainable development of urban systems. More than 10,000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed every year in EU countries, representing more than 20% of all road deaths. The small proportion of pedestrian and cyclist casualties that occur in rural areas are relatively severe and should not be forgotten, but this review is concerned with the majority, which occur in urban areas.
   Pedestrian safety is also one of the most serious problems in Estonian traffic, especially in urban areas. If one compares Estonia's figures with those of neighbouring Finland, pedestrian road traffic risk in Estonia is 2-4 times higher, for some reason.
   It is important to note that a number of road accidents occur at or near non-signalized pedestrian crossings. It is a well documented fact that the road traffic risk of pedestrian fatality or injury is related to drivers' behavioural aspects, such as speed choice when approaching the crossing, and a driver's willingness to yield to pedestrians at non-signalized crossings.
   The paper gives an overview of the survey of drivers' behaviour, in which drivers' attitudes to giving way to pedestrians were studied. Vehicle speed in the vicinity of zebra crossings was measured using the in-flow moving method and GPS receivers installed in vehicles.

AB  - The introduction of synthetic fertilizers transformed the food system into the one we know today in the Western world. The present paper argues that this transformation has become an irreversible self feeding process referred to as food system lock-in, which threatens planetary boundaries of nitrogen and phosphorus, hence the food security in the future. A system in a lock-in state can undermine its own existence by deteriorating the capacity to cope with upcoming crises of resource scarcity and environmental instability. In this paper, the roots of lock-in are explored and empirically grounded in the historical narrative of the food system transition in Finland in the past 60 years. The theoretical framework builds on socio-technical studies and the economic theory of increasing returns. The aim of the paper is to identify, through an evolutionary analysis, the processes of increasing returns that have become path inefficient and have reinforced the lock-in in the food system. Three separate but interdependent processes in the production, in the policy and institutions, and in the supply chain create systematic resistance towards sustainability transition. These findings indicate that more attention should be paid at the public policies that are currently too narrow in their scope and do not effectively bridge the entire system, from food production to consumption. Public intervention is critical for the unlocking, but individuals in the various parts of the food system are those who create new paths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To achieve a sustainable circular economy for wood ash, the reuse of wood ash in agriculture and forestry is important. To evaluate the usability of ash from the combustion of natural as well as waste wood for application as fertilizer, wood fuel and corresponding ash fraction samples (n = 86) of four industrial wood-fired heat and power plants (> 20 MW) were investigated. In different ash fractions, the concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cd, Pb, Ni, Tl, Zn) and plant nutrients (N, P, K, Ca) were assessed with regard to relevant legislation from the European Union and from selected European countries (Germany, Austria and Finland). Depending on fuel composition and combustion kinetics within the respective plants, the investigated ash fractions showed a wide range of nutrient and heavy metal contents. Apart from N which is mainly emitted with the flue gas, plant nutrients were present in substantial concentrations with mean values corresponding to 20% P, 55 % K and > 95% Ca content compared to nutrient compound fertilizer. A direct application of most ash fractions from both natural and waste wood combustion is however not possible due to high contents of Cd, Pb and Ni. In order to develop the ash for secondary use, investigation for a suitable treatment process is necessary. An estimation of the nutrient recovery potential from industrial wood energy plants in southwest Germany showed that approx. 3.1% (P), 7.5% (K) and 22.8% (Ca) of raw material for fertilizers could be substituted by ash.

AB  - An important challenge for the future is focusing on sustainability in life and business. The three elements of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social), defined in 17 factors by the United Nations (UN) as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), may, therefore, be the main drivers of business competitiveness and opportunity recognition. The main aim of the article is to identify the awareness level of sustainability and sustainable development goals in the context of business opportunity areas by analysing the results of a survey of organisations in six countries (Finland, Slovakia, Italy, Austria, Spain, and Turkey). A multilingual questionnaire, administered in six participating countries, was used as a collection tool to determine the organisation's level of awareness regarding the SDGs. A research questionnaire was filled in by 238 respondents, providing a cross-cultural view of their attitudes, knowledge, and future interest in sustainability and the SDGs. The obtained results indicate differences in the approach to sustainability issues, the scope of knowledge, interest, competencies in sustainable development and SDGs, and the content of implementation of sustainability and SDGs in organisations in different sectors, regions and countries. Further statistical evaluation of the research hypotheses states the significant relationship between the two variables: sustainable strategy and the designation of a responsible employee in each organisation rs = 0.677 (alpha = 0.05). It is essential to eliminate the gap in the cross-cultural approach and knowledge in engaging with sustainable strategy and its implementation in current and future organisation activities in the context of sustainability and SDGs, in order to enhance opportunities for the growth of sustainability-focused entrepreneurship across different sectors and countries.

AB  - Education for sustainable development represents a politically prioritized area of knowledge in contemporary Swedish education and as such it has acquired a prominent position among the governing values of educational policy. Insofar as education for sustainable development is directed at securing the future of human well-being, this article suggests that it concerns a moral discourse where notions about what may or may not happen in the future plays an important role in the governance of practices and behaviors in the present. Since the future is shrouded in uncertainty, it is suggested that the emotions of hope and fear may be understood in terms of tools for governing the everyday lives of children, invoking alluring and deterrent images that influence their decision-making. Besides seeking to gain a better understanding of some of the preconditions of education for sustainable development, the aim of this article concerns an investigation into some of the effects that education for sustainable development may have on the lives of children. To this end, it looks at how hope and fear are being put into play within the discourse as strategies for governing individuals in relation to the uncertainty of the future.

AB  - Urban density is central to pressing questions concerning low-carbon lifestyles, affordable housing and global land use patterns. However, for many densifying cities, problems of inequality, climate emissions and social sustainability often remain unsolved or exaggerated. Adopting a relational perspective, this paper explores the politics of urban densification in Oslo, Norway. Arguing that urban density is assembled as particular political projects, the paper seeks to understand the achievements urban densification projects bring together, from housing policy to environmental policy, property schemes and financial strategies. Based on a qualitative study of urban densification strategies and projects in Oslo, the paper develops a typology of hegemonic and counterhegemonic urban density discourses and contributes to a discussion of how economically, socially and environmentally different kinds of urban densities may be assembled.

AB  - This article focuses on how Sweden's largest tenantowners' organization, HSB, deals with energy efficiency. The aim is to examine HSB's energy goals, how they are determined and how they should be implemented at four levels: the national association, the regional office, the local housing co-operatives and the tenantowners. Representatives of all four levels were interviewed. Achieving energy goals calls for common strategies involving all levels of HSB. The analysis indicates that ambitious energy goals have not been followed up with similarly ambitious implementation plans by the organization. Champions in HSB mobilize support for energy efficiency at the regional and co-operative levels, but have no effect on household engagement. The lack of interest in energy efficiency on the part of households was not only due to the collective metering of energy, but also because energy constitutes only a small part of household life.

AB  - Modeling efforts to quantitatively reconstruct vegetation from pollen have never been attempted along the forest -steppe border of China, however such studies are important in interpreting fossil pollen assemblages of vegetation change along this ecotone. In this paper, relative pollen productivity (RPP) and relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) as two important parameters in quantitative vegetation reconstruction using the LRA (Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm approach) model, are estimated from the forest-steppe ecotone north of Shanxi, China, where pollen sampling and vegetation survey were performed at 18 random sample sites. The pollen analysis results show that Artemisia, Asteraceae, Poaceae, Pinus, Picea, Quercus, Betula and Hippophae dominate the pollen assemblages with more than 80% proportion. ERV (Extended R-value) analysis showed that the RSAP is about 600 m and that around 50% of the pollen in each sample comes from beyond this distance. RPPPoaceae (pollen productivity relative to Poaceae) is estimated as more than 10 for Pinus and Hippophae and around 5 for Picea and Betula. Estimates for Artemisia (3-4) are substantially lower than those reported from other studies in the steppe biome, and for Quercus (0.5) are substantially lower than those from the forest biome in north-east China or Europe. Four additional samples were then used to test the effectiveness of two different methods for reconstruction of vegetation proportion from pollen assemblages, the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) and the Modern Analogue Technique (MAT) showed that both methods can give generally reasonable results with similarity index more than 0.6, but there is still some discrepancy between the two methods.

AB  - This article analyses late 1960s' and early 1970s' policy debate on issues concerning balance of payments in Sweden. Part of this debate was the question of fiscal austerity as a tool to achieve external balance, and if it could be used without risking economic and social unrest. The aim is twofold: first to empirically shine new light on modern Swedish economic policy in a historic context. Second to theoretically explore new ways of interpreting the relationship between political thinking and economic ideas. Special focus within the second aim are the consequences of political thinking on Keynesian economic ideas as a framework of economic understanding at the time. The study is qualitative in its methods and pays attention to limits within the relationship between economic policymaking and economic expertise. The article highlights conflicting perspectives on Keynesian ideas and the heterogeneity of these perspectives among economic experts. A heterogeneity of this kind is also shown to complicate the assumed close relationship between Social Democracy and Keynesianism in a historic context. In essence, the article shows that studying policy debates in close historic detail makes for new conclusions on the development of modern economic ideas and the part political thinking plays in it.

AB  - To manage for more sustainable wildlife viewing tourism, a better understanding of tourists' behaviour that might disturb and negatively affect wildlife such as birds is needed. We conducted a qualitative case study of visitors to Hornoya, a protected bird cliff in Northern Norway. Behaviours with the potential to disturb seabirds at the site were explored using the theory of planned behaviour as a guiding framework. In-depth interviews and observations were used to explore why some visitors perform illegal or unwanted, potentially harmful behaviours, and to understand attitudes, social norms, and perceived behaviour control as influencing factors. The tourists visited Hornoya to experience seabirds in their natural surroundings, without causing harm. They were emotionally affected by the bird encounters, which may lead to thoughts and reflections about environmental challenges and nature protection. Visitors generally did not intend to disturb birds during these encounters. However, many visitors interpreted the birds' behaviour as meaning that they were not easily disturbed. Poorly developed social norms among visitors, in combination with limited presence of surveillance/guide personnel, and strong behavioural control among some visitors (willingness and ability to engage in illegal behaviour) led to occasional breaching of formal rules as well as incidents of inappropriate, potentially disturbing behaviour towards birds. Experienced wildlife photographers tended to show willingness and ability to engage in illegal behaviour more often than the two other segments.

AB  - In the actual context of climate change threats, lithium batteries fulfil lot of expectations in order to achieve a cleaner and more sustainable solution for transports, embodied by electric vehicles. According to different studies that identified a noticeable discrepancy between consumption and production, undersupply should be expected until 2045 in the European Union. Thus, ensuring lithium supply for the growth of energy-sustainable industrialised countries is crucial, and different approaches should be undertaken as for the purpose of technological transition, time matters.
   This paper focuses in analysing lithium prices and their expected evolution. It also studies in deep five ready to-go lithium mining investment projects worldwide: Whabouchi Project in Canada, Keliber Project in Finland, Cauchari-Olaroz Salars Project in Argentina, Sonora Project in Mexico, and Pilgangoora Project in Australia. The main purpose being to provide an exhaustive analysis of lithium mining investment in order to facilitate the development of preliminary economic assessments of future mining projects, fighting again supply disruption and accelerating the transition to sustainable energy. Conclusions: state in first place that prices are expected to return to a more stable behaviour, mainly based on a ramping up of the production by miners, as there are sufficient lithium recoverable resources in order to ensure the demand of future electric vehicles. Moreover, recycling of lithium batteries will represent a significant supply for the future.
   In second place, an order of magnitude both technical and economic of this mining industry is given. Two aspects can be highlighted: (1) it was possible to establish a linear correlation between the capital expense of the lithium mining investment projects and their expected production of lithium carbonate; and (2) continental brine deposits, where the extraction of lithium is conducted by evaporation processes in man-made ponds, will not represent a push out of the market for the lithium extracted from hard rocks and clays using conventional mining methods as they have almost the same operating costs.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands and their species and populations are declining rapidly throughout Europe, bringing about a need for successful vegetation recreation methods. To maintain biodiversity and ecological services of semi-natural grasslands, we need more knowledge on the relative performance of different recreation methods. In a replicated experiment in western Norway, we evaluated two hay transfer methods (hard or light raking of local hay), sowing of local seeds and natural regeneration for recreating semi-natural grassland in a road verge. We compared treated trial plots with their respective donor plots (where hay and seeds were harvested) for three successive years by evaluating vegetation cover, species richness and species transfer rates, and vegetation dynamics analysed by Bray-Curtis compositional dissimilarity (BC) and GNMDS (Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling) ordination. Vegetation cover at the trial site exceeded that of donor sites in three years. Transfer rates of common species were high for seed sowing and both hay transfer procedures. Species composition in trial plots for all three treatments became significantly more similar to donor plots, but was still relatively dissimilar after three years. Natural regeneration showed a different temporal pattern and also had a higher successional rate. The species composition of the other treatments followed the same trajectory toward the donor sites as revealed by GNMDS. We found relatively small differences between the two hay transfer methods and seed sowing. Transfer of local hay therefore appears to be a successful method of establishing local species when recreating semi-natural grasslands, and is generally cheaper than using commercial local seed mixtures.

AB  - Sustainable business development is a challenge that requires both organizational change and changes to individual behavior. We report on the design and implementation of an app-based decision support system designed to promote environmentally responsible behavior among individuals in a B2B setting. The app, known as the "Green Fingerprint" was designed in collaboration with a commercial real estate firm and subsequently deployed in several tenant sites in the greater Stockholm area. We measured energy productivity defined as revenue in Swedish Kronor/kilowatt hours of electricity consumption. Over a two year period participating firms were able to significantly increase energy productivity by as much as much as 100% as a result of direct feedback and adopting conservation techniques recommended by the system. Increased energy productivity resulted in annual energy costs that were substantially less than if energy productivity had not increased.

AB  - Here we present the results of a study on the effects of population size, seed predation, and plant size on male and female reproductive success in ten Vincetoxicunt hirundinaria populations in southwestern Finland. We investigated male reproductive success by recording pollinia removal, and studying pollen quality and quantity. Pod and seed production, and the number of ovules per ovary were counted to estimate female reproductive success. Both pollen quality and pollinia removal were higher in small V. hirundinaria populations compared to large populations. In contrast, the quantity of pollen was higher in large populations than in small populations. Pod initiation was higher in large populations. However, large populations had higher abortion rates and proportionally fewer intact pods. Plant size did not affect male reproductive success whereas pod and seed production correlated positively with plant size, although only in large populations. Population size had no clear impact on seed predation intensities. Variation was, however, observed among populations. Larger plant individuals suffered from an increased risk of being attacked only in two populations. This correlation was not clearly attributed to plant population size. The results of this study suggest that reproductive success in V. hirundinaria may be highly variable and this variation is to some extent explained by population size. Further, population size affected male and female reproductive success differently.

AB  - Increased recycling of nutrient-rich organic waste to meet crop nutrient needs is an essential component of a more sustainable food system. However, agricultural specialization continues to pose a significant challenge to balancing crop nutrient needs and the nutrient supply from animal manure and human excreta locally. For Sweden, this study found that recycling all excreta (in 2007) could meet up to 75% of crop nitrogen and 81% of phosphorus needs, but that this would exceed crop potassium needs by 51%. Recycling excreta within municipalities could meet 63% of crop P nutrient needs, but large regional differences and imbalances need to be corrected to avoid over or under fertilizing. Over 50% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus in excreta is contained in just 40% of municipalities, and those have a surplus of excreta nutrients compared to crop needs. Reallocation of surpluses (nationally optimized for phosphorus) towards deficit municipalities, would cost 192 million USD (for 24 079 km of truck travel). This is 3.7 times more than the total NPK fertilizer value being transported. These results indicate that Sweden could reduce its dependence on synthetic fertilizers through investments in excreta recycling, but this would likely require valuing also other recycling benefits.

AB  - This is the story of how a large research facility of broad European and global interest, the European Spallation Source (ESS), ended up in the small university town of Lund in Sweden. This happened in spite of the fact that a number of influential European countries were at one time or another competitors to host the facility. It is also a story about politics which attempts to illustrate how closely intertwined politics and science are, and how the interplay between those interests affects scientific progress. ESS became an arena for individual ambitions and political manoeuvring. The different stakeholders, in their striving to ensure that their own interests were realised, in various ways and with different degrees of success over the years, have influenced the key decisions that, during the already 30 year history of ESS, have driven the course that this project has taken. What emerges is that the interests of the stakeholders and the interests of the project itself are frequently not in harmony. This imposes challenges on the management of large research facilities as they have to not only navigate in the scientific landscape, which they often are more familiar with, but also in the political landscape. This story is therefore an attempt to shed light on the role of managers of large research facilities and the often delicate balancing act they have to perform when trying to comply with the different and often conflicting stakeholder interests. What is especially worthwhile examining, as we do in this paper, is the role that individuals, and the interaction between individuals, have played in the process. This shows that the focus of stakeholder theory on organisations, rather than the people in the organisations, needs to be redirected on to the individuals representing those organisations and their interrelationships. At the same time it is clear that the developing field of stakeholder management theory has not emerged into the consciousness of science facility managers or their governing bodies and is far down the list of priorities of researchers who use the facilities.

AB  - Plantations of genetically improved forest trees are critical for economic sustainability in forestry. This review summarizes gains in objective traits and the resulting economic impact of tree breeding programmes in Scandinavia and Finland. Genetic improvement of forest trees in these countries began in the late 1940s, when the first phenotypically superior plus-trees were selected from natural environments. The main findings from this review are that (i) tree breeding can increase volume growth in the range 10-25%, and (ii) the bare land value associated with genetically improved trees gives a better return on investment and a shorter rotation period compared to the unimproved forests. As some Nordic countries are quite dependent on the forest industry, breeding programmes that have resulted in economic gains have been beneficial for society. Growth and wood quality traits are often adversely correlated, and the weighting of traits from an economic perspective could provide an index for determining maximum profit from breeding. Tree breeding faces an array of challenges in the future, such as changes in silviculture, climate, new pests and diseases, and demand for wood-based products.

AB  - Environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) largely select flagship species for conservation marketing based on their aesthetic appeal. However, little is known about the fundraising effectiveness of this approach or how it compares to ecosystem conservation campaigns that use habitat types as flagships. By performing a willingness to donate (WTD) survey of potential online donors from Finland, we identified which motivations and donor characteristics influence their preferences for a range of different flagship species and ecosystems. Using the contingent valuation method and the payment card approach, we found the combined funding for eight mammal flagship species was 29% higher funding than for eight bird flagship species. Furthermore, the aesthetically more appealing species, as well as the species and ecosystems that are native to Finland, attracted the most funding. We then used ordinal logistic regression to identify the factors influencing a donor's WTD, finding that knowledge of biodiversity conservation and familiarity with the flagship was associated with an increased WTD to birds and ecosystems, and people with higher education levels had an increased WTD to ecosystems. Surprisingly, species aesthetic appeal was not related to an increased WTD, although "need of conservation" was, suggesting that highlighting the plight of these less appealing threatened species or ecosystems could raise money. Our results suggest that the factors driving donating to mammals, birds or ecosystems differ, and so underline the importance of considering the diverse motivations behind donation behaviour in fundraising campaigns. They also provide new evidence of the motivations of online donors, an under-studied group who are likely to become an increasingly important source of conservation funding.

AB  - Social and behavioural sciences often deal with the analysis of associations for cross-classified data. This paper focuses on the study of the patterns observed on European citizens regarding their attitude towards sustainable tourism, specifically their willingness to change travel and tourism habits to be more sustainable. The data collected the intention to comply with nine sustainable actions; answers to these questions generated individual profiles; moreover, European country belonging is reported. Therefore, unlike a variable-oriented approach, here we are interested in a person-oriented approach through profiles. Some traditional methods are limited in their performance when using profiles, for example, by sparseness of the contingency table. We removed many of these limitations by using a latent class distance association model, clustering the row profiles into classes and representing these together with the categories of the response variable in a low-dimensional space. We showed, furthermore, that an easy interpretation of associations between clusters' centres and categories of a response variable can be incorporated in this framework in an intuitive way using unfolding. Results of the analyses outlined that citizens mostly committed to an environmentally friendly behavior live in Sweden and Romania; citizens less willing to change their habits towards a more sustainable behavior live in Belgium, Cyprus, France, Lithuania and the Netherlands. Citizens preparedness to change habits however depends also on their socio-demographic characteristics such as gender, age, occupation, type of community where living, household size, and the frequency of travelling before the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Using water quality data from 1964 to 2002, concentrations and loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) in the Odense River were analyzed for trends in periods subsequent to and following the implementation of the Danish Action Plan I for reduction of nutrients in the environment (DAP) in 1987. In periods between 1964 and 1987 statistical significant increasing trends in DIN and PO4-P concentrations and loads were detected. However DIN generally showed stronger trends than PO4-P and 19 of the 29 tested, 4 PO4-P load tests showed non-significant results. In the subsequent periods between 1980 and 2002, significant nutrient reductions were detected at all sites and with the strongest trends for PO4-P. Also, tests combining data from several sites showed equally strong trends. Significant positive correlations between DIN concentrations and discharge were found throughout the period using the non-parametric Spearman Rank Correlation, suggesting soil leaching to be the main nitrogen source. Conversely, correlations between PO4-P and discharge changed from significantly negative to mostly significantly positive, a phenomenon most likely due to the change in phosphorus sources.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in the number of newly registered motorcycles worldwide. However, there is not only an increase in the number of motorcycles in traffic but also an increase in the number of conflicts between motorcyclists and the surrounding environment. A relatively significant research gap can be identified in the relationship between spatial factors and motorcycle accident rates. This paper analyses the spatiotemporal patterns of motorcycle accidents and studies their underlying factors. The KDE+ method (an extension of the kernel density estimation method) is used to identify concentrations of motorcycle accident key hotspots. To study the underlying traffic accident determinants, a two-step cluster analysis is used. The analysis is based on the database of motorcycle accidents in the Czech Republic from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020. The paper achieves a few main findings. By applying the KDE+ method, the most dangerous sections of the road network in the Czech Republic were identified, where a significant accumulation of motorcycle accidents occur. Motorcycle accidents are highly seasonal. Motorcycle accidents tend to accumulate in the afternoon, especially during the summer months. Concerning the frequency of accidents and the collective risk index, urban traffic, that is the traffic density, is an important cause of motorcycle accidents, along with the winter period with rather unfavourable weather conditions, and especially the directional conditions-curves and intersections-are among the hazardous sections.

AB  - Species richness hotspots are of critical importance in conserving biodiversity, but by using simple species richness in an area, there is an inevitable bias in favour of lower latitudes. We propose a simple method for estimating regionally representative species richness hotspots where the effect of latitudinal gradients is accounted for. By using this method, the same number of species are conserved but instead of being concentrated on lower latitudes the selected areas fall into much larger geographical regions resulting in a broader range of habitat types conserved. This method suits any scale and is also applicable to other kinds of environmental gradients. These regions are illustrated with data on birds and dragonflies of Finland.

AB  - Depopulation has become a public problem in Spain. However, scientific literature on Communication has not yet paid sufficient attention to this phenomenon. This paper presents a bibliographic review using mapping technique and addresses works focused on the overlapping between depopulation and communication. We have utilised Geography of Communication to structure this review and to try to detect priority perspectives and thematic gaps. The review focuses on two approaches: the analysis of representations of depopulated territory and the structure of the media in the affected areas. The mapping shows disparate output, focused on case studies, with no unifying theoretical paradigm, given the recent attention paid to this object of study. Although this dispersion makes it difficult to establish coherent conclusions between the findings, an emerging and scientifically relevant area has been detected meriting exploration of the link between mediatization and depopulation as a demographic and socio-cultural phenomenon. The discussion proposes potential lines of research that could shed light on the impact of media factors on depopulation processes and on the cultures and experiences of these communities.

AB  - This paper explores the role public policies have or may have in favoring or disfavoring the emergence, development, and diffusion of community-based sustainability initiatives. To this end, it presents evidence collected through a survey of 63 initiatives operating in six city-regions in Europe and across various domains of active citizenship: alternative food networks, community energy, sustainable mobility, and recycling. Results show that although they are mostly driven by pragmatic goals, the case of apolitical grassroots initiatives is quite rare. Most initiatives aspire both to challenge the political regime and strengthen their relationships with policy-makers. These two dimensions are correlated, showing that an antagonist attitude is as well infrequent. When it comes to the content of these relationships, the picture becomes more problematic: while one-half of the initiatives have been supported by public policies, almost two-thirds of them encountered some policy obstacle. The issue is very much context-specific. We show that in those countries or domains where the policy environment is more supportivein the UK, Finland, waste and energythe political activities of initiatives are also more dialogical. However, in unsupportive contextsCentral and Southern Europe, and food domainthey tend to be oppositional. Based on an analysis of the most recurrent policy barriers, the paper identifies some crucial areas where public policies can make a difference in facilitating or hindering a community-led sustainability transition.

AB  - Through a case study of leisure boating along the Swedish West Coast, this study explores how two conflicting roles - consumers and environmental citizens - produce and are produced by a highly ambivalent neoliberal discourse. On the one hand, this discourse supports economic growth and increasing consumption, while on the other hand it expects consumers to consider the environmental impacts of their actions and make pro-environmental choices. Through a mixed-method approach based on the application of consumer value theory (CVT) in combination with a motivation-opportunity-ability (MOA) model, this study demonstrates how the consumer role is predominantly produced and reproduced through social pressure and market forces as well as emotional and habitual attachment to boat life and boating. This (re)production of the consumer role conflicts with the environmental citizenship role, as boaters agree that protection is needed while they also put high value on the sea as a place of freedom. The study suggests that there is a need for an environmental policy that recognises how the consumer role is produced and reproduced. Such policy should move beyond the assumption of the sovereignty of the individual and focus more closely on the interaction between humans and the sea. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding product circularity as "three-dimensional" could anchor the Circular Economy to common principles while affording its followers flexibility about how to measure it in their specific sectors and disciplines and within their organization's means. Inspired by a heuristic developed for the urban planning profession to cope with the inherent conflicts of Sustainable Development, this article argues that measuring product-level circularity should consider ways to achieve (1) high material recirculation, (2) high utilization, and (3) high endurance in products and service offerings. Achieving all three dimensions ensures that material flowing through the economy is recovered from prior use phases, that it is used intensely, and that it retains its value in spite of exogenous changes. The article argues further that these three dimensions ought to be measured and reported separately rather than as a composite metric and that certain applications will have opportunities to improve circularity through certain dimensions better than others. The article also explains how researchers at RISE (Research Institutes of Sweden AB) are working with industry and government partners to measure the three dimensions and how diverse actors interested in the Circular Economy can use the three dimensions to take the first steps in their transition to circularity.

AB  - A farmland area in southern Sweden used for cereal production was turned into energy production by growing Salix. The breeding birds were censused in these fields after energy foresting had started and the first harvest was taken.
   The introduction of Salix viminalis in the fields showed to be favourable for species well adapted to bushy habitats like the marsh warbler. The habitat succession from the planted or harvested forest to the four, five years later mature forest is important too, as bird species prefer different growth stages of the brush forest. The whitethroat and the whinchat preferred the sprouts of the recently harvested areas, but the willow warbler and the garden warbler preferred the fully grown bushes preceeding the harvest.
   Introduction of Salix fields in an open farmland landscape will increase the number of bird species and for some species also the abundance. The biodiversity is improved if the harvest is asynchronous in different subareas. In terms of environment and fauna protection or improvement a limited increase of scattered energy producing Salix fields will probably be favourable, causing an increase in overall biological diversity.

AB  - An extensive research project concerning injury prevention was planned and initiated in Motala Municipality in the early 1980s. This article summarises 25 years of work for injury prevention and safety promotion in Motala. Evaluation of both process and effect were conducted based on a quasi-experimental study design, as well as cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of interventions. Initial evaluations results showed an annual incidence of injuries of 118.9/1000 citizens in 1983/1984 consisting of injuries at home (35%), sports injuries (18.9%), injuries at work (13.7%), traffic-related injuries (12.8%) and other injuries (19.5%). The annual social economic costs of injuries were estimated at 116 million Swedish crowns (SEK). By 1989, after two years of preventive work, the incidence of injuries was reduced by 13%. The greatest decrease was among the moderate severity category of injuries (41%). The social economic costs were thereby reduced by 21 million SEK per year. Since then, work with injury prevention has continued and annual evaluations have shown that the incidence of injuries, with some fluctuation, has continued to decrease up to the latest evaluation in 2008. The total decrease during the study period was 37%. This study shows that community-based injury prevention work according to the Safe Community model is a successful and cost-effective way of reducing injuries in the local community.

AB  - Soils containing an approximately equal mixture of metastable iron sulfides and pyrite occur in the boreal Ostrobothnian coastal region of Finland, termed potential acid sulfate soil materials'. If the iron sulfides are exposed to air, oxidation reactions result in acid and metal release to the environment that can cause severe damage. Despite that acidophilic microorganisms catalyze acid and metal release from sulfide minerals, the microbiology of acid sulfate soil (ASS) materials has been neglected. The molecular phylogeny of a depth profile through the plough and oxidized ASS layers identified several known acidophilic microorganisms and environmental clones previously identified from acid- and metal-contaminated environments. In addition, several of the 16S rRNA gene sequences were more similar to sequences previously identified from cold environments. Leaching of the metastable iron sulfides and pyrite with an ASS microbial enrichment culture incubated at low pH accelerated metal release, suggesting microorganisms capable of catalyzing metal sulfide oxidation were present. The 16S rRNA gene analysis showed the presence of species similar to Acidocella sp. and other clones identified from acid mine environments. These data support that acid and metal release from ASSs was catalyzed by indigenous microorganisms adapted to low pH.

AB  - Aim To determine whether reintroduced beavers, as an example of native herbivorous megafauna, can increase freshwater biodiversity at the landscape scale and to compare effects on two contrasting taxonomic groups. Location South-central Sweden. Methods We collected data on plant and water beetle composition and supporting environmental variables from 20 closely located wetlands, half created from the damming of streams by beavers-beaver ponds (BP), and half by other, mainly natural (e.g. topographic, river migration) means-other wetlands (OW). Differences in species composition and plant growth strategy (i.e. competitor, stress tolerator or ruderal) between wetland types were assessed using multivariate analyses. Results The species pool of both taxonomic groups was higher in BP than OW (plants + 17%; beetles + 15%). For both groups, the number of species unique to BP was 50% higher than those unique to OW. Plant and beetle compositions differed significantly between wetlands, most strongly for plants, while rarity scores showed no difference, and the incidence of invasive species was negligible. Plant composition was mostly influenced by open water, bare ground and woody debris in BP, and plant cover, height and leaf litter in OW. This was consistent with the characterization of BP vegetation by ruderal plants and OW by competitors and stress tolerators. A significant residual effect of wetland type on plant, but not beetle composition, suggests that beavers exert important direct effects on some biota (e.g. via herbivory) independent of the indirect effects they exert via environmental change. Main conclusions Beaver-created ponds support novel biodiversity that is not merely a subset of that found elsewhere in the same landscape. As such, re-establishing beaver populations where they are native should benefit freshwater biodiversity, but effects may be context and taxon specific. Beavers alone cannot solve the freshwater biodiversity crisis, but recognizing the widespread importance of herbivorous megafauna in maintaining heterogeneity and creating novel habitat will be a positive step.

AB  - Transport is one of the fastest growing sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. Some European countries have adopted comprehensive "sustainable transport" policies, in which climate change is addressed. This paper looks into how sustainable transport policy frameworks deal with climate change challenges in three countries: the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In particular, the focus is on the role of follow-up and monitoring systems to keep the policies on track. For the United Kingdom, a critical analysis is made of strengths and weaknesses of the policy monitoring regime. The analysis shows that the monitoring approach, while ambitious, has suffered some deficits that may have weakened the role of the high-level strategies. Current efforts to strengthen the system are discussed. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000107. (c) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - For efficient conservation, we need to consider both what kinds of habitat species require and the landscape-level supply of these habitats. We examined the relative importance of stand and dead wood types for wood-dependent lichens in two managed boreal forest landscapes in Sweden. We found 20 species and modelled their abundance based on stand type and dead wood characteristics using hierarchical Bayesian models or point estimates. Stands <60 years both have a large total extent and a large proportion of dead wood, resulting in the main part of the populations of most wood-dependent lichens occurring there. Older managed stands and unmanaged mires harbour smaller proportions of the populations. Stumps and snags, and to some extent logs, had high abundances of many species of wood dependent lichens in managed forest landscapes, while dead branches were used by few species. Measures taken to produce more snags should benefit wood-dependent lichens in managed landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organisational perspectives propose that structural arrangements affect policy outcomes. Drawing on these perspectives, it is worthwhile to find out whether and how disagreements among public authorities create barriers to public sector adaptation and preparedness. As the literature on weather vulnerabilities and climate adaptation recommends increased public sector coordination, exploring the possibilities of governance can contribute to the improvement of lifeline conditions. Insights from a Norwegian case study suggest that the different mandates of responsible public authorities sometimes clash. Such clashes limit the abilities to sustain welfare and business conditions when avalanches and blizzards cause highway outages. The findings also show that governance might only partly improve public sector peril response measures, as there is rarely sufficient flexibility to consider specific interests or preferences, for example, to keep a highway open until a school bus or a freight delivery has passed.

AB  - Import competition from low-wage countries can worsen labor market conditions in high-income countries and undermine the sustainability of free international trade. We examine the effect of increasing manufacturing imports from China on manufacturing employment and wage earnings distribution in Sweden by employing a two-stage least squares estimation method. The empirical results indicate that, except for the transportation sector, the effect of increasing import exposure to China on manufacturing and non-manufacturing employment growth is statistically insignificant. Regarding earnings distribution, we find that the earnings growth of low-wage workers in the manufacturing sector is not significantly influenced by an increase in Chinese imports. However, wage earners at the median level or above are positively impacted by trade shocks from China. These findings have implications for seeking policy alternatives that can enhance the sustainability of the international trade order.

AB  - The diet strategy of the wolf in Europe is reviewed on the basis of 74 basic and 14 additional literature sources. The comparative analysis reveals clear dependence on the latitude (and, therefore, on the changing environmental conditions) correlated with the wild ungulate abundance and diversity. Following a geographic pattern, the wolf is specialised on different species of ungulates: moose and reindeer in Scandinavia, red deer in Central and Eastern Europe and wild boar in Southern Europe. Where this large prey is taken, the roe deer is hunted with almost the same frequency in every region. The wolf diet in Europe shows two ecological adaptations formed by a complex of variables: 1. Wolves living in natural habitats with abundance of wild ungulates feed mainly on wild prey. 2. In highly anthropogenic habitats, with low abundance of wild prey, wolves feed on livestock (where husbandry of domestic animals is available) and take also a lot of plant food, smaller prey (hares and rodents) and garbage food. The frequency of occurrence of wild ungulates in the diet of wolves in North Europe varies from 54.0% in Belarus to 132.7% in Poland, while that of livestock is in the range from 0.4% in Norway to 74.9% in Belarus. In South Europe, the frequency of occurrence of wild prey varies from 0% in Italy and Spain to 136.0% in Italy, while of domestic ungulates ranges between 0% and 100% in Spain. The low density or lack of wild prey triggers the switch of the wolf diet to livestock, plant food (32.2-85% in Italy) or even garbage (up to 41.5% in Italy).

AB  - Growing marine mammal populations have led to renewed conflicts with fisheries and discussions of culling as a management measure. In order to evaluate the effects of such measures, lessons from previous culling efforts and historic data on marine mammal abundance and distribution in response to different hunting and management regimes are pertinent. Here, we combined multiple data sources, including bounty data from the Danish seal culling programme of 1889 to 1927, zooarchaeological records, historical written accounts, 20th century hunting statistics on seals and recent population survey data, in order to assess the prehistoric and historic occurrence of seals in Denmark, and to evaluate the effects of hunting and culling on seal populations, as well as its efficacy as a mitigation measure in seal-fisheries conflicts. We found that past conflicts were driven primarily by developments of passive fishing gear technology in the late 19th century, and that-contrary to several modern interpretations-the primary motivation for culling was damage to catch and gear, not resource competition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it took decades of heavy-handed culling to minimize the historic seal-fisheries conflicts. Moreover, the culling programme should be regarded in a broader context, where preceding hunting had already decimated grey seal stocks, and subsequent hunting led to an all-time low of a few thousand harbour seals in the early 1970s. We recommend that 21st century seal-fisheries conflicts, debates and associated management decisions should be seen in a historical context, and that there should be an aim towards the development of sustainable fisheries and ecotourism, rather than culling.

AB  - Urbanisation is increasing worldwide and is regarded a major driver of environmental change altering local species assemblages. Private domestic gardens contribute a significant share of total green area in cities, but their biodiversity has received relatively little attention. Previous studies mainly considered plants, flying invertebrates such as bees and butterflies, and birds. By using a multi-taxa approach focused on less mobile, ground-dwelling invertebrates, we examined the influence of local garden characteristics and landscape characteristics on species richness and abundance of gastropods, spiders, millipedes, woodlice, ants, ground beetles and rove beetles. We assume that most of the species of these groups are able to complete their entire life cycle within a single garden. We conducted field surveys in thirty-five domestic gardens along a rural-urban gradient in Basel, Switzerland. Considered together, the gardens examined harboured an impressive species richness, with a mean share of species of the corresponding groups known for Switzerland of 13.9%, ranging from 4.7% in ground beetles to 23.3% in woodlice. The overall high biodiversity is a result of complementary contributions of gardens harbouring distinct species assemblages. Indeed, at the garden level, species richness of different taxonomical groups were typically not inter-correlated. The exception was ant species richness, which was correlated with those of gastropods and spiders. Generalised linear models revealed that distance to the city centre is an important driver of species richness, abundance and composition of several groups, resulting in an altered species composition in gardens in the centre of the city. Local garden characteristics were important drivers of gastropod and ant species richness, and the abundance of spiders, millipedes and rove beetles. Our study shows that domestic gardens make a valuable contribution to regional biodiversity. Thus, domestic urban gardens constitute an important part of green infrastructure, which should be considered by urban planners.

AB  - According to known population parameters, we used software Vortex for simulating long-term population dynamics of white tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla L.) on fourteen management options. The main purpose of the study was the assessment of the dispersion rate detection importance (integrating effects of persecution and permanent dispersion) for the long-term viability of the population.
   None of the fourteen management scenarios led the population to extinction (P(E) < 0.00). Basic scenario, the one that represents the present knowledge about the population in Croatia, was determined with deterministic (r(det)) and stochastic growth rates r(stoch) of 0.074 and 0.072 respectively. All the scenarios with assumed dispersion rate of five sub-adult pairs had significantly lower deterministic and stochastic growth rates. Four of them, all characterised with degraded conditions for both breeding and non-breeding parts of the population, resulted in negative stochastic growth rates and led the population to extinction with probabilities ranged from r(stoch) 0.05 to 0.093. According to the obtained results we gave recommendations for future monitoring program improvements focusing the field work on dispersion rate detection as well as on the non-breeding part of the population in general.

AB  - The goal of this study is to evaluate the life cycle performance of two alternative pathways to biofuels in the shipping industry: the 'diesel route' and the 'gas route'. The diesel route comprises of a shift from heavy fuel oil to marine gas oil and then a gradual shift to biodiesel, whereas the gas route comprises of a shift to liquefied natural gas and then a gradual shift to liquefied biogas. The two routes are assessed in a case study for the ferry traffic between the Swedish mainland and the island Gotland. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental performance with the functional unit chosen to be one year of ro-pax ferry service, including both passenger and goods transportation. The gas route is indicated to have better overall environmental performance than the diesel route. Furthermore, use of biofuels is illustrated as one possible measure to decrease the global warming impact from shipping, but to the expense of greater environmental impact for some other impact categories. As an example, the global warming potential (GWP(100)) was shown to decrease with the use of biofuels in this study, while the eutrophication potential and the primary energy use increased.

AB  - This paper presents a classification of motives considered as relevant when selecting a mode of transport, and it examines the relative importance of driving habits, car attitudes, descriptive norms and motives for transport mode choices for commuting, shopping, leisure and child-related trips. A survey was sent by post to 3000 Swedish residents in metropolitan, semi-rural and rural areas (with a response rate of 34.6%). Through an ordinal factor analysis, three classes of motives were extracted: Perceived outcomes, Symbolic and Instrumental motives. Hierarchical proportional odds logistic regression and hierarchical linear regression models assess the relative importance of socio-demographic variables, motives, descriptive norms, car attitudes and driving habits for each kind of trip. These models indicate that the impact of socio-demographic and psychological variables varies across trip purposes. Commuting and child- related trips were primarily predicted by socio-demographic variables. Leisure and shopping trips were mostly predicted by driving habit. Driving habit was a common and strong predictor among all trip purposes. These results are evidence of the power of script-based trips to generate habitual travel behaviours across different trip purposes. Conclusions are made in the light of the usefulness of these results to practitioners and researchers who aim to foster sustainable transportation and to reduce private car use. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - This study describes the scenarios of likely development of carbon pools in managed forest ecosystems of the Czech Republic. The analysis was based on a matrix scenario model (EFISCEN), adopting a novel parameterization based on forest stand site types and forest typology. The model was constrained by practical management rules as prescribed by the Czech Forestry Act and used to assess production potential for the next five decades under three management and three climate scenarios. The analysis provided data on carbon pool development, including both tree biomass and soil compartments.
   For the tested scenarios of sustainable forest management (wood removals not exceeding increment) the model indicated a slight increase of soil carbon pool. For the possibly largest removals (maximum sustainable felling scenario), soil carbon stabilized within two or three decades reaching a mean value of about 8.1 kg/m(2) for. At the same time, the mean carbon stock held in biomass reached about 10.2 kg/m(2) including belowground parts. No decline of soil carbon was observed for any of the tested scenarios.
   We conclude that it is reasonable to assume that soil carbon is not a source of carbon under the current management constraints as implemented in the Czech forestry practice.

AB  - CONTEXT: Information on how crop yields are affected by weather variations and extreme weather is needed to develop climate adaptation measures for arable cropping systems. Here, we analysed the effects of weather anomalies and soil texture on crop yield anomalies across Sweden from 1965 to 2020.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to (i) assess the effects of temperature and precipitation anomalies and extreme weather on crop yield anomalies for major field crops across Sweden, (ii) quantify how crop responses to weather anomalies vary along the north-south climate gradient across Sweden, and (iii) elucidate the impacts of soil texture on yield responses to weather anomalies.METHODS: We used daily mean air temperature, daily total precipitation, soil texture and crop yield data from public databases covering all 21 counties in Sweden. Yield data was detrended to account for the effects of agricultural intensification on crop productivity. To assess seasonal weather influences on crop yields, temporal trends of daily average temperature and daily total precipitation were detrended for each season containing a three-month period. We also used a water balance index and a heat wave index to evaluate the impact of extreme weather.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses showed that years with extreme weather during summer (i.e. heat waves, drought or water excess) resulted in the largest negative yield anomalies. Spring-sown crops were more negatively affected by extreme weather compared to autumn-sown crops, which we associate with differences in the lengths of the growth period for autumn-and spring-sown crops. Effects of soil texture on yield anomalies were found for spring-sown cereals, where negative effects of drought were exacerbated with increasing sand content. Moreover, we showed that the effects of weather conditions on crop yield anomalies differed between different regions within the country. In northern Sweden, crop yields were more sensitive to excess water, while drought effects were more pronounced in southern Sweden. Similarly, increased summer temperatures favoured crop yields in northern Sweden but had a negative impact on crop yields in the southern part of the country. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrates that weather impacts on yields vary between crops and locations, and that adaptation to future climate will require crop-and site-specific strategies.

AB  - Mineral exploration is facing greater challenges nowadays because of the increasing demand for raw materials and the lesser chance of finding large deposits at shallow depths. To be efficient and address new exploration challenges, high-resolution and sensitive methods that are cost-effective and environmentally friendly are required. In this work, we present the results of a sparse 3D seismic survey that was conducted in the Zinkgruvan mining area, in the Bergslagen mineral district of central Sweden. The survey covers an area of 10.5 km2 for deep targeting of massive sulphides in a polyphasic tectonic setting. A total of 1311 receivers and 950 shot points in a fixed 3D geometry setup were employed for the survey. Nine 2D profiles and a smaller 3D mesh were used. Shots were generated at every 10 m, and receivers were placed at every 10-20 m, along the 2D profiles, and 40-80 m in the mesh area. An analysis of the seismic fold coverage at depth was used to determine the potential resolving power of this sparse 3D setup. The data processing had to account for cultural noise from the operating mine and strong source-generated surface waves, which were attenuated during both pre- and post-stack processing steps. The processing workflow employed a combination of 2D and 3D refraction static corrections, and post-stack FK filters along inlines and crosslines. The resulting 3D seismic volume is correlated with downhole data (density and P-wave, acoustic impedance, reflection coefficient), synthetic seismograms, surface geology and a 3D model of mineral-bearing horizons in order to suggest new exploration targets at depth. The overall geological architecture at Zinkgruvan is interpreted as two EW overturn folds, an antiform and a synform, affected by later NS-trending folding. Two strong sets of shallow reflections, associated with the Zn-Pb mineralization, are located at the hinge of an EW-trending antiform, while a strong set of reflections, associated with the main mineralization, is located at the overturned apex of the EW synform. The NS Knalla fault that crosses the study area terminates the continuation of the mineral-bearing deposits at depth towards the west, a conclusion solely based on the reflectivity character of the seismic volume. This study illustrates that sparse 3D data acquisition, while it has its own challenges, can be a suitable replacement for 2D profiles while line cutting, and environmental footprints can totally be avoided.

AB  - This paper provides perspectives for future medical healthcare social services and businesses that integrate advanced information and communication technology (ICT) and data science. First, we propose a universal medical healthcare platform that consists of wireless body area network (BAN), cloud network and edge computer, big data mining server and repository with machine learning. Technical aspects of the platform are discussed, including the requirements of reliability, safety and security, i.e., so-called dependability. In addition, novel technologies for satisfying the requirements are introduced. Then primary uses of the platform for personalized medicine and regulatory compliance, and its secondary uses for commercial business and sustainable operation are discussed. We are aiming at operate the universal medical healthcare platform, which is based on the principle of regulatory science, regionally and globally. In this paper, trials carried out in Kanagawa, Japan and Oulu, Finland will be revealed to illustrate a future medical healthcare social infrastructure by expanding it to Asia-Pacific, Europe and the rest of the world. We are representing the activities of Kanagawa medical device regulatory science center and a joint proposal on security in the dependable medical healthcare platform. Novel schemes of ubiquitous rehabilitation based on analyses of the training effect by remote monitoring of activities and machine learning of patient's electrocardiography (ECG) with a neural network are proposed and briefly investigated.

AB  - Recreational fishing has grown substantially worldwide; for some recreational fisheries both catch and economic value now exceeds that of commercial fisheries. Monitoring of recreational fisheries effort and catch is therefore important for sustainable fisheries management. We developed and implemented an angler survey to estimate effort and catch for the recreational trolling fishery for landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) in Lake Vanern, Sweden. Major challenges were the large spatial scale and dispersed fishing effort, a lack of revenue from fishing licence sales, and a lack of catch reporting requirements. We developed a complemented roving/mail-in survey to estimate effort and catch during the main fishing periods, spring and fall, 2014. Instantaneous counts from major access sites were used for effort estimates, and mail-in surveys were used for catch rates. Our results show that Vanern supports a salmon and trout fishery of some 28.7 +/- 3.3 tonnes per year. Fishing effort was higher in the spring than in the fall, and there were seasonal differences in catch rates for trout but not for salmon. Estimates show that the recreational trolling fishery now harvests more salmon and trout annually than do the commercial and subsistence fisheries combined. This highlights the importance of continuing an angler survey program for Vanern as a key element for sustainable fisheries management, and can serve as a model for other recreational fisheries at large spatial scales.

AB  - Introduction: The global motorcycle market has grown significantly, with over 770 million vehicles estimated to be in use worldwide. Motorcycle-related road traffic deaths in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Colombia are concerning, comprising 30% of all reported fatalities. Cartagena has an average of 70 motorcyclerelated deaths annually between 2019 and 2022, making it a high-risk area for motorcyclists.Objective: The study aimed to identify factors associated with motorcyclist safety at unsignalized three-legged and four-legged intersections in Cartagena by observing the behavior of the motorcyclists and the analysis of the potential traffic conflicts. The observational analysis focused on the access of motorcyclists from a secondary road to a main road since it is the behavior offered by the most significant road interaction and the potential risk of traffic conflicts due to crossing.Methods: The observational process was consolidated at ten three-legged intersections and seven four-legged intersections. Thirty-six hours of videos were collected considering different time slots and weekdays randomly distributed during September 2019 and March 2020. The selection of the intersections included different vehicular flows and road safety conditions. The variables considered in the study were: interaction with other road users, motorcyclist behavior, vehicle handling, potential distractors, and safety elements. The study used the Swedish Traffic Conflict Technique to analyze conflict analysis, incorporating the Post Encroachment Time (PET) measurement. The analysis was developed with descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. The collected variables were analyzed individually (frequency analysis), and contrasts were conducted with the PET values. The study evaluated associations between motorcycles and other motorized road actors at intersections about behaviors and crossroads.Results: In the Records, 10,281 motorcycle accesses at three and four-Legged Intersections were interactions with other road users, where 2417 and 1903 resulted in potential traffic conflicts, respectively. Average potential conflicts per hour were 115 and 127 at three and four-legged intersections. At the two intersections, the average PET values in motorcycles were between 2.09 and 2.10 s, while in the other motorized road users, it averaged around 2.67 to 2.71 s. In the road conditions, it was identified that intersections with a traffic flow of<10,000 vehicles/day and poor visibility to the left of the intersection lead to more unsafe conditions for motorcyclists. Motorcycle taxi drivers were the user group most frequently involved in traffic conflicts. Actions on the part of motorcyclists, such as risky behaviors, not using helmets, not using turn signals, and not waiting patiently for access, showed a relationship with the potential for traffic conflicts. Finally, turns to the left, particularly the indirect turn to the left on the opposite road, showed a greater risk of traffic conflicts.Conclusions: The study found that motorcycles exhibit more severe traffic conflicts than motorized vehicles at intersections. Infrastructure conditions significantly impact the risk of intersection conflicts. Individual behaviors such as not stopping at intersections and driving recklessly increased the risk of traffic conflicts. The study recommends improving infrastructure such as visibility and signaling and implementing separators to reduce travel speed and traffic conflicts for motorcycles.

AB  - The coastal area of western Norway is characterized by heathlands of Calluna vulgaris, developed and maintained through grazing by domestic animals and burning. Pollen diagrams from five sites (Vingen, Skatestraumen, Selja, Osneset, Gossen) are presented and the heathland development discussed. Soil, topography and cultural history differ between the sites, whereas the climate is relatively similar along the coast. The investigation shows presence of Calluna in forest openings from the Mesolithic, but cultural activity including grazing did not result in heathland development before 1300 cal. BC. The oldest heathland is found in an area of moraine and marine sand well suited for agricultural activity where heathlands developed as part of the farming economy. At sites with poorer soil, heathland development took place in the Iron Age and medieval time, as outfield pastures for farms located in some distance to the sites. By the medieval monastery at Selja, heathlands existed from the Late Iron Age and expanded into grasslands and cereal fields when the monastery was abandoned. The investigation illustrates the variation that exists in heathland development and the different factors that may cause the development. Until 1000 years ago, the coastal landscape probably held a mosaic of vegetation types; heathlands, grasslands, cultivated fields and forests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Moss, Norway, a former cellulose factory is currently being adapted for new uses. The onsite digester, a high-rise steel structure that was used to make cellulose before the factory closed in 2012, is a landmark on the premises. The Directorate for Cultural Heritage has not designated heritage status to the digester, although it constitutes heritage for many who used to work at the factory. The digester now faces an uncertain material future, but that does not preclude it from being remembered in various ways. Some former factory workers suggest that its heritage can be rendered olfactory by reconstructing the putrid smell the digester emitted while in service. This paper argues that 'authorised' views of heritage can be challenged by the ways in which working-class heritage is performed and remembered.

AB  - This study empirically investigated culture's consequences on employee perceptions of the performance implications of financial and non-financial rewards. Using a sample (n = 568) drawn from the banking industry in Finland and Hong Kong, we found that although the effects and predictive capability of culture (i.e. masculinityfemininity, individualismcollectivism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance) offered some important insights, a range of other contextual factors (i.e. organizational, institutional, economic) wielded influence over and shaped rewardperformance values, preferences, and behaviours. The emergence of these new paradigms necessitates that the US centric economic and behavioural theories (e.g. exchange) that underpin rewardperformance be revisited and extended if they are to be applicable in the international context. Understanding the influence of a range of contextual forces is therefore critical to multinational organizations attempting to implement effective reward strategies aimed at achieving a diverse set of performance priorities. In addition to these novel theoretical and practical contributions, this study also paves the way for future research in this promising area of management studies.

AB  - In March 2011, Swedish Nuclear Fuel Management Co (SKB) submitted an application to the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM), and the Nacka Land and Environmental court to build a repository for high-level spent nuclear fuel (SNF) in the municipality of osthammar. The purpose of this paper is (1) to present the KBS-3 method for the direct disposal of high-level SNF and the debate about the method, (2) to analyze the ethical principles involved, and (3) how to resolve possible conflict between these principles. The paper is divided in three parts. Part 1 contains a presentation of the KBS-3 method and different items in the debate about it. Part 2 concerns the ethical dimension of the method and the different ethical principles that can be discerned explicitly or implicitly in the discussion and the regulatory framework that informs the discussion. Part 3 contains an analysis of the conflicting principles and how this conflict can be resolved. For example, it is argued that some kind of ethical meta-norm might be formulated and that the ethical principles involved in the management of SNF might be assessed in reference to such ethical meta-norm. Finally, it is discussed if and how the conflict between different principles for the management of SNF might be resolved through closer consideration of the relationship between ethical principles and technical practice.

AB  - Challenging conventional wisdom that powerful states do as they will and small states do as they must, this article advances an analysis of small states and the role they can play as agents of change in the area of peace and security. Insights from constructivist research on foreign policy contribute to explain why some small states adopt norm entrepreneurship as a diplomatic strategy and how such strategy helps small states punch above their weight in international relations. The article is based on an in-depth case study of Sweden as a norm entrepreneur promoting the norm pertaining to the prevention of violent conflicts in the EU and UN, and it assesses the impact of the following strategies used by such a norm entrepreneur: norm construction, agenda-shaping, coalition-building, and support of institutionalisation.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes are leading to impacts on individual ecosystems as well as shifts in transfer dynamics between interconnected systems. At the land-ocean interface, changes in riverine inputs of organic matter (OM) and nutrients have the potential to lead to shifts in coastal carbon and nutrient cycling with consequences for ecosystem structure and function. In this study, we assess OM and nutrient dynamics for two contrasting Norwegian river-to-fjord systems: a boreal system with a forested catchment draining into a narrow fjord (Marrow boreal system'), and a subarctic system where lowland forests and mountainous regions drain into a broad fjord broad subarctic system'). We characterized seasonal organic carbon and nutrient concentrations and DOM absorption properties for samples collected along transects from river to outer fjord during 2015/2016. While differences in catchment properties drove contrasts in river chemistry between the two study rivers, fjord morphology and hydrodynamics as well as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations in marine receiving waters predicted water-chemistry patterns along the transect. The narrow boreal system, with high riverine DOC and nutrient concentrations, was structured mainly by a horizontal salinity gradient from river to outer fjord, with limited impact of seasonality. In contrast, the broad subarctic system tended to be dominated by vertical salinity stratification, with strong between-date differences in surface water salinity linked to seasonality in river discharge. These dynamics were also reflected in the strong horizontal gradients in DOC, nutrients and DOM properties in the narrow boreal system, in contrast to the broad subarctic system, where strong seasonality paired with a lack of strong contrast between riverine and marine concentrations of DOC and most nutrients led to an uncoupling between salinity and other water chemistry variables. In the narrow boreal system, terrestrial OM dominated both the particulate and dissolved OM pools, while OM in the broad subarctic system was derived primarily from marine phytoplankton. Non-linear declines in NO3 + NO2 were observed consistently in the boreal system and during the productive spring season in the subarctic system, suggesting biological uptake and a potentially important role of these rivers as sources of bioavailable N to coastal ecosystems. The results from these two case studies highlight the complex and interacting effects of catchment landcover, river water chemistry and discharge, fjord morphometry and hydrodynamics in structuring the transport, fate and potential impacts of terrestrially-derived nutrients and organic matter in northern coastal environments.

AB  - Climate-driven increase in the frequency of extreme hydrological events is expected to impose greater strain on the built environment and major transport infrastructure, such as roads and railways. This study develops a data driven spatial-statistical approach to quantifying and mapping the probability of flooding at critical road-stream intersection locations, where water flow and sediment transport may accumulate and cause serious road damage. The approach is based on novel integration of key watershed and road characteristics, including also measures of sediment connectivity. The approach is concretely applied to and quantified for two specific study case examples in southwest Sweden, with documented road flooding effects of recorded extreme rainfall. The novel contributions of this study in combining a sediment connectivity account with that of soil type, land use, spatial precipitation-runoff variability and road drainage in catchments, and in extending the connectivity measure use for different types of catchments, improve the accuracy of model results for road flood probability.

AB  - Continuing geographic spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) poses a serious threat to the sustainable future of cervids and hunting in North America. Moreover, CWD has been detected in captive cervids in South Korea and, in recent years, in free-ranging reindeer in Europe (Norway). Management of this disease is limited by logistical, financial, and sociopolitical considerations, and current strategies primarily focus on reducing host densities through hunter harvest and targeted culling. The success of such strategies in mitigating the spread and prevalence of CWD only upon detection is questionable. Here, we propose a proactive approach that emphasizes pre-emptive management through purposeful integration of virtual experiments (simulating alternate interventions as model scenarios) with the aim of evaluating their effectiveness. Here, we have used a published agent-based model that links white-tailed deer demography and behavior with CWD transmission dynamics to first derive a CWD outbreak trajectory and then use the trajectory to highlight issues associated with different phases of the CWD outbreak (pre-establishment/transition/endemic). Specifically, we highlight the practical constraints on surveillance in the pre-establishment phase and recommend that agencies use a realistic detection threshold for their CWD surveillance programs. We further demonstrate that many disease introductions are "dead ends" not leading to a full epidemic due to high stochasticity and harvesting in the pre-establishment phase of CWD. Model evaluated pre-emptive (pre-detection) harvest strategies could increase the resilience of the deer population to CWD spread and establishment. We conclude it is important to adaptively position CWD management ahead of, rather than behind, the CWD front.

AB  - The development of new technologies and the necessity to pay attention to sustainable development, on the one hand, and increasing the cultivated area to gain more product, on the other hand, have made the protection and improvement of the environment one of the most important concerns of policymakers. Accordingly, in recent years, extensive theoretical and empirical research has been conducted to find ways to improve the quality of the environment and its effective factors. In this regard, this paper assessed the impact of value-added agriculture and globalization on CO2 emission in the agricultural sector in selected developing countries, including Japan, Germany, the UK, France, Italy, South Korea, Spain, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and Australia. For this purpose, panel data over 1995-2017 and the random effects method were used. The results indicated that value-added agriculture and globalization had an inverse relationship with CO2 emission in the agricultural sector of developed countries. According to the results, it is recommended to reform infrastructures and optimize resource utilization by entering and promoting cleaner technologies, and furthermore attracting foreign investments, which are a part of criteria forming globalization.

AB  - In this study we investigated population dynamics of a perennial forb, Plantago media, in semi-natural grasslands in southeastern Sweden. Plantago media is a rather common inhabitant of grasslands in this region, but it has been shown to experience dispersal limitations both among managed grassland sites and at potential dispersal routes along road verges. The demography of P. media was studied in 22 permanent plots at two sites over five years. A seed sowing experiment was also performed at each site. The Life-cycle of P. media includes seedlings, juveniles, small vegetative rosettes, large vegetative rosettes and flowering rosettes. The population growth rates (lambda-values) were negative for both populations, with one exception: the first year transition matrix at one site. The projected life span for individuals surviving from seedlings to flowering rosettes varied between 19.6 yr and 227.8 yr. Elasticity analysis showed that remaining in the large rosette stages, both vegetative and flowering, was the most important factor influencing population growth rate. LTRE analysis gave similar results, indicating that spatial and temporal variation have similar effects on the population growth rate. The expected time to extinction in populations with an initial size of between 100 and 1000 individuals varied between 60 and 200 yr. The seed sowing experiment showed that seedling emergence was enhanced by both seed addition and disturbance, suggesting that recruitment is limited by seed and microsite availability. Recruitment was not found to have much impact on population growth rate. However, long-term population maintenance may depend on occasional small-scale disturbances that enhance pulses of recruitment. Fragmented landscape is likely to effect plant populations including rare and endangered species as well as more common species which have limited dispersal mechanisms.

KW  - OBJECTIVES
AB  - Cod and haddock are two of the "big 5" UK supermarket fish species and intrinsic to fish and chip shops nationwide. UK whitefish fleets produce a significant amount, however there is a reliance on imports to maintain supply. The UK is in a strong position to compete for raw material from Iceland and Norway given high prices paid for imports and investment by Icelandic and Norwegian companies in the UK. Regarding UK production of whitefish, the European Common Fisheries Policy landing obligation has introduced significant uncertainty. To avoid discarding of any quota stock, fishing may be stopped before all target stocks quota is reached. For demersal fleets, there is a transition period between 2016 and 18 where target stocks are introduced according to Advisory Council and EU agreement and Article 15, with all quota stocks from 2019. As the capacity of the fleets balance to the new regulations, supply will likely return and if maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is reached in 2020 then an increase in TACs from current levels is likely too. However, markets and industries can change in a short period. Particularly, most processing companies are small to medium size enterprises and those that concentrate on cod and haddock may have to adjust their business. Fleets could be resilient to such short term reductions in landings however this cannot be assumed. The competitiveness of producers will surely be affected in the short to medium term as a result.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze social innovations in a broader context in order to achieve sustainable development goals. In terms of a response to the research questions, a comprehensive analysis of an alteration process in rural development was conducted while identifying the social innovations, highlighting the good practices, and conceptualizing the social innovation typology of peripheral rural areas. The methodology included a comparative analysis addressing three European regions, namely Northern, Central, and Western Europe, represented by Finland, Croatia, and France, respectively, together with their nine good practice examples during a biennial RUR'UP project period. The results demonstrate the typological differences between the selected examples of social innovations that stimulate the rural development of peripheral rural areas. These examples were formulated by the different social conditions in which these innovations were created. As a traditional economic activity in rural areas, agriculture is a great challenge for the application of innovations, can effectuate changes in the economic activities of the rural population, and can promote social and economic sustainability. In conclusion, significant differences among the regions were proven on the basis of social, environmental, and economic impacts arising from the application of social innovation.

AB  - Atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) was collected at Ny-Alesund (Svalbard Islands, Norwegian Arctic) during spring and summer from 2010 to 2014 and analysed for lead content, enrichment factor and isotopic composition (Pb-208/Pb-206 and Pb-207/Pb-206). It was found that atmospheric lead was mainly of anthropogenic origin and neither its mean concentration, nor its isotopic composition was subjected to significant inter-annual differences (p-value > 0.1). Seasonal differences in both lead content and isotopic compositions occurred (p-value < 0.001), with the exception of 2013 samples. Lead content in spring was higher than in summer. Isotopic analysis indicated that mining and smelting activities in the Rudny Altay region (Central Eurasia), as well as industrial emission in north-eastern North America, were the main sources of atmospheric lead in spring and summer, respectively. During 2013, no significant differences between the two seasons were found (p-value > 0.3), showing a prolonged influence of Eurasian sources also in summer. The results obtained by the Pb isotopic composition were corroborated by a back trajectory cluster analysis of air-masses reaching the sampling site. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concepts of bioeconomy and sustainable development are interlinked. In many countries, the bioeconomy is often the subject of efforts to quantify it from the state level, and therefore, the question arises as to whether the data regarding the financial support of an FBE in individual countries can be considered mutually comparable, with the aim of including them, for example, among the criteria for measuring sustainability (e.g., indicators of sustainable development-SDI). This option has political implications for political representation, taking the form of a comparable indicator in the approaches of individual states. This article analytically compares FBEs and our understanding of them in selected countries: Czechia, Slovakia, Finland, Italy, and Germany. Czechia financially supports various areas of forestry through European funds (Rural Development Programme, RDP CZ). In this article, we assess this support from the point of view of the perceptions of the FBE in the studied states, with an emphasis on the view of Czechia. First, an FBE analysis of the selected official and supporting documents of the studied countries was performed. The total financial data from the supported projects from the RDP CZ were subsequently assigned to these areas. Thus, the idea of financial support for the FBE through the RDP CZ from the perspectives of the selected countries was born. The differences in the perception of the FBE according to the description derived from the analysis were also confirmed by the different financial quantifications (hypothetical) of these different views. The obtained results demonstrate an incomparable state of perception of the FBE among the selected countries. For these reasons, it is currently inappropriate to use the level of FBE financial support to measure sustainability.

AB  - The life modes and sizes of 98 species of higher crustaceans (Malacostraca) from Hornsund and Kongsfjorden (Svalbard fjords) were analyzed. The majority (90%) of the species were perennial, K strategists, with eight- to tenfold size differences between newborn and adult specimens. The largest species are carnivores and carrion feeders, while the smallest are sediment-dwelling suspension and deposit feeders. Compared with the crustacean fauna of northern Norway (over 500 species), the Svalbard fjord crustacean fauna is less diverse (below 150 species). The crustacean species populations from the Arctic fjord are more numerous (average number of ind./species/m(2)) compared to those of the northern Norway boreal fjords. Crustaceans with long life cycles and distinct size difference between juveniles and adults represent three to five ecologically different functional "species" each, since the smaller size groups of the same species differ with regard to their mobility, food and habitat use. Thus, crustaceans are ecologically and functionally more diverse than expected from simple species count.

AB  - Blooming filamentous algae recurrently overgrow macroalgae and seagrass in many coastal ecosystems, leading to potential losses in the functions and services these habitats provide. The seasonal reoccurrence of algal blooms is partly caused by excessive input of nutrients into coastal ecosystems. At the same time, overfishing of top predators has led to increased densities of smaller predators that reduce herbivore abundance. Managers of coastal ecosystems are in urgent need of information on how overfishing may act synergistically with eutrophication to promote algal blooms. In the present study, we model the interaction between the opportunistic filamentous algae Ulva spp. and the effective mesograzer (small invertebrate herbivore) Gammarus locusta L. under different nutrient regimes and predation rates by intermediate-size fish (4 to 12 cm). The aim is to assess how productivity, herbivory and predation interact to regulate seasonal algal growth under a range of scenarios, including temporal matching or mismatching between trophic groups. The model is parameterised with nutrient and demographic data from a seagrass ecosystem on the west coast of Sweden. Model simulations show that both nutrient level and herbivore abundance regulate seasonal algal biomass in the seagrass meadow. Their relative importance is dynamic and sensitive to the arrival times of herbivores in relation to the start of algal development in spring. Thus, herbivore presence and timing are crucial factors for the control of algal biomass, particularly during times when resource levels are ambient to slightly elevated. Simulations also show that it is mainly the predation rate and timing of predators, rather than food limitation, that limit herbivore abundance. As predation rates by invertebrates and smaller fish can be linked to the presence of larger and commercially targeted fish, overfishing may have similar effects to eutrophication in the seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - Multidisciplinary approach is used to evaluate concrete with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) from technical, environmental impacts and product circularity perspectives. Two RCA replacements investigated, RAC50: fine aggregates; RAC100: both coarse, fine aggregates. Reference, recycled concretes have same cement content, similar workability and compressive strength requirement, proven experimentally. RCA is sourced from pre-fab element discards of a Swedish plant, the logistical alternatives requiring environmental impact analysis. Alternatives are RCA crushing at plant and crushing at a different location including transportation. LCA shows transportation is second largest contributor after cement in all impact categories. RAC alternatives show lower total impact than reference concrete due to RCA replacement. A circularity index for concrete based on economic value of recirculated aggregates; supplements LCA for sustainability reporting. Circularity index results: RAC100 > RAC50 > RC. Combining circularity index with LCA helps optimize recycling process with regard to amount of recycled material and logistics respectively.

AB  - Purpose: Last-mile fulfilment is among the most energy consuming logistics operations in the supply chain because of the vast amount of stops and low fill rates. The study's purpose is to explore last-mile fulfilment options in regard to their energy efficiency and to develop guiding propositions for energy efficient last-mile fulfilment options.
   Design/methodology/approach: Interviews with Swedish retailers and their logistics service providers (LSPs) were conducted to compare different last-mile fulfilment options for consumer goods. Data of these options in respect to energy efficiency was analysed in regard to a framework with the components of distribution structure, transportation execution, and household logistics capability.
   Findings: This study analysed the energy efficiency of six distinct options in the last-mile fulfilment. Since transportation in the last mile is highly energy consuming, energy could be saved in last-mile fulfilment when goods are carried as far as possible collectively down in the supply chain to collection points close to the point of consumption (POC) in commercial vehicles with high fill rates. The end consumer should be responsible for only the last part of the last mile. Proximity between private households and collection points increases the possibility that the consumer will walk or use public transportation.
   Practical implications: This study provides insights to managers of logistics companies and retailers regarding how to save energy in last-mile logistics fulfilment.
   Originality/value: Viewing consumers as co-producers of logistics solutions and aligning the distribution structure, transportation execution, and household logistics capability suggest propositions for the improved energy efficiency of last-mile fulfilment options in the supply chain.

AB  - The relative abundance within a guild of six species of the lichen-forming fungal genus Umbilicaria was studied during primary colonization of rock surfaces in a chronosequence of ca. 245 y in an alpine glacier foreland in southern Norway. Although the density of the guild grew from zero to more than 1000 thalli/m(2) and the species differ substantially in life history traits such as initial growth rate, maximal size, maturation rate and propagule types, the relative abundance among the species remained almost unchanged through those years. The relative abundance of species is correlated with their life history parameters, such as initial growth rate and size-related maturation. The pattern of relative abundance was also similar in the saxicolous communities outside the foreland, which are potentially several thousand years old. Outside the foreland however the density of the guild is only 1/10 of that in the oldest parts of the foreland, due to soil formation and vegetation growth that have covered many of the low profile rock habitats. Thus the areas affected by the disturbance of glacier expansions and retreats provide temporary opportunities for large increases in the population sizes of the members of the saxicolous community. The observations support the view that pre-emption of habitat rather than competitive exclusion is common in saxicolous lichen communities and that "succession" consists in the addition but rarely the loss of species.

AB  - Several process-based models for simulating the growth of perennial grasses have been developed but few include the simulation of regrowth. The model CATIMO simulates the primary growth of timothy (Phleum pratense L), an important perennial forage grass species in northern regions of Europe and North America. Our objective was to further develop the model CATIMO to simulate timothy regrowth using the concept of reserve-dependent growth. The performance of this modified CATIMO model in simulating leaf area index (LAI), biomass dry matter (DM) yield, and N uptake of regrowth was assessed with data from four independent field experiments in Norway, Finland, and western and eastern Canada using an approach that combines graphical comparison and statistical analysis. Biomass DM yield and N uptake of regrowth were predicted at the same accuracy as primary growth with linear regression coefficients of determination between measured and simulated values greater than 0.79, model simulation efficiencies greater than 0.78, and normalized root mean square errors (14-30% for biomass and 24-34% for N uptake) comparable with the coefficients of variation of measured data (1-21% for biomass and 1-25% for N uptake). The model satisfactorily simulated the regrowth LAI but only up to a value of about 4.0. The modified CATIMO model with its capacity to simulate regrowth provides a framework to simulate perennial grasses with multiple harvests, and to explore management options for sustainable grass production under different environmental conditions.

AB  - Boundary layer concentrations of several volatile organic compounds (VOC) were measured during two campaigns in springs of 2003 and 2006. The measurements were conducted over boreal landscapes near SMEAR II measurement station in Hyytiala, Southern Finland. In 2003 the measuremens were performed using a light aircraft and in 2006 using a hot air balloon. Isoprene concentrations were low, usually below detection limit. This can be explained by low biogenic production due to cold weather, phenological stage of the isoprene emitting plants, and snow cover. Monoterpenes were observed frequently. The average total monoterpene concentration in the boundary layer was 33 pptv. Many anthropogenic compounds such as benzene, xylene and toluene, were observed in high amounts. Ecosystem scale surface emissions were estimated using a simple mixed box budget methodology. Total monoterpene emissions varied up to 80 mu g m(-2) h(-1), alpha-pinene contributing typically more than two thirds of that. These emissions were somewhat higher that those calculated using emission algorithm. The highest emissions of anthropogenic compounds were those of p/m xylene.

AB  - Symbiotic linkages in industry clusters in the form of interconnected materials, energy and information flows, and close proximity provide unique opportunities to develop efficient environmental strategies. The purpose of our study is to examine the practical potential of applying a life cycle approach in strategy evaluations, as the environmental impact caused by industrial symbiosis systems outside the company gates has been scarcely addressed. This is done by evaluating two strategies for an industry cluster in Sweden: (1) to replace a share of the fossil feedstock used in the industry cluster with forest-based feedstock and (2) to improve energy efficiency through thermal energy integration. The environmental impact reduction potential of the strategies is evaluated using life cycle assessment. The ratio between investment cost and reduced global warming potential is used as an indicator to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the strategies. Results demonstrate the importance of applying a life cycle perspective as the assessment outcome depends heavily on whether only on-site consequences are assessed or if upstream and downstream processes are also included. 20% of the greenhouse gas emission reduction of the energy integration strategy occurs off-site, whereas the forest strategy has the largest reduction potential off-site, >80%.

AB  - Securing the society is a central task of the state. On the present day, as well as in the future, knowledge and information are ever more closely tied to electronic data transfer. Finland's newly published Cyber Security Strategy depicts how the government safeguards electronic data transfer, that is, information security against different threat and risk scenarios. Cyberspace has humane element and technological element. It is a way to influence and effect society. It may be used to influence minds or attack physical world for example by disrupting traffic control. But cyberspace cannot exist without people. Strategic communication is a concept that unites efforts of governmental organizations to influence people in support of national interests. Strategic Communication is in a heated discussion in the military field. How the militaries can be credible and uphold the high standards of democracy within the asymmetric and complex battlefield. To be credible one must act according to what is said. Challenge is that the scene is global in the information age. The act, the actor, the scene, the purpose - all are exposed in a very short notice to the global audience through cyberspace. The most effective way to show the scene and actors is an audiovisual product. Examples of this come from all conflict zones. Militaries are establishing Youtube channels and providing material from the intense fighting and frontline action. The solution has been the Combat Camera capability. Media trained soldiers who are in the place where main effort is taken. Within spirit of strategic communication, Cyber strategy itself is a one way to operationalize cyber security by announcing measures to be taken against cyber attacks. In this article we take phenomenological reflections on the Finnish Cyber Strategy and Strategic Communication.

AB  - Aim To examine seven determinants of Registered Nurses' aspirations to become a manager in four Norwegian public hospitals. Background Research evidence shows that nurses submit few applications to management positions. Understanding the determinants that influence nurses' aspirations to become managers can provide healthcare organizations with important knowledge on the drivers and barriers in recruitment and on the development of nurse managers. Design This study adopted a cross-sectional web-based survey design. Method Logistic regression analysis based on 2,630 Registered Nurses' responses to a self-completion survey in a Norwegian regional health authority collected during October 2014. The overall response rate was 40%. Results Findings indicate that men and younger nurses are most likely to report an aspiration in management. The social support of an immediate supervisor and institutional stress are positively associated with an aspiration to become a manager; however, high experienced workloads have the opposite effect. Conclusion Healthcare organizations should work strategically to develop a human resource management policy that ensures that the organization develops the nurse managers it needs now and in the future. Impact This study addresses the challenge of having enough qualified nurse managers. The main findings indicate that job demands can have both a negative and positive impact on nurses' aspirations to become a manager. Healthcare organizations should, however, reduce demands and consider increasing job resources. The results should have an impact on the human resource department, managers, and other key personnel in healthcare organizations.

AB  - Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) has been applied to animal bones from the Late Iron Age (650-1050 CE) at the site of Old Uppsala, Sweden, to explore meat consumption and waste management at the site and to evaluate the inferential value of MCA, as indicated by earlier research using this technique. MCA describes variation within the data, which provides a platform from which to contextualize taphonomic traces at Old Uppsala. The data comprises bones from the many pit houses at Old Uppsala, categorized by taxon, anatomical parts and presence of taphonomic markers from burning, butchery, gnawing, trampling and weathering. The results show a clear variation in the distribution of animal bones between the pit houses. For example, differences in fragmentation degrees and in signs of bone exposure indicate different accumulation rates between the assemblages. The results also suggest that cultural practices affected the distribution of animal bones, especially in terms of spatial and social differences in animal consumption. The frequencies of bones from the axial skeleton, from pig, and possibly also from horse, differed within the settlement. We suggest that the uneven patterns of especially pig and horse bones were shaped by context specific meat consumption, influenced by the animal symbolism of the Old Norse societies, where these animals had strong, albeit different, symbolic connotations.

AB  - Plant-plant interaction plays a key role in regulating the composition and structure of communities and ecosystems. Studies of plant-plant interactions in forest ecosystems have mainly concentrated on growth effects of neighboring plants on target trees. Physiological effects of neighboring plants on target trees, in particular understorey effects on physiology of overstorey trees, have received less attention. It is still unclear what is the physiological mechanisms underlying positive growth effects of understorey removal, although understorey removal has been applied to improve the wood production for hundreds of years worldwide. Only 17.5% of published works dealt with understorey-overstorey interactions and only a few of those researched the understorey effects on the physiology of overstorey trees. Case studies indicated that overstorey Abies faxoniana trees grown with different understorey shrubs showed significantly different levels of tissue nitrogen and mobile carbohydrates. Removal experiment showed that nitrogen and mobile carbohydrates concentrations in Cunninghamia lanceolata trees grown in the absence of understorey shrubs differed significantly (pure stand > mixture) with those in trees grown in the presence of understorey shrubs, in particular during the dry season. This review highlighted that the neighboring woody plants affect C- and N-physiology in overstorey trees. These effects may be mainly resulted from underground competition for soil water rather than for other resources as the effects were more pronounced during the dry season. The present review suggests that positive effects of neighboring removal (e.g., understorey removal, thinning) on overstorey trees can be expected more rapidly and strongly in stressful area (e.g., low rainfall, nutrient-poor site) than in areas with optimal growth conditions. Hence, ecophysiology- based management strategies for dealing with neighboring plants in forest ecosystems should take into account: 1) site conditions, 2) timing, duration and frequency of management practices, and 3) species-specific properties and other aspects such as biodiversity conservation and soil erosion.

AB  - Migratory connectivity describes to which degree different breeding populations have distinct (non-overlapping) non-breeding sites. Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus, over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non-breeding period. The post-breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub-Saharan non-breeding range, with a post-breeding migration to east Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre-breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter-clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub-Saharan non-breeding sites, differed among populations. However, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations; neither during post-breeding migration in autumn, nor pre-breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non-breeding sites (neither post-nor pre-breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post-breeding and pre-breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non-breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non-breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants.

AB  - Bottom trawling and seabed littering are two serious threats to seabed integrity. We present an overview of the distribution of seabed litter and bottom trawling in Norwegian waters (the Norwegian Sea and the southern Barents Sea). Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) records and trawl marks (TM) on the seabed were used as indicators of pressure and impact of bottom trawling, respectively. Estimates of TM density and litter abundance were based on analyses of seabed videos from 1,778 locations, surveyed during 23 cruises, part of the Norwegian seabed mapping programme MAREANO. The abundance and composition of litter and the density of TM varied with depth, and type of sediments and marine landscapes. Lost or discarded fishing gear (especially lines and nets), and plastics (soft and hard plastic and rubber) were the dominant types of litter. The distribution of litter reflected the distribution of fishing intensity (density of VMS records) and density of TM at a regional scale, with highest abundance close to the coast and in areas with high fishing intensity, indicated from the VMS data. However, at a local scale patterns were less clear. An explanation to this could be that litter is transported with currents and accumulates in troughs, canyons, and local depressions, rather than reflecting the fisheries footprints directly. Also, deliberate dumping of discarded fishing gear is likely to occur away from good fishing grounds. Extreme abundance of litter, observed close to the coast is probably caused by such discarded fishing gear, but the contribution from aggregated populations on land is also indicated from the types of litter observed. The density of trawl marks is a good indicator of physical impact in soft sediments where the trawl gear leaves clear traces, whereas on harder substrates the impacts on organisms is probably greater than indicated by the hardly visible marks. The effects of litter on benthic communities is poorly known, but large litter items, such as lost fishing gear may add to the direct negative effects of bottom trawling.

AB  - Did MacMillan Bloedel really end the "war in the woods?" After years of intense battling, Greenpeace brought out the champagne for MB's June 1998 announcement of a new direction in forestry. In January 1999, Tomorrow Magazine, a global environmental business publication produced in Sweden, named MB "Company of the Year." MacMillan Bloedel Vice President Linda Coady, a key player in the company's remarkable turnaround, says that behind the scenes, the conflict continues. And surprisingly, she says it's appropriate and even beneficial to sustain debate over BC's forests - although on a different plane, where competition and cooperation are seen as two sides of the same coin, and where ideological polarization is replaced by the kind of relationships that can deal with complexity.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the largest anthropogenic sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs), with dairy and beef production accounting for nearly two-thirds of emissions. Several recent papers suggest that dung beetles may affect fluxes of GHGs from cattle farming. Here, we put these previous findings into context. Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7% and 12% respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0.05-0.13% reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all cow pats end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes. In contrast, we suggest that the effects of dung beetles may be accentuated in tropical countries, where more manure is left on pastures, and dung beetles remove and aerate dung faster, and that this is thus a key area for future research. These considerations give a new perspective on previous results perspective, and suggest that studies of biotic effects on GHG emissions from dung pats on a global scale are a priority for current research.

AB  - In this study, we reconstructed the long-term fire history of a set of ombrotrophic peatlands (bogs) located in a temperate region of southern Quebec (Bas-Saint-Laurent). Past and recent fire-free intervals (time interval between two consecutive fires) were compared using macrofossil analyses. During most of the Holocene epoch, fires were relatively rare events in bogs of the Bas-Saint-Laurent region. The fire-free intervals were approximately ten times longer (all sites considered) before the beginning of agricultural activities in the region (1800 AD) than after. This strongly suggests an anthropogenic influence on the fire regime prevailing in the bogs over the last 200 years. However, the shortening of the fire-free intervals was mainly the result of the ignition of one or two fires in almost every site during a relatively short period (200 years), rather than a higher fire frequency in each of the bogs. In some cases, fires had an influence on the vegetation structure of bogs, but it is more likely that a combination of several disturbances (fire, drainage, and drier than average summers) favoured the establishment of dense stands of pine and spruce, a forest expansion phenomenon that is now widespread in temperate bogs.

AB  - To achieve sustainable fisheries, advice to management should be based on reliable science and unbiased data. Attaining quality data (i.e. precise and unbiased) on recreational fishing can be challenging, particularly when prior knowledge of the sector is limited and a proper sample frame of recreational fishers or vessels does not exist. In this study, a registry of access points was constructed for the Swedish south-west coast and used as a spatial sample frame in determining both effort and catches of the private boat fishery. Sampling dates, times for sampling, and access points visited were selected using probabilistic methods, ensuring unbiased results. The final multi-stage sampling design involved multiple strata, clusters, and probability selection methods and enabled first-time estimation of Swedish recreational landings of western Baltic cod by private boats to be used in stock assessment. Concurrent data collection covering aspects such as boat counts at access points, provided additional information on e.g. activity patterns. That additional information opens possibilities to refine the design of the original survey and optimize the sampling effort towards different goals, such as other fished resources. In this paper, we reflect on the challenges that limitations in initial information poses to the design and deployment of a new recreational fisheries survey. We suggest ways, whereby indirect sampling frames can be developed from initially incomplete or limited information to access the fishers and their catch. Our experience shows that, despite initial frame and knowledge limitations, full probabilistic methods are worth considering in data limited scenarios and that the design-based point estimates and variances they provide on recreational fishing effort and catches are useful in guiding initial management and the next steps of survey improvement.

AB  - This paper presents energy and exergy analyses as a useful concept in analysing true efficient energy utilisation of the Nigerian residential sector by considering energy and exergy flows in this sector for a period of 15 years from 1991 to 2005. The energy and exergy flows considered include the commercial and the 'non-commercial' energy sources. The most efficiently utilised energy source appears to be the Liquefied Petroleum Gas and the least efficient, kerosene. Electricity utilisation exergy efficiency has been adversely affected by the vapour-compression air-conditioning application apart from low potential thermal energy applications. The overall utilisation energy and exergy efficiencies have been found to be 19.89% and 4.38%, respectively.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fixation in the feather moss-cyanobacteria association represents a major N source in boreal forests which experience low levels of N deposition; however, little is known about the effects of anthropogenic N inputs on the rate of fixation of atmospheric N-2 in mosses and the succeeding effects on soil nutrient concentrations and microbial community composition. We collected soil samples and moss shoots of Pleurozium schreberi at six distances along busy and remote roads in northern Sweden to assess the influence of road-derived N inputs on N-2 fixation in moss, soil nutrient concentrations and microbial communities. Soil nutrients were similar between busy and remote roads; N-2 fixation was higher in mosses along the remote roads than along the busy roads and increased with increasing distance from busy roads up to rates of N-2 fixation similar to remote roads. Throughfall N was higher in sites adjacent to the busy roads but showed no distance effect. Soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition exhibited a weak pattern regarding road type. Concentrations of bacterial and total PLFAs decreased with increasing distance from busy roads, whereas fungal PLFAs showed no distance effect. Our results show that N-2 fixation in feather mosses is highly affected by N deposition, here derived from roads in northern Sweden. Moreover, as other measured factors showed only weak differences between the road types, atmospheric N-2 fixation in feather mosses represents a highly sensitive indicator for increased N loads to natural systems.

AB  - A study of existing organic waste types in Malmo, Sweden was performed. The purpose was to gather information about organic waste types in the city to be able to estimate the potential for anaerobic treatment in existing digesters at the wastewater treatment plan (WWTP). The urban organic waste types that could have a significant potential for anaerobic digestion amount to about 50 000 tonnes year(-1) (sludge excluded). Some of the waste types were further evaluated by methane potential tests and continuous pilot-scale digestion. Single -substrate digestion and co-digestion of pre-treated, source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste, wastewater sludge, sludge from grease traps and fruit and vegetable waste were carried out. The experiments showed that co-digestion of grease sludge and WWTP sludge was a better way of making use of the methane potential in the grease trap sludge than single-substrate digestion. Another way of increasing the methane production in sludge digesters is to add source-sorted organic fraction of municipal solid waste (SSOFMSW). Adding SSOFMSW (20% of the total volatile solids) gave a 10-15% higher yield than could be expected by comparison with separate digestion of sludge respective SSOFMSW Co-digestion of sludge and organic waste is beneficial not just for increasing gas production but also for stabilizing the digestion process. This was seen when co-digesting fruit and vegetable waste and sludge. When co-digested with sludge, this waste gave a better result than the separate digestion of fruit and vegetable waste. Considering single-substrate digestion, SSOFMSW is the only waste in the study which makes up a sufficient quantity to be suitable as the base substrate in a full-scale digester that is separated from the sludge digestion. The two types of SSOFMSW tested in the pilot-scale digestion were operated successfully at mesophilic temperature. By adding SSOFMSW, grease trap sludge and fruit and vegetables waste to sludge digesters at the wastewater treatment plant, the yearly energy production from methane could be expected to increase from 24 to 43 GWh.

AB  - Concerns about carbon emissions from the use of fossil fuels are felt globally. In order to support sustainable energy in the future, efforts to reduce emissions are carried out by developing wood pellets as renewable energy. The Indonesian government is also concerned about advancing renewable energy technology to supply the country's industries and residents with electricity. Several factors and substitute sources hamper the growth of wood pellets as a renewable energy source in Indonesia. Studies from the past point to four obstacles to low-carbon development: sociocultural, economic, technological, and governmental. Therefore, this article aims to deter-mine the inhibiting factors and seek the best decisions for developing wood pellets as a renewable energy source. Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) procedures were applied to determine the best strategy for developing wood pellets in Indonesia. This study recruited several vital informants to identify factors and assess each alternative. The results of the analysis using ISM provide information that the Raw Materials (D11) and Standard Products (D6) sub-factors are vital in developing wood pellets as one of the renewable energies in Indonesia. Furthermore, the analysis of selecting the best alternative using TOPSIS shows that Alternative A1 (Government Incentives), with a weight of 0.825, has the longest distance. A more thorough evaluation of the articles is still needed to produce more accurate findings.

AB  - Deposition of livestock excreta on soil, either during grazing or when landspread, leads to extensive water pollution. Important transport mechanisms for diffuse pollution are surface runoff and through-soil inter-aggregate macropore flow. A two-phase approach has been adopted to represent water pollution by these mechanisms. Firstly, MACRO, a two-domain hydrological model from Sweden, described transport of ammonium and Escherichia coli microorganisms from individual fields; trampled pollution 'hotspots' were represented by reducing the soil surface layer conductivity. Excreted contaminant inputs to MACRO reflected the different stocking densities in both trampled and main field areas. Secondly, a channel network model simulated contaminant delivery to rivers, using MACRO output as input, with additional inputs to represent animals excreting directly into rivers, and other losses such as an overflowing lagoon.
   The combined models have been calibrated for a case-study Scottish dairy farm on which river flow and contaminant monitoring equipment were installed. Farm data on livestock numbers, land-spreading activities, etc. were used to set inputs to MACRO. The simulated loads of ammonium in the river showed a pattern similar to estimates from river concentrations above and below the farm, particularly in peak timings related to heavy rainfall events. The models are being used to assist in assessing engineering solutions for pollution mitigation. Providing water troughs to discourage animals from entering the river to drink has been represented in the model by excluding excreta inputs directly to the river, and is considered to have reduced pollutant loads.

AB  - Visions of postapocalyptic survival abound in contemporary culture. In the Finnish cultural and literary landscape, where such ideas have historically been extremely marginal, narratives of societal collapse have started appearing during the last ten years. This article examines Laura Gustafsson's novel Korpisoturi (Wilderness Warrior, 2016) as a critical assessment of survivalist ideology in contemporary popular culture. By focusing on questions of gender portrayal and environmental ideology, the article suggests that the novel can be approached as a comical deconstruction of a survivalist mind-set and its representation in postapocalyptic fiction. Through its humorous portrayal of a "prepper" protagonist, Wilderness Warrior renegotiates some of the inherent ideological characteristics of apocalyptic utopianism. With its critique of the paradigmatic cultural notions of global ecological catastrophes, the novel also offers a humorous account of the ultimate unnarratability of disaster in the age of the Anthropocene.
