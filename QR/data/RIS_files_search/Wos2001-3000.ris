AB  - The amount of High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) is a commonly used environmental indicator for assessing the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy, to support sustainable agriculture and monitor changes in agricultural land use in Europe. HNVf comprises agricultural areas of semi-natural state, low-intensity farming and fine-scale landscape mosaics of different habitat types. For a successful implementation, the identification of HNVf should correctly reflect the variation in biodiversity values between different agricultural landscapes. We examined how well the Finnish HNVf indicator and the sub-indicators constituting it recalculated for the purposes of this study for five study regions reflect the variation in bird and butterfly species richness and diversity patterns at different spatial scales. We found that butterfly diversity index was positively associated with the HNVf indicator at the finest scale of 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares. Among the HNVf sub-indicators, extensive cultivation of grasslands was most strongly related to the farmland bird diversity and the density of edge to the butterfly diversity. Thus, the HNVf concept reflects well the distribution of butterflies in the Finnish agricultural landscapes but insufficiently the diversity patterns of farmland birds. Importantly, semi-natural vegetation and long-term pastures the backbone of the concept presently occur in small and highly fragmented patches in agricultural landscapes in Finland. The Pan-European concept of HNVf has restricted application to farmland birds of this boreal country and the national HNVf concept may need to be revised.

AB  - The determinants of plant species richness and composition of meadows are often mutually related, showing joint effects on plant diversity. Thus, the specific objective of this paper was to evaluate the relative importance of soil, topography, and field management explanatory variables on plant species richness and composition of mown meadows in an area of the Southern Alps. The data consisted of 159 taxa sampled during the summer of 2003 in 56 10 x 10 m(2) sampling plots. For each plot, 25 explanatory variables were recorded. The variation in species richness and composition was divided into the three sets of explanatory variables using a variation partitioning method. Species richness was mostly controlled both by the short-term effect of nitrogen fertilisation, and, as stressed by studies in other landscape contexts in Europe, by the long-term effect of soil phosphorus accumulation. The decrease of plant species number on the most fertile meadows was the consequence of the dominance of few competitors or ruderals, which prevented the establishment of small stress-tolerant species. In contrast to species richness, plant species composition presented an important pure effect of topography (altitude and slope). Species composition depended on several topography, soil, and field management factors. Thus, for both conservation and restoration of species-rich hay meadows, it is necessary to maintain a low level of soil P content, and to prevent the abandonment of parcels on steep slopes and in marginal areas, because these hosted the highest level of plant diversity.

AB  - Human population growth and resource use, mediated by changes in climate, land use, and water use, increasingly impact biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. However, impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem services are rarely analyzed simultaneously and remain largely unknown. An emerging question is how science can improve the understanding of change in biodiversity and ecosystem service delivery and of potential feedback mechanisms of adaptive governance. We analyzed past and future change in drivers in south-central Sweden. We used the analysis to identify main research challenges and outline important research tasks. Since the 19th century, our study area has experienced substantial and interlinked changes; a 1.6 degrees C temperature increase, rapid population growth, urbanization, and massive changes in land use and water use. Considerable future changes are also projected until the mid-21st century. However, little is known about the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services so far, and this in turn hampers future projections of such effects. Therefore, we urge scientists to explore interdisciplinary approaches designed to investigate change in multiple drivers, underlying mechanisms, and interactions over time, including assessment and analysis of matching-scale data from several disciplines. Such a perspective is needed for science to contribute to adaptive governance by constantly improving the understanding of linked change complexities and their impacts.

AB  - Forest harvest residue is a low-competitive biomass feedstock that is usually left to decay on site after forestry operations. Its removal and pyrolytic conversion to biochar is seen as an opportunity to reduce terrestrial CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change. The mitigation effect of biochar is, however, ultimately dependent on the availability of the biomass feedstock, thus CO2 removal of biochar needs to be assessed in relation to the capacity to supply biochar systems with biomass feedstocks over prolonged time scales, relevant for dimate mitigation. In the present study we used an assembly of empirical models to forecast the effects of harvest residue removal on soil C storage and the technical capacity of biochar to mitigate national-scale emissions over the century, using Norway as a case study for boreal conditions. We estimate the mitigation potential to vary between 0.41 and 0.78 Tg CO2 equivalents yr(-1), of which 79% could be attributed to increased soil C stock and 21% to the coproduction of bioenergy. These values correspond to 9-17% of the emissions of the Norwegian agricultural sector and to 0.8-15% of the total national emission. This illustrates that deployment of biochar from forest harvest residues in countries with a large forestry sector, relative to economy and population size, is likely to have a relatively small contribution to national emission reduction targets but may have a large effect on agricultural emission and commitments. Strategies for biochar deployment need to consider that biochar's mitigation effect is limited by the feedstock supply which needs to be critically assessed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wild plant populations may harbour a myriad of unknown viruses. As the majority of research efforts have targeted economically important plant species, the diversity and prevalence of viruses in the wild has remained largely unknown. However, the recent shift towards metagenomics-based sequencing methodologies, especially those targeting small RNAs, is finally enabling virus discovery from wild hosts. Understanding this diversity of potentially pathogenic microbes in the wild can offer insights into the components of natural biodiversity that promotes long-term coexistence between hosts and parasites in nature, and help predict when and where risks of disease emergence are highest. Here, we used small RNA deep sequencing to identify viruses in Plantago lanceolata populations, and to understand the variation in their prevalence and distribution across the Aland Islands, South-West Finland. By subsequent design of PCR primers, we screened the five most common viruses from two sets of P. lanceolata plants: 164 plants collected from 12 populations irrespective of symptoms, and 90 plants collected from five populations showing conspicuous viral symptoms. In addition to the previously reported species Plantago lanceolata latent virus (PlLV), we found four potentially novel virus species belonging to Caulimovirus, Betapartitivirus, Enamovirus, and Closterovirus genera. Our results show that virus prevalence and diversity varied among the sampled host populations. In six of the virus infected populations only a single virus species was detected, while five of the populations supported between two to five of the studied virus species. In 20% of the infected plants, viruses occurred as coinfections. When the relationship between conspicuous viral symptoms and virus infection was investigated, we found that plants showing symptoms were usually infected (84%), but virus infections were also detected from asymptomatic plants (44%). Jointly, these results reveal a diverse virus community with newly developed tools and protocols that offer exciting opportunities for future studies on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of viruses infecting plants in the wild.

AB  - Forests are becoming increasingly dominant in the landscape of north-eastern Europe as a result of a decline in agriculture, land abandonment and the related trend of afforestation. This is also the case in Latvia, where former agricultural land is either artificially afforested or taken over by the natural process of secondary succession. A large spatial and temporal variety of succession and compositional diversity of tree species colonizing fields is observed in the central part of Latvia. Understanding of the possible scenarios in the development of plant communities after land abandonment is important for deciding on viable management solutions, e.g. restoration of semi-natural grasslands or forest regeneration. The aim of the research was to determine the factors affecting the course of secondary succession at its initial stage and the composition of tree species that are colonizing abandoned fields. Ten abandoned fields were surveyed, recording species composition and vegetation structure, determining soil properties and analysing correlations between these factors. The research results help to explain the mechanisms of how soil properties affect the course of succession. On fertile soils a dense herbaceous layer developed, which in abandoned fields resulted in accumulation of a thick cover of litter. Such conditions hinder establishment of typical pioneer species, e.g. grey alder Alnus incana, aspen Populus tremula and birch Betula pendula, whereas Norway spruce Picea abies is able to compete with grass species and thus can more easily establish in abandoned fields, creating favourable conditions for invasion by other tree species.

AB  - Norway is a nation with an abundant supply of energy, both from fossil and renewable resources. Due to limited domestic demand, Norway is today exporting large amounts of petroleum products. For the future, various options for export of CO(2)-lean energy exist, both from Northern and Southern Norway, and both from fossil sources (including carbon capture and storage), and renewable energies (particularly wind power). Transport vectors are hydrogen pipelines, liquid hydrogen ships and HVDC cables, and a plausible customer is central Europe due to its proximity, high population density and lack of domestic energy resources.
   Within the framework of the "NorWays" project, various options to deliver energy for hydrogen-based transportation from Norway to Germany were studied. Eight CO(2)-lean well-to-wheel energy export chains were evaluated with respect to efficiency, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts, costs and utilisation of Norwegian R&D experience. In the chosen scenarios, energy export via hydrogen pipelines and ships appeared energetically and economically interesting against existing approaches as NG and electricity export. Furthermore, increased utilisation of Norwegian R&D experience and higher value creation is anticipated by the export of a higher refined product. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While research on the ecosystem services provided by biodiversity is becoming widely embraced as an important tool in conservation, the services provided by saproxylic arthropods an especially diverse and threatened assemblage dependent on dead or dying wood remain unmeasured. A conceptual model depicting the reciprocal relationships between dead wood and saproxylic arthropod biodiversity, wildfires, climate change, forest productivity and pest outbreaks is presented. This model suggests that the ecological influence of saproxylic arthropods may extend far beyond their effects on wood decay. Several predictions arising from this view are briefly summarised with the hope of stimulating research that may ultimately help strengthen the argument for saproxylic arthropod conservation.

AB  - Dispersal is a process that increases genetic diversity and genetic connectivity of populations. We studied the turnover rate of breeding adults and genetic population structure to estimate dispersal in Peregrine Falcons in Finland. We used relatedness estimates among Finnish Peregrine Falcons over a 5-year period, genotyping over 500 nestlings with 10 microsatellite loci to reveal the rate of turnover. Our results reveal a high turnover rate (21.7%) that does not seem to be correlated with the breeding success of the previous year. The extent of population genetic structure and diversity, and possible signs of the population crash during the 1970s, was assessed with a reduced dataset, excluding relatives. We found genetic diversity to be similar to previously studied falcon populations (expected heterozygosity of 0.581) and no population genetic structuring among our sampled populations. We did not find a genetic imprint of the past population bottleneck that the Finnish Peregrine population experienced. We conclude that high dispersal rates are likely to have contributed to maintaining genetic diversity across the landscape, by mixing individuals within the species' distribution in Finland and thus preventing genetic structuring and negative effects associated with the population decline in the 1970s.

AB  - Secondary Miombo woodlands and forest plantations occupy increasing areas in Mozambique, the former due to anthropogenic activities. Plantations, mainly species of Eucalyptus and Pinus, are being established on sites previously covered by secondary Miombo woodlands. This affects the evolution, cycle and spatiotemporal patterns of carbon (C) storage and stocks in forest ecosystems. The estimation of C storage, which is indispensable for formulating climate change policies on sequestrating CO2, requires tools such as biomass models and biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEF). In Mozambique, these tools are needed for both indigenous forests and plantations. The objective of this study is to fit species-specific allometric biomass models and BCEF for exotic and indigenous tree species. To incorporate efficient inter-species variability, biomass equations were fitted using nonlinear mixed-effects models. All tree component biomass models had good predictability; however, better predictive accuracy and ability was observed for the 2-predictors biomass model with tree height as a second predictor. The majority of the variability in BCEF was explained by the variation in tree species. Miombo species had larger crown biomass per unit of stem diameter and stored larger amounts of biomass per stem volume. However, due to relatively rapid growth, larger stem diameters, heights, and stand density, the plantations stored more biomass per tree and per unit area.

AB  - Reindeer herding is both a traditional livelihood and a business still practiced in the northern parts of Eurasia. In the Nordic countries, reindeer herding has contributed to keeping remote northern areas inhabited while maintaining Indigenous cultures. Reindeer herders have also been able to adapt to new circumstances, and many of them have invested in value-adding production or secondary occupations, such as tourism. The main challenge for reindeer herding is the loss of pastures to other industries and infrastructure projects. The growing investment in wind farms-which not only compete for the same land with reindeer herding but may also disturb the herding practices-has emerged as a recent competitor to reindeer herding in the context of land use. In this article, we study the rights and opportunities of reindeer herders to participate in decision making on land use for infrastructure projects in general and wind farm projects in particular. Our focus is on the situation in Finland, but we also use examples of reported land use conflicts between reindeer herders and wind farms from other Nordic countries. The aim of this article is, on the one hand, to find out how the rights of reindeer herders in planning and making decisions on wind farms are regulated and, on the other hand, how these rights function in practice. In addition to national legislation on participation in land use, there exists a growing number of international conventions to protect the environment and the rights of Indigenous people. Wind farms are particularly interesting in that renewable energy is now internationally preferred and subsidized as "green energy" in the fight against climate change. The challenge remains how to protect traditional livelihoods and human rights while targeting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

AB  - Augmenting the genetic diversity of small, inbred populations by the introduction of new individuals is often termed "genetic rescue". An example is the Norwegian Lundehund, a small spitz dog with inbreeding-related health problems that is being crossed with three Nordic breeds, including the Norwegian Buhund. Conservation breeding decisions for the (typically) small number of outcrossed individuals are vital for managing the rescue process, and we genotyped the Lundehund (n = 12), the Buhund (n = 12), their crosses (F1, n = 7) and first-generation backcrosses to the Lundehund (F2, n = 12) with >170,000 single nucleotide polymorphism loci to compare their levels of genetic diversity. We predicted that genome-wide diversity in F2 dogs would be higher than in the Lundehund but lower than in the F1 and the Buhund, and the heterozygosity values showed the expected patterns. We also found that runs of homozygosity, extended chromosomal regions of homozygous genotypes inherited from a common ancestor, were reduced in F2 individuals compared with Lundehund individuals. Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of outcrossing but indicate that some of the acquired genetic diversity is lost following immediate backcrossing. Additional breeding among F2 crosses could therefore merit from further consideration in genetic rescue management.

AB  - The perturbation of the global nitrogen (N) cycle due to the increase in N deposition over the last 150 years will likely have important effects on carbon (C) cycling, particularly via impacts on forest C sequestration. To investigate this effect, and the relative importance of different mechanisms involved, we used the Generic Decomposition And Yield (G'DAY) forest C-N cycling model, introducing some new assumptions which focus on N deposition. Specifically, we (i) considered the effect of forest management, (ii) assumed that belowground C allocation was a function of net primary production, (iii) assumed that foliar litterfall and specific leaf area were functions of leaf N concentration, (iv) assumed that forest canopies can directly take up N, and (v) modified the model such that leaching occurred only for nitrate N. We applied the model with and without each of these modifications to estimate forest C sequestration for different N deposition levels. Our analysis showed that N deposition can have a large effect on forest C storage at ecosystem level. Assumptions (i), (ii) and (iv) were the most important, each giving rise to a markedly higher level of forest C sequestration than in their absence. On the contrary assumptions (iii) and (v) had a negligible effect on simulated net ecosystem production (NEP). With all five model modifications in place, we estimated that the C storage capacity of a generic European forest ecosystem was at most 121 kg C kg-1 N deposited. This estimate is four times higher than that obtained with the original version of G'DAY (27.8 kg C kg-1 N). Thus, depending on model assumptions, the G'DAY ecosystem model can reproduce the range of dC : dN(dep) values found in the literature. We conclude that effects of historic N deposition must be taken into account when estimating the C storage capacity of a forest ecosystem.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems have received international interest for their possible role in climate change mitigation, highlighting the importance of being able to assess and predict how changes in habitat distributions and their associated communities may impact the greenhouse gas sink potential of these vegetated seascapes. Importantly, the range and diversity of macrophytes within the vegetated seascape have different capacities to store C within their biomass and potentially sequester C depending on their functional trait characteristics. To bridge the present knowledge gaps in linking macrophyte traits to C storage in tissue, we (1) quantified biomass-bound C stocks within diverse macrophyte communities, separately for soft and hard bottom habitats and (2) explored the links between various traits of both vascular plants and macroalgae and their respective biomass-bound C stocks using structural equation modeling (SEM). We conducted a field survey where we sampled 6 soft bottom locations dominated by aquatic vascular plants and 6 hard bottom locations dominated by the brown algae Fucus vesiculosus in the Finnish archipelago. Macrophyte carbon stocks of hard bottom locations were an order of magnitude higher than those found in soft bottom locations. Biodiversity was associated with aquatic plant carbon stocks through mass ratio effects, highlighting that carbon stocks were positively influenced by the dominance of species with more acquisitive resource strategies, whereas age was the main driver of carbon in the mono-specific macroalgal communities. Overall, our results demonstrate that habitat type and dominating life history strategies influenced the size of the organism-bound carbon stocks. Moreover, we showed the importance of accounting for the diversity of different traits to determine the drivers underpinning carbon storage in heterogenous seascapes composed of macrophyte communities with high functional diversity.

AB  - The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is one of the most critical insect disturbance agents in Europe. In recent years, bark beetles have caused tremendous economic losses, and affected ecosystems over large spatial scales. In this study, we evaluated the influence of selected factors on the bark beetle outbreak in 2015, the year with the most severe drought to have been recorded in the last few decades. The main aim of this study was to develop a new approach of identifying and mapping individual trees infested by bark beetles, for more efficient bark beetle management. The study was conducted on an area occupying 62,000 ha, using air-borne laser scanning, multispectral imagery data, and digital forest maps.
   First, an individual dead tree detection method, based on remote sensing data, was developed, which allowed the quantification of the bark beetle outbreak at an individual tree level, with accurate information on the number and location of killed spruces. Then, topography, habitat, and single tree-based variables were used to examine their influence on tree mortality. Finally, a spatial hot-spot analysis of the outbreak, throughout the 62,000 ha of the Polish part of the Bialowieza Forest, was performed.
   For the first time, we mapped the status of the spruce bark beetle outbreak across the Bialowieza Forest, using the method developed in this study. 283,166 dead Norway spruce trees were detected in the study area, supporting the fact that the current bark beetle outbreak is the largest in this area since 1945. The number of dead spruces surrounding any given dead tree was the single most important predictor in all models, with a relative contribution of 35-79% depending on the neighbourhood analysed (radius from 0 to 2000 m). Crown closure and stand age, as well as the share of dead spruce and dominant tree species were found to be the most important predictors of the development of bark beetle infestation. The method developed in this study was evaluated and proved to be suitable for the monitoring and management of the ongoing insect outbreak.

AB  - In 2014, 129 farmed salmon escapees captured in an upstream-migration trap located in the river Etne, western Norway, were investigated for viral infections, age at escape, size, and genetic composition. The frequency of escapees positive for salmonid alphavirus (SAV), piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), and infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) was 12, 79, and < 1%, respectively. Fatty acid analysis demonstrated that the individuals had escaped from farms at different stages of the production cycle, although the majority had probably escaped from farms in the same year as their capture in the river. Genetic analyses demonstrated that the escapees originated from multiple farms. This was also supported by the distribution of fish size and timing of entry into the river. A combination of genetic, fatty acid and viral infection analyses showed that in the river Etne in 2014: (i) most of the fish entering the river were infected with one or more viruses, (ii) the majority of them had escaped in the same year that they entered the river, (ii) they originated from multiple farm sources, and (iv) two of the identified genetic groups likely originated from two recent and distinct escape events. This is the first study to integrate results from multiple analytical methods in order to reveal the ecological and genetic diversity of escaped farmed fish entering a river with native salmon population throughout an entire season.

However, less is known about the permanence and reversibility of these responses. To gain insight into whether multifunctionality can be sustained under intensive management, we developed a framework building on the concept of resilience: a system's ability to avoid displacement and to return or transform to a desired state. We applied it to test the ability of forest multifunctionality to persist during and recover from intensive management for timber production in a boreal forest. Using forest growth simulations and multiobjective optimization, we created alternative future paths where the forest was managed for maximal timber production, for forest multifunctionality, or first maximal timber production and then multifunctionality. We show that forest multifunctionality is substantially diminished under intensive forestry and recovers the slower, the longer intensive forestry has been continued. Intensive forestry thus not only reduces forest multifunctionality but hinders its recovery should management goals change, i.e., weakens its resilience. The results suggest a need to adjust ecosystem management according to long-term sustainability goals already today.

AB  - The release of long-stored carbon from thawed permafrost could fuel increased methanogenesis in northern lakes, but it remains unclear whether old carbon substrates released from permafrost are metabolized as rapidly by methanogenic microbial communities as recently produced organic carbon. Here, we apply methane (CH4) clumped isotope (Delta(18)) and C-14 measurements to test whether rates of methanogenesis are related to carbon substrate age. Results from culture experiments indicate that Delta(18) values are negatively correlated with CH4 production rate. Measurements of ebullition samples from thermokarst lakes in Alaska and glacial lakes in Sweden indicate strong negative correlations between CH4 Delta(18) and the fraction modern carbon. These correlations imply that CH4 derived from older carbon substrates is produced relatively slowly. Relative rates of methanogenesis, as inferred from Delta(18) values, are not positively correlated with CH4 flux estimates, highlighting the likely importance of environmental variables other than CH4 production rates in controlling ebullition fluxes.
   Plain Language Summary There is concern that carbon from thawed permafrost will be emitted to the atmosphere as methane (CH4). It is currently uncertain whether old organic carbon from thawed permafrost can be converted to CH4 as rapidly as organic carbon recently fixed by primary producers. We address this question by combining radiocarbon and clumped isotope measurements of CH4 from lakes in permafrost landscapes. Radiocarbon (C-14) measurements indicate the age of CH4 carbon sources. We present data from culture experiments that support the hypothesis that clumped isotope values are dependent on microbial CH4 production rate. In lake bubble samples, we observe a strong correlation between these two measurements, which implies that CH4 formed from older carbon is produced relatively slowly. We also find that higher rates of CH4 production, as inferred from clumped isotopes, are not linked to higher rates of CH4 emissions, implying that variables other than CH4 production rate strongly influence emission rates.

AB  - Whereas there is evidence that mixed-species approaches to production forestry in general can provide positive outcomes relative to monocultures, it is less clear to what extent multiple benefits can be derived from specific mixed-species alternatives. To provide such insights requires evaluations of an encompassing suite of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and forest management considerations provided by specific mixtures and monocultures within a region. Here, we conduct such an assessment in Sweden by contrasting even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies)-dominated stands, with mixed-species stands of spruce and birch (Betula pendula or B. pubescens), or spruce and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). By synthesizing the available evidence, we identify positive outcomes from mixtures including increased biodiversity, water quality, esthetic and recreational values, as well as reduced stand vulnerability to pest and pathogen damage. However, some uncertainties and risks were projected to increase, highlighting the importance of conducting comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluations when assessing the pros and cons of mixtures.

AB  - In order to gauge ongoing and future changes to disturbance regimes, it is necessary to establish a solid baseline of historic disturbance patterns against which to evaluate these changes. Further, understanding how forest structure and composition respond to variation in past disturbances may provide insight into future resilience to climate-driven alterations of disturbance regimes.
   We established 184 plots (mostly 1000 m2) in 14 primary mountain Norway spruce forests in the Western Carpathians. On each plot we surveyed live and dead trees and regeneration, and cored around 25 canopy trees. Disturbance history was reconstructed by examining individual tree growth trends. The study plots were further aggregated into five groups based on disturbance history (severity and timing) to evaluate and explain its influence on forest structure.
   These ecosystems are characterized by a mixed severity disturbance regime with high spatiotemporal variability in severity and frequency. However, periods of synchrony in disturbance activity were also found. Specifically, a peak of canopy disturbance was found for the mid-19th century across the region (about 60% of trees established), with the most important periods of disturbance in the 1820s and from the 1840s to the 1870s. Current stand size and age structure were strongly influenced by past disturbance activity. In contrast, past disturbances did not have a significant effect on current tree density, the amount of coarse woody debris, and regeneration. High mean densities of regeneration with height >50 cm (about 1400 individuals per ha) were observed.
   Extensive high severity disturbances have recently affected Central European forests, spurring a discussion about the causes and consequences. We found some evidence that forests in the Western Carpathians were predisposed to recent severe disturbance events as a result of synchronized past disturbance activity, which partly homogenized size and age structure and made recent stands more vulnerable to bark beetle outbreak. Our data suggest that these events are still part of the range of natural variability. The finding that regeneration density and volume of coarse woody debris were not influenced by past disturbance illustrates that vastly different past disturbance histories are not likely to change the future trajectories of these forests. These ecosystems currently have high ecological resilience to disturbance. In conclusion, we suggest that management should recognize disturbances as a natural part of ecosystem dynamics in the mountain forests of Central Europe, account for their stochastic occurrence in management planning, and mimic their patterns to foster biodiversity in forest landscapes.

AB  - The rotation length is a key component of even-aged forest management systems. Using Fennoscandian forestry as a case, we review the socioecological implications of modifying rotation lengths relative to current practice by evaluating effects on a range of ecosystem services and on biodiversity conservation. The effects of shortening rotations on provisioning services are expected to be mostly negative to neutral (e.g. production of wood, bilberries, reindeer forage), while those of extending rotations would be more varied. Shortening rotations may help limit damage by some of today's major damaging agents (e.g. root rot, cambium-feeding insects), but may also increase other damage types (e.g. regeneration pests) and impede climate mitigation. Supporting (water, soil nutrients) and cultural (aesthetics, cultural heritage) ecosystem services would generally be affected negatively by shortened rotations and positively by extended rotations, as would most biodiversity indicators. Several effect modifiers, such as changes to thinning regimes, could alter these patterns.

AB  - 1 The arctic environment is highly heterogeneous in terms of plant distribution and productivity. If we are to make regional scale predictions of carbon exchange it is necessary to find robust relationships that can simplify this variability. One such potential relationship is that of leaf area to photosynthetic CO2 flux at the canopy scale.
   2 In this paper we assess the effectiveness of canopy leaf area in explaining variation in gross primary productivity (GPP): (i) across different vegetation types; (ii) at various stages of leaf development; and (iii) under enhanced nutrient availability. To do this we measure net CO2 flux light response curves with a 1 x 1 m chamber, and calculate GPP at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 600 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   3 At a subarctic site in Sweden, we report 10-fold variation in GPP among natural vegetation types with leaf area index (LAI) values of 0.05-2.31 m(2) m(-2). At a site of similar latitude in Alaska we document substantially elevated rates of GPP in fertilized vegetation.
   4 We can explain 80% of the observed variation in GPP in natural vegetation (including vegetation measured before deciduous leaf bud burst) by leaf area alone, when leaf area is predicted from measurements of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).
   5 In fertilized vegetation the relative increase in leaf area between control and fertilized treatments exceeds the relative increase in GPP. This suggests that higher leaf area causes increased self-shading, or that lower leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area causes a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis.
   6 The results of this study indicate that canopy leaf area is an excellent predictor of GPP in diverse low arctic tundra, across a wide range of plant functional types.

AB  - Farm Atlantic salmon escape and invade rivers throughout the North Atlantic annually which has generated growing concern about their. impacts on native salmon populations. A large-scale experiment was therefore undertaken in order to quantify the lifetime success and interactions of farm salmon invading a Norwegian river. Sexually mature farm and native salmon were genetically screened, radio tagged and released into the River Imsa where no other. salmon had been allowed to ascend. The farm fishes were competitively and reproductively inferior, achieving less than one-third the breeding success of the native fishes. Moreover, this inferiority was scs biased, being more pronounced in farm males than females, resulting in tho principal route of gene flow involving native males mating with Farm females. There were also indications of selection against farm genotypes during early survival but not thereafter. However, evidence of resource competition and competitive displacement existed as the productivity of the native population was depressed by more than 30%. Ultimately the lifetime reproductive success (adult to adult of the farm fishes was 16% that of the native salmon. Our results indicate that such annual invasions have the potential for impacting on population productivity, disrupting local adaptations and reducing the genetic diversity of wild salmon populations.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is an economically and culturally important species. Norway has more than 400 watercourses with Atlantic salmon and supports a large proportion of the world's wild Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon are structured into numerous genetically differentiated populations, and are therefore managed at the population level. Long-distance migrations between freshwater and ocean habitats expose Atlantic salmon to multiple threats, and a number of anthropogenic factors have contributed to the decline of Atlantic salmon during the last decades. Knowledge on the relative importance of the different anthropogenic factors is vital for prioritizing management measures. We developed a semi-quantitative 2D classification system to rank the different anthropogenic factors and used this to assess the major threats to Norwegian Atlantic salmon. Escaped farmed salmon and salmon lice from fish farms were identified as expanding population threats, with escaped farmed salmon being the largest current threat. These two factors affect populations to the extent that they may be critically endangered or lost, with a large likelihood of causing further reductions and losses in the future. The introduced parasite Gyrodactylus salaris, freshwater acidification, hydropower regulation and other habitat alterations were identified as stabilized population threats, which have contributed to populations becoming critically endangered or lost, but with a low likelihood of causing further loss. Other impacts were identified as less influential, either as stabilized or expanding factors that cause loss in terms of number of returning adults, but not to the extent that populations become threatened. Management based on population specific reference points (conservation limits) has reduced exploitation in Norway, and overexploitation was therefore no longer regarded an important impact factor. The classification system may be used as a template for ranking of anthropogenic impact factors in other countries and as a support for national and international conservation efforts.

AB  - Scientifically-based systematic conservation planning for reserve design requires knowledge of species richness patterns and how these are related to environmental gradients. In this study, we explore a large inventory of coastal breeding birds, in total 48 species, sampled in 4646 1 km(2) squares which covered a large archipelago in the Baltic Sea on the east coast of Sweden. We analysed how species richness (alpha diversity) and community composition (beta diversity) of two groups of coastal breeding birds (specialists, i.e. obligate coastal breeders; generalists, i.e. facultative coastal breeders) were affected by distance to open sea, land area, shoreline length and archipelago width. The total number of species per square increased with increasing shoreline length, but increasing land area counteracted this effect in specialists. The number of specialist bird species per square increased with decreasing distance to open sea, while the opposite was true for the generalists. Differences in community composition between squares were associated with differences in land area and distance to open sea, both when considering all species pooled and each group separately. Fourteen species were nationally red-listed, and showed similar relationships to the environmental gradients as did all species, specialists and generalists. We suggest that availability of suitable breeding habitats, and probably also proximity to feeding areas, explain much of the observed spatial distributions of coastal birds in this study. Our findings have important implications for systematic conservation planning of coastal breeding birds. In particular, we provide information on where coastal breeding birds occur and which environments they seem to prefer. Small land areas with long shorelines are highly valuable both in general and for red-listed species. Thus, such areas should be prioritized for protection against human disturbance and used by management in reserve selection.

AB  - The major part of the attractiveness of Nordic tourism relies on natural resources and features such as the landscape, the flora, the fauna and the four seasons. Lately, it has been predicted that climate change will alter these preconditions of nature-based tourism destinations, which may have severe consequences for the tourism industry. Nevertheless, tourism is also bound to many other societal changes that may influence the economics and the development of peripheral communities dependent on tourism and bring new challenges in maintaining their vitality. For assessing these challenges and potential adaptation measures a multidisciplinary and participatory approach was developed in the EU LIFE+ project VACCIA (Vulnerability Assessment of ecosystem services for Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation) Action 12: Tourism. The aim of this article is to evaluate this approach for assessing the local vulnerability and adaptation of tourism to the challenges of climate change in two tourism municipalities of Northern Finland.

AB  - This paper discusses vegetation types and diversity patterns in relation to environment and land-use at summer farms, a characteristic cultural landscape in the Norwegian mountains. Floristic data (189 taxa) were collected in 130 4-m(2) sample plots within 12 summer farms in Roldal, western Norway. The study was designed to sample as fully as possible the range of floristic, environmental, and land-use conditions. Vegetation types delimited by two-way indicator species analysis were consistent with results from earlier phytosociological studies. Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis show that rather than being distinct vegetation types, the major floristic variation is structured along a spatial gradient from summer farm to the surrounding heathland vegetation. Species richness (alpha diversity) was modelled against environmental variables by generalized linear modelling and compositional turnover (beta diversity) by canonical correspondence analysis. Most environmental factors made significant contributions, but the spatial distance-to-farm gradient was the best predictor of both species richness and turnover. While summer farms reduce mean species richness at the plot scale, the compositional heterogeneity of the upland landscapes is increased, thereby creating `ecological room' for additional vegetation types and species. Within an overall similarity across scales, soil variables (pH, base saturation, LOI, phosphate and nitrogen) differed considerably in their explanatory power for richness and turnover. A difference between `productivity limiting' factors and `environmental sieves' is proposed as an explanation. Species turnover with altitude is relatively low in grasslands as compared to heaths.

AB  - Fire disturbance is considered paramount for regeneration and biodiversity in the boreal forest with prescribed burning widely advocated in present day forest management. Palaeoecological knowledge is beneficial in understanding the role of fire as a driver of past vegetation dynamics. We use a sedimentary pollen and charcoal record to reconstruct 5000 years of fire and vegetation history from a small forest hollow (approximate area 12 m(2)) in the Vesijako Strict Nature Reserve, currently one of the few remaining old-growth forest stands in southern Finland. Results indicate three distinct periods in the environmental history (1) 5000-2000 cal. yrs. BP; semi-natural low frequency (430 year return period), low intensity fires in a diverse mixed stand with little evidence of anthropogenic disturbance and an expanding Picea abies (Norway spruce) population (2) 2000-750 cal. yrs. BP; anthropogenic-driven high frequency (180 year return period), high intensity stand-replacing fires in a low diversity stand with evidence of slash and burn cultivation and a decline of Picea population, (3) 750 cal. yrs. BP to present day; fire absence through a reduction in human-induced fire or active fire suppression and the expansion of the currently dominant Picea forest. The changing fire frequency has had a major influence on the forest composition during the last 5000 years. The loss of floristic diversity is associated with an increase in the human use of fire and without this human interference the previously high biodiversity in the stand may have remained up until the present day. If fire remains absent in Vesijako then it is likely that the Picea population will continue to dominate in the stand supporting a negative feedback mechanism that will result in lower frequency, higher intensity fires in the future.

AB  - There is an increasing awareness of ecosystem services and use of ecological engineering in today's search for more sustainable wastewater treatment systems, but there is still great uncertainty about how to compare and evaluate the ecological sustainability of different systems. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of resources in three different wastewater treatment systems: (i) conventional three-step treatment (WWTP), (ii) conventional mechanical and chemical treatment complemented with a constructed wetland (TP + CW), and (iii) treatment in a natural wetland (NW), and to investigate to what extent increased space, time, and dependence of ecosystem services could substitute for purchased input in wastewater treatment. In order to compare resources of different quality we used emergy analysis, assessing the amount of solar energy required, directly and indirectly, for a certain production. Emergy use due to purchased inputs and to local renewable inputs differed substantially between the three treatment system studies, with emergy ratios of purchased to local renewable inputs of 9:1, 141:1, and 3056:1 for NW, TP + CW, and WWTP, respectively. Total use of emergy per person equivalent (p.e.) and kg phosphorus was similar in all three systems, strengthening our hypothesis of unchanged total emergy use in systems of different purchased input and land use. However, in the present study, purchased input was not fully substituted, while the natural wetland, apart from requiring a large land area, also needed a lot of purchased resources to fulfil the strict rules for wastewater treatment prescribed by society.

AB  - 1. Population-level management is difficult to achieve if wildlife routinely crosses administrative boundaries, as is particularly frequent for migratory populations. However, the degree of mismatch between management units and scales at which ecological processes operate has rarely been quantified. Such insight is vital for delimiting functional population units of partially migratory species common in northern forest ecosystems.
   2. We combined an extensive dataset of 412 GPS-marked red deer (Cervus elaphus) across Norway with information on the size and borders of two administrative levels, the governmental level (municipality) and landowner level (local management units, LMUs), to determine the timing and scale of mismatch between animal space use and management units. We analysed how landscape characteristics affected the use of management units and the timing and likelihood of crossing borders between them, in an effort to delineate more appropriate units in various landscapes.
   3. Median municipality size could potentially cover 70% of female and 62% of male annual ranges, while only 12% and 4% of LMUs were expansive enough to accommodate migratory routes in females and males, respectively. Red deer migrate along elevational gradients and are more likely to find both suitable lowland winter habitat and higher summer habitat within management units with variable topography. Consistent with this, the likelihood of border crossing decreased with increasing diversity of elevations.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate a considerable mismatch between animal space use and management units. Far-ranging movements and frequent administrative border crossings during autumn migration coincides with the period of active management (hunting season). Our study also highlights that, due to extensive movements of males, coordination of management aims may provide a more realistic avenue than increasing sizes of local management units. A more general insight is that the degree of mismatch between range use and management units depends on the season and landscape type. This needs to be accounted for when delimitating functional population units of migratory populations.

AB  - QuestionsAre there differences in species composition and richness between islands that were reforested more than 70yr ago with the introduced Pinus mugo compared with islands supporting the native Pinus sylvestris? Do the results depend on autocorrelation in geographical space and species ordination space? Species richness is expected to increase as a function of the size of an island; are the responses to island size different between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands. Does the land-use history have an impact on the current species composition and richness pattern?
   LocationThe archipelago is in the oceanic section of the Atlantic bioclimatic zone, west Norway. This archipelago was part of the ancient and widespread treeless heathland found along the European west coast.
   MethodsData on vascular plants were compiled from the forested islands, and their differences in species composition were analysed by ordination. The hypotheses were tested by means of t-tests and generalized linear models, the spatial component was accounted for by means of Moran's I and spatial autoregression with the moving average approach. This was done both in geographical space and species ordination space.
   ResultsThere are more vascular plants on the islands with introduced P.mugo than on the islands with native P.sylvestris. The latter have rather homogenous undergrowth dominated by bryophytes. This may explain lower richness on islands with native forest and why island size is not correlated with species richness on these islands. In contrast, P.mugo is easily wind-felled in autumn storms, which keeps rocky microhabitats exposed to air and new forest habitats are created. Species that are associated with the previous land-use system (grazing) prevail on islands with introduced pine, and thus contribute to higher plant richness.
   ConclusionsThe difference in species richness and island species-area relationship (ISAR) between P.mugo and P.sylvestris islands may relate to the same underpinning causes. Species from the old land-use system have survived on P.mugo islands, but not in the late-successional forest with a more closed canopy that has developed on P.sylvestris islands. Thus habitat and species richness is higher and increases with area on P.mugo islands but not on P.sylvestris islands.

AB  - The establishment of monoculture plantations of non-native tree species is a common practice for supplementing native timber stocks. Since native wildlife species may lack co-evolved traits needed to successfully exploit nonnative tree species, non-native plantations are expected to provide inferior habitat for native biodiversity. However, some studies report that plantations may increase net biodiversity at the landscape scale by introducing novel habitats or supplementing existing natural forests. We used point counts to sample birds in 2016 and 2017 in mature Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations in western Massachusetts, as well as representative native forest types, to evaluate bird use of these plantations relative to native forest types. Our findings showed that overall species richness for spruce plantations was similar to that of native forest habitats, and that several native conifer-dependent species (red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta canadensis), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), blackburnian warbler (Setophaga fusca), and brown creeper (Certhia americana) were significantly more abundant in spruce plantations relative to native deciduous, hemlock, and mixed stands. Bird species reported to associate with eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), such as blue-headed vireo (Vireo solitarious) and blackthroated green warbler (Setophaga virens), were observed using spruce plantations at similar levels as eastern hemlock stands. These results demonstrate that Norway spruce plantations can provide suitable habitat for native species associated with conifers, which is significant given projected continued decline of eastern hemlock in response to the hemlock wooly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Although large-scale conversion of native forest to plantations would likely lead to a loss in biodiversity, land managers could be justified in allowing small-scale plantations to persist without suffering negative impacts to native biodiversity.

AB  - Coastal erosion is a major issue facing Europe that will only worsen under future climate change and the resulting sea level rise. One effect of erosion is the loss of ecosystem services, which are provided by coastal areas, such as provisioning, regulating, habitat, and cultural services. These services can be quantified in monetary terms. Here, we present comprehensive estimates of future decline in coastal ecosystem services due to the erosion of sandy coastlines. We used datasets derived from remote sensing products: a pan-European land cover/use dataset (Corine Land Cover) and new global probabilistic coastal erosion projections constrained by artificial and topographical barriers to erosion. The results include historical changes (2000-2018) and projections under two emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2050 and 2100 together with uncertainty bounds. We estimate that in 2018, the coastal zone (excluding open sea) included 579,700 km(2) of habitats generating 494 billion euros of services annually. The future sea-level rise could erode 1.0% [90% confidence interval 0.7-1.5%] of the 2018 area under RCP4.5, and 1.2% [0.7-2.2%] under RCP8.5. The decline in services would be even greater: 4.2% [3.0-6.1%] under RCP4.5, and 5.1% [3.3-8.5%] under RCP8.5. The highest absolute losses would be sustained by salt marshes, while relative losses would be highest in beaches, sands, and dunes. The most affected countries in relative economic terms would be Denmark, Albania, Greece, Estonia, and Finland, but countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, and France would be among those losing the largest share of their coastal ecosystem services. Regional analysis using NUTS 3 regions shows high diversity of the impacts, with many regions along the North Sea and eastern Mediterranean Sea that are heavily affected by coastal erosion-induced loss of ecosystem services. The study highlights the urgency of undertaking mitigation actions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we focus on documented and possible effects of fish stocking in terms of ecosystem services. The increasing use of fish stocking between 1970 and 2000 in the semiurban setting of Stockholm archipelago, Sweden, is used as case study. The objective is to analyze this management practice from an ecosystem perspective, accounting for both the ecological and social context of releasing fish. The results show that enhancements of four native species (Salmo S. trutta, Salmo salar, Stizostedion lucioperca, and Anguilla anguilla) have dominated over new introductions of one nonnative species. (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The major objective has been to increase fish catches for local resource users. Involved stakeholders include three management agencies, one hydropower company, and several local sport fishing associations. Documented effects focus on recapture and production rates. However, our analysis suggests that additional positive or negative effects on biodiversity, food web dynamics, mobile links, or ecological information may also result, with possible consequences for the long-term provision of food, game, and aesthetic values. We conclude that a more adaptive and cooperative management approach could benefit from a deeper analysis of where, when, and what species is released, by whom, which stakeholders that use the fish and those ecosystem services the fish generate, and of the role of formal and informal institutions for monitoring and evaluating the success of releasing fish.

AB  - The high seas provide a variety of ecosystem services that benefit society. There have, however, been few attempts to quantify the human welfare impacts of changes to the delivery of these benefits. We assessed the values of several key ecosystem service benefits derived from protecting ecosystems in the high seas of the Flemish Cap through choice experiments conducted in Canada, Norway, and Scotland. Rather than solely eliciting public willingness to pay, we also explored the determinants of variance in the estimates of willingness to pay. We aimed to determine how much respondents were willing to pay for high-seas ecosystems conservation, which factors influence individuals' willingness to pay, and whether individuals in Canada had a higher willingness to pay relative to those living in Norway and Scotland. This latter point captures distance-decay effects. On average, the public placed positive value on conserving high-seas ecosystems and on developing economic activities related to the exploitation and exploration of marine resources, despite a lack of awareness and familiarity with these environments. Distance-decay effects on willingness to pay were not clear. Scots had the highest willingness to pay and the Norwegians the lowest willingness to pay for all attributes, with the only exception being willingness to pay for a large increase in new jobs, in which case Canadians' willingness to pay was higher than Scots'. The public's willingness to pay was influenced by sociodemographic characteristics and their perceptions of high-seas ecosystems. Our results provide evidence of the impacts of high-seas governance on human welfare and that improved governance could increase the value people place on high-seas ecosystems and the services they produce.

AB  - Urban greenspaces provide ecosystem services like more natural ecosystems do. For instance, vegetation modifies soil properties, including pH and soil organic matter content, yet little is known about its effect on metals. We investigated whether the accumulation and mobility of heavy metals, nutrients and carbon is affected by plant functional types (evergreen or deciduous trees, lawns) in urban parks of varying ages in southern Finland. Plant types modified soil physico-chemical parameters differently, resulting in diverging accumulation and mobility of metals and other elements in park soils. However, the effects of plant functional type depended on park age: lawns in parks of ca. 50 y old had the highest contents of Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn, and in these, and older parks (>100 y old), contents of most metals were lowest under evergreen trees. The mobility of metals and other elements was influenced by the amount of water leached through the soils, highlighting the importance of vegetation on hydrology. Soils under evergreen trees in young parks and lawns in intermediately-aged parks were most permeable to water, and thus had high loads of Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, tot-P and tot-N. The loads/concentrations of elements in the leachates was not clearly reflected by their content/concentration in the soil, alluding to the storage capacity of these elements in urban park soils. Our results suggest that in urban systems with a high proportion of impermeable surfaces, park soil has the potential to store nutrients and metals and provide an important ecosystem service particularly in polluted cities.

AB  - We investigated the dendroclimatic response of a Pinus heldreichii metapopulation distributed over a wide elevation interval (from 882 to 2143 m a.s.l.), spanning from low mountain to upper subalpine vegetation belts in the southern Italian Apennines. The tested hypothesis is that wood growth along an elevational gradient is non-linearly related to air temperature. During three years of fieldwork (2012-2015) at 24 sites, we collected wood cores from a total of 214 pine trees with diameter at breast height from 19 to 180 cm (average 82.7 & PLUSMN; 32.9 cm). We used a combination of tree-ring and genetic methods to reveal factors involved in growth acclimation using a space-for-time approach. Scores from ca-nonical correspondence analysis were used to combine individual tree-ring series into four composite chronologies re-lated to air temperature along the elevation gradient. Overall, the June dendroclimatic response followed a bell-shaped thermal niche curve, increasing until a peak around 13-14 & DEG;C. A similarly bell-shaped response was found with previ-ous autumn air temperature, and both dendroclimatic signals interacted with stem size and growth rates, generating a divergent growth response between the top and the bottom of the elevation gradient. Increased tree growth in the upper subalpine belt was consistent with the consequences of increasing air temperature under no drought stress. A positive link was uncovered between pine growth at all elevations and April mean temperature, with trees growing at the lowest elevations showing the strongest growth response. No elevational genetic differences were found, hence long-lived tree species with small geographical ranges may reverse their climatic response between the lower and upper bioclimatic zones of their environmental niche. Our study revealed a high resistance and acclimation capa-bility of Mediterranean forest stands, and such low vulnerability to changing climatic conditions highlights the poten-tial to store carbon in these ecosystems for the coming decades.

AB  - Countries have pledged to different national and international environmental agreements, most prominently the climate change mitigation targets of the Paris Agreement. Accounting for carbon stocks and flows (fluxes) is essential for countries that have recently adopted the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - ecosystem accounting framework (UNSEEA) as a global statistical standard. In this paper, we analyze how spatial carbon fluxes can be used in support of the UNSEEA carbon accounts in five case countries with available in-situ data. Using global multi-date biomass map products and other remotely sensed data, we mapped the 2010-2018 carbon fluxes in Brazil, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Sweden and the USA using National Forest Inventory (NFI) and local biomass maps from airborne LiDAR as reference data. We identified areas that are unsupported by the reference data within environmental feature space (6-47% of vegetated country area); cross-validated an ensemble machine learning (RMSE=9-39 Mg C ha(-1) and R-2=0.16-0.71) used to map carbon fluxes with prediction intervals; and assessed spatially correlated residuals (<5 km) before aggregating carbon fluxes from 1-ha pixels to UNSEEA forest classes. The resulting carbon accounting tables revealed the net carbon sequestration in natural broadleaved forests. Both in plantations and in other woody vegetation ecosystems, emissions exceeded sequestration. Overall, our estimates align with FAO-Forest Resource Assessment and national studies with the largest deviations in Brazil and USA. These two countries used highly clustered reference data, where clustering caused uncertainty given the need to extrapolate to under-sampled areas. We finally provide recommendations to mitigate the effect of under-sampling and to better account for the uncertainties once carbon stocks and flows need to be aggregated in relatively smaller countries. These actions are timely given the global initiatives that aim to upscale UNSEEA carbon accounting.

AB  - Increasing pressure of sea lice, development of multi-resistance to chemotherapeutants, and alternative delousing strategies have been raising concerns about the environmental impacts of salmon farming. Ectoparasitic sea lice and its treatments represent a major bottleneck for the development of the Norwegian salmonid aquaculture. The environmental impacts of different treatments and their contribution to the salmon footprint remain unknown; these processes have been excluded from life cycle assessment (LCA) of farmed salmon. In this work, we apply LCA to quantify the impacts of three different value chains expressed per ton of cleaner fish farmed/fished, distributed, and used. The impacts of farmed lumpfish, farmed wrasse, and fished wrasse are then combined to calculate the footprint of the Norwegian biological lice treatment mix, expressed per ton of salmon produced. We found that wrasse fishing generates considerably lower impacts than farmed lumpfish and, a fortiori, farmed wrasse. The direct comparison of these value chains is compromised since LCA is unable to quantify ecosystem impacts and because cleaner fish delousing efficiencies remain unknown. Overall, the impacts of biological lice treatments have a low contribution to the salmon footprint, suggesting that using this treatment type could be a sound approach to treat salmon. However, such favorable results depend on three critical factors: (1) the efficiency of biological lice treatments needs to be confirmed and quantified; (2) ecosystem impacts should be accounted for; and (3) cleaner fish welfare issues must be addressed.

AB  - In the article, we examine the ethnic groupness among Sami reindeer herders in Northwest Finnish Lapland. According to our results, reindeer herders recognize different groupnessess. Saminess is perceived as an ethnic and often local, family-related groupness. Moreover, Sami ethnicity is closely bound to the local herding life on the fells, in the cultural landscape of nomadism. Finnishness, on the other hand, involves meanings relating to the state and nation in particular. The interviews provide indications of the general rise of Sami culture, the long-term influence of Finnish culture and the state and the multidimensional nature of ethnicities in everyday life, that is, an overlapping and richness of ethnicities and identifications.

AB  - This paper synthesizes a five-year project (BIOWATER) that assessed the effects of a developing bioeconomy on Nordic freshwaters. We used a catchment perspective and combined several approaches: comparative analyses of long-term data sets from well-monitored catchments (agricultural, with forestry, and near pristine) across Fennoscandia, catchment biogeochemical modelling and ecosystem services assessment for integration. Various mitigation measures were also studied. Benchmark Shared Socio-economic Pathways were downscaled and articulated in dialogue with national stakeholder representatives leading to five Nordic Bioeconomy Pathways (NBPs) describing plausible but different trajectories of societal development towards 2050.These were then used for catchment modelling and ecosystem service assessment. Key findings from the work synthesized here are: (a) The monitoring results from 69 catchments demonstrate that agricultural lands exported an order of magnitude more nutrients than natural catchments (medians 44 vs 4 kg P km-2 y-1 and 1450 vs 139 kg N km-2 y-1) whilst forests were intermediate (7 kg P km-2 y-1 and 200 kg N km-2 y-1). (b) Our contrasting scenarios led to substantial differences in land use patterns, which affected river flow as well as nutrient loads in two of the four modelled catchments (Danish Odense angstrom and Norwegian Skuterud), but not in two others (Swedish catchment C6 and Finnish Simojoki). (c) Strongly contrasting scenarios (NBP1 maximizing resource circularity versus NBP5 maximizing short-term profit) were found to lead to similar monetary estimates of total societal benefits, though for different underlying reasons - a pattern similar across the six studied Nordic catchments. (d) The ecological status of small to medium sized rivers in agricultural landscapes benefitted greatly from an increase in riparian forest cover from 10 % to 60 %. Riparian buffer strips, constructed wetlands, rewetting of ditched peatlands, and similar nature-based solutions optimize natural biogeochemical processes and thus can help in mitigating negative impacts of intensified biomass removal on water quality.

AB  - Background: The Sami are the indigenous ethnic population of northern Scandinavia. Their health condition is poorly known, although the knowledge has improved over the last decade.
   Objectives: The aim was to review the current information on mortality, diseases, and risk factor exposure in the Swedish Sami population.
   Design: Health-related research on Sami cohorts published in scientific journals and anthologies was used to compare the health condition among the Sami and the majority non-Sami population. When relevant, data from the Sami populations in Swedish were compared with corresponding data from Norwegian and Finnish Sami populations.
   Results: Life expectancy and mortality patterns of the Sami are similar to those of the majority population. Small differences in incidences of cancer and cardiovascular diseases have been reported. The traditional Sami lifestyle seems to contain elements that reduce the risk to develop cancer and cardiovascular diseases, e. g. physical activity, diet rich in antioxidants and unsaturated fatty acids, and a strong cultural identity. Reindeer herding is an important cultural activity among the Sami and is associated with high risks for accidents. Pain in the lower back, neck, shoulders, elbows, and hands are frequent among both men and women in reindeer-herding families. For men, these symptoms are related to high exposure to terrain vehicles, particularly snowmobile, whereas for women psychosocial risk factors seem to more important, e. g. poor social support, high effort, low reward, and high economical responsibilities.
   Conclusions: Although the health condition of the Sami population appears to be rather similar to that of the general Swedish population, a number of specific health problems have been identified, especially among the reindeer-herding Sami. Most of these problems have their origin in marginalization and poor knowledge of the reindeer husbandry and the Sami culture in the majority population. It is suggested that the most sustainable measure to improve the health among the reindeer-herding Sami would be to improve the conditions of the reindeer husbandry and the Sami culture.

AB  - Acidification, as a form of soil degradation is a process that leads to permanent reduction in the quality of soil as the most important natural resource. The process of soil acidification, which in the first place implies a reduction in soil pH, can be caused by natural processes, but also considerably accelerated by the anthropogenic influence of excessive S and N emissions, uncontrolled deforestation, and intensive agricultural processes. Critical loads, i.e. the upper limit of harmful depositions (primarily of S and N) which will not cause damages to the ecosystem, were determined in Europe under the auspices of the Executive Committee of the CLRTAP in 1980. These values represent the basic indicators of ecosystem stability to the process of acidification. This paper defines the status of acidification for the period up to 2100 in relation to the long term critical and target loading of soil with S and N on the territory of Krupanj municipality by applying the VSD model. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) geostatistic module was used as the interpolation method. Land management, particularly in areas susceptible to acidification, needs to be focused on well-balanced agriculture and use of crops/seedlings to achieve the optimum land use and sustainable productivity for the projected 100-year period.

AB  - Information about the distribution, composition and status of the benthic environment and communities is important for the implementation of ecosystem-based management involving assessment of the effects of human activities. The MAREANO programme (Marine Areal Database for Norwegian Coasts and Sea Areas) conducts seabed mapping in order to fill knowledge gaps in relation to the implementation of management plans for the Norwegian EEZ. This paper describes the experience from the mapping strategy used by MAREANO. By using a variety of sampling gears the benthic environment and communities from all types of seabed are thoroughly documented. This involves the mapping of bottom topography, seabed substratum, pollutants, species composition, biomass and habitat forming vulnerable biota in a varied marine landscape. The area mapped from 2006 to 2013 is 131,000 km(2), spans depths ranging from 40 to 2700 m and covers a variety of topographic features including canyons, cold seeps and coral reefs. The information gained by this broad mapping approach has offered a unique insight into the diversity of benthic species and habitats. Through interpretation and classification of the information gained MAREANO scientists produce a database and detailed maps of seabed surficial geology, marine landscapes, biotopes and particularly sensitive and threatened habitats. Indicators of human impact, such as pollutants, trawl marks and marine litter are also presented on maps. Experience from 8 years of detailed mapping shows the necessity of thorough mapping for informed management decision-making.

AB  - Assessment of diversity (including both species richness and intraspecific variation) within a habitat may often be difficult when morphological criteria are used for identification and classification of isolates. Here we describe how combined fatty acid and sterol profiles (FAST-profiles) can be used for classification of fungal isolates into FAST-groups (i.e, operational chemotaxonomic units) according to a defined upper variation limit. Data analysis includes a two stage statistical approach. First, the isolates are grouped into taxonomic species using a discriminant model based on well identified 'model' isolates. These species groups together with one group that includes isolates which could not be identified with the discriminant model are further divided into operational chemotaxonomic units using a FAST-profile mismatch threshold. This method is demonstrated with Norway spruce needle endophytes.
   The model isolates were obtained from fallen spruce needles and identified by morphological criteria. Five species fruited on the needles: Lophodermium piceae, Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii, Lirula macrospora, Tiarosporella parca, and Thysanophora penicillioides. Additionally, mycelia of Sclerophoma pythiophila were frequently noted. These model isolates were separated by their FAST-profiles by applying a multivariate discriminant model into six distinct non-overlapping clusters corresponding to their species. This model was used for identification of 1740 isolates obtained from surface sterilized Norway spruce needles. As an example, isolates identified as T. parca were further divided into FAST-groups by applying a FAST-profile mismatch threshold value. This threshold value was the average within-species mismatch-value obtained for isolates identified by morphological criteria. This method allows a division of any batch of fungi cultivable in vitro into operational chemotaxonomic units according to a defined upper variation limit.

AB  - Monitoring of the coastal environment is vitally important as these areas are of economic value and at the same time highly exposed to anthropogenic influence, in addition to variation of environmental variables. In this paper we show how the combination of biooptical data from satellites, analysis of water samples, and a ship-mounted automatic flow-through sensor system (Ferrybox) can be used to detect and monitor phytoplankton blooms both spatially and temporally. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) data and turbidity from Ferrybox are combined with remotely sensed Chl a and total suspended matter from the MERIS instrument aboard the satellite ENVISAT (ENVIronmental SATellite) European Space Agency. Data from phytoplankton speciation and enumeration obtained by a national coastal observation network consisting of fish farms and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority are supplemented with data on phytoplankton pigments. All the data sets are then integrated in order to describe phytoplankton bloom dynamics in a Norwegian fjord over a growth season, with particular focus on Emiliania huxleyi. The approach represents a case example of how coastal environmental monitoring can be improved with existing instrument platforms. The objectives of the paper is to present the operative phytoplankton monitoring scheme in Norway, and to present an improved model of how such a scheme can be designed for a large part of the world's coastal areas.

AB  - The right choice of tree species to form forest cultures is of paramount importance to the preservation of the diversity, fertility and ecological stability of forest ecosystems. To that end, we examined the effect of a 40-year-long cultivation of Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco) on the floristic composition, characteristics of the forest floor, physical and chemical properties of the soil and the intensity of organic matter decomposition in a beech forest in western Serbia (Mt. Maljen). It was found that the cultivation of Douglas fir caused a reduction in biodiversity, changes in the chemical properties of the soil, that were most pronounced in the surface layers (0-10 cm), and a slowing down in the metabolism of the beech stand. The absence of many plant species characteristic to natural beech forests was observed in the Douglas fir plantation, these were reflected in the detected changes in the chemical properties of the soil, such as lower substitutional acidity (p<0.05), depletion of the adsorption of basis in the cation complex (p<0.001) and lower amounts of C, N, P (p<0.001) and K (p<0.01) in relation to the beech stand (control). No differences were found in soil moisture and active acidity levels. The higher value of the C/N ratio of the Douglas fir litter (p<0.001) provided proof for its lower decomposition rate compared to beech litter (p<0.05). Over time, all these changes could lead to further acidification and degradation of the soil and a reduction in this ecosystem's productivity.

AB  - The total area of boreal peatlands is about 3.5 million km(2) and they are estimated to contain 15-30% of the global soil carbon (C) storage. In Finland, about 60 000 km(2), or 60% of the original peatland area, has been drained, mainly for forestry improvement. We have studied C inventory changes on forestry-drained peatlands by re-sampling the peat stratum in 2009 at the precise locations of quantitative peat mass analyses conducted as part of peatland transect surveys during the 1980s. The old and new profiles were correlated mainly by their ignition residue stratigraphies; at each site we determined a reference level, identifiable in both profiles, and calculated the cumulative dry mass and C inventories above it. Comparison of a total of 37 locations revealed broad variation, from slight increase to marked decrease; on average the 2009 results indicate a loss of 7.4 (SE +/- 2.5) kg m(-2) dry peat mass when compared with the 1980s values. Expressed on an annual basis, the results indicate an average net loss of 150 g C m(-2) year(-1) from the soil of drained forestry peatlands in the central parts of Finland. The C balance appeared not to correlate with site fertility (fertility classes according to original vegetation type), nor with post-drainage timber growth.

AB  - We studied four south-facing and three north-facing boreal spruce forest stands (ca. 0.1 ha each) in SE Norway with the aim of testing the hypothesis that former logging has long-term effects on boreal forest-floor vegetation. The stand series comprised unlogged natural forests and forests that were selectively or clear cut 60-70 years prior to our study. Each stand was described with respect to history of forestry impact and tree-stand structure. Environmental, species number, species abundance and species composition (vegetation gradients obtained as ordination axes) variables obtained for 25 m x 1 m plots in each stand were tested for among-stand differences.
   Significant among-stand differences were found, partly related to former forest management and partly,due to among-stand differences in topography. Differences among stands related,to management were found for tree stand density, highest in managed stands, and for Dryopteris expansa agg. and Luzula pilosa abundances, peaking in formerly clear-cut stands. Species number (at plot or stand scales) was weakly related to former management. On southerly as well as northerly aspects, gradients in species composition were found that separated plots according to former management. Differences among stand conditioned on topography resulted in opposite patterns in the two series of stands because among southerly stands the clear cut was the least while among northerly the clear cut was the most strongly sloping. Low-inclination sites tended more strongly to be paludified and to have high Sphagnum cover, and to have low abundance of specific microsites with small mosses and hepatics. Vegetation gradients related to soil moisture and microtopography were found for both aspects.
   A strong gradient in species composition related to tree influence at within-stand scales was found, with variation in species number. Existence of such a gradient should provide for significant biotic effects (of short or long duration) of the environmental changes that take place during forest re-growth: (1) the immediate creation of small or large tree-layer gaps by tree felling; and (2) the closing of the tree layer during the regeneration phase. Most notably, the phases at which the tree layer reaches minimum and maximum cover, respectively, may act as 'bottlenecks' for survival of forest-floor species.
   We conclude that forestry impacts understorey vegetation by way of changes. in tree-layer structure and, to a lesser extent, substrate availability and the local environment, during forest regrowth. The extent and duration of this impact will depend on a complex set of factors. Our results are consistent with the view that if maintenance of species diversity is aimed at, environmental considerations should be built into forest management practices, preferably by mimicking the natural structural dynamics of the tree layer.

AB  - Cultivated organic soils can be a major source of GHG emissions in countries with high coverage of peat soils. Targeting mitigation measures based on mapping of cultivated organic soils would reduce these emissions and increase sustainability of agriculture. Different georeferenced datasets were combined to study the area trend and describe current agricultural use of organic soils. The area was also mapped regionally into classes based on intensity of cultivation and organic layer depth, and an example allocation of potential mitigation measures was made at the country scale. The area and proportion of cultivated organic soils have increased in Finland since 1990 but the clearance rate has decreased in recent years. More than half of the area retains a peat layer deeper than 0.6 m indicating long-lasting mitigation potential with measures capable of slowing peat decomposition. Sixty-five percent of the cultivated organic soil area was not considered a priority area for radical management changes, for various reasons, but there are 85,000ha of field with more realistic potential for GHG mitigation. The mapping method was found to be a practical tool for depicting the GHG mitigation potential of cultivated organic soils. Significant reductions in agricultural GHG emissions can be expected with implementation of the suggested mitigation measures.

AB  - The oak-dominated woodlands and forests of northern Europe have experienced dramatic declines due to agriculture, urbanization, and conifer-dominated production forestry. These losses have had a substantial negative impact on biodiversity due to the large number of forest species which depend on oak and the environments oak-dominated forests provide. Production oak stands may serve as a means of supplementing or complementing the habitat provided by the limited remaining natural oak remnants in this region. Here we evaluate the extent to which oak plantations in temperate southern Sweden provide habitat and resources for bird communities, by surveying and contrasting the bird species composition and diversity found in mature and young production oak stands (5 and 8 replicates respectively) and protected oak-dominated remnant forests (5 replicates). The mature production stands possessed a bird community partially overlapping in bird species composition, and comparable in species richness (34 species) to that found within protected oak forests (39 species). Furthermore, the production oak forests surveyed hosted threatened or near threatened bird species, including black woodpecker (Dryocopus martius), goldcrest (Regulus regulus), starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella). Though production oak forests cannot replace the habitat provided by protected oak forests, these stands do appear to provide conditions consistent with the habitat and resource requirements of a diverse cross-section of bird species in this region, including species of substantial conservation concern. Production oak forests thus have the capacity to make a positive contribution to biodiversity conservation, as well as providing a diverse range of goods and services to society.

AB  - Across large spatial scales, species richness in many taxa is mainly determined by climatic variables. However, some of the mechanisms behind large-scale patterns of species richness and abundance are expected to act on the community level, and on a smaller scale than the resolution of the data commonly used for deriving these patterns. We studied the distribution of sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) across Europe using both standardised samples from local habitats and large-scale inventories. In the first approach, we analysed species and individual numbers from standardised pitfall traps from 17 locations distributed from northern Sweden to Spain and Greece. We also calculated Simpson indices to correct for different activity densities. Additionally, we analysed whether diversity of sheetweb spiders is sensitive to habitat type. In the second approach, we investigated the known sheetweb spider species richness of European countries and large islands. In both datasets, species richness of sheetweb spiders reached a maximum at about 55 degrees N and declined towards the Mediterranean and the Arctic. In addition, species richness decreased from western (maritime) to eastern (continental) regions. Also Simpson diversity showed a hump-shaped relation to latitude, and was the only variable influenced by habitat type. In contrast to species richness and diversity, activity density increased monotonously with latitude. Towards the north, sheetweb spiders are likely limited by energy availability, towards the south, water limitation as well as bottom-up and top-down community interactions may reduce sheetweb spiders. Accordingly, their diversity does not follow the pattern of vertebrates, large insects and aquatic organisms, which depend more strongly on energy availability. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

AB  - The area of dedicated energy crops is expected to increase in Sweden. This will result in direct land use changes, which may affect the carbon stocks in soil and biomass, as well as yield levels and the use of inputs. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes of biomass are often not considered when calculating the climate impact in life cycle assessments (LCA) assuming that the CO2 released at combustion has recently been captured by the biomass in question. With the extended time lag between capture and release of CO2 inherent in many perennial bioenergy systems, the relation between carbon neutrality and climate neutrality may be questioned. In this paper, previously published methodologies and models are combined in a methodological framework that can assist LCA practitioners in interpreting the time-dependent climate impact of a bioenergy system. The treatment of carbon differs from conventional LCA practice in that no distinction is made between fossil and biogenic carbon. A time-dependent indicator is used to enable a representation of the climate impact that is not dependent on the choice of a specific characterization time horizon or time of evaluation and that does not use characterization factors, such as global warming potential and global temperature potential. The indicator used to aid in the interpretation phase of this paper is global mean surface temperature change (T-s(n)). A theoretical system producing willow for district heating was used to study land use change effects depending on previous land use and variations in the standing biomass carbon stocks. When replacing annual crops with willow this system presented a cooling contribution to T-s(n). However, the first years after establishing the willow plantation it presented a warming contribution to T-s(n). This behavior was due mainly to soil organic carbon (SOC) variation. A rapid initial increase in standing biomass counteracted the initial SOC loss.

AB  - Mapping of ecosystem services (ESs) provide valuable information on the geographical variation of ESs and their relation to overall diversity. Although the relationship between biodiversity and ESs has been intensively explored, little is known how geodiversity (i.e., variety of geological, geomorphological and soil features) is associated with different ESs. We studied 1) the spatial variation of geodiversity and biodiversity in relation to six ESs (i.e., forest carbon budget, potential supply of groundwater, milk and meat production, crop production, amount of free-time residences and nationally valuable landscapes) using variation partitioning (VP), and 2) the spatial overlap between geodiversity and biodiversity and ESs using generalized additive models (GAM) in 1006 intensively surveyed grid cells of 100 km(2) located across Finland. In the VP, biodiversity independently explained more of the variation than geodiversity for majority of the ESs. However, shared explanation ability of biodiversity and geodiversity was considerable for majority of ESs (forest carbon budget: 41.3%, crop production: 15.0%, free-time residences: 15.2% and valuable landscapes: 7.3%), often exceeding that of both independent contributions. GAMs indicated that increase in both biodiversity and geodiversity enhances forest carbon budget (D-2 = 66.8% and 12.4%, respectively), potential production of groundwater (8.3% and 0.1%), crop production (35.7% and 8.9%), free-time residences (40.0% and 7.9%) and valuable landscapes (11.6% and 6.9%). However, the positive relationship between diversity and ESs levelled off for many of the ESs. Our findings suggest that geodiversity is an important complementing factor in explaining spatial variation of the ESs in high-latitude regions. We also found dominantly synergic effects between abiotic diversity and ESs. Thus, our study results highlight the need to more deeply incorporate abiotic diversity into ESs research. Environmental conservation and management would benefit from the more comprehensive integration of geodiversity to ESs research along with the changing environmental conditions of future decades.

AB  - A study of pelagic and littoral species richness among microcrustaceans in 2,466 Norwegian lakes recorded 120 crustacean species: 77 cladocerans, 31 cyclopoids, and 12 calanoids, respectively. Very few species were strictly pelagic, and the pelagic crustacean zooplankton species were by far outnumbered by their littoral counterparts. More than two-thirds of the total crustacean species numbers in lakes were accounted for by species with a littoral preference. A considerable number of species occurred with low frequency, and the median total number of crustacean species in the lakes was only 14. A majority of littoral species also occurred commonly in pelagic samples, and vice versa. Some species are truly both littoral and pelagic, and nearly all species occurring in pelagic samples were also common in littoral samples. A high proportion of the common littoral species was only recorded occasionally in pelagic samples, and should thus be considered strictly littoral. There was no significant correlation between lake area and species richness for pelagic or littoral species. Our findings demonstrate the importance of including littoral species when assessing microcrustacean diversity in lakes, and we question the practice of considering species as either pelagic or littoral, because a majority of the recorded species was common in both habitats. It calls for a further discussion of the term "planktonic", since most of the species are at least partly "semiplanktonic."

AB  - This paper presents water erosion data of three stationary series of field experiments (each analysing 10 land plots) on various steepness slopes with different soil texture of the hilly topography of Western Lithuania (Zemaiciai Upland). Six different erosion-preventive crop rotations (four field crop rotations and two perennial grasses for sward formation) were investigated. It was demonstrated that extent of water erosion depends on erosion-preventative capabilities of different crop rotations, slope gradient, soil texture and the amount of precipitations. According to the results of long-term experiments, the mean annual erosion rate under the grass-grain rotation decreased by 95.0% compared with crop rotation with black fallow. The annual soil loss (SL) due to water erosion in the crop rotation with bare fallow was estimated to be between 0.01 and 18.56 t ha(-1)yr(-1). Usage of long-term grass sward completely prevented soil erosion. Perennial grasses and grass-grain crop rotations also prevented soil erosion on slopes during rainstorm (41-65 mm of precipitation during the day). However, even grain-grass rotations could not completely prevent the water erosion on the 9 degrees-11 degrees slopes with light textured soils. SL rate in 5-year rotation was 1.64 and 1.41 t ha(-1)yr(-1), respectively. Soil water erosion and nutrient losses are effectively inhibited by long-lived perennial grasses. Covering slopes with erosion-preventive sward forming perennial grasses in many cases prevented available potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) loss from inside the soil, however, the K and P losses resulting from runoff were 0.005-1.0 and 0.001-0.071 kg ha(-1), respectively.

AB  - In this study, a process-based model (RCG-C) was developed, parameterized and calibrated for studying the annual and seasonal dynamics of the ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a cutaway peatland (Linnansuo, eastern Finland) cultivated with a perennial bioenergy crop (Phalaris arundinaceae, L., RCG). Based on a number of prior studies and an environmentally controlled experiment, RCG-C emphasized several key processes beyond the generality of previous diplotelmic models for pristine peatlands. These processes included the effects of management (e.g., drainage, peat extraction, tilling, harvesting and fertilization) on the soil hydrology and the cycling of carbon and nitrogen, the influence of climatic factors on photosynthesis and the phenological cycle and phenological and soil-moisture controls on biomass production and canopy development. The model was validated based on continuous measurements of meteorological parameters, energy and CO2 fluxes (eddy covariance system) performed at the site from 2005 to 2010, including variation associated with both wet and dry years. The results showed that the model captured the seasonal and annual trends of the latent heat flux and NEE during the six-year period. Moreover, the simulated values for the total C sink capacity, accumulation of rhizome biomass and peat formation from RCG obtained during the six-year period also agreed well with the field measurements. Based on the FINADAPT climate scenarios, a sensitivity analysis of the model showed that the potential increases in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Ca) and air temperature (Ta) could be the main forces driving the changes in NEE. The model simulation suggested that the effects of Ta tend to offset those of Ca and lead to a decrease in the total C sink capacity of the site during the main rotation period (4-15th year of cultivation). This decrease tends to become more intensive toward the end of the 21st century. During the period from 2060 to 2099, the total CO2 sink capacity could decrease by 79% during the main rotation period at the Linnansuo site. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. One of the main reasons why insect pollinators are declining is a lack of floral resources. In agricultural landscapes, remaining seminatural grasslands play a key role for providing such resources. However, droughts pose an increasing threat to the abundance and continuity of flowers. Soil amendments are a novel management tool for Swedish grasslands aiming to increase carbon sequestration and soil water holding capacity. In this study, we examined how drought is affecting floral resources (i.e. floral units, nectar quantity and nectar continuity) in grasslands with different mowing regimes, and if soil amendments could mitigate potential negative drought effects.
   2. In summer 2019, we set up an experiment combining rain-out shelters ('drought'), soil amendments ('compost') and different mowing regimes ('mown' vs. 'abandoned') in four extensively managed Swedish grasslands (48 plots, size 2 m(2)). Between May and August 2021, we counted the floral units nine times in each plot. We derived values for the nectar sugar production per floral unit from an existing database.
   3. We observed a decrease in floral units under drought in the mown, but not in the abandoned plots. Nectar quantity and continuity over the season were not significantly affected by drought across both mowing regimes-in the abandoned plots the nectar provision even extended slightly in duration (towards late summer). The compost treatment had positive effects on the floral units, nectar quantity and continuity (extending it towards early summer) in the mown, but not in the abandoned plots. The plant species in our study reacted differently to the treatments. Most of the nectar was provided by only few species (mainly Lathyrus pratensis, Vicia cracca and Anthriscus sylvestris).
   4. The results are species specific, thus other plant communities might respond differently. However, our experiment shows that nectar provision (based on database values) in grasslands with a native plant community and natural soil conditions remains relatively stable under drought. We also found that soil amendments increase floral resources in managed grasslands.

AB  - Wind throw is a common disturbance in forest ecosystems. Because many forests are intensively used our knowledge on forest dynamics after such disturbances is limited. In the Bavarian Forest National Park/Germany after the wind throw event in summer 1983, we started our long-term observation in nearly natural Norway spruce forests within 5-year intervals up to 2010. A part of the affected stands was cleared, while another part was left untouched for natural development. Here, we focused on the tree species regeneration, using an individual-based approach. We expected that tree species regeneration in both management types would follow different succession pathways. Indeed, we found different regeneration characteristics, depending on whether the area had been cleared or left unmanaged. For example, for the target species Norway spruce, a chronic regeneration during the first two decades with low numbers, but a high survival rate of individuals, and for the pioneer species birch, pulse regeneration with high numbers of individuals only at the beginning and high individual loss during the following years occurred. Unmanaged and cleared wind throw areas, respectively, offer different quantities of micro-sites: the pit and mound structure as mineral soil disturbance was limited to less than 1/4 in the untouched area, whereas there was mineral soil disturbance more or less everywhere on the cleared parts. Type and intensity of disturbance allow a wide range of succession pathways after wind throw, based on the fundamental processes of germination and competition. Therefore, for protection area management as well as for forest management, the human activity immediately after the event is crucial. Because each management impact will change the succession pathway fundamentally any impact has to be omitted in protection areas with the main goal of natural vegetation succession. Also in managed forests abdication of any impact on small areas may improve the natural structures and biodiversity of forests.

AB  - Climate change has been unprecedented in the last half-century. Tree growth dynamics and responses to climate warming at different elevations vary by study area due to regional diversity in site-specific climatic conditions in the central Hengduan Mountains. A. georgei is the dominant species in high-elevation montane forests in the central Hengduan Mountains. To study the response of A. georgei radial growth to climate and identify tree growth trends at different elevations, tree-ring width chronologies at four elevations across the subalpine A. georgei forest belt were built and growth-climate relationships were analyzed. The primary findings of this study were as follows: (1) radial growth rates of A. georgei decreased with elevation; (2) warming alleviated the limitation of low temperatures and abundant precipitation on tree radial growth at the highest sampling site; and (3) unlike at other elevations, the trend of trees basal area increment (BAI) at the lowest sampling site showed a significant decline over the past 20 years. This suggests the presence of an elevational inflection point, likely between 3800 m and 4000 m, where tree growth trends diverge. These results confirmed that A. georgei at higher elevation in the central Hengduan Mountains currently benefits from higher temperatures. However, the effects of drought on A. georgei at lower elevations would cause radial growth to decrease with climate warming. Therefore, it is critical to establish effective management strategies based on how A. georgei responds to climate change at various elevations.

AB  - Background: The quantitative impact of forest management on forests' wood resource was evaluated for Picea and Fagus mixed forests. The effects on the productivity of tendering operations, thinnings and rotation length have seldom been directly quantified on landscape scale.
   Methods: Two sites of similar fertility but subject to contrasted forest management were studied with detailed inventories: one in Germany, the other in Romania, and compared with the respective national forest inventories. In Romania, regulations impose very long rotations, low thinnings and a period of no-cut before harvest. In contrast, tending and thinnings are frequent and intense in Germany. Harvests start much earlier and must avoid clear cutting but maintain a permanent forest cover with natural regeneration. While Germany has an average annual wood increment representative for Central Europe, Romania represents the average for Eastern Europe.
   Results: The lack of tending and thinning in the Romanian site resulted in twice as many trees per hectare as in the German site for the same age. The productivity in Romanian production forests was 20 % lower than in Germany despite a similar fertility. The results were supported by the data from the national forest inventory of each country, which confirmed that the same differential exists at country scale. Furthermore, provided the difference in rotation length, two crops are harvested in Germany when only one is harvested in Romania. The losses of production due to a lower level of management in Romania where estimated to reach 12.8 million m(3). y(-1) in regular mountain production forests, and to 15 million m(3). y(-1) if managed protection forest is included.
   Conclusions: The productivity of Picea and Fagus mountain forests in Romania is severely depressed by the lack of tending and thinning, by overly long rotations and the existence of a 25-years no-cut period prior to harvest. The average standing volume in Germany was 50 % lower than in Romania, but the higher harvesting rate resulted in more than doubling wood production. Considering the mitigation effects of climate change by forests, it emerges that the increase in standing volume of forests in Romania is smaller than the additional harvest in Germany which serves fossil fuel substitution.

AB  - This study addresses social-ecological dynamics in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm County, Sweden, with special focus on the National Urban Park (NUP). It is part of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and has the following specific objectives: (1) to provide scientific information on biodiversity patterns, ecosystem dynamics, and ecosystem services generated; (2) to map interplay between actors and institutions involved in management of ecosystem services; and (3) to identify strategies for strengthening social-ecological resilience. The green areas in Stockholm County deliver numerous ecosystem services, for example, air filtration, regulation of microclimate, noise reduction, surface water drainage, recreational and cultural values, nutrient retention, and pollination and seed dispersal. Recreation is among the most important services and NUP, for example, has more than 15 million visitors per year. More than 65 organizations representing 175,000 members are involved in management of ecosystem services. However, because of population increase and urban growth during the last three decades, the region displays a quite dramatic loss of green areas and biodiversity. An important future focus is how management may reduce increasing isolation of urban green areas and enhance connectivity. Comanagement should be considered where locally managed green space may function as buffer zones and for management of weak links that connect larger green areas; for example, there are three such areas around NUP identified. Preliminary results indicate that areas of informal management represent centers on which to base adaptive comanagement, with the potential to strengthen biodiversity management and resilience in the landscape.

AB  - On-going climatic changes and land-use changes may impact water storage dynamics within wetlandscapes (defined as the entire hydrological catchments of interconnected wetland systems). These dynamics are closely linked to many wetland ecosystem services including flood buffering, nutrient retention and biodiversity support. Here, we investigate if and how current water storage dynamics can differ between wetlands within the same wetlandscape. Based on continuous monitoring of water levels in multiple wetlands throughout a growing season (spring, summer, autumn) in Vattholma, Sweden, we show that there are two distinct storage behaviours depending on the position of the wetland within the landscape. Headwater wetland regions were active in temporary storage of surplus water from regular summer rains while water levels of downstream wetlands dropped to seasonal low values without responding to individual summer precipitation events. Thereby, the downstream wetlands maintained capacity to buffer extreme floods. We also found that headwater wetlands were associated with complex and patchy inundation, which causes habitat conditions to vary over short time scales both within and among these wetlands, in contrast to the prolonged low-water state of the downstream wetlands. These differences between headwater-downstream wetlands imply that the functionality of an entire wetlandscape cannot be assessed by simple extrapolation of data from monitoring stations that typically are located downstream of headwater regions. Increased understanding of these differences can support wetland management practices that target location-specific nature-based solutions and ecosystem services.

AB  - Despite rapid advances in development of the ecosystem services (ES) concept, challenges remain for its use in decision making. Cultural ES (CES) have proven particularly difficult to pin down and resultant "shades of grey" impede their consideration by decision-makers. This study undertakes a literature review of CES to highlight the shades of grey, briefly illustrates findings by reference to the Swedish mountain landscape, then addresses potential implications for practical decision making. The concept of CES is complex and difficult to operationalize. The root of confusion appears to be a lack of rigour in identifying CES, hindering identification of proper methods for determining: the ecosystem elements that underpin CES; the beneficiaries of CES and how they value benefits delivered; and how CES may vary in space and time. We conclude by proposing a framework of questions, which we relate to the ES cascade model, that is intended to help researchers and decision-makers to reflect when considering CES. Answers to the questions should enable decision-makers to prioritise policy development or implementation in relation to the differing needs of potentially competing beneficiaries and what needs to be done or not done to the ecosystem, where, when and by whom.

AB  - There is a fundamental trade-off between leaf traits associated with either resource acquisition or resource conservation. This gradient of trait variation, called the economics spectrum, also applies to fine roots, but whether it is consistent for coarse roots or at the plant community level remains untested. We measured a set of morphological and chemical root traits at a community level (functional parameters; FP) in 20 plant communities located along land-use intensity gradients and across three climatic zones (tropical, mediterranean and montane). We hypothesized (i) the existence of a root economics spectrum in plant communities consistent within root types (fine, < 2mm; coarse, 2-5mm), (ii) that variations in root FP occur with soil depths (top 20cm of soil and 100-150cm deep) and (iii) along land-use gradients. Root FP covaried, in line with the resource acquisition-conservation trade-off, from communities with root FP associated with resource acquisition (e.g. high specific root length, SRL; thin diameters and low root dry matter contents, RDMC) to root FP associated with resource conservation (e.g. low SRL, thick diameters and high RDMC). This pattern was consistent for both fine and coarse roots indicating a strong consistency of a trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation for plant roots. Roots had different suites of traits at different depths, suggesting a disparity in root function and exploitation capacities. Shallow, fine roots were thinner, richer in nitrogen and with lower lignin concentrations associated with greater exploitation capacities compared to deep, fine roots. Shallow, coarse roots were richer in nitrogen, carbon and soluble concentrations than deep, coarse roots. Fine root parameters of highly disturbed, herbaceous-dominated plant communities in poorer soils were associated with foraging strategies, that is greater SRL and lower RDMC and lignin concentration than those from less disturbed communities. Coarse roots, however, were less sensitive to the land-use gradient.Synthesis. This study demonstrates the existence of a general trade-off in root construction at a community level, which operates within all root types, suggesting that all plant tissues are controlled by the trade-off between resource acquisition and conservation.

AB  - Deadwood plays an important role in the forest ecosystems, providing nutrients and habitat for a wide range of organisms, preventing soil erosion, and improving carbon storage. Microorganisms are primary agents in wood decomposition. The aim of the present research is to describe the changes in diversity, structure and abundance of microbial communities over downy birch lying deadwood decomposition in a boreal forest under natural conditions. This study also included investigations on the potential involvement of deadwood in climate change.
   The decomposition of deadwood was visually assessed using a five-class system. The microbial community diversity and composition were assessed with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting. Real time PCR was used to evaluate the absolute and relative microbial abundance. The potential involvement of deadwood in climate change was assessed by in situ-measuring of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from downy birch lying deadwood and from soil.
   The results obtained indicate that deadwood represents a substrate whose physico-chemical and microbiological property change with time. Higher diversity of fungi, bacteria, and archaea were recorded in the decay class 5. Conversely, actinobacteria showed the lowest values of diversity in decay class 5. We observed a succession of dominant microbial taxa over the decomposition progress. Overall, the abundance of each microbial group increases with the advance of decomposition. Among the estimated physico-chemical properties, nitrogen content, that increased with decay, and pH were the most important candidate drivers of microbial community composition and abundance. CO2 emissions were recorded higher in the decay class 5 and in soil of plots with the highest amount of lying deadwood.
   Bacteria dominated the microbial community and may play a more important role in the late stages of wood decomposition conversely to fungi and actinobacteria that are assumed to be primary involved in early stages of wood colonization. Archaea are shown to be an integral and dynamic component of decaying wood biota. The presence of large amounts of deadwood may affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the event of an increase in temperatures that could reduce the carbon (C) sink capacity of the boreal forests.

AB  - Spruce Picea spp, trees in Kielder Forest produced a heavy cone crop in 1990/1991 but not in 1991/1992. Common crossbills Loxia curvirostra and siskins Carduelis spinus rely upon conifer seed for food, and consequently large numbers were present in the good cone year. The abundance of these two finches was one of the main reasons why songbird density was four times higher in 1991 than in 1992. The numbers and breeding productivity of two raptors that specialise in hunting songbirds were also monitored in both years, Sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus appeared to respond to this increased food supply. In 1991 they fed on crossbills and siskins, and increased their breeding numbers and productivity so that seven times more chicks were reared than in 1992. These results indicate that sparrowhawk numbers are likely to fluctuate far more in large spruce forests than in other habitats in Britain where food supply is more stable. To ensure that spectacular ''crossbill years'' occur in future it is important to maintain a diversity of coniferous species in forests, including appreciable areas of Norway spruce Picea abies, Merlins Falco columbarius did not switch to feeding on crossbills and siskins, and their breeding numbers and performance were similar between years, Moorland birds were their main food, although considerable numbers of woodland songbirds were also taken in early spring. These results suggest that forests provide merlins with some prey at a time of year when moorland birds are scarce. Thus, the planting of large conifer forests may not be detrimental to merlin populations, provided that extensive areas of moorland remain nearby.

AB  - Spruce populations in the north of the European part of Russia have formed with traits, the population-geographic variability of which has not been sufficiently studied. The research purpose is to study on the basis of biometric parameters the phenotypic structure and geographic differentiation of spruce populations located north of the 60th parallel, as well as their relative position to European and Siberian spruces. Spruce is characterized here by a significant population-geographical diversity. The average length of cones in populations is within 44-85 mm, the coefficient of narrowing of the upper part of seed scales (C-n) is 36.68, elongation coefficient (C-p) is 40.60 %, and their difference (C-n-C-p) is from -23 to +28 %. The coefficients of geographical variation are 15, 18, 12, and 61 %, respectively. By the value of the C-n-C-p index, 6 groups of populations out of 9 (I-IX) existing throughout the east of Europe and Siberia are distinguished, excluding the first three groups. There are intermediate phenotypes of individuals (f.emm., f.m., f.mms.) in groups IV, V and VI with the highest frequency (61, 72, 55 %), in groups VII, VIII and IX the highest frequency (71, 86, 98 %) is among Siberian spruce phenotypes (f.ms., f.mss., f.s.). The length of the cones varies significantly in the population groups: 70-80 mm on average in the first; 50-60 mm on average in the second. Population groups IV, V and VI represent an intermediate form of European and Siberian spruces and are distributed southwest of the conditional line between the rivers Pinega and Mezen to Syktyvkar. Groups VII, VIII and IX represent Siberian spruce and occupy the territory northeast of the specified line: the Arkhangelsk region, the territory of the Komi Republic, the Murmansk region and the northernmost part of Karelia. There are no populations representing European spruce in the region according to the studied characteristics. The results obtained can be used in the development of differentiated methods of forestry in the European North of Russia.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services (ESs) is a relatively new scientific methodology, offering a possible approach to the prevention of ecological problems caused by human action and to the resolution of conflicts arising from land-use questions. Since ESs were launched as a major conceptual tool in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA, 2005), interest in them has been increasing. Despite the scientific as well as economic and political enthusiasm for the ES approach, only few case studies have as yet been published. we studied the interface between ESs and landscape planning in Forest Lapland, in northern Finland. In the article, we present a methodology and various databases which can be used in applied research on ESs. We classify the ESs offered by various biotopes of the study area, and examine the effects of different land-use forms on the provision of ESs. On the basis of our results, we suggest possible uses of the European CORINE land cover database in case studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are becoming increasingly rare, and their vegetation may be affected by environmental changes and altered management. At Kungsangen Nature Reserve, a wet to mesic semi-natural meadow near Uppsala, Sweden, we analysed long-term changes in the vegetation using data from 1940, 1982, 1995 and 2016. We also analysed the spatial and temporal dynamics in the Fritillaria meleagris population based on countings of flowering individuals in 1938, 1981-1988 and 2016-2021. Between 1940 and 1982 the wet part of the meadow became wetter, which led to an increased cover of Carex acuta and pushed the main area of flowering of F. meleagris up towards the mesic part. Annual variation in the flowering propensity of F. meleagris (in May) was affected by temperature and precipitation in the phenological phases of growth and bud initiation (June in the previous year), shoot development (September in the previous year) and initiation of flowering (March-April). However, the response to weather was in opposite directions in the wet and mesic parts of the meadow, and the flowering population showed large year-to-year variation but no long-term trend. Variation in management (poorly documented) led to changes in different parts of the meadow, but the overall composition of the vegetation, species richness and diversity changed little after 1982. Species richness and species composition of the meadow vegetation, and the long-term stability of the F. meleagris population are maintained by the variation in wetness, highlighting the importance of spatial heterogeneity as an insurance against biodiversity loss in semi-natural grasslands and nature reserves generally.

AB  - Factors driving the species richness and distribution of bryophytes are poorly studied and not well understood, particularly in grasslands. We analysed the occurrence of bryophyte species and variation in species richness across 674 plots (0.5 m x 0.5 m) in alvar vegetation (grassland on limestone pavement with thin or no soil) on oland (Sweden) in relation to substrate characteristics and chemistry, inundation frequency, grazing pressure and geographical variables. We found 148 taxa, including 11 nationally red-listed ones. Species richness per plot was significantly associated with substrate type, positively associated with pH and grazing intensity, but negatively associated with soil depth. However, richness of species typical of, or restricted to, alvar habitats responded differently to richness of species more common in other habitats. Typical alvar species were favoured by high pH, shallow soil and low phosphate availability, while generalists preferred relatively low pH, higher phosphate availability and organic or mull soil types. Distance from the alvar margin had only weak effects. Concerning the effects on individual species and community composition, inundation frequency and pH were found to have the largest effects, although other factors (substrate type, soil depth, bare soil, bare stone, phosphate availability and grazing pressure) were more important for some individual species, stressing the importance of microsite variability and variability in management for regional species richness. From a conservation perspective, it is concluded that grazing is generally positive whilst factors increasing phosphate availability may disadvantage the typical alvar species, and proximity to the alvar margin is not a major problem.

AB  - We studied the matrilinear genetic structure of the Siberian tit Parus cinctus by sequencing 911 bp of the mitochondrial control region of 56 birds from Fennoscandia and 3 from Yakutia, central Siberia, representing subspecies P. c. lapponicus and P. c. cinctus, respectively. One major haplotype comprised 35.7% of all birds and was present in all Fennoscandian populations. Sequence variation of 5 museum specimens from Norway fitted with the pattern of the present-day birds. The nucleotide diversity was 0.00205 +/- 0.00025 in the Fennoscandian population and no population structuring was detected. The star-like phylogeny suggests a recent expansion of the population size in the evolutionary time scale. A modern decline of the population size from 200 000 pairs to 50 000 pairs in Finland has resulted from cutting and fragmentation of old-growth forests, but the effects of this could not yet be detected in the mtDNA pattern. However, the nucleotide diversity differed among populations being the highest at Kuusamo, close to the Russian border. Conceivably, the gene flow maintained by the substantial migration of Siberian tits is sufficient to prevent differentiation of local populations in Fennoscandia. Presumably the large conservation areas in NE Finland and on the Russian side of the border contribute to the high genetic variation observed in the Kuusamo population. Comparison of the mtDNA phylogeny of the Siberian tit with the phylogenies of the great tit, the blue tit and the willow tit showed that the Siberian tit and some other non-migratory species of the foliage gleaning guild share similar post glacial histories in the western palaearctic.

AB  - Predicting plant-pollinator interaction networks over space and time will improve our understanding of how environmental change is likely to impact the functioning of ecosystems. Here we propose a framework for producing spatially explicit predictions of the occurrence and number of pairwise plant-pollinator interactions and of the species richness, diversity and abundance of pollinators visiting flowers. We call the framework 'MetaComNet' because it aims to link metacommunity dynamics to the assembly of ecological networks. To illustrate the MetaComNet functionality, we used a dataset on bee-flower networks sampled at 16 sites in southeast Norway along with random forest models to predict bee-flower interactions. We included variables associated with climatic conditions (elevation) and habitat availability within a 250 m radius of each site. Regional commonness, site-specific distance to conspecifics, social guild and floral preference were included as bee traits. Each plant species was assigned a score reflecting its site-specific abundance, and four scores reflecting the bee species that the plant family is known to attract. We used leave-one-out cross-validations to assess the models' ability to predict pairwise plant-bee interactions across the landscape. The relationship between observed occurrence or absence of interactions and the predicted probability of interactions was nearly proportional (GLM(logistic regression slope) = 1.09), matching the data well (AUC = 0.88), and explained 30% of the variation. Predicted probability of interactions was also correlated with the number of observed pairwise interactions (r = 0.32). The sum of predicted probabilities of bee-flower interactions were positively correlated with observed species richness (r = 0.50), diversity (r = 0.48) and abundance (r = 0.42) of wild bees interacting with plant species within sites. Our findings show that the MetaComNet framework can be a useful approach for making spatially explicit predictions and mapping plant-pollinator interactions. Such predictions have the potential to identify areas where the pollination potential for wild plants is particularly high, and where conservation action should be directed to preserve this ecosystem function.

AB  - Hypothesis: The opportunity for inter-individual niche differences in contrasting resource environments can induce divergent natural selection in trophic morphology within single gene pools.
   Organisms: Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) caught in the littoral and pelagic habitats of two neighbouring sub-arctic lakes.
   Field sites: Two post-glacial lakes (Fjellfrosvatn and Lille Rostavatn, North Norway) of similar size and physical structures, but with different fish diversities (two and six species, respectively).
   Methods: Analysis and comparison of trophic niche (habitat and diet usage) and trophic morphology (body form and head structure) data from individual fish. Only immature charr 19-25 cm long were used to reduce the effects of allometric growth and secondary sex traits.
   Conclusions: The utilization of multiple resource types has facilitated incipient steps towards the evolution of polymorphism in one lake, but not in the other. In Fjellfrosvatn, individual specializations in benthivore and planktivore diet niches are correlated with inter-individual morphological differentiation. In contrast, the Arctic charr in Lille Rostavatn were restricted to zooplanktivory, and distinct morphological diversification was absent. We conclude that the two lakes have dissimilar opportunities for individual niche specialization and evolution of polymorphism.

AB  - Northern forested peatlands contain a large pool of terrestrial carbon (C). When drained for forestry, these peatlands may become sources of Cot remain C sinks, depending on site nutrient level, climate, and average water level depth. However, previous studies do not consider the impact of other silvicultural practices on the C dynamics in drained peatlands. Clearfellings cause disturbance in ecosystem C dynamics and might lead to losses of C to the atmosphere. The initial development of C dynamics following clearfelling in a drained peatland forest in Finland was investigated in a 4-year study which included monitoring of ground vegetation development and chamber based measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-ECO) and heterotrophic peat soil respiration (R-PEAT). NEE measurements showed that the site was mainly a net CO2 source (May-October mean efflux of 1990 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) to the atmosphere during the three measurement seasons after clearfelling. This was caused by decrease in photosynthesizing biomass and by high R-ECO (May-October mean efflux of 2540 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)). The recovery of ground vegetation biomass was rather fast. However, during the 3 years after clearfelling its capability to fix carbon could not compensate the high R-ECO, which was mainly caused by excessive amounts of easily decomposable fresh organic matter (dying tree roots, logging residue and dying ground vegetation). Clearfelling slightly decreased the decomposition rates of peat (R-PEAT) (May-October mean efflux of 1130 g CO2 m(-2) season(-1)) i.e., the oldest and largest C storage of the site, through two mechanisms: R-PEAT in deeper layers was restricted by higher water table level and in surface layers by excessive dryness, which lowered the temperature response of R-PEAT. We conclude that clearfelling strongly affects ecosystem C dynamics but does not affect the peat C storage. The appearance of new tree stand is needed before the ecosystem could act as a C sink again. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural wetlands are among the most threatened habitat types worldwide. They contain a high diversity of macroinvertebrates, including dragonflies and damselflies (Insecta: Odonata). In agricultural landscapes, new wetlands have been constructed to filter nutrients and solid matter from agricultural runoff. These types of wetlands may also benefit Odonata as new breeding habitats. However, it is not yet clear what environmental characteristics of constructed wetlands are important for Odonata. We studied 20 constructed agricultural wetlands in Central Finland and asked whether Odonata are able to use these wetlands as breeding habitats, and which environmental characteristics (aquatic vegetation, water area, shoreline length, bottom type diversity, water transparency, and pH) of the wetlands affect odonate abundance and species richness. The constructed wetlands hosted altogether 17 odonate species. Odonate abundance was positively associated with the number of aquatic vegetation growth forms of the wetland. Odonate species richness was associated positively with abundance, floating-leaved vegetation, and water transparency. Constructed agricultural wetlands support local diversity of common odonate species. Although protecting the remaining natural wetlands is of primary importance, constructed wetlands can add suitable wetland habitats in the agricultural landscape. From the perspective of Odonata, heterogenic aquatic vegetation and water quality are features worth promoting when constructing and managing agricultural wetlands.

AB  - In 1978 the World Wide Fund for Nature in Finland, and the Finnish Museum of Natural History, established a "Margaritiferaworking group". During the last 18 years Margaritifera populations have been checked in more than 60 rivers in different parts of Finland and in some rivers in Russian Karelia and Estonia. Altogether we have inventoried about 2000 km of underwater research transects. The best method of restoring the freshwater pearl mussel population is the protection of the breeding population. Altogether eleven Margaritifera rivers belong to the new Finnish Natura 2000-network. In 1995 the Ministry of Environment gave financial values to every protected animal and plant species in Finland (confiscation value). The confiscation value of a single M. margaritifera specimen in Finland is 3500 FIM (about pound 500). In the last decades the main threat to Margaritifera has been the drainage of peat lands and wet forest. One method to prevent the flow of silt into a mussel river has been to stop the ditching short of the river but dig pools for silt deposition. In restoring the old timber floating rivers to ones suitable for salmon, a so called soft technique, has been developed in Finland. By using this technique it has also been possible to prepare the river bed for freshwater pearl mussels. Glochidiosis can have a severe impact on trout in fish farms such that new installations must not be located in downstream proximity of important mussel populations. The farming of rainbow trout in natural rivers leads to the partial reduction of the native brown trout and consequently to the loss of Margaritifera glochidia as they cannot encyst on the gills of the rainbow trout. In some Margaritifera rivers where density of salmonid fish is low, the host fish population has been increased up to 0.5-1 specimens/m(2). The restocking of freshwater pearl mussel populations by transplantation has been the last choice of conservation measures in Finland. After 16 years a success rate of over 90% has been achieved, where mussels have been transferred to other parts of the same river, but only 50% or less in cases where mussels have been transferred from one river to another It has also been very important to encourage research on all aspects of the biology and geographical distribution of the freshwater pearl mussel, and to promote co-ordination of survey and research programmes at national and international levels.

AB  - The overall goal of this study was to evaluate the correlation of multiple abiotic and biotic factors with organic-horizon (O-horizon) carbon (C) content on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in central Maine, USA. O-horizon samples were collected and their associated depths were recorded from stands managed with a range of silvicultural and harvesting treatments (i.e., selection, shelterwood, and commercial clearcut) and an unmanaged control. The overall mean for O-horizon C content from all samples was 25.6 +/- 16.1 Mg ha(-1) (mean +/- SD). The samples were used to develop a pedotransfer function for predicting O-horizon C content from O-horizon depth (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 1.6 Mg ha(-1)) so that an average of O-horizon C content could be calculated for permanent sample plots on which abiotic and biotic factors were quantified. O-horizon depth measurements recorded along transects on permanent sample plots were used to calculate plot average O-horizon C content. There were no significant differences in average predicted O-horizon C content among selection, shelterwood, and commercial clearcut treatments. However, variation in predicted O-horizon C content between stands where the same treatment was applied was statistically significant and was likely due to the timing of harvests and abundance of dead wood buried within O horizons. Depth to redoximorphic features, cartographic depth to water table or saturated zone, drainage class, fine woody debris mass, downed woody debris volume, tree basal area, and the relative basal area of conifer species were not significant predictors of predicted O-horizon C content at the plot level. When the individual predicted values of O-horizon C content were modeled, within plot variation accounted for 83.8% of the variance. Bryophyte mass, which was predicted from bryophyte cover, only explained 1.2% of the variation in O-horizon C content at the microsite level. These results highlight the sizeable variability in O-horizon C content within and among these mixed-species stands with various forest management and natural disturbance histories.

AB  - The agricultural sector has a critical role in creating social and environmental value of natural resources in addition to its traditional role of creating economic value by supplying food to the ever-increasing world population. In fulfilling this dual role, the agricultural sector often faces competing pressures: to operate financially profitable businesses and to create, maintain, and benefit from ecosystem services (ES) in their operations. This paper analyses these pressures in an examination of drivers and barriers to the initiation of the business model innovation process for sustainability (BMIpfS) as perceived by ten agricultural business managers who operate farms in southern Sweden. The paper explores the interplay between managerial cognition and business decisions as revealed in semi-structured interviews. The new ES in focus connect to radical land-use change, paludiculture, as used in the rewetting of farmland intended to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that drained peat soil causes. The paper contributes to the literature by identifying drivers and barriers that moderates the initiation of the BMIpfS. Although the managers acknowledge the importance of long-term, sustainable social, and environmental value creation, they have grave doubts about the profitability of activities associated with the preservation of peat soils and connected ES. These managers would benefit from taking a more proactive, long-term approach to business model changes for sustainability and from acquiring more knowledge about market demand for sustainability-oriented ES. Successful facilitation and implementation of knowledge transfer and government subsidies that support ES could improve the turning of profits based on sustainable value creation.

AB  - This article contributes to the accelerating development of methods for sustainability assessment (SA) to support maritime spatial planning (MSP), by proposing an ecosystem services based framework for SA. MSP is generally seen as an important approach to promote a more sustainable use of sea space. However, so far all sustainability concerns are not equally well represented in planning practise; in particular, social sustainability aspects such as social justice and sociocultural values related to human-nature connectedness receive less attention. We first explored concepts and principles related to sustainability assessment and social sustainability in the scientific literature. Based on this, we analysed how far the present approaches to assessments in Baltic Sea EU Member States have been extended from environmental concerns to towards broader sustainability concerns so far. Using current best practise in two pioneering countries (UK and Sweden), we illustrated how social sustainability principles could match with applied social impact criteria, and further, how such criteria can inform an ecosystem services-based impact assessment framework. Based on existing frameworks, including the DPSIR (driving forces, pressures, state, impact, response) environmental assessment framework and the ecosystem service cascade, we propose a sustainability impact assessment framework for MSP (MSP-SA) integrating across sustainability dimensions and including assessment of distributional aspects of marine ecosystem service benefits. Finally, we discuss the applicability and further development of the framework in relation to present day sustainability assessment practise in MSP.

AB  - BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of thinning on stand growth, carbon (C) sequestration, and soil properties in Brutia pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) plantations. The study was conducted at two experimental sites -the Antalya-Kas and Isparta-Egirdir plantation areas- in Turkey between 1985 and 2015. Different thinning intensities -unthinned (control), moderate, and heavy- were replicated in four blocks. We determined the C in the living biomass, litter, soil, and some soil features for each experimental parcel.ResultsWe found no statistically significant difference in total stand volume between thinning-intensity treatments 30 years after thinning. This may be due to more light availability and less competition between trees and faster tree-diameter growth rate after thinning, thus explaining the volume in the treated parcels compared to the control over time. The C stocks in the biomass, litter, and soil were not significantly influenced by the thinning intensity. The nutrients in the litter and soil, and other soil properties, were not significantly different among thinning parcels. This implies that the C and other nutrients in the litter and soil are related to the stand volume and biomass, which were not changed by thinning in time.ConclusionThis finding is important in terms of showing that there was no change in total stand volume by thinning, which has been debated in the literature. This information is useful for forest managers when determining thinning strategy.

AB  - Growth of human populations and increased human activity, particularly in coastal areas, increase pressure on coastal ecosystems and the ecosystem services (ES) they provide. As a means toward being able to assess the impact of multiple stressors on ES, in the present study we propose an 8-step conceptual approach for assessing effects of chemical mixtures and other stressors on ES in coastal areas: step A, identify the relevant problems and policy aims; step B, identify temporal and spatial boundaries; step C, identify relevant ES; step D, identify relevant stressors (e.g., chemicals); step E, translate impacts into ES units; step F, assess cumulative risk in ES units; step G, rank stressors based on their contribution to adverse effects on ES; and step H, implement regulation and management as appropriate and necessary. Two illustrative case studies (Swedish coastal waters and a coastal lagoon in Costa Rica) are provided; one focuses on chemicals that affect human food supply and the other addresses pesticide runoff and trade-offs among ES. The 2 cases are used to highlight challenges of such risk assessments, including use of standardized versus ES-relevant test species, data completeness, and trade-offs among ES. Lessons learned from the 2 case studies are discussed in relation to environmental risk assessment and management of chemical mixtures. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:376-386. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB  - Eutrophication of the Baltic Sea has in Sweden led to the initiation of government schemes aiming to increase wetland areas in agricultural regions and thereby reduce nutrient transport to the sea. Landowners play a significant role as providers of this ecosystem service and are currently offered subsidies to cover their costs for constructing and maintaining wetlands. We undertook a grounded theory study, in which landowners were interviewed, aiming at identifying landowners' incentives for constructing wetlands on their land. The study showed that adequate subsidies, additional services that the wetland could provide to the landowner, local environmental benefits, sufficient knowledge, and peers' good experiences could encourage landowners to construct wetlands. Perceived hindrances were burdensome management, deficient knowledge, time-consuming application procedures and unclear effectiveness of nutrient reduction. The main reason for not creating a wetland, however, was that the land was classified as productive by the landowner, i.e., suitable for food production. Current schemes are directed toward landowners as individuals and based on subsidies to cover costs. We propose that landowners instead are approached as ecosystem service entrepreneurs and contracted after a tendering process based on nutrient reduction effects. This would lead to new definitions of production and may stimulate improved design and placement of wetlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive Surveys of biodiversity in protected and managed areas have not been conducted for a majority of taxonomic groups and ecosystem types, which makes it difficult to assess how large a portion of biodiversity is at least potentially under protection. The situation is the same in boreal regions, and only preliminary analyses of the biodiversity, patterns of less well-known organism groups, including many freshwater taxa, within the protected area network have been conducted. We studied patterns of species richness and community composition of algae, macrophytes (bryophytes and vascular plants), and macroinvertebrates of headwater streams draining protected areas and managed forests in a boreal drainage basin in Finland. We found no significant differences in the species richness and Community composition of these organism groups between the protected and managed streams. Gamma- and beta-diversity varied strongly among the protected and managed stream groups, yet this variation was contingent on the organism group and the beta-diversity measure used. In general, there was much species turnover within both protected and managed stream groups, masking any between-group differences. However, we found a number of redlisted and rare species in our surveys. Of these species, several macrophyte species occurred more frequently in the protected streams. By contrast, rare species of algae and macrophytes did not generally show such inclinations to the protected streams. We found no strong congruence in species richness or community dissimilarity between algae, macrophytes, and macroinvertebrates, suggesting that the main anthropogenic gradient in terms of forestry is not strong enough to modify stream environmental conditions and thereby shape biodiversity in the focal drainage basin. This finding also suggests that surveys of aquatic biodiversity across protected and managed landscapes should not rely too heavily on the surrogate taxon approach, but instead should consider patterns shown by multiple taxonomic groups that represent biologically and ecologically disparate organisms. Our results indeed suggest that the levels of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity show differing among-taxon responses to forest management and naturalness of headwater streams. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Based on 52 nesting attempts of Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus in the Sumava Mountains (South Bohemia, Czech Republic), in habitats comprised mainly of Norway spruce forests, we investigated the relationships between diet composition and fledgling productivity of this owl. We found that (i) owls feed mainly on Sorex shrews (39%), Microtus voles (19%), Apodemus mice (15%), bank voles Myodes glareolus (14%) and birds (6%), (ii) the percentage of Apodemus mice, as well as the percentage of Myodes glareolus, negatively correlated to the percentage of Sorex shrews and birds in the owls' diet, and (iii) the fledgling productivity of the owls positively correlated to the percentage of Apodemus mice in the diet. Finally, (iv) the percentage of Microtus voles, the second most common prey, exhibited no close relationships with other prey groups or fledgling productivity of the owls. These results suggest that Apodemus mice were an important prey in the diet of the Tengmalm's owl in our study area, and support the theory that, compared to their northern counterparts, nocturnal raptors in Central Europe may be less dependent on Microtus voles due to the increased diversity of available prey species.

AB  - [1] Peatlands represent an important component of the global carbon cycle, storing 23 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Peatland mining eliminates the carbon sink function of the peatland. In this paper we measure the total ecosystem respiration in a natural, 2 and 3 year (young) and 7 and 8 year (old) postcutover peatland near Sainte-Marguerite- Marie, Quebec, during the summers of 1998 and 1999. Although the natural site was a source of CO2 during the dry 1998 study season (138 g C m(-2)), CO2 emissions were between 260 and 290% higher in the cutover sites (363 and 399 g C m(-2) for young and old, respectively). Cutover site CO2 emissions were only 88 and 112 g CO2-C m(-2) at the young and old sites during the wet 1999 study season. Total ecosystem respiration was more dependent on the water table position than on changes in the thermal regime or the labile carbon of the peat in a dry summer, but the opposite was the case in a wet summer. CO2 emissions increased with postharvest time regardless of a decrease in labile carbon, demonstrating that cutover peatlands are a large persistent source of atmospheric CO2. Direct measurement of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange in cutover peatlands, as opposed to determining the loss of carbon from bulk density determinations, provides a better understanding of how peat drainage and harvesting operations affect the carbon balance in peatlands.

AB  - The understorey fulfils many important ecosystem services, such as mediation of carbon dynamics, provision of habitats, and it contains most of the plant diversity in forest ecosystems. Changes in the overstorey diversity may affect understorey diversity as trees have a species-specific impact on resource availability and soil conditions that influence the understorey. In an attempt to disentangle the overstorey-understorey diversity relations, we combined the strengths of an experimental and observational approach in the boreal vegetation zone in Finland.
   The Satakunta tree diversity experiment was planted in 1999 using a pool of five tree species and four species richness levels (1, 2, 3, 5 species per plot) (only the first three levels were analysed in this study). Each level was replicated with different species composition to avoid complete dilution, which allows the separation of identity and diversity effects. Understorey surveys were performed in three subplots per plot in 2003 (young phase) and 2011 (established phase). In the full-grown forest surrounding Joensuu, a similar design was used in an observational plot-based study with three tree species richness levels (1, 2, 3 species per plot), containing trees from a pool of three species. The understorey was surveyed in 2012, also in three subplots per plot. We unravelled the relations between (1) tree species richness and (2) understorey composition, diversity, compositional dissimilarity within and between plots and temporal turnover, and searched for tree species identity effects.
   Tree species richness had a significant influence on the understorey composition in the established phase of the experiment. In contrast with the expectations, plot-level understorey diversity showed no significant differences between the tree species richness levels, neither at the experiment nor at the full-grown forest. At the established phase of the experiment, interplot compositional dissimilarity was significantly higher for monocultures than for mixtures. Monocultures have distinct influences on resources and soil conditions, leading to larger differences with other plots, while mixtures often share the same tree species or species with similar environmental impact. Tree species identity effects were present in monocultures but were predominantly tempered in mixed stands due to stronger dilution. Neither research approach found a clear relation between tree species richness and understorey diversity. The presence of tree species identity effects may partially have skewed the diversity relations. However, results on interplot compositional dissimilarity indicated that creating mixtures using a chessboard pattern of monocultures may positively influence understorey diversity at the forest level.

AB  - The only option for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Finland is mineral carbonation, which has been extensively researched at angstrom bo Akademi University (angstrom A). Finding suitable minerals for mineral carbonation in different regions of Finland will keep transportation of either CO2 or the actual mineral at a lowest possible level. Four different rocks from different regions in Finland have been compared with respect to composition" and possibility to extract magnesium. This paper presents experiments applying thermal solid/solid extraction. It was found that a mixture of ammonium sulphate (AS) and ammonium bisulphate (ABS) could extract a significant part of magnesium compared to tests using only AS or ABS. Serpentinite rock is also the best option for magnesium extraction while diopside and magnesiohornblende are much less reactive. Continuous mixing during the experiment in a rotary tube and adding some water to the solid/solid mixture gives better extraction results. The binding capacities of CO2 in the serpetinites with respect to the magnesium extractions achieved in this study are 240 kg CO2/ton rock (Serp-A) and 207 kg CO2/ton rock (Serp-B).

AB  - Within forest governance research, the transfer of power from governmental actors to civil society and market actors has been subject to intense scientific debate. We move forward on this debate by analyzing how ongoing transformations and power shifts in forest governance affect the power relations of actors with interest in various ecosystem services (ESs) in nine countries (Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Turkey). In order to examine power resources of actors, we triangulated 220 qualitative interviews, document analysis, and participatory observations. Governmental actors (with various interests in ESs) were the most powerful actors in most countries, and thus drove forest management. Our analysis shows that the power relations of actors with interest in different forest ESs, varied within the nine countries, though many similarities existed. Governmental, market, and civil society actors differed in their capacity to apply the power strategies "coercion", "(dis)incentives", and "dominant information", to realize their interests in ESs. In Lithuania, Slovakia and Turkey, governmental actors relied mostly on coercion; in the Netherlands on incentives; and in Sweden on dominant information. In Germany, Ireland, Italy and Portugal governmental actors relied on a mix of coercion, incentives, and dominant information. Market actors in all countries relied mostly on incentives, and civil society actors on dominant information as their power strategy.

AB  - Using a participatory research approach, we assess the knowledge systems and political ontology of reindeer husbandry. The study was conducted by a mixed team of scientists and Sami reindeer herders who practiced reindeer husbandry in West Finnmark, northern Norway, both prior to and during the state-led "rationalization" of Sami reindeer husbandry since the late 1970s. The analysis is based on the participants' reindeer herding knowledge and their assessment of the governance of Sami pastoralism. Two future narratives (scenarios) were used to stimulate reflection and discussion. Based on these discussions and by studying secondary sources, we examined how herders and government officials explained what reindeer husbandry is and ought to be and their conceptions about "proper" management of reindeer, herders, and the land on which reindeer pastoralism depends. We find that the state governance of reindeer husbandry since the end of the 1970s promoted, through a combination of economic incentives and sanctions, herding practices primarily based on Western knowledge and way of understanding the world. This knowledge system and the management techniques it promotes was, and still is, in conflict with and undermines reindeer herding knowledge and worldviews. However, despite 40 years of policies attempting to transform reindeer husbandry according to the state's perception of proper pastoralism, a Sami worldview continues to influence the herders' understanding of the relationship between humans, reindeer, and nature and how this relationship should be governed. Nonetheless, the conflicting, asymmetrical knowledge systems and competing worldviews of what reindeer husbandry is and ought to be compromise the identity and rights of the pastoralists.

AB  - The control and maintenance of species composition of mixed stands is a highly relevant objective of forest management in order to provide multifunctionality and climatic resilience. In contrast to this requirement there is, however, an evident lack of quantitative methods for mixture regulation. In this context, we propose an approach for the regulation of mixture proportions that has been implemented in a forest management model. The approach considers species-specific growth characteristics and takes into account the mixing effect on stand density. We present five exemplary simulations that apply the regulation. Each simulation maintains one of five desired species compositions. In these simulations, we consider the species European beech and Norway spruce under good site conditions, thus representing the most prominent mixed stands in Central Europe. Based on this model experiment, we analyze the potential benefit of controlled mixing regulation for achieving desired levels and combinations of ecosystem service provision, in particular productivity, diversity, and groundwater recharge. We found that a constant 50% basal area share of beech (equivalent growing space share of 80% to 70% depending on stand age) provided the most balanced supply of ecosystem services. Prominently, groundwater recharge considerably decreased when beech basal area shares were held below 50%. We discuss the ecological and practical implications of the regulation approach and different mixing shares.

AB  - Fungal and bacterial community composition across a soil depth profile in two Swedish grasslands is driven by vegetation and topography, but the drivers of abundance and diversity differ between groups.
   Soil microbial diversity and community composition are shaped by various factors linked to land management, topographic position, and vegetation. To study the effects of these drivers, we characterized fungal and bacterial communities from bulk soil at four soil depths ranging from the surface to below the rooting zone of two Swedish grasslands with differing land-use histories, each including both an upper and a lower catenary position. We hypothesized that differences in plant species richness and plant functional group composition between the four study sites would drive the variation in soil microbial community composition and correlate with microbial diversity, and that microbial biomass and diversity would decrease with soil depth following a decline in resource availability. While vegetation was identified as the main driver of microbial community composition, the explained variation was significantly higher for bacteria than for fungi, and the communities differed more between grasslands than between catenary positions. Microbial biomass derived from DNA abundance decreased with depth, but diversity remained relatively stable, indicating diverse microbial communities even below the rooting zone. Finally, plant-microbial diversity correlations were significant only for specific plant and fungal functional groups, emphasizing the importance of functional interactions over general species richness.

AB  - We determined the foraging habitats of the northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling et Blasius, 1839), Brandt's bat Myotis brandtii (Eversmann, 1845), whiskered bat Myotis mystacinus (Kuhl, 1819), Daubenton's bat Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl, 1819) and brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus (Linnaeus, 1758) in southern Finland. Among these species, we compared the diversities of foraging habitats, linear feature preference and the bats' tendencies to forage simultaneously. Eptesicus nilssonii was the most opportunistic, foraging in a wide range of habitats. Myotis daubentonii (94%) foraged mainly on water habitats, while M. brandtii/mystacinus (89%) and P. auritus (66%) foraged mainly in forest habitats. The diversities of foraging habitats used by E. nilssonii and P. auritus were higher than those of M. brandtii/mystacinus and M. daubentonii. Both E. nilssonii and P. auritus foraged mostly alone or in small numbers, while M. brandtii/mystacinus tended to gather in large numbers to forage in the same habitat. Half of E. nilssonii and 46% of M. daubentonii foraged over linear features, while other species did not use linear features to such an extent. Management and conservation of foraging habitats are needed especially for M. brandtii/mystacinus and M. daubentonii, which are more specialized than E. nilssonii and P. auritus.

CP  - 17th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE)
AB  - This study has investigated the quality and reliability of manual assessments on railway embankments within the domain of railway maintenance. Manually inspecting vegetation on railway embankments is slow and time consuming. Maintenance personnel also require extensive knowledge of the plant species, ecology and bio-diversity to be able to recommend appropriate maintenance action. The overall objective of the study is to investigate the reliable nature of manual inspection routines in favour an automatic approach. Visual estimates of plant cover reported by domain experts' have been studied on two separate railway sections in Sweden. The first study investigated visual estimates using aerial foliar cover (AFC) and sub-plot frequency (SF) methods to assess the plant cover on a railway section in Oxberg, Alvdalsbanan, Sweden. The second study investigated visual estimates using aerial canopy cover method on a railway section outside Vetlanda, Sweden. Visual estimates of the domain experts were recorded and analysis-of-variance (ANOVA) tests on the mean estimates were investigated to see whether if there were disagreements between the raters'. ICC(2, 1) was used to study the differences between the estimates. Results achieved in this work indicate statistically significant differences in the mean estimates of cover (p < 0.05) reported by the domain experts on both the occasions.

AB  - Empirically derived field diffusivities were determined over a 24h period for a selection of anthropogenic chlorinated chemicals in both fresh and aged snow at Tromso, Norway. Diffusivities in fresh snow were 4.91 x 10(-2), 4.79 x 10(-1), 4.75 x 10(-2) and 4.75 x 10(-2) cm(2) s(-1) for PCB-6, HCB and alpha-/gamma-HCH, respectively. These field diffusivities were compared to theoretical diffusivities (assuming no interaction between the chemical vapour and ice surfaces) and effective diffusivities (assuming sorption of the chemical vapour to the ice surface). Theoretical diffusivities were the highest values and were in good agreement with the empirical diffusivities derived from the field data. This suggests that the test chemicals used in this study have a low affinity for the snow/ice surfaces during diffusion into the snow. Differences in calculated diffusivities between these compounds can be largely accounted for by their physical-chemical properties, notably their snow interfacial-air partition coefficients (K-ia (snow)). However, using calculated values of K-ia snow to describe sorption to the snow surfaces greatly reduced the effective diffusivities of the chemicals relative to the empirical field diffusivities, and calls into question the accuracy of K-ia snow and/or its suitability for describing snow/air interactions at the relatively mild temperatures encountered in this study. Comparison of diffusivities between fresh and aged snow revealed similar values (within the same order of magnitude) and may be due to similar porosities between the snow types, although this parameter was not measured. Mass transfer coefficients were determined using the empirical field diffusivities and depth of the snow-layer, allowing chemical fluxes from snow to air to be calculated through use of the Whitman two-film resistance model. Using derived fluxes the chemical half-lives (t(1/2)) in fresh snow were calculated assuming that snow metamorphosis did not occur. The half-lives were in good agreement to half-lives measured in a separate field study for Pops, and serve to validate the empirical diffusivities measured in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Environmental compensation (EC) aims at addressing environmental losses due to development projects and involves a need to compare development losses with compensation gains using relevant metrics. A conceptual procedure for computing no net loss is formulated and used as a point of departure for a comparative analysis of metrics used by five Swedish municipalities as a part of their EC implementation in the spatial planning context of detailed development plans. While Swedish law does not require EC in this context, these municipalities have still decided to introduce EC requirements for development projects that occur on municipality-owned land and to promote voluntary EC among private actors in development projects on private land. There is substantial variation across the municipalities studied with respect to both metrics and attributes subject to measurement, but there are also similarities: The attributes considered when assessing the need for EC in conjunction with development are not only about nature per se, but also about recreational opportunities and other types ecosystem services; semi-quantitative metrics such as scores are common while quantitative or monetary metrics are rare; and metrics are rarely applied to assess compensatory gains, focusing instead on losses from development. Streamlining across municipalities might be warranted for increasing predictability and transparency for developers and citizens, but it also introduces considerable challenges such as a need for developing consistent guidelines for semi-quantitative metrics, and to handle substitutability issues if metrics are not only applied on individual attributes but also on groups of attributes. The broad scope of attributes used by the municipalities is in line with an international tendency to broaden EC to include not only biodiversity aspects but also ecosystem services. Moreover, the EC systems applied by the municipalities are of particular importance for highlighting the crucial role of environmental management for maintaining and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services not only in areas having formal protection status but also in the everyday landscape. The municipalities' experience and strengths and weaknesses associated with their EC systems are therefore relevant also in an international perspective.

AB  - Landscapes and their management are at the center of many of the sustainability challenges that we face. Landscapes can be described as social-ecological systems shaped by a myriad of human activities and biophysical processes, interacting across space and time. Managing them sustainably requires considering this complexity. Resilience thinking offers ways to address complexity in decision-making. In this paper, we analyse the learning and impact on a diverse group of local actors from participating in a participatory resilience assessment. The assessment, focused on sustainable landscape management in the Helge a catchment, Sweden, produced concrete knowledge outputs, describing ecosystem service bundles, a future vision, conceptual system models, and a strategic action plan. Follow-up interviews indicate that the process and its outputs supported the participants' learning process and helped them to articulate complexity thinking in practice. The outputs, and the exercises to produce them, emerged as complementary in supporting this articulation. Furthermore, they helped build participants' capacity to communicate the diverse values of the landscape to others and to target leverage points more strategically. Thus, it supported the application of resilience thinking in landscape management, especially by generating learning and fostering complex adaptive systems thinking.

AB  - Long-term data on spatial dynamics of epiphytic lichens associated with old-growth forests are fundamental for understanding how environmental factors drive their extinction and colonization in heterogeneous landscapes. This study focuses on Usnea longissima, a flagship species for biodiversity conservation. By using a long-term data set (37 yr.) of U. longissima in old Picea abies forests in Skuleskogen National Park, Sweden, we examined changes in the number of host trees, population size (sum of thallus length), extinction, colonization, dispersal, and distribution in a protected landscape. We surveyed the lichen in 1984-1985 by applying a line transect inventory and a total population inventory and tagged 355 occupied trees with an aluminium plate buried in the ground. We repeated the survey in 2021 using a metal detector and recorded GPS-position of host trees, tree and lichen population characteristics. We also measured the structure and age (tree-ring data) of the forest to understand how disturbance history influenced lichen populations. Usnea longissima occurred on 66 of the tagged trees and we recorded 141 new host trees. The number of host trees decreased with 41.7% and the population size with 41.9%. One third of the decline was caused by deterministic extinction (treefalls) and two thirds by stochastic extinction on standing trees. The probability of stochastic extinction on live trees decreased with population size in logistic regression. The decline in the sites with largest populations (35-87% loss) was more influenced by limited colonization than extinction. Colonization was highest in humid north-facing hillslopes with multi-layered forests driven by gap dynamics. The lichen was strongly dispersal-limited, with a median effective horizontal dispersal of only 3.8 m in 37 yr., explaining its strong dependence of long continuity of forest cover. The populations were clustered and had substantial local turnover, yet with stable distribution at landscape scale. The tree-ring index, growth releases and gap recruitments indicate extensive harvesting similar to 1860-1900, but without major disturbances during the last 70-80 yr. Instead, the decline of U. longissima was probably driven by air pollution, climate change (autumn/winter mortality and heatwaves) and denser forests. Our findings highlight that the long-term survival of this lichen may be at risk even in forests having a strong level of protection.

AB  - Detailed characterization and documentation of apple genetic resources are crucial for genetic amelioration and germplasm management. This study was carried out to fill the missing gap in information on the genetic diversity of cultivated apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) germplasm maintained in different orchards and fruit nurseries in different areas of the North Kashmir region. In this study, 62 genotypes collected from the North Kashmir region were screened using ten microsatellite markers. Allelic data were used to elucidate the population structure, genetic relationships, and molecular variance to define the genetic structure of the collection of diverse apple genotypes. A total of 77 alleles were amplified with an average polymorphism percentage of 87.5%, polymorphic information content (PIC) of 0.71, and resolving power (RP) of 3.58. The average genetic diversity indices observed for number of alleles (Na) = 1.67, effective number of alleles (Ne) = 1.47, Shannon's information index (I) = 0.43, expected heterozygosity (Ho) = 0.29, and unbiased heterozygosity (mu He) = 0.3 per assay indicated a moderate level of genetic diversity. Based on Jaccard's similarity coefficient, a UPGMA dendrogram, and principal coordinate analysis, a widespread dispersal of genotypes into three sub-clusters showing a high degree of genetic variability within the groups was obtained. STRUCTURE analysis divided the collection into two (K = 2) sub-populations that were more or less grouped on the basis of traditionally cultivated and recently introduced genotypes mixed with a few indigenous genotypes. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed significant variation within the populations (81%), indicating that the genotypes were the primary source of wide variation and that there was a limited genetic exchange between the genotypes, which aligns with the findings of the cluster analysis. The apple germplasm analyzed in the North Kashmir region represents an important source of genetic diversity, which can contribute significantly to germplasm management and future apple breeding programs both inside and outside the region.

AB  - We report on preparatory work to develop a virtual laboratory for ecosystem services, ESLab, and demonstrate its pilot application in southern Finland. The themes included in the pilot are related to biodiversity conservation, climate mitigation and eutrophication mitigation. ESLab is a research environment for ecosystem services (ES), which considers ES indicators at different landscape scales: habitats, catchments and municipalities and shares the results by a service that utilizes machine readable interfaces. The study area of the pilot application is situated in the boreal region of southern Finland and covers 14 municipalities and ten catchments including forested, agricultural and nature conservation areas. We present case studies including: present carbon budgets of natural ecosystems; future carbon budgets with and without the removal of harvest residues for bioenergy production; and total phosphorus and nitrogen future loads under climate and agricultural yield and price scenarios. The ESLab allows researchers to present and share the results as visual maps, statistics and graphs. Our further aim is to provide a toolbox of easily accessible virtual services for ES researchers, to illustrate the comprehensive societal consequences of multiple decisions (e.g. concerning land use, fertilisation or harvesting) in a changing environment (climate, deposition).

AB  - For carbon sequestration estimates it is necessary to evaluate effects of management practices on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) dynamics in a wide range of production systems and climatic zones. At higher latitudes with cold temperate climate, crop rotations dominated by forage are common and often highly productive-and the climate as well as the forage cropping systems favour large stocks of SOC and SON. The objective of this study was to estimate SOC and SON stock dynamics in the arable layer (0-25 cm) for different 6-year forage-based rotations using sampling data from three long-term field experiments in Northern Sweden. At the site with the lowest initial amount of SOC (8.2 kg C m(-2)), SOC stocks increased by 12 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over a 50-year period for the continuous forage rotation ('A'), which received ca. 10 Mg ha(-1) of cattle manure per year (wet mass). At the same site, SOC stocks were more or less at steady state in rotation 'B' with 4 years of forage and 2 years of annuals, receiving the same amount of manure. For rotation 'C' with 3 years of forage and receiving ca. 6.5 Mg ha(-1) of manure, the SOC stocks decreased by 18 g C m(-2) yr(-1,) while the SOC stocks for rotation 'D' with only annuals and no manure application decreased by 24 g C m(-2) yr(-1). At the other two sites, with higher initial SOC stocks (12.1 and 12.8 kg C m(-2)), the SOC stocks in all treatments decreased during a 30-year period, at a rate ranging from 11 to 95 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Similar trends were found for the change in SON stocks, although they were more variable. The topsoil SOC stocks were high compared to southern Sweden and regions of similar climate in northeast Canada, in particular for rotation A. These results indicate that the estimates of SOC and SON storage rate changes for a particular management system van vary widely within a small region of a given climatic zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Extensive forest expansion has taken place across Europe during recent decades. Forest expansion is also a major trend in Norway, with an annual increase of about 24.6 million m(3) during 2007-11. Similar trends were found in the study area at Mt FlOyen, Bergen, western Norway. Two types of forest expansion were discovered: expansion of alien coniferous tree species from plantations and spontaneous expansion of native Betula pubescens. Historical data on livestock grazing and climate were used to detect possible drivers of forestation. Forest expansion started in the 1970s, in a period when average July temperatures were lower than the period before. This is an indication that forest expansion was triggered by another cause than increasing summer temperatures. The area used to be heathland for livestock pasture but grazing came to an end around 1900. The area is well below the upper alpine forest limit and forestation should be expected when grazing ceased. The reason why forestation started so late is that neighbouring areas were also deforested. Forestation took place when trees planted in the 1950s began to produce seeds from the 1970s. During the twentieth century birch colonized steep slopes and still continues to do so in abandoned pastures. A distinct increase in July temperatures was found since 2000, which may increase the speed of future forest expansion. This will cause a substantial increase in uptake and storage of carbon, and will decrease the need for afforestation of new open land as suggested by some governmental bodies.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is one of the primary limiting elements in terrestrial ecosystems, and vegetation restoration has been regarded as an effective way to increase soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks. Despite compelling evidence indicating that mixed plantations can demonstrate higher vegetation productivity and carbon (C) sequestration capacity than monocultures, the effects of mixed plantations on STN stocks remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of 128 observations from 49 peer-reviewed articles across the Loess Plateau of China to evaluate the impact of different afforestation models (i.e., mixed plantations and monocultures) on the dynamics of STN stocks in mineral soil (0-30 cm). The results showed that, compared with monocultures, mixed plantations significantly increased STN stocks by 19.3%. For different mixed types, tree-shrub mixed plantations increased more STN stocks than tree-tree mixed plantations. However, the positive effect of mixed plantations on STN stocks was significant > 20 years after stand establishment. Moreover, for areas with steeper slope (>25 degrees), lower elevation (<1200 m), and climate restricted (MAT < 8 degrees C, MAP < 500 mm), mixed plantations had more advantages in increasing STN stocks than monocultures. Additionally, the response ratio of STN stocks was negatively correlated with the initial STN stocks, response ratios of soil pH, and bulk density (BD) but positively correlated with the response ratio of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Our results demonstrate that increasing tree species richness is an important strategy to increase STN stocks.

AB  - Land use change can elevate disease risk by creating conditions beneficial to species that carry zoonotic pathogens. Observations of concordant global trends in increased pathogen prevalence or disease incidence and landscape change have generated concerns that urbanization could increase transmission risk of some pathogens. Yet host-pathogen relationships underlying transmission risk have not been well characterized within cities, even where contact between humans and species capable of transmitting pathogens of concern occurs. We addressed this deficit by testing the hypothesis that areas in cities experiencing greater population loss and infrastructure decline (i.e., counter-urbanization) can support a greater diversity of host species and a larger and more diverse pool of pathogens. We did so by characterizing pathogenic Leptospira infection relative to rodent host richness and abundance across a mosaic of abandonment in post-Katrina New Orleans (Louisiana, USA). We found that Leptospira infection loads were highest in areas that harboured increased rodent species richness (which ranged from one to four rodent species detected). Areas with greater host co-occurrence also harboured a greater abundance of hosts, including the host species most likely to carry high infection loads, indicating that Leptospira infection can be amplified by increases in overall and relative host abundance. Evidence of shared infection among rodent host species indicates that cross-species transmission of Leptospira probably increases infection at sites with greater host richness. Additionally, evidence that rodent co-occurrence and abundance and Leptospira infection load parallel abandonment suggests that counter-urbanization can elevate zoonotic disease risk within cities, particularly in underserved communities that are burdened with disproportionate concentrations of derelict properties.

AB  - The coastal heathland of Western Europe, dominated by Calluna vulgaris L., was previously maintained by prescribed-burning and grazing to the extent that the Calluna became anthropogenically adapted to regular burning cycles. This 5000-6000-year-old land management practice was essential for local biodiversity and created a vegetation free from major wildland fires. In Norway, recent neglect has, however, caused accumulation of live and dead biomass. Invasion of juniper and Sitka spruce has resulted in limited biodiversity and increasing wildland fire fuels. At the Kringsja cabin and sheep farm, Haugesund, an area of previous fire safe heathland has been restored through fire-agriculture. Kringsja is located close to several important Viking Age sites and the Steinsfjellet viewpoint, a popular local tourist destination. The motivation for the present study is to analyse this facility and investigate possibilities for synergies between landscape management and tourism as a route to sustainable transitions. The present study compares restored heathland vegetation with unmanaged heathland at Kringsja. The potential for activities is also analysed based on the proximity to the tourist attractions in the region. The Kringsja area demonstrates different vegetation conditions depending on level of afforestation, Calluna heath maintenance, and gracing. Within a few minutes' walk, dense Sitka spruce communities with desert-like forest floor may be compared to native forest floors, Calluna dominated heathland, and grazing fields. It turns out that Kringsja may become a showcase for resuming prescribed burning and grazing for fire-safe rich landscapes, while offering cultural and historical experiences for all age groups. Moreover, tourism may become a source of income required for supporting ongoing restoration initiatives. To start working on a common vision, preferably aligned with existing "Homeland of the Viking Kings" tourism approach, should be one of the first steps along this path.

AB  - The European Union (EU) promotes a sustainable blue economy in the coastal and marine regions. In Finland, the regional development objectives are defined at the national and regional levels. Maritime spatial planning (MSP) is a tool to reconcile the sea's different uses. This study considers developing collaborative practices in regional planning to help meet regional development objectives. The MSP participants representing the coastal fishery (fishing and fish farming) in the Satakunta region, Finland, exemplify a local stakeholder group. Coastal fishery is a demanding and highly regulated livelihood, with the potential to grow as local food is trending. A mixedmethod approach was used to examine MSP participants' and fishery experts' perceptions about regional cooperation and the MSP process. The semi-structured interviews focused on three main themes: regional cooperation and synergies, conflicts and threats, and interest in regional collaboration or establishing secondary businesses. Questionnaires 2019 and 2021 examined stakeholders' engagement (intrinsic motivation) and social trust towards the planners in the MSP process. The need to tackle the challenges of coastal fishery dictates coastal fishery participants' perceptions regarding the fishery business's development in a regional context. Despite the collaborative approach, the first Finnish MSP round did not make a significant difference in the coastal fishery's status as a stakeholder group. MSP processes and developing the sustainable blue economy are part of the regional development framework, requiring a level playing field and mutual trust among stakeholders. The regional development of marine and coastal areas would benefit from a joint forum for stakeholder interaction built upon MSP. Collaboration could strengthen the integrative and comprehensive management of sea uses and resources.

AB  - Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and replacement of fossil fuels by renewable energy sources are important national and international targets. Oxyfuel (oxygen combustion technology) is one of the most promising technologies enabling carbon capture and storage (CCS) from flue gases. Aim of oxyfuel concept development is to study different oxygen production technologies, combustion processes, CO2 capture methods and integrate those to optimised concept. Goal is to create technical readiness for demonstration of oxygen combustion by using state-of-the-art knowledge, experiments, modelling and simulation. Demonstration plan for oxygen combustion for an existing power plant(s) in Finland will be prepared. Main results will be an evaluation of oxygen combustion business potential for implementation in existing and new power plants, and improvement of competitiveness of Finnish companies in energy sector by developing CO2-free power production technologies.
   Before oxygen combustion can be demonstrated in full-scale, small-scale testing and model development must be done. Material exposure conditions in oxygen combustion will differ from any present day environment. Current high temperature steel grades have been not developed nor tested for such aggressive conditions. VTT (Technical Research Centre of Finland) has in Jyvaskyla unique small-scale combustors applicable for oxygen combustion research.

AB  - In recent years, the study of soil nitrogen distribution (SND) in rocky desertification control ecosystems has increased exponentially. Rocky desertification experiences severe environmental degradation due to its fragile nature, and understanding rocky desertification soil nitrogen (SN) is critical for ecosystem services (ES) to support sustainable development. From the perspective of bibliometrics, this paper systematically, comprehensively, qualitatively and quantitatively describes the progress, trends and hotspots of SND in the field of rocky desertification environment. The results show that: 97.40% of the document type is "Article"; the study of rocky desertification SND shows the characteristics of rapid growth, the volume of published articles in the past three years accounted for 34.30% of the total; active countries are mainly China, Germany, United States, Sweden, Finland, etc. The research hotspots in this field include karst and nitrogen, and the future research hotspots tend to focus on karst rocky desertification ecosystem, soil nutrients and vegetation diversity in south China. It is suggested to construct SN management strategy suitable for rocky desertification fragile ecosystems in the future, strengthen theoretical research and comprehensively understand the characteristics of rocky desertification control ecosystem to put forward sustainable management strategy according to local conditions.

AB  - According to the latest IEA report, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) from fossil fuel fired power plants is a key option to mitigate CO2 emissions in the 450 scenario. In addition it is the only technology capable of large CO2 emission reduction from industrial applications and in combination with biomass firing the only currently available technology for reducing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by means of negative emission performance. Alstom develops CCS technologies for post-combustion and oxy-combustion, and have shown that these technologies can compete with renewable power generation on the basis of Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE). It is now essential that governments give the same priority to CCS as to renewables in order for large demonstration plants to be built, a necessary step in the development of the technology. The Norwegian Government, through its special purpose company Gassnova, is at the forefront of making this happen by construction of the world's largest test site for Carbon Capture. The Technology Center Mongstad (TCM) is owned by Gassnova, Statoil, Shell and Sasol. The unique location of TCM, next to the Mongstad refinery, provides interesting opportunities in terms of gases to be treated. The plant at TCM is designed to treat both refinery off-gas from a cracker operation as well as the exhaust from a gas turbine based combined heat and power plant. In addition, the captured CO2 can be recycled to achieve any CO2 concentration between 4 and 13% by volume. The Alstom Chilled Ammonia Process (CAP) is post-combustion technology that captures CO2 emitted from power plants or industrial sources. Deployment of this technology requires operating data and validated simulation tool for design that can evaluate various CAP configurations to achieve the lowest possible capital cost, energy demand and operating cost. A special focus will be directed to the CAP Installation at TCM, which was commissioned in 2012. The plant is designed to treat both refinery off-gas from a cracker operation as well as the exhaust from a gas turbine based combined heat and power plant.
   This paper will report on the first results of Chilled Ammonia Process (CAP) as part of Alstom's development program of commercial solution for carbon capture, at Technology Center Mongstad in 2012.

AB  - Every reindeer herder in Finland belongs to one of 56 co-operatives, each known as a paliskunta. In addition, some reindeer owners herd using the folkloric siida model of co-operation. Content analysis of interviews conducted with reindeer herders - referred to as reindeer husbandry entrepreneurs, by the Reindeer Herders' Association - from two ethnic communities in Finland, reveals that respondents who identified themselves as ethnic Finns viewed their self-employment as an individualistic form of entrepreneurship and they focused their discussion on matters related to financial capital and profit. In contrast, Sami respondents claimed that a significant causal variable behind their herding was maintenance of a cultural tradition and not necessarily limited to the maximization of financial profits. Sami respondents spoke much about their cooperative siida (a fluid, informal grouping of herders who voluntarily co-operate), and the social capital it involved; and about reindeer herding skills that are acquired on the job, i.e. human capital; and also about aptitudes, beliefs, customs, habits, interests, lifestyle and round-up traditions, reflecting the fact that considerable cultural capital is passed from adults to children in the course of primary socialization. A consequence of family participation in various aspects of community-based reindeer herding is that Sami children learn the occupation from a young age.

AB  - This study examines recent changes in the distribution of spring staging barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in Norway. From the early 1980s onwards, two major changes have taken place. First, increasing numbers of geese moved from the traditional islands with a semi-natural vegetation towards agricultural fields on larger islands close to the mainland. Secondly, geese expanded their range by exploring more northerly located islands. Data on food exploitation by geese on the traditional islands were collected to interpret these changes. The density of shoots of edible grasses explained the spatial variation in grazing pressure over the traditional islands. This pattern was caused by intensive grazing of available habitat, where apparently a lower threshold of the intake rate set a limit to the amount of food cropped. It is concluded that the carrying capacity of the traditional islands had been reached. On many of the traditional islands, capacity declined, however, as the vegetation type with the highest density of grasses and most preferred by geese disappeared. This negative development seems to have started when people abandoned the islands and summer grazing by sheep stopped. The declining number of geese that can find sufficient food within the traditional range, in conjunction with the rapidly growing size of the total population, are the main causes for the observed expansion of the population. Increasing spring temperatures and a change in agriculture may have allowed the geese to move to the north, and to invade agricultural areas. To lessen conflicts between geese and farmers on the large islands, two lines of management are available: restoration of management on islands within the traditional range, and enhancing the attractiveness to geese of saltmarshes on the larger islands.

AB  - Political and socially constructed arguments about values and benefits originating from ecosystem services (ES) may improve the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation. In this article we show how effective biodiversity conservation is dependent on stakeholders' rhetorical skills and their ability to introduce persuasive arguments for the target audience. We present a case study of a lengthy conflict to protect a mire area located in Eastern Finland. We follow locally constructed arguments and analyse their effectiveness with different audiences. Research data consist of interviews, newspaper articles and legal documents. Employing content analysis, we study the ES identified by different stakeholders and analyse the effectiveness and sources of arguments presented on behalf of those services. We differentiate between legal and political effectiveness as many ES arguments were effective in sustaining the prolonged conflict locally but ineffective in administrative courts. Legislation and scientific evidence are identified as the main sources for an effective argument in legal proceedings. This case is an example of how local residents require support from scientists in order to formulate effective arguments for legal audiences. Valid arguments for legal institutions are based on the protection of individual species or biotypes whereas political processes are more responsive to local ES valuations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The article describes the communities of soil nematodes in pine (hereinafter - Pinus sylvestris) and spruce (hereinafter - Picea abies) forests in the Finnish-Russian Friendship Nature Reserve. It exemplifies typical northtaiga forests and combines Kostomuksha State Nature Reserve (Republic of Karelia, Russia) and Friendship Park, consisting of five Protected Areas in the adjacent area of Finland. Methods commonly applied in nematology were used to study the following parameters: taxonomic diversity, population density, biomass, eco-trophic structure of nematode communities, and ecological indices representative of the soil food web. In the coniferous forests, the soil nematode fauna was made up of 45 nematode genera belonging to 29 families, with the highest diversity demonstrated by bacterial feeders (42% of the total number of taxa detected). Coniferous forests in the Finnish territory featured a high number of taxa (29-33) and high values of the Shannon index (H') (3.4-3.8) as compared to their counterparts in the Kostomuksha State Nature Reserve (18-24 taxa and H' = 2.4-3.3, respectively). A general trend for all the surveyed forests was a decrease in nematode abundance and biomass from the forest litter towards the mineral soil layer, which was more pronounced on the Finnish territory. A Principal Component Analysis of relative abundance of functional guilds of nematodes showed that forests of Eastern Finland had a more uniform nematode fauna among soil horizons. Analysis of the eco-trophic structure of nematode communities in soils under the coniferous forests revealed a high abundance of bacterial feeders, fungal feeders and nematodes associated with plants, while plant parasites were scarce or missing. In pine forests of both Russian and Finnish parts of the Friendship Nature Reserve, soil nematode communities were noted for a higher diversity and relative abundance of predators, while those in spruce forests had a higher abundance of fungal feeders than in pine forests. The regional features of the nematode fauna in the Kostomuksha State Nature Reserve were a low diversity and high dominance levels of taxa (high Simpson's index values), low maturity index (SMI) and structure index (SI) of the nematode communities, possibly as a result of human impact or other local-scope adverse environmental factors. The forest nematode communities in the Finnish territory showed a higher diversity of the fauna and a lower dominance level of taxa (a more evenly structured nematode fauna). The Finnish forests harboured 16 specific taxa not encountered in the Russian territory and plant parasites of the family Trichodoridae, which were rare in Northwest Russia. In addition, the group of dominant taxa included K-strategy nematodes sensitive to the environmental conditions. All this suggests that the conditions on the Finnish side are more favourable for soil nematodes. The ecological indices explored in the study (SI, EI) confirm that Finnish coniferous forests are stable habitats with complex, multicomponent soil food webs and undisturbed soil ecosystems. On the contrary, the indices for forests of the Kostomuksha Stare Nature Reserve betray a simplified and unstable food web associated with degraded soil ecosystems exposed to detrimental environmental impacts.

AB  - The opinions and perceptions of local communities are central issues in the sustainable management of conservation areas. During 2002 and 2003, we studied the opinions of local people about nature conservation and the development of tourism to investigate whether these opinions were influenced by socioeconomic and demographic factors. Data were collected via a survey of local residents in six areas with different histories of land use, land ownership, conservation, and tourism development. We classified respondents by cluster analysis into three different groups according to their opinions about nature conservation and tourism development: (1) sympathetic to nature conservation, but quite neutral to tourism development (57.7%); (2) critical of nature conservation, but quite neutral to tourism development (30.5%); and (3) quite neutral to nature conservation, but critical of tourism development (11.8%). The most important factors for classification were residential area, age, level of education, primary occupation, indigenousness, frequency of contact with tourists through work, and effects of nature conservation on household economy. On the other hand, gender, level of income, land ownership, land donation for conservation, and income from tourism did not affect opinions concerning nature conservation and tourism development. Almost equal proportions of residents living in close proximity to conservation areas in Kuusamo had positive and negative opinions about nature conservation. Residents living in close proximity to conservation areas regarded conservation as something that might reduce employment and incomes. On the other hand, a greater proportion of residents living near tourist resorts and farther from conservation areas had positive opinions about and perceptions of nature conservation and tourism development. Based on the proportional division of all respondents into the three groups, there may be a coexistent relationship between nature conservation and tourism in our study area. When local stakeholders had a chance to commit to the planning process, they had positive perceptions of and opinions about nature conservation and tourism development in their residential areas. As a result, we concluded that negative opinions and a lack of commitment to the planning process may hinder local development.

AB  - Invasive mammals are the greatest threat to island biodiversity and invasive rodents are likely responsible for the greatest number of extinctions and ecosystem changes. Techniques for eradicating rodents from islands were developed over 2 decades ago. Since that time there has been a significant development and application of this conservation tool. We reviewed the literature on invasive rodent eradications to assess its current state and identify actions to make it more effective. Worldwide, 332 successful rodent eradications have been undertaken; we identified 35 failed eradications and 20 campaigns of unknown result. Invasive rodents have been eradicated from 284 islands (47,628 ha). With the exception of two small islands, rodenticides were used in all eradication campaigns. Brodifacoum was used in 71% of campaigns and 91% of the total area treated. The most frequent rodenticide distribution methods (from most to least) are bait stations, hand broadcasting, and aerial broadcasting. Nevertheless, campaigns using aerial broadcast made up 76% of the total area treated. Mortality of native vertebrates due to nontarget poisoning has been documented, but affected species quickly recover to pre-eradication population levels or higher A variety of methods have been developed to mitigate nontarget impacts, and applied research can further aid in minimizing impacts. Land managers should routinely remove invasive rodents from islands < 100 ha that lack vertebrates susceptible to nontarget poisoning. For larger islands and those that require nontarget mitigation, expert consultation and greater planning effort are needed. With the exception of house mice (Mus musculus), island size may no longer be the limiting factor for rodent eradications; rather, social acceptance and funding may be the main challenges. TO be successful, large-scale rodent campaigns should be integrated with programs to improve the livelihoods of residents, island biosecurity, and reinvasion response programs.

AB  - Aims To define, objectively, a comprehensive set of functional groups of bird species in Scotland, taking into account season and spatial scale; to use these groups to assess how functional biodiversity of Scottish birds is related to land cover/use patterns.
   Location Scotland.
   Methods Analyses were of all bird species (resident or migrant) present in Scotland, excluding only the rarest and seabirds which come ashore only to breed, at both individual territory ('functional Groups')and landscape ('Landscape Clusters') scales, separately for summer and winter, using data covering the whole of Scotland. Functional Groups were defined by species' use of a large number of habitat features for feeding, nesting, roosting/perching and cover/shelter. Landscape Clusters were derived from the strength of species' associations with six land cover/use strata: arable (cropped land), inbye (controlled/managed grasslands), mooredge (mixed moorland/non-moorland landscape), moor (large areas of essentially uninterrupted moorland), plateau (areas containing the highest or most climatically severe moorland or montane land) and non-agricultural (principally urban areas, large forest blocks and large water bodies). Bird species and Functional Groups were related to landscape-scale land cover/use by their associations with strata. Biodiversity patterns in relation to land cover/use were similarly examined both as species diversity and Functional Group diversity.
   Results Both Functional Groups and Landscape Clusters were clearly interpretable ecologically. Species within Functional Groups had consistent patterns of association with strata, linking birds with land cover/use at landscape as well as local habitat scale. However, Landscape Clusters showed several differences from Functional Groups, mainly linked with the relative importance of 'local' and landscape-scale habitat features, or limited geographical range of some species. While there were clear groupings of species related to land cover/use in summer, bird distributions in winter were primarily related to climate severity, with broad land cover/use of only secondary importance.
   Bird biodiversity varied functionally as well as numerically between strata. Variation between strata was consistent with the habitat-use characteristics of each Functional Group. Limited geographical range of some species reduced the per-square species richness of all Functional Groups below their potential maximum but the degree of reduction varied markedly between Functional Groups.
   Structural heterogeneity in the landscape was an important determinant of bird biodiversity, with both homogeneous and heterogeneous landscape types (strata) of value to different Functional Groups. The importance of the lowland strata for birds generally, especially in winter, contrasted with the specific importance of every stratum for particular Functional Groups, especially in summer.
   Conclusions The combination of Functional Groups and land cover/use stratification enables a concise, comprehensive, direct assessment of bird biodiversity in relation to land cover/use at landscape scale. It also provides a framework within which effects of regional or global changes in environment or land use on bird biodiversity can be estimated. Total species richness in a stratum is a poor measure of its importance for overall bird biodiversity; species richness within Functional Groups, together with the analyses of Functional Groups in relation to the strata, provides a better base for the formulation of national-level conservation and biodiversity policy.

AB  - The overlapping land use of reindeer husbandry and forestry - both important livelihoods in the boreal forest zone in northern Finland - has led to disputes between the two land use forms for over a hundred years. For the purposes of this study, we conducted a literature review on the impacts of forestry on reindeer husbandry and the impacts of reindeer husbandry on forestry. We examined reindeer husbandry and forestry practitioners' perspectives on the impacts of forestry measures on reindeer husbandry and on the relations of forestry and reindeer husbandry. To achieve a holistic understanding of and new perspectives on these issues, scientific knowledge was combined with practitioners' knowledge gathered via a survey, and both archival and recent data sources were utilized. The study showed that a number of conventional forestry measures decrease either the number, surface area and/or the quality of reindeer pastures, which causes mostly unfavorable impacts on reindeer husbandry. The impacts of reindeer husbandry on commercial forests were regarded either as detrimental or beneficial, but mostly marginal. The relations between reindeer husbandry and forestry have improved during the past decades mainly due to the development of a consultation procedure between representatives of state forestry and reindeer husbandry. The study pointed to a need for establishing a corresponding, although voluntary, consultation procedure to private and joint forest ownership. In order to better adapt to the requirements of reindeer husbandry, forestry should take measures aiming at e.g. unevenaged forest structure, saving of old-growth trees, harvesting of logging residue from the most terricolous lichenrich sites, light soil preparation and natural regeneration. Planned forest sector investments in bioeconomy were regarded by respondents as somewhat positive, since growing demand for wood could mean more effective thinnings of young forests, which, in turn, would improve the preconditions of both forestry and reindeer husbandry. At the same time, the reindeer herders of our study were afraid that the development would lead to the loss of the last old-growth forests rich in epiphytic lichens -critically important winter pastures of reindeer.

AB  - Farmers are key actors in land management confronted with society's increasing demand for public goods. Understanding farmers' values and motivations is essential to policy makers to foster more sustainable production practices. So far, no definite value profile for European farmers exists. Based on Schwartz's theory of basic human values, we statistically analyzed six rounds of the European Social Survey to explore farmers' value orientations in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. Our results revealed that farmers are less open to change and instead more conservative in their value orientation than the general population. Comparison of value orientations across farmers showed that this value profile is particularly pronounced for Austrian, Finnish, and German farmers. Furthermore, there is a slight tendency for farmers to be less motivated by self-interest and instead more concerned with common welfare than the general population, but this observation needs further validation. Based on these value profiles, we argue that agri-environmental schemes will receive better acceptance when they represent a long-term modification of existing schemes, when they do not trade off commodity production, and when they provide benefits to society. Compensation for income losses resulting from reduced on-farm output appears to be an ineffective incentive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bark beetles often serve as forest damaging agents, causing landscape-level mortality. Understanding the biology and ecology of beetles are important for both, gathering knowledge about important forest insects and forest protection. Knowledge about the bark beetle gut-associated bacteria is one of the crucial yet surprisingly neglected areas of research with European tree-killing bark beetles. Hence, in this study, we survey the gut bacteriome from five Ips and one non-Ips bark beetles from Scolytinae. Results reveal 69 core bacterial genera among five Ips beetles that may perform conserved functions within the bark beetle holobiont. The most abundant bacterial genera from different bark beetle gut include Erwinia, Sodalis, Serratia, Tyzzerella, Raoultella, Rahnella, Wolbachia, Spiroplasma, Vibrio, and Pseudoxanthomonas. Notable differences in gut-associated bacterial community richness and diversity among the beetle species are observed. Furthermore, the impact of sampling location on the overall bark beetle gut bacterial community assemblage is also documented, which warrants further investigations. Nevertheless, our data expanded the current knowledge about core gut bacterial communities in Ips bark beetles and their putative function such as cellulose degradation, nitrogen fixation, detoxification of defensive plant compounds, and inhibition of pathogens, which could serve as a basis for further metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics investigations.

AB  - Analytic-deliberative techniques have been suggested as a promising approach to ecosystem service (ES) valuation but are still at an experimental stage. This paper contributes to the development of ES valuation in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure by introducing an analytic-deliberative approach to assessing restoration options for a regulated river in Finland. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with a value-focused approach was applied and compared with a desktop application of the ES-focused MCDA approach. We found out that the concept of ES could bring added value to the assessment process by: 1) enabling the framing and valuing especially of provisioning services - final ecosystem services, such as salmon catch in a more understandable way for the stakeholders, and 2) taking into account ecosystem processes and supporting services more precisely. However, some potential dangers of using the ES-based approach could include ES's appearing as a distant mode of thinking to affected groups and other stakeholders, and neglect of the trade-offs between ES and other relevant value and impact categories. Thus, although the ES framework is promising, it should not form a rigid 'checklist' way of making assessments but should rather be used to widen perspectives about potential issues in linking ecosystem properties to human benefits and values. It is argued that by combining the ES framework with the interactive MCDA approach, we can form a comprehensive and integrated approach to incorporating ESs into EIA. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) network comprises > 600 scientific groups conducting site-based research within 40 countries. Its mission includes improving the understanding of global ecosystems and informs solutions to current and future environmental problems at the global scales. The ILTER network covers a wide range of social-ecological conditions and is aligned with the Programme on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS) goals and approach. Our aim is to examine and develop the conceptual basis for proposed collaboration between ILTER and PECS. We describe how a coordinated effort of several contrasting LTER site-based research groups contributes to the understanding of how policies and technologies drive either toward or away from the sustainable delivery of ecosystem services. This effort is based on three tenets: transdisciplinary research; cross-scale interactions and subsequent dynamics; and an ecological stewardship orientation. The overarching goal is to design management practices taking into account trade-offs between using and conserving ecosystems toward more sustainable solutions. To that end, we propose a conceptual approach linking ecosystem integrity, ecosystem services, and stakeholder well-being, and as a way to analyze trade-offs among ecosystem services inherent in diverse management options. We also outline our methodological approach that includes: (i) monitoring and synthesis activities following spatial and temporal trends and changes on each site and by documenting cross-scale interactions; (ii) developing analytical tools for integration; (iii) promoting trans-site comparison; and (iv) developing conceptual tools to design adequate policies and management interventions to deal with trade-offs. Finally, we highlight the heterogeneity in the social-ecological setting encountered in a subset of 15 ILTER sites. These study cases are diverse enough to provide a broad cross-section of contrasting ecosystems with different policy and management drivers of ecosystem conversion; distinct trends of biodiversity change; different stakeholders' preferences for ecosystem services; and diverse components of well-being issues.

AB  - Wind is a significant disturbance agent in forests that is likely to become more prevalent as plantation forests are increasingly grown at high stand density to maximize yields and carbon sequestration. Although research has used models to characterize plantation wind risk at discrete sites, little research has regionally scaled these predictions under both current and future climate. Stem slenderness, or height/diameter ratio, has been found to be a useful proxy for stand stability in the widely grown species, radiata pine (Pinus radiata), which constitutes 90% of the New Zealand plantation area. Stands with a slenderness that exceed 80 m m(-1) are likely to be at risk when exposed to strong winds. In this study, slenderness was derived from 4,004 radiata pine permanent growth monitoring plots, that covered the spatial distribution of the species, and matched with stand density, age and key climatic and edaphic variables derived from surfaces. Using these data, the objectives of this study were to (i) develop a model to predict slenderness using machine learning and partition the impacts of key factors on slenderness, (ii) use this model to spatially predict slenderness throughout New Zealand for three contrasting silvicultural regimes, under current and future climate, and (iii) identify any regions that may be particularly vulnerable to wind risk. The final model of slenderness developed using the random forest algorithm included, in order of importance, stand density, stand age, mean annual air temperature and total annual rainfall. Predictions made on a withheld independent dataset (n = 401) were both unbiased and accurate (R-2 = 0.85). Spatial predictions of slenderness under current climate showed wide regional variation with mean slenderness at age 30 years increasing from 62.1 m m(-1 )for low stand density clearwood regimes to 73.5 m m(-1) for medium stand density structural grade regimes and 79.5 m m-1 for high stand density carbon regimes. Mean changes in slenderness were relatively low to 2040 and 2090 within the North Island. In contrast, within the South Island there were moderate increases in slenderness for the three silvicultural regimes that were markedly higher for 2090 than 2040.

AB  - AimTo determine whether a contemporary population of the moose (Alces alces), a large northern ungulate, retains genetic signatures of post-glacial recolonization and/or the effects of anthropogenic factors. We focused on investigating spatial genetic structure and the distribution of genetic diversity of this species to clarify its still obscure history.
   LocationEastern Fennoscandia, Northern Europe.
   MethodsIn total, 574 Finnish and Russian Karelian moose were genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci, and the mitochondrial control region was sequenced from 224 individuals. Spatially explicit Bayesian clustering, multivariate and spatial autocorrelation methods were applied alongside traditional F-statistics to study the effects of landscape on genetic structure. The demographic history of our study populations was explored with coalescent analysis and Bayesian skyline plots.
   ResultsA major mitochondrial divergence of moose was discovered between northern parts of Finland and the rest of the studied area. Landscape genetic analyses on the microsatellite data identified three genetic clusters connected by clines, with coalescent analysis indicating the division to be of ancient origin. Additionally, recent population bottlenecks were detected using Bayesian skyline plots.
   Main conclusionsOur results indicate a post-glacial secondary contact between two distinct moose mitochondrial lineages that diverged during the Pleistocene, whereas admixture of three diverged genetic subpopulations was detected using microsatellites. The emergence of these subpopulations was estimated to have occurred after the post-glacial recolonization of Fennoscandia. The observed genetic bottlenecks coincide with recorded historical population declines in the 18th century. We conclude that the contemporary genetic composition of the moose population in eastern Fennoscandia has been affected by both ancient and recent factors.

AB  - Research relating to ecosystem services has increased, partly because of drastic declines in biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. However, the mechanistic linkages between land use, biodiversity and service provision are poorly understood and synthesized. This is particularly true for many ecosystem services provided by mobile organisms such as natural enemies to crop pests. These species are not only influenced by local land use but also by landscape composition at larger spatial scales.
   We present a conceptual ecological production function framework for predicting land-use impact on biological control of pests by natural enemies. We develop a novel, mechanistic landscape model for biological control of cereal aphids, explicitly accounting for the influence of landscape composition on natural enemies varying in mobility, feeding rates and other life history traits. Finally, we use the model to map biological control services across cereal fields in a Swedish agricultural region with varying landscape complexity.
   The model predicted that biological control would reduce crop damage by 45-70% and that the biological control effect would be higher in complex landscapes. In a validation with independent data, the model performed well and predicted a significant proportion of biological control variation in cereal fields. However, much variability remains to be explained, and we propose that the model could be improved by refining the mechanistic understanding of predator dynamics and accounting for variation in aphid colonization.
   We encourage scientists working with biological control to adopt the conceptual framework presented here and to develop production functions for other crop-pest systems. If this kind of ecological production function is combined with production functions for other services, the joint model will be a powerful tool for managing ecosystem services and planning for sustainable agriculture at the landscape scale.

AB  - Supplementary, or diversionary feeding of wildlife is a common management practice, increasingly used to reduce or divert herbivore impact from sensitive habitats, forestry or agriculture. The landscape-scale spatial distribution of herbivory in relation to diversionary feeding is relevant to wildlife and land management, yet has never been quantified. We considered multiple hypotheses, based on central-place foraging theory, to investigate how landscape-scale browsing impact changed as a function of distance from feeding stations and thereby test the effectiveness of diversionary feeding. We assessed the landscape-scale browsing impact of moose by quantifying browsing patterns and moose density in commercially-valuable young Scots pine stands in an area of South-East Norway with a long history of winter feeding. We also used positions from GPS-collared female moose to investigate the spatial distribution of individuals across the landscape. Moose density and browsing impact at the local spatial scale (<1 km) followed an exponential decrease with distance from diversionary feeding stations. However, at the landscape scale (1-10 km), browsing impact did not show any relationship with distance to feeding stations. Leader stem browsing on Scots pine trees was high at both the local (68 +/- 12%) and landscape (59 +/- 8%) scales. In addition, browsing on commercially valuable Norway spruce, which is normally avoided by moose, was locally high around feeding stations. Long-term diversionary feeding of moose is ineffective in diverting browsing impact from young pine stands at the landscape scale, as currently practiced. Browsing on commercially-important tree species was sufficiently high that economic consequences could be expected. To avoid further conflict, we suggest a combination of reducing moose density and increasing the availability of natural or higher quality supplementary forage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - European ecosystems have been subject to extensive shifts in anthropogenic disturbance, primarily through atmospheric deposition, climate change, and land management. These changes have altered the macronutrient composition of aquatic systems, with widespread increases in organic carbon (C), and declines in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Less well known is how these disturbances have affected nutrient stoichiometry, which may be a more useful metric to evaluate the health of aquatic ecosystems than individual nutrient concentrations. The Swedish west coast has historically experienced moderate to high levels of atmospheric deposition of sulfate and N, and eutrophication. In addition, coastal waters have been darkening with damaging effects on marine flora and fauna. Here, we present three decades of macronutrient data from twenty lakes and watercourses along the Swedish west coast, extending from headwaters to river mouths, across a range of land covers, and with catchments ranging 0.037-40,000 km(2). We find a high degree of consistency between these diverse sites, with widespread increasing trends in organic C, and declines in inorganic N and total P. These trends in individual macronutrients translate into large stoichiometric changes, with a doubling in C:P, and increases in C:N and N:P by 50% and 30%, showing that freshwaters are moving further away from the Redfield Ratio, and becoming even more C rich, and depleted in N and P. Although recovery from atmospheric deposition is linked to some of these changes, land cover also appears to have an effect; lakes buffer against C increases, and decreases in inorganic N have been greatest under arable land cover. Our analysis also detects coherently declining P concentrations in small forest lakes; so called (and unexplained) "oligotrophication." Taken together, our findings show that freshwater macronutrient concentrations and stoichiometry have undergone substantial shifts during the last three decades, and these shifts can potentially explain some of the detrimental changes that adjacent coastal ecosystems are undergoing. Our findings are relevant for all European and North American waters that have experienced historically high levels of atmospheric deposition, and provide a starting point for understanding and mitigating against the trajectories of long-term change in aquatic systems.

AB  - Afforestation of marginal cultivated land is an internationally approved climate mitigation strategy, however, with uncertain implications for soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. We examined the effect of forest planting by measuring SOC at two adjacent sites: one with a Norway spruce forest planted in 1968 and one actively grazed pasture. Both sites had similar land-use history before forest planting, and they were as similar as possible in all other edaphic factors. There were no significant differences in SOC stocks down to 30 cm mineral soil, 7.15 and 8.51 kg C m(-2) in the forest plantation and pasture respectively. Only a minimal build-up of an O horizon, less than 2 cm, was observed in the plantation. The SOC stocks of the plantation and pasture were not significantly different from that of a nearby old forest, 7.17 kg C m(-2). When comparing these three land-uses we found that there were significant differences in the upper 10 cm of the soil with regard to other soil properties. Nitrogen (N) stock and pH were significantly lower in the old forest compared to the plantation, which again was significantly lower than that of the pasture. The opposite was the case for the C/N ratio. We conclude that there were no significant differences in SOC stocks in the upper 30 cm 50 years after afforestation with Norway spruce, but that there is still a legacy from the former cultivation that may influence both productivity and organic matter dynamics.

AB  - Assessing the organic C (C-org) sequestration in no-till soils under perennial crops requires molecular-level quality indicators. Therefore, we investigated the quality of soil organic matter (SOM) in the topsoil under Salix viminalis Land Lolium perenne L at two test sites in Central Sweden. The willow S. viminalis (clone 78021) was grown in short rotation coppice, and the grass L. perenne in an adjacent meadow for 17 (site Ultuna) and 15 years (site Enkoping), respectively. The concentrations of aliphatic lipids, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as well as the molecular composition and thermal stability of the bulk SOM, determined by pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS), were tested as indicators for the crop-specific SOM quality. Larger C-org concentrations (factor 1.4) in the topsoil (site Ultuna) under S. viminalis than under L. perenne corresponded to higher concentrations of summed aliphatic lipids (factor 1.6), mainly saturated n-alkanoic acids (factor 2.1) and n-alkanols (factor 1.5) in the GC/MS-analyses. Moreover, in the willow stand (site Ultuna) at soil depth of 0-10 cm disproportionally higher concentrations of saturated n-alkanoic acids (C-17-C-36) (factor 2.4) and n-alkanes (C-21-C-36) (factor 2.6) indicated a preferential sequestration of aliphatic C because the bulk Corg concentrations were only larger by factor 1.4. This crop-specific impact on SOM at soil depth of 0-10 cm was proven for both test sites. Furthermore, the Py-FIMS showed larger abundances of thermally stabile alkylaromatics (factor 1.4), and non-peptidic N-containing compounds (factor 1.3) in the S. viminalis plot (site Enkoping), which supported a crop-specific C-org-sequestration of these compounds. Thus, in summary, accumulations in extracted long C-chain aliphatic lipids and the thermal stability of some substance classes indicated that the C-org sequestration by no-till may be more distinct in soils under S. viminalis than under L. perenne.

AB  - The annual hemiparasite Euphrasia stricta occurs on Gotland in two early-flowering meadow varieties. E. stricta var. suecica is on the Swedish red-list as endangered, occurring in Sweden only on the Baltic island of Gotland. It probably has near relatives east of the Baltic proper. The other variety, E. stricta var. tenuis, has a wider distribution occurring almost all over Sweden, but is declining in abundance. Both varieties have close morphological similarities and habitat preferences, raising questions about which level conservation efforts should be focused on, varieties or populations. In this study we describe the genetic structure between and within these two varieties using amplified fragment length polymorphism, AFLP. F-ST between varieties is 0.14, and between populations within the varieties E. stricta var. suecica and var. tenuis FST is 0.60 and 0.26 respectively. The partitioning of gene diversity to different levels shows that 14% of the genetic diversity occurs between varieties, 42% between populations within varieties, and 44% within populations. Significant genetic differentiation was detected between varieties, populations and subpopulations within populations using a constrained principal coordinate analysis.
   We suggest that all of the existing populations of these two varieties on Gotland should be preserved, since they are few (6 E. stricta var. suecica and 5 E. stricta var. tenuis) and much of the genetic diversity is partitioned between populations.

AB  - An ecosystem model (Sima) was utilised to investigate the impact of forest management (by changing both the initial stand density and basal area thinning thresholds from current recommendations) on energy wood production (at energy wood thinning and final felling) and management-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the energy wood production in Finnish boreal conditions (62A degrees 39' N, 29A degrees 37' E). The simultaneous effects of energy wood, timber and C stocks in the forest ecosystem (live and dead biomass) were also assessed. The analyses were carried out at stand level during a rotation period of 80 years for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) growing in different fertility sites. Generally, the results showed that decreased basal area thinning thresholds, compared with current thinning, reduced energy wood (logging residues) and timber production, as well as carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Conversely, increased thinning thresholds increased energy wood production (ca. 1-27%) at both energy wood thinning and final felling and reduced CO2 emissions (ca. 2-6%) related to the production chain (e.g. management operations), depending on the thinning threshold levels, initial stand density, species and site. Increased thinning thresholds also enhanced timber production and carbon stocks in the forest ecosystem. Additionally, increased initial stand density enhanced energy wood production for energy wood thinning for both species, but this reduced energy wood production at final felling for Scots pine and Norway spruce. This study concluded that increases in both initial stand density and thinning thresholds, compared with the current level, could be useful in energy wood, timber and carbon stocks enhancement, as well as reducing management-related CO2 emissions for energy wood production. Only 2.4-3.3% of input of the produced energy (energy wood) was required during the whole production chain, depending on the management regime, species and sites. However, a comprehensive substitution analysis of wood-based energy, in respect to environmental benefits, would also require the inclusion of CO2 emissions related to ecosystem processes (e.g. decomposition).

AB  - Epiphytic lichen and bryophyte species composition, richness and diversity were surveyed on basal trunks of six common old-growth forest tree species, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Betula pendula, Alnus incana, Salix caprea and Populus tremula, in two old-growth forest areas, one in southern and one in middle boreal Finland. The average species numbers per tree ranged from 18 (Picea) to 27 (Salix) in the southern and from 20 (Populus) to 31 (Salix) in the middle boreal area. A few widespread habitat-generalist species, such as the foliose lichens Hypogymnia physodes and Platismatia glauca, were most abundant on all the tree species, except Populus. Most other epiphyte species showed at least a slight preference for one or two tree species. Populus proved to have the most distinct flora characterized by the abundance of certain, rather specialized crustose lichens and bryophytes. The number of species that occurred on only one tree species was highest on Populus (9) in the southern and on Alnus (18) in the middle boreal area. Differences in bark acidity and structure were the most likely explanations for the differences between tree species in the epiphytic flora and diversity. Salix and Populus were the most important of the tree species studied for the conservation of epiphyte diversity in the boreal forests of Finland. (C) 1996 The British Lichen Society

AB  - Boreal forests in Sweden are exploited in a number of ways, including forestry and reindeer husbandry. In the winter, reindeer feed mainly on lichens, and lichen-rich forests are a key resource in the herding system. Commercial forestry has mainly negative effects on reindeer husbandry, and conflicts between these two industries have escalated over the last century. This article reviews the effects of modern forest management practices on the winter resources available for reindeer husbandry. Forestry affects reindeer husbandry at both the stand level and the landscape level and over various time scales. Clear-cutting, site preparation, fertilization, short rotation times, and forest fragmentation have largely resulted in a reduced amount of ground growing and arboreal lichens and restricted access to resource. This article also discusses alternative forestry practices and approaches that could reduce the impacts of forestry on reindeer husbandry, both in the short and long term.

AB  - Wetlands are interconnected with the larger surrounding landscape through the hydrological cycling of water and waterborne substances. Therefore, the borders of individual wetlands may not be appropriate landscape system boundaries for understanding large-scale functions and ecosystem services of wetlandscapes (wetland network - landscape systems), and how these can be impacted by climate and land-use changes. Recognizing that such large-scale behaviours may not be easily predicted by simple extrapolation of individual wetland behaviours, we here investigate properties of 15 Swedish wetlandscapes in the extensive (22 650 km(2)) Norrstrom drainage basin (NDB) comprising as many as 1699 wetlands. Results based on wetland survey data in combination with GIS-based ecohydrological analyses showed that wetlands located in wetlandscapes above a certain size (in the NDB: similar to 250 km(2)) consistently formed networks with characteristics required to support key ecosystem services such as nutrient/pollutant retention and biodiversity support. This was in contrast to smaller wetlandscapes (<250 km(2)), which had smaller and less diverse wetlands with insufficient throughflow to significantly impact large-scale flows of water and nutrients/pollutants. The existence of such wetlandscape-size thresholds is consistent with scale-dependent flow accumulation patterns in catchments, suggesting likely transferability of this result also to other regions.

AB  - To gain insights into the effects of adaptive governance on natural capital, we compare three well-studied initiatives; a landscape in Southern Sweden, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, and fisheries in the Southern Ocean. We assess changes in natural capital and ecosystem services related to these social-ecological governance approaches to ecosystem management and investigate their capacity to respond to change and new challenges. The adaptive governance initiatives are compared with other efforts aimed at conservation and sustainable use of natural capital: Natura 2000 in Europe, lobster fisheries in the Gulf of Maine, North America, and fisheries in Europe. In contrast to these efforts, we found that the adaptive governance cases developed capacity to perform ecosystem management, manage multiple ecosystem services, and monitor, communicate, and respond to ecosystem-wide changes at landscape and seascape levels with visible effects on natural capital. They enabled actors to collaborate across diverse interests, sectors, and institutional arrangements and detect opportunities and problems as they developed while nurturing adaptive capacity to deal with them. They all spanned local to international levels of decision making, thus representing multilevel governance systems for managing natural capital. As with any governance system, internal changes and external drivers of global impacts and demands will continue to challenge the long-term success of such initiatives.

AB  - The goal of the processing industry, trade and consumers is to get eco-labelled freshwater fish products from sustainable fisheries into the market as soon as possible. The fourth largest natural lake system in Europe, the Saimaa lake system supports a fishery for vendace (Coregonus albula). Certification of the fishery requires an understanding of population structure to help determine the number and spatial extent of management units. In this study, we analysed the genetic diversity of local vendace populations in the Saimaa lake system and aimed to identify the conservation and management units of vendace. Within the Saimaa, the genetic divergence between local populations of vendace was weak and their genetic divergence did not follow an isolation by geographic distance pattern. Vendace has potential to disperse effectively within and between local populations in different lake basins. Even if we observed subtle genetic divergence within our study systems, available information showed no significant evidence that the local populations had unique evolutionarily significant traits. The local populations of the Saimaa lake system seem to have similar life history and morphological traits as in the whole Central Finland lake district. The conservation of genetic diversity seemed not to require basin-specific actions and we conclude that management of local vendace populations of Saimaa as one management unit is advisable.

AB  - Boreal mires encompass high diversity in species and habitats, many of which are endangered. In Finland, extensive use of peatlands has resulted in habitat fragmentation. A need for accurate and cost-efficient vegetation mapping and monitoring of habitat changes exists in mire conservation, restoration and peatland forestry. LiDAR is an emerging and excellent tool for probing the geometry of vegetation and terrain. Modern systems measure the backscattered signal accurately and also provide radiometric information. Experiments were carried out in a complex minerotrophic-ombrotrophic eccentric raised bog in southern Finland (61 degrees 47'N, 24.18'E). First, we tested discrete-return LiDAR for the modeling of mire surface patterns and the detection of hummocks and hollows, as well as the effect of mire plants on the Z accuracy of the surface echoes. Secondly, the response of different mire vegetation samples in LiDAR intensity was examined. Thirdly, we tested area-based geometric and radiometric features in supervised classification of mire habitats to discover the meaningful variables. The vertical accuracy of LiDAR in mire surface modeling was high: 0.05-0.10 m. A binary hummock-hollow model that was estimated from a LiDAR-based elevation model matched flawlessly in aerial images and had moderate explanatory power in habitat classification trials. The intensity of LiDAR in open-mire vegetation was mainly influenced by the surface moisture, and separation of vegetation classes spanning from ombrotrophic to mesotrophic vegetation proved to be difficult. Area-based features that characterize the height distribution of LiDAR points in the canopy were the strongest explanatory variables in the classification of 21 diverse mire site types. Actual qualifying differences in the ground flora were unattainable in the LiDAR data, which resulted in inferior accuracy in the characterization of ecohydrological conditions and nutrient level of open mires and sparsely forested wet sites. Mire habitat classification accuracy with LiDAR surpassed earlier results with optical data. The results suggested that LiDAR constitutes an efficient aid for monitoring applications. We propose the co-use of images and LiDAR for enhanced mapping of open mires and tree species. In situ calibration and validation procedures are required until invariant geometric and radiometric features are discovered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we address the implications of changing social-ecological feedback links for a sustainable management of coastal regions applying an ecosystem management perspective. This case study focuses on user patterns of fish resources in the Central Baltic Sea archipelago consisting of three sub-regions: Stockholm archipelago, Sweden, the Angstromland islands and the archipelago of SW Finland. The transition from a region, mainly relying on a mixture of local natural resources towards a region more dominated by the recreational demands of nearby large urban areas, has altered user patterns of fish resources. This transition has partly followed different pathways in the three sub-regions depending on how socio-economic driving forces have been manifested in management actions. Nevertheless, functioning ecosystems are still the basis for the delivery of ecosystem services and a living archipelago system. The significance of capturing and (re)building feedback links into management regarding knowledge on ecosystem services for a sustainable ecosystem management is discussed.

AB  - The rotation lengths of intensively managed production forests may be altered to achieve a variety of goals, with correspondingly implications for biodiversity. Here we consider the potential implications of shortened rotation times for biodiversity in planted monocultures of the two most common production tree species in Sweden, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). To do so we surveyed bird, bryophyte, epiphytic lichen and vascular plant diversity in 80 and 55-year-old stands; stand ages which approximate present-day and potential future rotation lengths in this region respectively. We found clear differences in the species communities of the 55 compared to the 80-year-old stands for both understory species and epiphytes, but not for birds. Nevertheless, bird species richness was still highest in the 80-year-old Norway spruce dominated stands. Dead wood amount was also highest the 80-year-old Norway spruce stands. Highest species richness of epiphytic lichens was found in 80-year-old Scots pine stands. However, 55-year-old Scots pine stands had a higher understory species richness and diversity than the older Scots pine stands, including a larger number of open land species. The 80-year-old forest stands examined may be considered old with respect to production forest rotation lengths in Sweden but are relatively young when comparing stand ages of unmanaged natural forest stands. Nevertheless, our results indicate that shortening the rotation time of Scots pine and Norway spruce, in this part of Sweden from 80 to 55 years, could have important consequences for forest biodiversity. These consequences are primarily inferred from the likely implications from shortened rotations for lichens community composition and diversity in both Norway spruce and Scots pine stands, as well as impacts on understory plant species in Norway spruce stands.

AB  - Diplopoda (millipedes) and Isopoda (woodlice) are among the most abundant macro-detritivores in temperate forests. These key regulators of plant litter decomposition are influenced by habitat and substrate quality, including that of dead wood. Dead wood provides shelter and resources to macro-detritivores, but the relative effects of tree species, wood decay stage, forest environment and their interactions on macro-detritivore communities are poorly known. To unravel these effects, we combined a reciprocal field incubation experiment and direct field sampling to compare the Diplopoda and Isopoda communities in logs of silver birch (Betula pendula) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) in two contrasting sites in terms of soil texture, pH, fertility and microclimate. We found: (1) a curvilinear relationship between wood decay stage and abundance of Diplopoda and Isopoda, by using wood density as a measure for the decay stage; (2) the pH of dead wood was a good predictor of wood decay stage in a site with pH close to neutrality but not in an acidic site; (3) Diplopoda and Isopoda community composition on different tree species converged during the decay process, consequently tree species are more important in the substrate selection of macro-detritivores at the beginning of their dead wood decomposition; (4) tree species, the growing environment of the trees and the decomposition environment of the logs strongly determined Diplopoda and Isopoda community composition in dead wood, these drivers of macro-detritivore communities interacted with each other and with the wood decay stage. Thus, when trying to understand and predict future patterns of macro-detritivore diversity under regimes of changing land-use and climate, these interactions should be taken into account. An important next step will be to quantify the feedback of macro-detritivore community composition to dead wood decomposition itself. This feedback may be better understood from the combination of (1) the complex interactions of tree species, wood decay stage and forest environment on the macro-detritivore community and (2) the functional traits of these macro-detritivore species. A better knowledge about these feedbacks can help in predicting carbon storage and nutrient cycling functions of dead wood in forests differing or changing in tree species composition and abiotic environment.

AB  - We argue that the current system of agri-environment management in the European Common Agricultural Policy is ineffective at conserving biodiversity in part because it promotes fragmentation instead of collaboration of actors, thus hindering coordinated biodiversity management. Actor fragmentation is reinforced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in three ways: (1) through targeting individual farmers; (2) by creating confusion around coordination roles for increasing numbers of actors; and (3) by failing to engage with barriers to collaboration among farmers. Our findings draw on empirical evidence collected through multi-stakeholder workshops in Germany and Sweden. Our argument adds a different dimension to accepted explanations for the ineffectiveness of CAP for biodiversity management. Traditionally, explanations have focussed on low levels of farmer uptake of relevant measures, or the lack of ecological knowledge informing such measures. The level of actor fragmentation identified here suggests that a fundamental rethink of farmland biodiversity management is needed. We propose a new research agenda to identify more effective governance approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tree slenderness coefficient (TSC) reflects tree stability and plays an important role in the development of near-natural silviculture programs and forest management decisions. However, there is a lack of TSC models to explore the factors that promote tree stability in mixed forests. Based on the data from 316 boreal and temperate mixed forest plots in northeastern China, this study developed a nonlinear mixed-effects TSC model for 14 tree species. Biotic and abiotic factors including climate, soil, wind speed, species mixtures, and diversity indices were tested for their regulatory effects on the TSC. Response patterns of each species' stability to changes in envi-ronmental factor gradients were simulated. In addition, this paper quantified the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on tree stability using the hierarchical partitioning approach. The results showed that mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), soil cation exchange capacity (CEC), the proportion of sand particles (SAND), mean wind speed (MWS), basal area proportions of the species of interest (BAP), and the Gini coefficient (GC) significantly influenced TSC. Tree stability increased with increasing MAT, CEC, and SAND. In contrast, increasing MAP, MWS, BAP, and GC negatively affected tree stability. The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on TSC were related to species heterogeneity. Our study quantified the drivers of tree stability in mixed forests and revealed the response patterns of TSC to environmental gradients, which will support further as-sessments of the stability of multi-species mixed forests under future environmental changes.

AB  - In recent years, the analysis of single or multiple species trait patterns was regarded as a reliable biomonitoring tool alternative or in addition to the traditional taxon-based methods. Hitherto, the trait approach was overwhelmingly applied to macroinvertebrate assemblages to monitor anthropogenic induced degradations of freshwater ecosystems. However, little is known yet whether bio-ecological traits derived from speciose and functionally diverse meiobenthic taxa might also provide diagnostic descriptors for the assessment of ecosystem health. The aim of our pilot study was to assess if the trait composition (including life history, morphometrical and ecological attributes) of lake nematode assemblages can reflect signs of cultural eutrophication equally well as the concomitant change in the species composition. Sediment samples for the analysis of the nematodes assemblage structure were taken at littoral sites of 15 German and Swedish lakes. Lakes were assigned to three traditional classes along the trophic continuum-oligotrophic, mesotrophic, and eutrophic. Canonical correspondence analyses illustrated that both the nematode trait and species compositions were significantly altered to similar extents along the eutrophication gradient. A set of 7 out of 28 trait modalities and a group of 12 from 30 species could be defined as indicative of oligotrophic or eutrophic conditions, and enabled us to discriminate among the three trophic lake states, without confounding effects of pronounced trait intercorrelations. Trait modalities such as a high number of offspring per year and the feeding type suction feeder predominated at the upper range of the enrichment gradient, whereas for modalities such as the obligate asexual reproduction, the feeding type chewer and several specifying nematode morphometrics (short body length, slender body shape) the opposite trend was revealed. However, the observed trait replacement did not imply an increased potential of resilience or resistance to disturbance, suggesting that eutrophication effects rather indirectly shaped nematode assemblages. This first attempt to apply a trait-based analysis to nematode assemblages was found to be successful for distinguishing among different degrees of lake eutrophication. However, compared to macroinvertebrate taxa there remains a great paucity on bio-ecological trait data for nematode species. Therefore future research is demanded to expand and refine nematode trait specifications with the intention to gain further insights into the mechanistic link between responses of nematode populations to environmental alterations.

AB  - Using the HUMPOL simulation computer model we explored the effects of various factors characteristic of mosaic cultural landscapes on the Relevant Source Area of Pollen (RSAP sensu Sugita) of small lakes (50 m radius), and the representation of NAP and human-impact pollen indicators in small takes. The following aspects were tested: 1) effect of variations in the spatial distribution of taxa/patches and species diversity on RSAP, 2) effect of changes in the proportion of landscape openness and size of openings on the RSAP and the pollen signal, and 3) the value of low-abundance anthropogenic indicator species to detect openness in the landscape. Moreover, we examined a methodological aspect of the MOSAIC computer program, i.e. the variability in RSAP due to inherent variations between replicates of random landscape simulation scripts using the program MOSAIC. We found differences in the RSAP estimates between runs using replicates of the same landscape created in the program MOSAIC. Such differences need to be taken into account when interpreting results involving the use of MOSAIC replicates. The simulations suggest that, if the model assumptions are valid, the RSAP is sensitive to vegetation structure in terms of patch size, and taxa/patch diversity and spatial distribution, whatever the properties of the taxa modelled. The longer the distance from each sampling site to get a sufficient cover of all taxa within the landscape, the larger the RSAP. If the spatial distribution of patches is very uneven and/or some taxa/patches are characterised by low frequencies in the randomized landscape, this distance will become longer. Further analysis of the results and new modelling experiments are necessary to provide better means for testing the presented hypothesis on the effect of spatial vegetation/landscape evenness on RSAP. The simulations indicate that, in hypothetical mosaic tree/herb landscapes including common NW European taxa of traditional cultural landscapes, RSAP estimates are relatively robust, i.e. will seldom be smaller than 1000 m and larger than 2500 m in radius in the case of 50 m radius lakes. NAP percentage is not a reliable "measure" of landscape openness. A NAP percentage value may represent a large range of openness percentage cover depending on the size and spatial distribution of the openness patches. Common pollen indicators of human impact and landscape openness will be represented in a pollen assemblage from small lakes when the landscape is relatively open (>= 30%) and a minimum of 300-1000 grains is counted. Findings of pollen indicators of human impact may not be as reliable indicators of land use within the RSAP as has sometimes been assumed, especially when human activity is small scale. Moreover, it is important to realize that a small number of grains may indicate relatively large overall openness cover in the landscape, especially if the open areas consist of few large clearings rather than many small clearings.

AB  - Urban planning is assumed to play an important role in developing nature-based solutions (NBS). To explore how NBS is addressed in urban development, municipal planning practices are analyzed based on three case studies in the Stockholm region of Sweden. Through focus group discussions, interviews and document studies, the planning and implementation of NBS and their intended contribution to regional green infrastructure (GI) and social and ecological qualities are investigated. The results show that the planning and design of urban green spaces engages the local community. Moreover, different conceptual frameworks are used to strengthen an ecological perspective and nurture expected outcomes, in particular ecosystem services and GI. Through competence development and collaborative approaches, the co-creation of innovative solutions for public and private green spaces is promoted. However, institutional conditions, e.g., legal frameworks and landownership shape the planning process and can challenge the ability to enhance social and ecological qualities. An assessment of the planning processes indicates a strong focus on ecosystem services and local GI, while the potential to contribute to regional GI differs widely between cases. The study concludes that a knowledge-driven and integrative planning process can foster the potential of NBS for green and sustainable cities.

AB  - The genetic diversity of four population of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Moscow parks have been studied. For the first time, a comparison of the gene pool of planted stands in urban areas with the gene pool of natural populations and planted stands of the Moscow region investigated earlier revealed a significant reduction in the genetic diversity of planted stands of Moscow parks in comparison with conditionally native populations from the Moscow region. In three of the four urban planted stands, a decrease was revealed in the proportion of polymorphic loci (down to 0.41 and 0.50) compared to conditionally native forests (0.64). All plant stands do not differ from conditionally native in terms of average heterozygosity and average number of alleles per locus. However, the test for allelic frequency heterogeneity demonstrated a significant difference of all planted stands (from Moscow and the Moscow region) from conditionally native populations both by 3-11 loci and by all (17) polymorphic loci. The quality of the gene pool of three of the four Moscow planted stands was evaluated as unsatisfactory and one of them as critical. A reduction in viability of urban planted stands with a reduced gene pool diversity was revealed: two of the three plantations died. In our opinion, this is a consequence of the sharp deviations of the observed diversity of the gene pool of the studied plantations from the natural norm, i.e., an optimal state of the gene pool historical in this natural area. Thus, economic necessity of genetic control over the state of saplings in reforestation is obvious.

AB  - It is not yet completely clear how individuals weigh positive and negative consequences of specific environmental actions to the self, others and nature, and how these evaluations are associated with the acceptance of such environmental actions. We explored how the acceptance of ecosystem service-related forest management objectives were associated with perceived positive and negative consequences, perceived knowledge of these objectives, and gender among future professionals in the bioeconomy context. We analysed a survey collected among Finnish university students majoring in agriculture and forestry, and biological and environmental sciences (N = 159). We found that environmental concerns followed a two-factor structure: concerns for humans and concerns for the environment. Perceived harm to nature and humans reduced the acceptance of timber and bioenergy objectives, but only the effect of perceived harm to humans remained when they were considered together with perceived benefits. Perceived knowledge of the objectives had little effect on acceptance of the objectives. Females endorsed the biodiversity and climate objectives more than males, whereas males endorsed timber objectives more than females. These results show that in the context of ecosystem service management, positive consequences are more important than negative when evaluating bioeconomy objectives, and that consequences to humans are more important than consequences to the environment.

AB  - Besides traditional timber production, other forest functions, such as biodiversity and recreation, have gained increasing importance during the last few decades. Demands on forests have become more diversified, thus making forest management and planning more complex. To meet these challenges, there is a growing interest in a more diversified silviculture, for which a number of different management options are available. However, it remains unclear how the various management options affect economic, ecological, and social aspects of sustainable forest management. Hence, in this study, we assess the consequences of various management options on different aspects of sustainable forest management through scenario analysis using a forestry decision support system. We evaluate 10 different forest management scenarios for two contrasting municipalities in Sweden, based on expert participation by way of a web-based multi-criteria decision analysis framework. We asked experts in economic, ecological, and social forest values, as well as those in reindeer husbandry, to weigh a number of indicators in their field of expertise against each other, and to create value functions for each indicator. We then determined scenario ranking for different sets of weights for economic, ecological and social forest values. Our results indicate that current management practices are favorable for economic aspects (wood production), while a number of scenarios would be better suited to fulfill the Swedish co-equal forest policy goal of production and consideration of environmental issues, such as scenarios with longer rotation periods, a larger share of set-asides and a higher share of continuous cover forestry. These measures would be beneficial not only for ecological values, but also for social values and for reindeer husbandry. Furthermore, we found that expert participation through the web-tool was a promising alternative to physical meetings that require more commitment in terms of time and resources.

AB  - To manage and conserve ecosystems in a more sustainable way, it is important to identify the importance of the ecosystem services they provide and understand the connection between natural and socio-economic systems. Historically, streams have been an underrated part of the urban environment. Many of them have been straightened and often channelized under pressure of urbanization. However, little knowledge exists concerning the economic value of stream restoration or the value of the improved ecosystem services. We used the contingent valuation method to assess the social acceptability of a policy-level water management plan in the city of Helsinki, Finland, and the values placed on improvements in a set of ecosystem services, accounting for preference uncertainty. According to our study, the action plan would provide high returns on restoration investments, since the benefit-cost ratio was 15-37. Moreover, seventy-two percent of the respondents willing to pay for stream restoration chose "I want to conserve streams as a part of urban nature for future generations" as the most motivating reason. Our study indicates that the water management plan for urban streams in Helsinki has strong public support. If better marketed to the population within the watershed, the future projects could be partly funded by the local residents, making the projects easier to accomplish. The results of this study can be used in planning, management and decision making related to small urban watercourses.

CP  - Human Role in Reindeer/Caribou Systems Workshop
AB  - Emerging out of small-scale reindeer farming, large-scale reindeer husbandry in Sweden and Norway was developed to counteract resource scarcity caused by depleted wild reindeer numbers and human population growth above what the former subsistence economy could sustain. Current numbers of reindeer are likely lower and fluctuate less than before wild reindeer were depleted and reindeer husbandry started on a large scale. Productivity is about 7-8 kg of meat per head in winter stock. Current problems arise from a multitude of circumstances, some of them related to the problems of practising a subsistence type of living in close connection with a modern industrialized society. Problems include: low production, typical for harsh conditions and use of an unimproved animal stock; the inability to support a modern standard of living solely from reindeer; the collective access to grazing grounds which makes internal management difficult; unclear legal rights resulting in conflicting interests with other land users and formal owners; and the relatively low number of people directly involved in reindeer husbandry. Possible long-term consequences are marginalization and the loss of land use rights, with negative consequences for the Saami as an indigenous people. Reindeer husbandry research addresses these problems by integrating human-ecological and socio-economic aspects with traditional natural science orientated research on reindeer husbandry problems. This research is funded by a multitude of sources. Independently of this, research is conducted on Saami life and culture in relation to reindeer husbandry at various universities, especially within social sciences and arts.

AB  - In Finland, over 220,000 ha of arable land has been afforested in recent decades. To meet the goals of forest management on afforested fields, information on the effects of former agricultural land use on soil fertility is needed. In this study, we examine the soil fertility of 12 former arable fields afforested either 10 or 60-70 years ago with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and adjacent sites that have been forested continuously. Volumetric soil samples were collected from the organic soil layer and from mineral soil to a depth of 40 cm. Soil samples were analyzed for pH, bulk density, organic matter content and amounts of nutrients (Kjeldahl N, extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn and B). On afforested fields, amounts of nutrients in the mineral soil, especially in 10-year-old afforestations, were higher than on continuously forested sites. In the organic layer plus the 0-40 cm soil layer, the 10-year-old afforestations had 68% more N, 41% more P, 83% more K, 252% more Ca, 6% more Mg, 61% more Zn and 33% more B than the continuously forested sites at a comparable soil depth. In the 60-70-year-old afforestations, the differences were significant only for N, Ca and Zn (20% more N, 121% more Ca and 115% more Zn than on the continuously forested sites). The effects of agriculture on amounts of nutrients were most clearly detected in the former plough layer (0-20 cm) of the 10-year-old afforestations and in the top layer (0-10 cm) of the older afforestations. Amounts of nutrients in the organic layer of the afforested sites were lower, but their concentrations were higher than in the continuously forested sites. On the 10-year-old afforestations, the bulk density of the mineral soil tended to be lower and the organic matter content higher than on the continuously forested sites. On both young and old afforestations, soil pH was higher than on the continuously forest sites. According to these results, changes in soil properties caused by agriculture have increased the soil fertility and therefore probably also the site index. The results also suggest that changes in soil properties due to agricultural land use are quite long lasting.

AB  - To address concern for loss of bryophyte biodiversity within managed forests, we compared community composition and environmental characteristics among three disturbance regimes: (i) naturally regenerated clear-cut forests, (ii) cutover spruce plantations (established on clear-cut forest land), and (iii) afforested field spruce plantations (established on agricultural fields) across a range of ages (19-102 years) in the Acadian Forest region of New Brunswick, Canada. Abundances of all forest floor bryophyte species, available substrates, microtopographical features, and tree canopy were measured as percent cover (1 m(2)) in 26 stands: 12 naturally regenerated clear-cut forests, eight cutover plantations, and six afforested field plantations. Multivariate analyses indicated that both bryophyte community composition and associated environment differed significantly across disturbance regimes, with no strong trends related to time since clearing (i.e., stand age). Spruce plantations were characterized by low substrate diversity and microtopographic and canopy homogeneity. Both plantation types had lower bryophyte species richness, evenness, and diversity (H') relative to naturally regenerated clear-cut forests; cutover plantations had the highest total bryophyte cover. The bryophyte community of plantations was composed of a subset of species found within naturally regenerated clear-cut forests: many liverworts and epixylic mosses were absent, with fewer pioneer species and more perennial stayers (equivalent to K-strategists) than expected.

AB  - The term 'actionable knowledge' indicates the rising expectation that science should produce useful results for policy and planning. In line with this, the success of the notion of ecosystem services (ES) in ecological sciences has been associated with promises of enhanced environmental protection and a narrowed gap between ecological knowledge and action. Promising to deliver operational knowledge for land-use planning, the notion allows ecologists to address social and economic issues related to conservation. We show that actionability of ES in land-use planning is not given, but requires active engagement by ecologists, land-use planners and nature managers. Making ES knowledge useful can be achieved through a range of techniques facilitating collaborative action between the producers and users of ES knowledge. We draw on exploratory case analyses in France and Finland to show how ES maps and scenarios are mobilised to operationalise ES. More specifically, we identify four techniques associated with mapping and scenario-making that seek to render ES knowledge actionable: (1) measures of ES in specific units, (2) visualisation of the results, (3) storytelling to discuss future options and (4) gamification to enact a culture of cooperation. We underline that these techniques can be used in several different ways in the planning process, providing specific advantages and limits depending on the goals, and that they have a diverging place in professional cultures.

AB  - Biochar management has been proposed as a possible tool to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and thus far its impacts in forested environments remain poorly understood. We conducted a large-scale, replicated field experiment using 0.05-ha plots in the boreal region in northern Sweden to evaluate how soil and vegetation properties and processes responded to biochar application and the disturbance associated with burying biochar in the soil. We employed a randomized block design, where biochar and soil mixing treatments were established in factorial combination (i.e., control, soil mixing only, biochar only, and biochar and soil mixing; n=6 plots of each). After two growing seasons, we found that biochar application enhanced net soil N mineralization rates and soil NH4+ concentrations regardless of the soil mixing treatment, but had no impact on the availability of NO3- , the majority of soil microbial community parameters, or soil resPiration. Meanwhile, soil mixing enhanced soil NO3- concentrations, but had negative impacts on net N mineralization rates and several soil microbial community variables. Many of the effects of soil mixing on soil nutrient and microbial community properties were less extreme when biochar was also added. Biochar addition had almost no effects on vegetation properties (except for a small reduction in species richness of the ground layer vegetation), while soil mixing caused significant reductions in graminoid and total ground layer vegetation cover, and enhanced seedling survival rates of P.sylvestris, and seed germination rates for four tree species. Our results suggest that biochar application can serve as an effective tool to store soil C in boreal forests while enhancing NH4+ availability. They also suggest that biochar may serve as a useful complement to site preparation techniques that are frequently used in the boreal region, by enhancing soil fertility and reducing nutrient losses when soils are scarified during site preparation.

AB  - The effects of 13 years of biennial application of four organic amendments (compost, green manure, farmyard manure and sewage sludge) on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, microbial biomass and community structure were compared with those of bare fallow, an unfertilised control and N-fertilised treatments. The experiment was conducted on a clay soil in western Sweden, in a randomised block design with four replicates. The crops grown were spring barley and oats. Changes in SOC mass were estimated by the 'equivalent soil mass' concept. Carbon inputs from crops were calculated from grain yields using linear allometric functions. The decomposition rate of soil organic matter was derived from a bare fallow treatment. Humification coefficients, defined here as the fraction of C input entering the SOC pool, for the organic amendments and crop residues were estimated by fitting a single-pool first order model to the final SOC stocks. The humification coefficient was highest for domestic waste compost (0.9) and lowest for above-ground crop residues (0.19). Crop yields were highest in sewage sludge-amended soil, probably due to favourable physical soil conditions, as indicated by lower bulk density (1.27-1.30 g cm(-3)) than in the other treatments (132-1.38 g cm(-3)). Despite addition of relatively high amounts of organic N, yields in other treatments receiving organic amendments were significantly lower than in those receiving mineral N fertiliser. In particular, the compost material was found to be highly recalcitrant, as indicated by its low C/N ratio (10) and low crop yield. Comparison of the correlation between phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentration and SOC showed that compost supported relatively less microbial biomass than the other substrates tested. An important finding was that differences in SOC between treatments were significant to 40 cm depth and that up to 27% of the SOC changes observed to 40 cm depth occurred in the upper subsoil (25-40 cm). Thus, SOC changes below ploughing depth should be considered in SOC balance studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Insects are reported to be in decline around the globe, but long-term datasets are rare. The causes of these trends are elusive, with changes in land use and climate among the top candidates. Yet if species traits can predict rates of population change, this can help identify underlying mechanisms. If climate change is important, for example, high-latitude species may decline as temperate species expand. Land use changes, however, may impact species that rely on certain habitats. Aims and methods We present 30 years of moth captures (comprising 97,032 individuals of 808 species) from a site in southeast Norway to test for population trends that are correlated with species traits. We use time series analyses and joint species distribution models combined with local climate and habitat data. Results and discussion Species richness declined by 8.2% per decade and total abundance appeared to decline as well (-9.4%, p = 0.14) but inter-annual variability was high. One-fifth of species declined, although 6% increased. Winter and summer weather were correlated with annual rates of abundance change for many species. Opposite to general expectation, many species responded negatively to higher summer and winter temperatures. Surprisingly, species' northern range limits and the habitat in which their food plants grew were not strong predictors of their time trends or their responses to climatic variation. Complex and indirect effects of both land use and climate change may play a role in these declines. Implications for insect conservation Our results provide additional evidence for long-term declines in insect abundance. The multifaceted causes of population changes may limit the ability of species traits to reveal which species are most at risk.

AB  - Information on forest site productivity is a key component to assess the carbon sequestration potential of boreal forests. While site index (SI) is commonly used to indicate forest site productivity, expressions of SI in the form of yield capacity (potential maximum mean annual volume increment) is desirable since volume yield is central to the economic and ecological analyses of a given species and site. This paper assessed the functional relationship between SI and yield capacity on the basis of yield plot data from long-term experiments measured over several decades for Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and Larch (Larix decidua and Larix sibirica) in Sweden. Component models of total basal area and volume yield were also developed. SI was determined by existing height development functions using top height and age, whereas functions for stand-level (m2 ha- 1) basal area development were constructed based on age, SI and initial stand density using difference equations and nonlinear mixed-effects models. The relation between volume yield (m3 ha- 1) and top height was adjusted with total basal area production through nonlinear mixed-effects models. Species-specific parametric regression models were used to construct functional relationships between SI and yield capacity. The root mean square errors of the species-specific models ranged from 2 to 6% and 10-18% of the average values for the basal area and volume equations, respectively. For the yield capacity functions, the explained variations (R2) were within 80-96%. We compared our yield capacity functions to earlier functions of the species and significant differences were observed in both lower and higher SI classes, especially, for Scots pine and Norway spruce. The new functions give better prediction of yield capacity in current growing conditions; hence, they could later be used for comparing tree species' production under similar site and management regimes in Sweden.

KW  - CURVATURE
AB  - Fault analysis plays an important role in determining the location of potential CO2 storage sites in which long-term storage feasibility is critical. The presence of faults and fracture zones can potentially lead to the gradual migration of CO2 from the storage reservoir to the atmosphere through the overburden strata. Traditional methods such as manual picking of faults are time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks, which can be costly for the CO2 storage site assessment process. To help address this concern, we develop a process for automating fault picking using deep neural networks. We implement two different deep neural networks based on the architectures of UNet and Deeplab v3+. We train the networks using synthetic data and labels and augment them using linear transformations and elastic deformations. We implement an ensemble-based approach to improve the generalization ability of our method. We also incorporate uncertainty estimation into the framework to aid in the risk management aspect of the decision-making process. We use data sets from different regions across the globe which help us to improve the methodology, with the ultimate aim to help 3D fault detection in the Smeaheia Field, a potential site for CO2 storage scale-up on the Horda Platform, offshore Norway.

AB  - The concept of urban ecosystem services (ES) is currently promoted in Sweden in the planning for more compact and sustainable cities. This study looks into how the implementation of the urban ES concept in Stockholm is understood by different urban professionals, based on semi-structured interviews and a stakeholder workshop. Although recognizing the usefulness of the ES concept, the professionals identified many remaining challenges linked to integrating the concept into land use planning. These are analyzed in relation to the gap between ES science and ES policy and structured according to the different types of planning uncertainties they represent. One issue that was persistently highlighted by stakeholders was that the promotion of urban ES - regardless of how beneficial it may be - will add further complexity to already strained workloads among planners, policy-makers and urban managers. Also, the political demand for increasing density in the urban areas of Stockholm seems to create a growing need for urban ES. Urban densification can thus potentially promote the interest in planning with ES as a vital parameter for urban qualities. They expressed a need for long term perspectives in planning with new tools and methods for valuing ES, supported through "high profile" projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditionally, biogeography has described the distribution of species. But as plant functional traits and functional diversity underpin ecosystem dynamics, understanding drivers of functional diversity at biogeographical scales is essential to understand spatial variation in ecosystem characteristics, particularly in light of ongoing environmental changes. Here we investigate geographic patterns of functional diversity and -traits of the Norwegian flora. We explore whether climate, land-use or glacial history are important drivers of functional diversity. We combine species occurrence records and assemblage-means of functional traits to assess the spatial distribution of functional traits and -diversity of native vascular plants in Norway in a 20 x 20 km grid. We use multiple-model inference to identify which environmental factors contribute the most in explaining the spatial patterns of trait distributions and functional diversity. Additionally, we use the constructed models to predict potential changes in distributions of traits and functional diversity given different climate change scenarios. Both individual traits and functional diversity display clear geographic patterns, predictable by climate, landscape and glacial history. Traits related to plant size and growth peak in warmer areas and are predicted to increase in the future, as is functional richness and dispersion. In contrast, functional evenness peaks in northern regions and is predicted to decrease in the future. The different environmental drivers vary in degree of importance, effect sizes and -directions on the assemblage-averaged functional traits and -diversity. This underlines the importance of multiple drivers in determining plant assemblage functionality. In the face of climate- and land-use change, Norway is expected to become warmer, wetter and experience a substantial increase in anthropogenic land-uses, such as increased urbanisation. In turn, the functional composition of the Norwegian flora is predicted to shift towards tall, woody, fast-growing species.

AB  - We examine the optimal length of a contract period in a conservation program with payments for ecosystem services aiming at protecting biodiversity on privately owned forests. The government chooses the number of stands and the length of contracts so as to maximize biodiversity benefits under a binding conservation budget. We examine the implication of two alternative budgets: a separate budget for each period (periodic budget) or one budget that to be used in all periods (intertemporal budget). The impact of the budget type shows up in the fact that with intertemporal budget choice set is larger and more high quality stands are available for contracting. Based on theoretical characterization we conduct a numerical landscape-level analysis. We find that both short and long conservation contracts are used to protect privately owned forest land. Transactions costs tend to reduce the number of short contracts. A budget increase results in a use of longer contracts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines which kinds of social benefits derived from forests are emphasised by Swedish stakeholders and what governance modes and management tools they accept. Our study shows that there exists a great variety among stakeholders' perceptions of forests' social values, where tourism and recreation is the most common reference. There are also differences in preferred governance modes and management where biomass and bioenergy sectors advocate business as usual (i.e. framework regulations and voluntarism) and other stakeholders demand rigid tools (i.e. coercion and targeting) and improved landscape planning. This divide will have implications for future policy orientations and require deliberative policy processes and improved dialogue among stakeholders and authorities. We suggest that there is a potential for these improvements, since actors from almost all stakeholder groups support local influence on governance and management, acknowledged and maintained either by the authorities, i.e. targeting, or by the stakeholders themselves, i.e. voluntarism.

AB  - Ecosystem-based fisheries management seeks to expand upon the traditional one-stock fisheries management measures by internalizing the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems, and accounting for biological interactions among marine resources. The fact that marine resources provide multiple, often competing benefits, makes the accomplishment of these ecosystem-based fisheries management objectives highly complex. In this paper, we develop a dynamic bioeconomic model to analyze the ecological and economic interactions between fisheries and renewable habitat where the habitat provides multiple ecosystem services. Specifically, a single resource manager seeks to maximize co-benefits of fishery-habitat interactions when the habitat is an exploitable marine resource, but also a dwelling place for commercial fish, enhancing the growth of the fish stock and providing regulating ecosystem services in the form of carbon sink for climate change mitigation. The optimal management rules for both fishery and habitat are derived and discussed. We also present an application of the model to analyze an integrated management of coastal cod and kelp forests in Norway, where regulations on commercial harvesting of kelp forests seek to protect fisheries. Both the theoretical model and the Norwegian application suggest substantial potential increases for both coastal cod and kelp forest stocks, with an attendant 8% increase in cod harvests, and about 1% reduction in kelp harvests. In addition, an optimal management regime that internalizes carbon sink co-benefits of kelp forests stores additional 300,000 tonnes of carbon.

AB  - The increasing human impact on the earth's biosphere is inflicting changes at all spatial scales. As well as deterioration and fragmentation of natural biological systems, these changes also led to other, unprecedented effects and emergence of novel habitats. In boreal zone, intensive forest management has negatively impacted a multitude of deadwood-associated species. This is especially alarming given the important role wood-inhabiting fungi have in the natural decay processes. In the boreal zone, natural broad-leaved-dominated, herb-rich forests are threatened habitats which have high wood-inhabiting fungal species richness. Fungal diversity in other broadleaved forest habitat types is poorly known. Traditional wood pastures and man-made afforested fields are novel habitats that could potentially be important for wood-inhabiting fungi. This study compares species richness and fungal community composition across the aforementioned habitat types, based on data collected for wood-inhabiting fungi occupying all deadwood diameter fractions. Corticioid and polyporoid fungi were surveyed from 67 130 deadwood particles in four natural herb-rich forests, four birch-dominated wood pastures, and four birch-dominated afforested field sites in central Finland. As predicted, natural herb-rich forests were the most species-rich habitat. However, afforested fields also had considerably higher overall species richness than wood pastures. Many rare or rarely collected species were detected in each forest type. Finally, fungal community composition showed some divergence not only among the different habitat types, but also among deadwood diameter fractions. Synthesis and applications: In order to maintain biodiversity at both local and regional scales, conserving threatened natural habitat types and managing traditional landscapes is essential. Man-made secondary woody habitats could provide the necessary resources and serve as surrogate habitats for many broadleaved deadwood-associated species, and thus complement the existing conservation network of natural forests.

AB  - Although habitat loss and fragmentation are widely regarded as major factors contributing to the decline of many populations, the relative importance of each phenomenon is seldom evaluated. Some researchers have questioned the generality of responses to habitat fragmentation, given variation in life history characteristics, the natural dynamics of systems, and land use patterns. Furthermore, a fundamental mismatch may exist between ecological theory, with its emphasis, on the spatial configuration of habitats, and empirical observations of population response. Nevertheless, the paucity of quantitative land management guidelines often leads to inappropriate generalizations of conservation paradigms to regional issues. We reviewed the empirical evidence for true fragmentation effects in boreal bird communities in Fennoscandia and Canada, and concluded that most responses may be attributed to pure habitat loss in landscapes where forest harvesting is the dominant land use practice. In these dynamic landscapes, total forest cover may not change, and predicting patterns of species decline requires identification of the habitats and species of concern. We constructed simple empirical models of benchmark communities in boreal forests of Finland and Canada based on species composition, species abundance distribution, and habitat requirements, in order to identify features of bird species sensitive to the loss of older forests. These models require a solid understanding of the underlying structure of the community of interest, and predict species loss based on a random-sample hypothesis. Our results were consistent with observed patterns of bird population decline and species loss in these regions. This approach provides null models for comparison with habitat remnants in order to test for fragmentation effects, and a basis for more detailed exploration of population dynamics and persistence in these systems. The results of our review and analyses indicated that system- and species-specific considerations are important when assessing the potential outcome of habitat loss and fragmentation on regional biota. Indiscriminate application of conservation paradigms may lead to misguided research efforts and poor management guidelines.

AB  - Context: The global demand for food is expected to continue increasing for decades, which may drive both agricultural expansion and intensification. The associated environmental impacts are potentially considerable but will depend on how the agricultural sector develops. Currently, there are contrasting regional developments in agriculture; expansion and/or intensification in some regions and abandonment in others, as well as changes in the type of farming. However, the environmental consequences of changes in farm type are not well understood.
   Objective: We have evaluated the impacts of farm type on food production and three key environmental variables-landscape openness, grassland biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-in three marginal agricultural regions in Sweden.
   Methods: We do this by first dividing the population of farms in each region into types, based on their land-use and livestock holdings using an innovative clustering method. Thereafter we analysed changes in production activities for farm types over time and evaluated the environmental and food-production impacts, where landscape openness is quantified using a novel indicator.
   Results and conclusion: Our results show that there is not one single farm type that would simultaneously maximize food production, grassland biodiversity, and landscape openness, whilst minimizing GHG emissions. However, there exists considerable potential to manage the trade-offs between food production and these environmental variables. For example, by reducing land use for dairying and instead increasing both cropping for food production and extensive livestock grazing to maintain landscape openness and biodiversity-rich semi natural pastures, it would keep food production at similar levels.
   Significance: Our farm typology allows us to assess the multifunctionality of farming, by relating contrasting production activities to multiple ecosystem services, grassland biodiversity and GHG emissions for informing policy towards more sustainable agriculture. We have demonstrated this with examples under Swedish conditions, but it should to a large extent also be applicable for other countries.

AB  - Fusarium culmorum is a ubiquitous soil-borne fungus able to cause foot and root rot and Fusarium head blight on different small-grain cereals, in particular wheat and barley. It causes significant yield and quality losses and results in contamination of the grain with mycotoxins. This review summarizes recent research activities related to F.culmorum, including studies into its population diversity, mycotoxin biosynthesis, mechanisms of pathogenesis and resistance, the development of diagnostic tools and preliminary genome sequence surveys. We also propose potential research areas that may expand our basic understanding of the wheatF.culmorum interaction and assist in the management of the disease caused by this pathogen. Taxonomy Fusarium culmorum (W.G. Smith) Sacc. Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota; Subphylum Pezizomycotina; Class Sordariomycetes; Subclass Hypocreomycetidae; Order Hypocreales; Family Nectriaceae; Genus Fusarium. Disease symptoms Foot and root rot (also known as Fusarium crown rot): seedling blight with death of the plant before or after emergence; brown discoloration on roots and coleoptiles of the infected seedlings; brown discoloration on subcrown internodes and on the first two/three internodes of the main stem; tiller abortion; formation of whiteheads with shrivelled white grains; Fusarium head blight: prematurely bleached spikelets or blighting of the entire head, which remains empty or contains shrunken dark kernels. Identification and detection Morphological identification is based on the shape of the macroconidia formed on sporodochia on carnation leaf agar. The conidiophores are branched monophialides, short and wide. The macroconidia are relatively short and stout with an apical cell blunt or slightly papillate; the basal cell is foot-shaped or just notched. Macroconidia are thick-walled and curved, usually 35 septate, and mostly measuring 3050 x 5.07.5m. Microconidia are absent. Oval to globose chlamydospores are formed, intercalary in the hyphae, solitary, in chains or in clumps; they are also formed from macroconidia. The colony grows very rapidly (1.62.2cm/day) on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at the optimum temperature of 25 degrees C. The mycelium on PDA is floccose, whitish, light yellow or red. The pigment on the reverse plate on PDA varies from greyish-rose, carmine red or burgundy. A wide array of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR tools, as well as complementary methods, which are summarised in the first two tables, have been developed for the detection and/or quantification of F.culmorum in culture and in naturally infected plant tissue. Host range Fusarium culmorum has a wide range of host plants, mainly cereals, such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, corn, sorghum and various grasses. In addition, it has been isolated from sugar beet, flax, carnation, bean, pea, asparagus, red clover, hop, leeks, Norway spruce, strawberry and potato tuber. Fusarium culmorum has also been associated with dermatitis on marram grass planters in the Netherlands, although its role as a causal agent of skin lesions appears questionable. It is also isolated as a symbiont able to confer resistance to abiotic stress, and has been proposed as a potential biocontrol agent to control the aquatic weed Hydrilla spp. Useful websites http://isolate.fusariumdb.org/; http://sppadbase.ipp.cnr.it/; http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/fusarium_group/MultiHome.html; http://www.fgsc.net/Fusarium/fushome.htm; http://plantpath.psu.edu/facilities/fusarium-research-center; http://www.phi-base.org/; http://www.uniprot.

AB  - Forest trees dominate many Alpine landscapes that are currently exposed to changing climate. Norway spruce is one of the most important conifer species of the Italian Alps, and natural populations are found across steep environmental gradients with large differences in temperature and moisture availability. This study seeks to determine and quantify patterns of genetic diversity in natural populations toward understanding adaptive responses to changing climate. Across the Italian species range, 24 natural stands were sampled with a major focus on the Eastern Italian Alps. Sampled trees were genotyped for 384 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 285 genes. A wide array of potential candidate genes was tested for correlation with climatic parameters. To minimize false-positive association between genotype and climate, population structure was investigated. Pairwise F-ST estimates between sampled populations ranged between 0.000 and 0.075, with the highest values involving the two disjoint populations, Valdieri, on the western Italian Alps, and Campolino, the most southern population on the Apennines. Despite considerable genetic admixture among populations, both Bayesian and multivariate approach identified four genetic clusters. Selection scans revealed five F-ST outliers, and the environmental association analysis detected ten SNPs associated to one or more climatic variables. Overall, 13 potentially adaptive loci were identified, three of which have been reported in a previous study on the same species conducted on a broader geographical scale. In our study, precipitation, more than temperature, was often associated with genotype; therefore, it appears as the most important environmental variable associated with the high sensitivity of Norway spruce to soil water supply. These findings provide relevant information for understanding and quantifying climate change effects on this species and its ability to genetically adapt.

AB  - While organic carbon (OC) in agricultural mineral soils is widely studied in terms of soil carbon sequestration and gaseous emissions, discharge-induced OC loss from soil is still poorly understood and estimations of boreal soil OC loads within water erosion are lacking. Loss of organic matter from arable soils is a concern for surface water quality, climate change and soil productivity. The main aim of this study was to quantify the role of water erosion in total OC and nitrogen (N) loads exported in agricultural discharge from boreal mineral soils under various cultivation practices. Surface water and subsurface drainage were collected near-continually over 2 years in two clayey and one sandy soil in Finland. Eroded sediment was mechanically separated by centrifugation from all discharge samples to detect sediment OC% and N% by dry-combustion method. Dissolved OC and N con-centrations in selected discharge samples were measured with high-temperature catalytic oxidation of unfiltered supernatant. A multiple linear regression model was used to study the significant factors affecting dissolved, sediment and total OC loads. In the clayey soils, the sediment OC (2-24 kg ha- 1 y-1) and N (0.2-1.1 kg ha- 1 y-1) export accounted for up to 35 % and 20 % of the annual discharge-induced total loads of OC (19-85 kg ha -1) and N (2-8 kg ha -1), respectively. In the sandy soil, erosion was negligible and dissolved loads of 17-35 kg OC ha- 1 y- 1and 4-7 kg N ha- 1 y-1 were detected. Subsurface drainage exported most of the sediment-associated OC and N loads from clayey soils. For the total OC loads, the distribution varied between the discharge routes, while the total N loads were mostly exported in subsurface drainage in both soil types. Sediment OC and N exports were related to soil plowing and discharge intensity, while dissolved OC loss was promoted by high surface soil OC%. Our results also indicated that a single cultivation practice may affect sediment and dissolved loads in opposite ways. These findings can be used to complement carbon budget estimations for mineral agricultural soils, and to assess soil management effects on terrestrial organic matter loading to boreal surface waters.

AB  - Mosses represent ecological niches that harbor a hitherto largely uncharacterized microbial diversity. To investigate which factors affect the biodiversity of bryophyte-associated bacteria, we analyzed the bacterial communities associated with two moss species, which exhibit different ecological behaviors and importance in bog ecosystems, Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum fallax, from six temperate and boreal bogs in Germany and Norway. Furthermore, their surrounding plant communities were studied. Molecular analysis of bacterial communities was determined by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis using eubacterial and genus-specific primers for the dominant genera Burkholderia and Serratia as well as by sequence analysis of a Burkholderia 16S rRNA gene clone library. Plant communities were analyzed by monitoring the abundance and composition of bryophyte and vascular plant species, and by determining ecological indicator values. Interestingly, we found a high degree of host specificity for associated bacterial and plant communities of both Sphagnum species independent of the geographical region. Calculation of diversity indices on the basis of SSCP gels showed that the S. fallax-associated communities displayed a statistically significant higher degree of diversity than those associated with S. magellanicum. In contrast, analyses of plant communities of Sphagnum-specific habitats resulted in a higher diversity of S. magellanicum-specific habitats for all six sites. The higher content of nutrients in the S. fallax-associated ecosystems can explain higher diversity of microorganisms.

AB  - Data on vascular plants of herb-rich forests in Finland were used to compare the efficiency of reserve selection methods in representing three measures of biodiversity: species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and restricted-range diversity. Comparisons of reserve selection methods were carried out both with and without consideration of the existing reserve system. Our results showed that the success of a reserve network of forests in representing different measures of biodiversity depends on the selection procedure, selection criteria, and data set used. Ad hoc selection was the worst option. A scoring procedure was generally more efficient than maximum random selection. Heuristic methods also appeared to be efficient. Each biodiversity measure can be used as a criterion for a selection algorithm and as a measure of efficiency of protection at the network level. The results indicate that different measures of biodiversity should be taken into account. For instance, phylogenetic diversity of a network was maximized by a heuristic method using phylogenetic diversity as the selection criterion. However, a heuristic method based on restricted-range diversity was more efficient than that based on species richness in representing high species richness in a forest network. Our results showed also that complementing the existing reserves is less efficient than selection starting with a blank slate. That is, the total number of sites required to protect a given level of biodiversity is higher when complementing the existing network, because some previously protected sites contribute relatively little diversity to the network. Data on species of a historic network should be available when new sites are selected for complementing the historic network.

AB  - Forests regulate climate, as carbon, water and nutrient fluxes are modified by physiological processes of vegetation and soil. Forests also provide renewable raw material, food, and recreational possibilities. Rapid climate warming projected for the boreal zone may change the provision of these ecosystem services. We demonstrate model based estimates of present and future ecosystem services related to carbon cycling of boreal forests. The services were derived from biophysical variables calculated by two dynamic models. Future changes in the biophysical variables were driven by climate change scenarios obtained as results of a sample of global climate models downscaled for Finland, assuming three future pathways of radiative forcing. We introduce continuous monitoring on phenology to be used in model parametrization through a webcam network with automated image processing features. In our analysis, climate change impacts on key boreal forest ecosystem services are both beneficial and detrimental. Our results indicate an increase in annual forest growth of about 60% and an increase in annual carbon sink of roughly 40% from the reference period (1981-2010) to the end of the century. The vegetation active period was projected to start about 3 weeks earlier and end ten days later by the end of the century compared to currently. We found a risk for increasing drought, and a decrease in the number of soil frost days. Our results show a considerable uncertainty in future provision of boreal forest ecosystem services.

AB  - Bialowie(z) over dota Forest is one of the closest to pristine forest ecosystems in temperate vegetation zone in European Lowland, which is still being transformed by forest management. We investigated the effects of salvage logging of spruce stands killed by bark beetle on the recovery process and the biodiversity of the herb layer in the early stages of vegetation development after felling, on the habitat of mixed deciduous, oak-lime-hornbeam forest (Tilio-Carpinetum). We tested: (i) to what extent salvage logging modifies the plant species richness and diversity compared to sites left intact; (ii) whether clear-felling leads to an increase in diversity of vascular plants; and (iii) which ecological groups of plants benefit, and which are hindered by disturbance, depending on age and size of the clear-felled site. Salvage harvesting executed between 2012 and 2016 led to an increase in overall plant diversity. However, the winners were the species of open habitats, promoted by soil disturbance, whereas the number and cover of ancient forest indicator species decreased in comparison to unlogged forests. Both trends were significantly related to the increasing size of clear-felled sites, and developed right after logging. A comparison of the species composition of the disturbed (logged and unlogged) sites with undisturbed forest with stands unaffected by infestation, treated as control plots revealed the great potential of the affected sites for spontaneous recovery towards the oak-lime-hornbeam forest community, despite 50-90 years of spruce-dominated stand cover. We conclude that continuous deterioration of the forest habitats via clearcutting of stands affected by insect outbreak, followed by tree planting, substantially reduces the chances of successful, natural regeneration towards deciduous, structurally complex and diverse forests.

AB  - Intensive forest management is one of the main land cover changes over the last century in Central Europe, resulting in forest monoculture. It has been proposed that these monoculture stands impact hydrological processes, water yield, water quality and ecosystem services. At the Lysina Critical Zone Observatory, a forest catchment in the western Czech Republic, a distributed physics-based hydrologic model, Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM), was used to simulate long-term hydrological change under different forest management practices, and to evaluate the comparative scenarios of the hydrological consequences of changing land cover. Stand-age-adjusted LAI (leaf area index) curves were generated from an empirical relationship to represent changes in seasonal tree growth. By consideration of age-adjusted LAI, the spatially-distributed model was able to successfully simulate the integrated hydrological response from snowmelt, recharge, evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, soil moisture and streamflow, as well as spatial patterns of each state and flux. Simulation scenarios of forest management (historical management, unmanaged, clear cutting to cropland) were compared. One of the critical findings of the study indicates that selective (patch) forest cutting results in a modest increase in runoff (water yield) as compared to the simulated unmanaged (no cutting) scenario over a 29-year period at Lysina, suggesting the model is sensitive to selective cutting practices. A simulation scenario of cropland or complete forest cutting leads to extreme increases in annual water yield and peak flow. The model sensitivity to forest management practices examined here suggests the utility of models and scenario development to future management strategies for assessing sustainable water resources and ecosystem services.

AB  - Septoria tritici blotch caused by the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly Mycosphaerella graminicola) is one of the most yield-reducing diseases worldwide. Effective disease management involves the use of resistant cultivars and application of fungicides. In this study, the population structure and genetic diversity of 183 Z. tritici isolates from Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the Baltic countries were analysed by molecular markers. In population structure analysis, isolates from Denmark and Sweden were grouped together, whereas isolates from the Baltics and Finland were grouped together. Analysis of genetic diversity and phi-values confirmed the division of Nordic and Baltic regions. Danish isolates sampled from different regions and different varieties were not genetically different. However, significant genetic differences were detected between isolates sampled from different years in Denmark and for isolates sampled from specific cultivars in different years. Additionally, the frequency of several known point mutations in the gene cyp51, conferring decreased sensitivity to DMI fungicides, was investigated. Several of the examined mutations were detected at a lower frequency in Baltic isolates compared to Danish and Swedish isolates. Analysis of the Danish population revealed a significant increase in specific mutations over the years. Lastly, some mutations were significantly more frequent in isolates derived from certain varieties. By using different resistance sources in breeding programmes and application of a wide range of fungicides, a sustainable and efficient disease management can be obtained.

AB  - Traditional land use systems are threatened by land use intensification and resulting land cover transitions in northern areas. This article examines cumulative land cover changes and their impacts on reindeer grazing grounds in the Kyro reindeer herding district in northern Finland. Land cover transitions were studied using Landsat TM and OLI images and topographic maps. The results showed that the herding district has experienced notable land cover changes during the past decades, and most of these changes were directly related to forestry. The proportion of continuous coniferous forests of the total forest cover declined from 92% to 78% between 1987 and 2013. Approximately one third of the forests outside current conservation areas were disturbed by forest management by 2013, and remaining forests were notably more fragmented than forests within conservation areas. The extent of the road and path networks expanded considerably between 1960s and 2010 as a result of increasing logging and tourism. Accumulation of disturbances gradually results in loss of key resources and declined quality of the landscape mosaic from the reindeer herding perspective, which can pose a serious threat to long-term sustainability of the livelihood. Rapid land cover changes in non-protected areas highlight an increasingly important role of conservation areas in maintaining resources for reindeer husbandry in the face of intensifying land use. Sustainable management of resources outside conservation areas requires careful participatory planning and efficient cumulative impact assessment of different land use activities.

AB  - Phytomelioration and tree species selection on poor mine soils are important for reclamation and afforestation success. Black alder (Alnus glutinosa), as N-fixing species, is often planted on afforested post-mining barrens as an admixture to improve soil properties and enhance growth of target tree species. Objective of this study was to assess the effect of black alder admixture on chemical, physical and microbial properties of sandy mine soils afforested with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The topsoil samples (0-5 cm) were taken in areas afforested with Scots pine with black alder admixture at 1 m, 2 m, 4 m and 8 m from the black alder rows and measured for texture, maximum water holding capacity (WHC), pH, C-org and N contents. The measured soil microbial properties included microbial biomass (C-mic), basal respiration rate (RESP), N mineralization rate and urease activity (URE). Community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of soil microbial communities were determined with Biolog (R) Ecoplates. The highest C-org, N, C-mic, RESP, N mineralization rate and URE values were measured at 1 m from the alders row and then decreased rapidly. The influence of alders ranged to ca 2 m-3 m from the alders row depending on the soil property. Soil microbial communities close to the alders row were functionally more diverse than those in soils from larger distances. There were distinct differences in CLPPs between microbial communities from soil at 1 m and 8 m from the alders row wherein those close to the alders were more efficient in degradation of carbohydrates and those at 8 m in degradation of polymers. Results of the study clearly indicate positive influence of black alder on several soil properties crucial for their biological activity and fertility.

AB  - The bivalve fauna from a late early Campanian rocky shore at Ivo Klack (southern Sweden), comprises just over sixty species, a very high diversity in comparison to other Late Cretaceous and modern rocky shore bivalve assemblages. This high diversity is here considered to represent a reliable census of the fauna; only in part can it be explained by the cumulative effect of generations of bivalves inhabiting this coastal environment. The high density and diversity and the wide range of shell morphologies allow interpretation of different modes of life in this variable environment with many contrasting habitats. Study of the functional morphology of bivalve shells and comparison with extant relatives has resulted in a subdivision of the fauna into seven guilds and five habitats. The bivalve fauna represents a within-habitat, time-averaged assemblage to which none of the species was introduced from adjacent environments. It includes some of the most northerly known, very small rudistid bivalves, in addition to the oldest known occurrences of Mytilus and Barbatia in association with rocky shores. Bivalves constituted the most important invertebrate group inhabiting the late early Campanian rocky shore at Ivo Klack, in terms of diversity, density and biomass. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In agricultural landscapes, arthropods provide essential ecosystem services such as biological pest control and pollination. Intensified crop management practices and homogenization of landscapes have led to declines among such organisms. Semi-natural habitats, associated with high numbers of these organisms, are increasingly lost from agricultural landscapes but diversification by increasing crop diversity has been proposed as a way to reverse observed arthropod declines and thus restore ecosystem services. However, whether or not an increase in the diversity of crop types within a landscape promotes diversity and abundances of pollinating and predaceous arthropods, and how semi-natural habitats might modify this relationship, are not well understood. To test how crop diversity and the proportion of semi-natural habitats within a landscape are related to the diversity and abundance of beneficial arthropod communities, we collected primary data from seven studies focusing on natural enemies (carabids and spiders) and pollinators (bees and hoverflies) from 154 crop fields in Southern Sweden between 2007 and 2017. Crop diversity within a 1-km radius around each field was positively related to the Shannon diversity index of carabid and pollinator communities in landscapes rich in semi-natural habitats. Abundances were mainly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitats in the landscape, with decreasing carabid and increasing pollinator numbers as the proportion of this habitat type increased. Spiders showed no response to either crop diversity or the proportion of semi-natural habitats. Synthesis and applications. We show that the joint effort of preserving semi-natural habitats and promoting crop diversity in agricultural landscapes is necessary to enhance communities of natural enemies and pollinators. Our results suggest that increasing the diversity of crop types can contribute to the conservation of service-providing arthropod communities, particularly if the diversification of crops targets complex landscapes with a high proportion of semi-natural habitats.

AB  - 1. Most Finnish streams were channelised during the 19th and 20th century to facilitate timber floating. By the late 1970s, extensive programmes were initiated to restore these degraded streams. The responses of fish populations to restoration have been little studied, however, and monitoring of other stream biota has been negligible. In this paper, we review results from a set of studies on the effects of stream restoration on habitat structure, brown trout populations, benthic macroinvertebrates and leaf retention.
   2. In general, restoration greatly increased stream bed heterogeneity. The cover of mosses in channelised streams was close to that of unmodified reference sites, but after restoration moss cover declined to one-tenth of the pre-restoration value.
   3. In one stream, densities of age-0 trout were slightly lower after restoration, but the difference to an unmodified reference stream was non-significant, indicating no effect of restoration. In another stream, trout density increased after restoration, indicating a weakly positive response. The overall weak response of trout to habitat manipulations probably relates to the fact that restoration did not increase the amount of pools, a key winter habitat for salmonids.
   4. Benthic invertebrate community composition was more variable in streams restored 4-6 years before sampling than in unmodified reference streams or streams restored 8 years before sampling. Channelised streams supported a distinctive set of indicator species, most of which were filter-feeders or scrapers, while most of the indicators in streams restored 8 years before sampling were shredders.
   5. Leaf retentiveness in reference streams was high, with 60-70% of experimentally released leaves being retained within 50 m. Channelised streams were poorly retentive (c. 10% of leaves retained), and the increase in retention following restoration was modest (+14% on average). Aquatic mosses were a key retentive feature in both channelised and natural streams, but their cover was drastically reduced through restoration.
   6. Mitigation of the detrimental impacts of forestry (e.g. removal of mature riparian forests) is a major challenge to the management of boreal streams. This goal cannot be achieved by focusing efforts only on restoration of physical structures in stream channels, but also requires conservation and ecologically sound management of riparian forests.

AB  - Urban greenspace provides citizens with important cultural ecosystem services (CES). Identifying landscape features and land use contexts that facilitate CES delivery is critical for guiding urban greenspace management. However, how landscape features and urban context interact with each other in influencing the CES of greenspaces remains unclear. Studies on the CES of patchy urban forests are needed as they are essential urban CES providers, but vulnerable under urban land use pressure. To address these concerns, we compared the CES of 20 urban forest patches in Helsinki, Finland, with five different combinations of landscape features (i.e. size and connectivity) and land use contexts (i.e. surrounding construction density). CES were assessed through an on-site survey on visitors' use, perceptions of CES experience and overall satisfaction, to capture the possible disparities among CES measurements. In larger (>20 ha) forests, visitors were highly satisfied with CES, particularly appreciating the experience of physical health improvement and inspiration through longer and more intense physical uses. Visitors of urban forests in a low construction density context appreciated experiences of cultural heritage, psychological restoration and physical health improvement. Urban forests deliver unique CES characterised by physical use and the benefit of restoration, aesthetics and contact with nature. We suggest that maintaining large urban forests is more effective in promoting CES in high-density areas. In low-density areas, maintaining small forests with open greenspace in the surroundings can also promote CES experiences. We identify management gaps caused by a mismatch between use intensity and CES experiences of urban forests, while both are important in determining people's overall satisfaction.

AB  - Biochars have potential to provide agricultural and environmental benefits such as increasing soil carbon sequestration, crop yield, and soil fertility while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen leaching. However, whether these effects will sustain for the long-term is still unknown. Moreover, these effects were observed mostly in highly weathered (sub-) tropical soils with low pH and soil organic carbon (SOC). The soils in northern colder boreal regions have typically higher SOC and undergo continuous freeze-thaw cycles. Therefore, effects of biochars in these regions may be different from those observed in other climates. However, only a few biochar studies have been conducted in boreal regions. We aimed to assess the long-term effects of biochars on GHG emissions, yield-normalized non-CO2 GHG emissions (GHGI), and N dynamics in boreal soils. For this, we collected data from four existing Finnish biochar field experiments during 2018 growing season. The experiments were Jokioinen (Stagnosol), Qvidja (Cambisol), Viikki-1 (Stagnosol), and Viikki-2 (Umbrisol), where biochars were applied, 2, 2, 8, and 7 years before, respectively. The GHG emissions, crop yield, soil mineral N, and microbial biomass were measured from all fields, whereas, additional measurements of plant N contents and N leaching were conducted in Qvidja. Biochars increased CO2 efflux in Qvidja and Viikki-2, whereas, there were no statistically significant effects of biochars on the fluxes of N2O or CH4, but in Qvidja, biochars tended to reduce N2O fluxes at the peak emission points. The tendency of biochars to reduce N2O emissions seemed higher in soils with higher silt content and lower initial soil carbon. We demonstrated the long-term effects of biochar on increased crop yield by 65% and reduced GHGI by 43% in Viikki-2. In Qvidja, the significant increment of plant biomass, plant N uptake, nitrogen use efficiency, and crop yield, and reduction of NO3--N leaching by the spruce biochar is attributed to its ability to retain NO3--N, which could be linked to its significantly higher specific surface area. The ability of the spruce biochar to retain soil NO3--N and hence to reduce N losses, has implications for sustainable management of N fertilization.

AB  - The diversity and characteristics of species within Inocybe section Inocybe Singer were investigated in Finland. As a result, 11 species are described here as new: Inocybe acutoides, I. amicta, I. boreocarelica, I. bufonia, I. ericetorum, I. kittilensis, I. lapponica, I. paludicola, I. porcorum, I. pseudoteraturgus, and I. silvae-herbaceae. Detailed macroscopic and microscopic descriptions, habitat information, and ITS sequence data are included. The new species are compared with each other and with similar species within the section, and a key is provided for the European boreal species. The types of Inocybe acuta, I. alpigenes, I. borealis, I. cicatricata, I. giacomi, I. heterochrominea, I. hinnulea, I. johannae, I. proximella, I. purpureobadia, I. putilla, I. striaepes, I. taxocystis, I. teraturgus, I. tetragonospora, and I. umbrinodisca are treated. The often poorly understood Inocybe acuta, I. borealis, I. giacomi, and I. proximella, as well as the recently described I. purpureobadia, are characterised on the basis of our own material. Inocybe borealis, I. giacomi, and I. purpureobadia are reported from the boreal zone for the first time. Inocybe borealis appears to be a remarkably variable species. Inocybe striata and I. umbrinodisca are reduced to synonyms of I. proximella, I. heterochrominea is reduced to a synonym of I. borealis, and I. tetragonospora to a synonym of I. alpigenes. In addition, Inocybe hinnulea and I. striaepes are reduced to synonyms of I. giacomi, and the previously supposed synonymy of I. johannae with I. giacomi is supported by ITS analysis.

AB  - A growing world population and rapid expansion of cities increase the pressure on basic resources such as water, food and energy. To safeguard the provision of these resources, restoration and sustainable management of landscapes is pivotal, including sustainable forest and water management. Sustainable forest management includes forest conservation, restoration, forestry and agroforestry practices. Interlinkages between forests and water are fundamental to moderate water budgets, stabilize runoff, reduce erosion and improve biodiversity and water quality. Sweden has gained substantial experience in sustainable forest management in the past century. Through significant restoration efforts, a largely depleted Swedish forest has transformed into a well-managed production forest within a century, leading to sustainable economic growth through the provision of forest products. More recently, ecosystem services are also included in management decisions. Such a transformation depends on broad stakeholder dialog, combined with an enabling institutional and policy environment. Based on seminars and workshops with a wide range of key stakeholders managing Sweden's forests and waters, this article draws lessons from the history of forest management in Sweden. These lessons are particularly relevant for countries in the Global South that currently experience similar challenges in forest and landscape management. The authors argue that an integrated landscape approach involving a broad array of sectors and stakeholders is needed to achieve sustainable forest and water management. Sustainable landscape management-integrating water, agriculture and forests-is imperative to achieving resilient socio-economic systems and landscapes.

AB  - The assessment of effects of anthropogenic disturbance on biodiversity (BD) and ecosystem services (ES) and their relationships are key priorities of the Intergovernmental Panel for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. Agricultural landscapes and their associated BD provide multiple ES and it is crucial to understand how relationships between ES and BD components change along gradients of landscape complexity. In this study, we related eight ES potentials to the species richness of five invertebrate, vertebrate and plant taxonomic groups in cereal farming systems. The landscape complexity gradient ranged from areas dominated by annually tilled arable land to areas with high proportions of unfertilized, non-rotational pastures and uncultivated field borders. We show that after accounting for landscape complexity relationships between yield and bird richness or biological control became more positive, but relationships between bird richness and biological control became less positive. The relationship between bird and plant richness turned from positive to negative. Multidiversity (overall biodiversity), was positively related to landscape complexity, whereas multifunctionality (overall ES provision), was not significantly related to either one of these. Our results suggest that multidiversity can be promoted by increasing landscape complexity; however; we found no support for a simultaneous increase of several individual ES, BD components or multifunctionality. These results challenge the assumption that bio-diversity-friendly landscape management will always simultaneously promote multiple ES in agricultural landscapes. Future studies need to verify this pattern by using multi-year data, larger sets of ES and BD components and a study design that is appropriate to address larger spatial scales and relationships in several regions.

AB  - The high rate of species extinction in recent decades is seen by many ecologists as heralding an extinction of catastrophic magnitude in the near future. The ecological consequences of such a biodiversity crisis are hard to predict, but some indication of likely effects can be gained from the knowledge of mass extinctions in the past. The Late Ordovician extinction was one of the five great extinctions in the geological record. It occurred in two phases about 0.5-1 million years (Ma) apart and resulted from climatic and related environmental changes associated with the rapid growth and decay of the large Gondwanan ice cap. Overall, an estimated 86% of species became extinct, 61% of genera and 12-24% of families, but few or no orders or higher taxa. The extinction severely affected both marine benthos and plankton. Using brachiopod data as a measure of ecological change, it can be seen that the number of within-habitat species (alpha diversity) was severely reduced and the number and distinctness of benthic communities (beta diversity) on marine shelves also declined sharply. Concurrently the number of palaeogeographic provinces fell from ten to five, possibly as a result of a loss of endemic species and preferential survival of cosmopolitan species. At the peak of extinction, following the second extinction phase, the ecological structure of both benthic and planktonic ecosystems had been severely disrupted and downgraded in complexity as a wide variety of niches were 'vacated'. In spite of the profound biodiversity and ecological crisis within this 'survival' interval, communities returned to their pre-extinction levels of alpha and beta diversity during the subsequent 'recovery' interval. In spite of the large amount of vacant ecospace to be filled there was very little innovation in terms of adaptive strategy, so that the structure of the emerging Silurian communities was similar to that of the Ordovician. In these terms the ecological recovery was remarkable, but it was also prolonged over about 4-5 Ma. On a geological time scale the biosphere returned to 'normal', but on a human time scale the mass extinction produced a very severely degraded biosphere. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the present work, the capture and storage of carbon dioxide from the fossil fuel power plant have been considered. The main objective was to analyze the thermodynamic performances and the technological aspects of two integrated gasification gas combined cycle plants (IGCC), as well as to give a forecast of the investment costs for the plants and the resulting energy consumptions.
   The first plant considered is an IGCC* plant (integrated gasification gas combined cycle plant with traditional shift reactors) characterized by the traditional water gas shift reactors and a CO2 physical adsorption system followed by the power section. The second one is an IGCC(M) plant (integrated gasification gas combined cycle plant with membrane reactor) where the coal thermal input is the same as the first one, but the traditional shift reactors and the physical adsorption unit are replaced by catalytic palladium membrane reactors (CMR).
   In the present work, a mono-dimensional computational model of the membrane reactor was proposed to simulate and evaluate the capability of the IGCC(M) plant to capture carbon dioxide.
   The energetic performances, efficiency and net power of the IGCC* and IGCC(M) plants were, thus, compared, assuming as standard a traditional IGCC plant without carbon dioxide capture. The economical aspects of the three plants were compared through an economical analysis. Since the IGCC* and IGCC(M) plants have additional costs related to the capture and disposal of the carbon dioxide, a Carbon Tax (adopted in some countries like Sweden) proportional to the number of kilograms of carbon dioxide released in the environment was, assumed. According to the economical analysis, the IGCC(M) plant proved to be more convenient than the IGCC* one. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Disturbances shape forest structure and composition, but the temporal dynamics of disturbance patterns, their influence on dynamics of forest structural complexity, and the potential impacts of ongoing climate changes are not fully understood. We addressed these issues by focusing on (1) long-term, landscape level retrospective analysis of disturbance dynamics of mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest; (2) testing for the prevailing disturbance agent; and (3) the detection of disturbance drivers, particularly site conditions, using a dendrochronological approach.
   We had a unique opportunity to sample a large area of natural forest (in otherwise altered region) in Bohemian Forest, that was recently affected by extensive and severe wind and bark beetle disturbances raising management concerns. Tree-ring series of a minimum of 35 trees on each of the 26 study plots were analysed for signals of past disturbances that were indicated either by release from suppression (rapid growth increase) or rapid early growth rate (gap origin).
   A broad range of disturbance severities were detected across the landscape, but severe disturbances (>50% trees responded), with a short rotation period of 174 years, best characterize the area. Reconstructed disturbances were associated with historically documented windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks. They were distributed across the landscape and affected its large portions with spatially variable severity. Over the last five centuries, disturbances peaked in the 1820s, but were rare after 1880. This non-equilibrium dynamics resulted into mature landscape structure at the end of 20th century and contributed to the large extent of disturbances in the last two decades. Disturbances were more frequent on wind-exposed locations such as mountain ridges and flatter terrain.
   Frequent disturbances did not allow the forest to develop into an old-growth phase; rather disturbance events of variable severities created structures important for biodiversity and could also preserve key early-seral phases in the landscape. We anticipate that potential future increase of disturbance intensities will not lead to comparable regime shifts in forests shaped by high-severity disturbances that kill largely mature trees (e.g., wind and bark beetle), because such disturbances are followed by resistant forest structure. Conservation areas should be large enough to allow for a wide range of disturbances. Emphasizing ecological functions needs understanding of biological legacies of natural disturbances and managers could partly rely on natural events to restore natural features into cultivated forests.

AB  - Water protection is a widely supported goal in society, but competing interests often complicate the implementation of water protection measures. Moreover, the benefits of protection efforts are typically underestimated as risk assessments focus on the provision of drinking water and neglect the additional services provided by a clean drinking water source. We developed a list of water system services (WSS) that allows assessment of all biotic and abiotic services provided by a drinking water source. The WSS were derived from the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES). The objectives of this paper are to (i) introduce the concept of WSS, (ii) describe a procedure on how to develop a region-specific list of WSS and present a list of WSS specifically tailored to Sweden, (iii) present how to integrate WSS into a risk assessment for drinking water, and (iv) illustrate a practical application on a Swedish case study. The results, presented as an assessment matrix, show the provided services and contrast the hazard sources with their impact on all services. The WSS assessment can be used to communicate and negotiate the extent of water protection measures with relevant stakeholders and illustrate synergies and trade-offs of protective measures beyond drinking water protection.

AB  - Background: The Baltic Sea ecosystems supply many benefits to society, termed ecosystem services. These depend upon a healthy marine environment requiring marine and relevant land-based policies integrated with public health policies. Until recently marine environment protection policies have largely focussed on human impacts on the environment and have not taken into account impacts of ecosystems on human health beyond the direct impacts of hazardous substances, such as those present in seafood. Whilst endeavours have been made to integrate human health and well-being into marine policies, interviews with key stakeholders through a participatory process revealed that the linkages were not sufficiently strong to inform policymaking. The existing evidence base urgently needs to be identified and synthesised to support relevant policy updates of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) 2008/56/EC and the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) (2007) as well as to help direct future research priorities.
   Method: The protocol is based on the primary question, "What linkages have been researched between Baltic Sea ecosystems and the positive and negative impacts to human health and well-being?" Using systematic mapping, this study will identify and map the state and the geographical distribution of the existing research evidence linking human health and well-being with the Baltic Sea ecosystems. The types of ecosystem services supplied by the Baltic Sea and the associated health and well-being impacts will be categorised and presented in a graphical matrix, illustrating ecosystem service type and the types of health and well-being outcomes. The systematic mapping procedure will result in a narrative report published with a searchable database, which will contain a descriptive summary of the information from all of the eligible studies. The systematic map and database will be displayed on the website of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE).

AB  - As a fine-scale, manipulative model experiment leaf litter was added in plots to increase habitat heterogeneity in a 50-year-old Norway spruce plantation, established after the clear-cutting of a native beech forest, during a 2-year period in the Hungarian Mountain Range. Pitfall trap catches of carabids from leaf-litter plots were compared with those from control plots to explore the effect of leaf-litter addition. Difference in the species composition was revealed by ordination; scores of the samples of the two plot types were significantly separated along the first MDS axis. The most numerous species (Pterostichus oblongopunctatus) was significantly more abundant in the leaf-litter plots. However, there were no significant differences for the other most frequently obtained species. Habitat generalist species were the most abundant, followed by forest generalists, then forest specialists, and there were some open habitat species. Enhanced habitat heterogeneity (leaf-litter addition) in homogeneous plantations influenced the spatial distribution and composition of carabids, through altered abiotic (lower ground temperature in the leaf-litter plots) and biotic (more prey items) factors. Differences in abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity were not significant between the control and the manipulated plots, although carabid catch was higher in the leaf-litter plots during both years. Forestry practices to increase habitat heterogeneity should be considered to enhance biodiversity in managed forests.

AB  - The ongoing pressures of climate change, as expressed by the increased intensity, duration, and frequency of temperature and precipitation events, threatens the storage of carbon in northern latitudes. One key concern is how these events will affect the production, mobilization, and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), the main form of aquatic carbon export in these regions. In this study, we retrospectively show contrasting effects of climate extremes over 23 years on two adjacent boreal catchments, one dominated by forest cover and the other draining a mire (wetland), despite experiencing the same extreme climate events. During the peak snowmelt, DOC concentrations ranged from 20 to 33 mg l(-1) in the forest catchment and 10-28 mg l(-1) in the mire catchment respectively, highlighting large inter-annual variation in the springtime hydrologicCexport at both sites. Weused climate and discharge variables to predict this variation, and found that DOC from the forested catchment, which is derived largely from riparian soils, had the highest concentrations following cold summers, dry autumns, and winters with high precipitation. By contrast, in the mire outlet, where DOC is primarily derived from decomposing peat, the highest DOC concentrations in the spring followed cold/dry winters and dry summers. Our results indicate that processes regulating stream DOC concentrations during spring in both catchments were dependent on both temperature and precipitation in multiple seasons. Together, these patterns suggest that DOC responses to climatic extremes are complex and generate variable patterns in springtime concentrations that are strongly dependent upon landscape context.

AB  - Whilst life cycle assessment (LCA) boundaries are expanded to account for negative indirect consequences of bioenergy such as indirect land use change (ILUC), ecosystem services such as water purification sometimes delivered by perennial bioenergy crops are typically neglected in LCA studies. Consequential LCA was applied to evaluate the significance of nutrient interception and retention on the environmental balance of unfertilised energy willow planted on 50-m riparian buffer strips and drainage filtration zones in the SkAyenne region of Sweden. Excluding possible ILUC effects and considering oil heat substitution, strategically planted filter willow can achieve net global warming potential (GWP) and eutrophication potential (EP) savings of up to 11.9 Mg CO(2)e and 47 kg PO(4)e ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, compared with a GWP saving of 14.8 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) year(-1) and an EP increase of 7 kg PO(4)e ha(-1) year(-1) for fertilised willow. Planting willow on appropriate buffer and filter zones throughout SkAyenne could avoid 626 Mg year(-1) PO(4)e nutrient loading to waters.

AB  - The choice of materials may play an important role in achieving the common European aims of near zero energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the lifecycle of buildings. The production of timber materials demands lower emissions than concrete and steel. To guide political and industrial priorities, it is vital to estimate the emission effects of increased use of timber. The article reports on a broad study that had the following aims:
   1. To forecast the number, types, floor area, and location of new buildings that will be built in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030.
   2. To estimate how many of these new buildings (a) will be and (b) could be built with timber as the main construction material.
   3. To compare these timber potentials to the present and future availability of nationally and sustainably sourced and manufactured timber.
   4.To estimate the effect on GHG emissions when substituting concrete and steel with timber in the production of new buildings in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030. The research is based on official prognoses for population growth. They are combined with building predictions derived from municipal statistics and plans. A GHG reduction factor is extracted from existing studies of the effects of conversion to timber. This factor is used to estimate the GHG saving potentials of different scenarios for timber use. Main results: center dot The forecast of building numbers, categories, sizes and location is a useful tool when discussing environmental, urban, industrial and architectural strategies. center dot Housing in 2-8 stories, not high-rise buildings, represents the biggest potential for increased use of timber in Norway. center dot Scientific consensus is not established regarding timber buildings and emissions. Especially the effects of carbon storage in long-lived products and use of residues for biofuel substitutes fossil fuel are still debated. To convey an order of magnitude, the different emission-saving effects are separated. center dot The estimates of GHG mitigation indicate that conversion to use of timber may have significant effects, butmeasures in the transport sector aremore important for reaching the ambitious emission targets in Oslo and Akershus counties. center dot To be robust, the argument for timber buildings must include the perspective of a green industrial shift based on renewable resources and innovative technology, design and architecture. center dot The vicinity of Norway's biggest and most rapidly growing market for timber buildings and the country's largest forests and timber-based industries represents a unique opportunity for sustainable urban and regional development.

AB  - In this study, we examined certain plant species for their high need of nitrogen (N > 6, Ellenberg's scale) and identified both conditions of soil nutrients, contents of N and P in leaves and light availability in permanent plots of deciduous forests in the Bohemian Karst (Central Bohemia) between 1997 and 1999. For comparison, a similar habitat was studied in SW-Slovenia. According to our results, factors limiting a development of the ground-layer vegetation of deciduous forests were soil moisture, soil NO3- content and light. The nitrophilic plant cover of the study area required for its development a readily available supply of nitrogen (mainly NO3-). In our opinion, an increase in the quantity of soil-available nitrogen may have been caused by an enhanced deposition of nitrogen. On the other hand, an analysis of leaf N and P indicated that the most of deciduous forests in the Bohemian Karst are still limited less by P than N. Therefore, a successful establishment of nitrophilic species seemed to be dependent on both an adequate supply of N and P in these soils. We observed that soil-extractable P contents were lower in plots covered with less than 1% of nitrophilic plants than in all other plots. Diversity of nitrophilic species, i.e., the number of species per plot, was significantly increased in the presence of soil-ex tractable P. A positive effect of P on both nitrogen mineralisation and nutrition of nitrophilic plants has been reported earlier in the literature. Thus, a successful utilisation of increased N in soils of these ecosystems could occur only in the presence of a sufficiently high P content. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Considering rapid urbanization worldwide, concern is growing that the resulting loss of green space affects welfare negatively. This study assesses how implicit prices of green amenities differ across apartments in different price groups to assess distributional impact of urban green amenities. Additionally, the paper proposes adjustments to enhance the standard hedonic model and increase comparability of estimates across study areas. Sales data for 6614 apartments in the suburbs of Stockholm, Sweden, an area that is relatively more prone to land conversion, were combined with GIS data on green urban areas and assessed in a simple log-linear model and quantile regression model. The results suggest that forested area even in a in a city with abundant green areas, have an impact on apartment prices. The price effect of green amenities differs strongly across both categories of 'green area' such as parks and forests, as well as, between the mean and the ends of the distribution of apartment prices. The proposed adjustments and results could be of use to other study areas.

AB  - Good understanding of forest productivity and carbon (C) storage capacity is essential for better understanding of C dynamics and climate modeling. Studies of old-growth forest C dynamics from central and eastern Europe are rare and the few remaining pristine forests represent a unique opportunity to study natural forest dynamics in an otherwise managed landscape. We studied protected old-growth Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) stands in the Bohemian Forest, Czech Republic, to explore total ecosystem C pool (live and dead biomass and soil) variability in forest ecosystem as a function of stand age and elevation. These old-growth forest ecosystems store very high amounts of C, up to 570 t C ha(-1), and 393 t C ha(-1) on average. Live biomass is the dominant C pool followed by mineral soil, forest floor and dead biomass. We found that total C significantly decreased with increasing elevation (1025-1338 m a.s.1) from 456 to 294 t C ha(-1), predominantly driven by decreases in live biomass and forest floor C pools. Significant changes take place in individual pools based on age and elevation gradients, but total C was not significantly different between stands age 116-145 years. Contrary to some recent findings that old-growth forest ecosystems continue to sequester C long after maturity, our data supports the hypothesis that old-growth forests reach a steady state and become C neutral. They accumulate same amount of C through photosynthesis than is lost by decay and leaching. This study provides a detailed overview of C pools of old-growth Bohemian Forests and highlights the importance of including all major C pools in forest ecosystem C studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Species richness of plants generally decreases along elevational gradients or peaks at intermediate elevations. Land use including grazing by wild and domestic herbivores also affects plant communities and diversity, but how grazing affects plant diversity along elevational gradients is less clear.
   2. Using a field experiment along an elevational gradient in Norway, we tested whether the impact of grazing on plant diversity interacts with elevation. Vascular plant communities were sampled following 10years of experimental sheep grazing (decreased/ceased, maintained and increased densities of 0, 25 and 80sheepkm(-2)) and compared with pre-experimental baseline data.
   3. The impact of grazing on species richness (alpha diversity) was investigated at the species level, and temporal community variance was used to investigate community stability (temporal beta diversity). Spatial community variance (spatial beta diversity) at the enclosure level was used to test whether community homogenization differed between treatments.
   4. Species richness and temporal stability varied between treatments and along the elevational gradient. Where grazing was ceased, species richness declined by up 3.7 species at low elevations and increased by up to 3.5 species at high elevations, whilst where grazing was maintained or increased, changes were less extreme along the elevational gradient.
   5. Temporal stability of plant communities was highest at low elevations and lowest at high elevations where grazing was reduced. There were no clear differences in spatial homogenization between grazing treatments, although spatial species turnover increased in heathlands where grazing decreased.
   6. Synthesis. This study shows that the effect of grazing on plant diversity varies with elevation, and grazing herbivores can thus directly affect elevational patterns of plant diversity. Grazing can buffer changes in plant communities and species richness, even in the face of other environmental drivers such as climatic warming.

AB  - Addressing sustainability challenges in landscape management requires processes for co-producing usable knowledge together with those who will use that knowledge. Participatory futures methods are powerful tools for attaining such knowledge. The applications of such methods are diverse and understanding the intricacies of the knowledge co-production process is important to further develop these research practices. To improve participatory futures methods and contribute to systematic and critical reflections on methodology, we present a comparative analysis of four research projects that applied participatory futures methods in the same study area. Conducted between 2011 and 2020, these projects aimed to co-produce knowledge about the future provision of ecosystem services in the Helge a catchment area in southern Sweden. For structuring the post-hoc, self-reflexive analysis, we developed a framework dividing the knowledge co-production process into three dimensions: settings, synthesis and diffusion. We based the analysis on documentation from the projects, a two-step questionnaire to each research team, a workshop with co-authors and interviews with key participants. The comparison highlights steps in project decision-making, explicit and implicit assumptions in our respective approaches and how these assumptions informed process design in the projects. Our detailed description of the four knowledge co-production processes points to the importance of flexibility in research design, but also the necessity for researchers and other participants to adapt as the process unfolds.

AB  - The capture and storage Of CO2 is gaining attention as an option for limiting CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. CO2 capture is premised on the safe long-term storage Of CO2 in geological formations. Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA, Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2 has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s. The Cost Of CO2 capture from low concentration industrial sources varies with a number of factors, but will certainly be very much higher than the recovery of naturally-occurring CO2. Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas industry for the application Of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2 storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic incentives for the key actors involved. This article discusses the most important research directions for CO2 capture and storage projects that have been initiated around the world. The adequacy of economic incentives will strongly influence how quickly producers and users of fossil fuels are able to close the knowing-doing gap for CO2 capture and storage.

AB  - The invasive Japanese seaweed Gracilaria vermiculophylla has become established over the past several years in numerous European estuaries, from Portugal to Norway. In the Faou estuary (48.295 degrees N-4.179 degrees W, Brittany, France), it forms a dense population at the mud's surface. The effects of G. vermiculophylla on metabolism, diversity, and the food web were studied. Community gross primary production (GPP) and respiration (CR) during emersion, chlorophyll-a content, macrofaunal and meiofaunal diversity and abundance, and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of representative macrofaunal species and main food sources were measured at low tide in winter, spring, summer 2014, and winter 2015. Results show significant seasonal variation in GPP and CR. Moreover, GPP was significantly higher in areas where G. vermiculophylla was present than in the control area (bare mud). However, this high GPP appeared to be linked to the increase in biomass in primary producers, with their efficiency (primary productivity, i.e. assimilation number) remaining relatively stable compared with the control area. Significant variation in abundance of meiofauna and macrofauna was also detected and new epifaunal species were collected, mainly in Gracilaria-colonized areas. Isotopic food-web Bayesian mixing models strongly suggested that G. vermiculophylla plays a major role in the diet of some dominant species. Mechanisms interacting with the functioning and diversity of the mudflat are discussed. Finally, the invasive seaweed G. vermiculophylla affected the mudflat ecosystem in three ways: as a new primary producer (increase in metabolism), as a habitat-forming species (changes in diversity and abundance of macrofauna and meiofauna), and as a new abundant food source, likely through the detrital pathway.

AB  - Urbanization is an important driver of environmental changes causing an increasing demand of ecosystem services while altering natural ecosystems. Yet, the sustainable management of urban areas can support the long-term provision of goods and services typical of healthy and resilient ecosystems and essential for human well-being. In this study, multiple ecosystem services generated by forest, agricultural (cropland and grassland), and urban areas in the municipality of Uppsala (Sweden) were first assessed in biophysical terms and then valued in money units. Afterwards, the economic value of provisioning and regulating services was spatialized using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The economic value of all investigated services amounted to 1.81 billion Swedish Kronor (SEK) or 198 million (sic) per year, of which: 80% generated by forest areas, 19% by agricultural areas, and 1% by green urban areas. Considering the size of different land uses, the average economic value of green urban areas was the highest (20,000 SEK ha(-1) or 2200 (sic) ha(-1)), followed by forest areas (11,387 SEK ha(-1) or 1250 (sic) ha(-1)), and agricultural areas (6398 SEK ha(-1) or 703 (sic) ha(-1)). The integration between the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of several ecosystem services provided by different land uses as well as their spatial analysis allowed a deeper understanding on the ecological life-support system to the urban area of Uppsala. In conclusion, we maintain that the interplay between nature services and human settlements can be better explored by using an interdisciplinary approach providing ecological and economic information integrated in support of policy makers and urban planners.

AB  - Methane (CH4) is a powerful greenhouse gas controlled by both biotic and abiotic processes. Few studies have investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, and climate change-induced shifts in CH4 flux and the overall carbon budget are therefore largely unknown. Hence, there is an urgent need for long-term in situ experiments allowing for the study of ecosystem processes over time scales relevant to environmental change. Here we present in situ CH4 and CO2 flux measurements from a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden subjected to 16 years of manipulations, including summer warming with open-top chambers, birch leaf litter addition, and the combination thereof. Throughout the snow-free season, the ecosystem was a net sink of CH4 and CO2 (CH4 -0.27 mg C m(-2) d(-1); net ecosystem exchange -1827 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), with highest CH4 uptake rates (-0.70 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) during fall. Warming enhanced net CO2 flux, while net CH4 flux was governed by soil moisture. Litter addition and the combination with warming significantly increased CH4 uptake rates, explained by a pronounced soil drying effect of up to 32% relative to ambient conditions. Both warming and litter addition also increased the seasonal average concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the soil. The site was a carbon sink with a net uptake of 60 g Cm-2 over the snow-free season. However, warming reduced net carbon uptake by 77%, suggesting that this ecosystem type might shift from snow-free season sink to source with increasing summer temperatures.
   Plain Language Summary: Much attention has been directed toward methane (CH4) dynamics in peatlands and wet ecosystems at high latitudes, which are considered net CH4 sources which intensify the greenhouse effect and lead to further warming. However, few studies have hitherto investigated CH4 fluxes in subarctic heath ecosystems, which likely exhibit both CH4 production and uptake. Therefore, climate-induced changes in CH4 exchange and the overall carbon balance are largely unknown. In this unique long-term field experiment, we investigated the response of biological CH4 uptake (microbial CH4 consumption) to increased summer warming by open-top chambers and deciduous leaf litter input in a wet heath ecosystem in northern Sweden, representative of a large proportion of the tundra landscape. We found that leaf litter addition significantly increases CH4 uptake rates due to a pronounced soil drying effect, which is intensified in combination with warming. Warming enhances CO2 release, while CH4 uptake is controlled by soil moisture. The study demonstrates the sensitivity and capacity of a wet heath ecosystem to function as a net CH4 sink. However, it was also shown that higher summer temperatures might shift the ecosystem toward a net carbon source due to an increase in CO2 release, thereby enhancing the greenhouse effect.

AB  - Globally, environmental and social change in water-scarce regions challenge the sustainability of social-ecological systems. WaterSES, a sponsored working group within the Program for Ecosystem Change and Society, explores and compares the social-ecological dynamics related to water scarcity across placed-based international research sites with contrasting local and regional water needs and governance, including research sites in Spain and Sweden in Europe, South Africa, China, and Alabama, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Texas in the USA. This paper aims to provide a commentary on insights into conducting future solutions-oriented research on water scarcity based on the understanding of the social-ecological dynamics of water scarce regions.

AB  - Densification of cities is presently one of the dominating strategies for urbanization globally. However, how densification of cities is linked to processes in the peri-urban landscapes is rather unknown. The aim of this paper is to highlight the potentials in of peri-urban landscapes to be recognized as complementary providers of urban ecosystem services when green areas in cities are reduced by densification. We suggest that the way forward is to change the perceptions of peri-urban areas from being defined as located between cities and rural areas with a specific population density or a geographical distance, to become recognized as a landscape defined by its functionality. By identifying and describing the functionality in peri-urban landscapes the existing governance gaps can be recognized and thus dealt with through adaptation of existing planning tools. Although not yet articulated, peri-urban areas should be used to facilitate integration of top down and bottom up approaches and thereby closing the governance gaps. We illustrate this reasoning by two examples; one of the establishment of green wedges in Stockholm, Sweden, and the other with the establishments of international Model forests. We conclude that further densification of cities will create a lack of ecosystem services in cities by putting an even higher pressure on the peri-urban landscape and not as suggested today that densification lower pressure on peri-urban landscapes. Rethinking and reframing the peri-urban areas by adapting existing platforms will potentially contribute to a more nuanced discussion on strategies for urban development generally.

AB  - Although a circular economy promotes economic and environmental benefits, knowledge gaps remain surrounding the application of these concepts to food systems. A better understanding of the connection between different flows of biomass and energy at different spatial scales is needed to facilitate effective transitions towards circular bioeconomies. This study provides a framework for assessing the circularity of food systems, which we exemplify by identifying key steps towards circularity for three contrasting farming regions in Finland. For each of the regions, we quantified the flows of biomass, nutrients and energy. We found large differences in circularity, depending on the chosen indicator. Most biomass and nutrient flows were related to livestock production, which implies that it plays a key role in circular food systems. Current livestock production was found to be connected to national and global food systems through the international feed trade. This trade generates imbalanced nutrient flows between regions and countries, resulting in excess accumulations of nutrients in regions with net imports. In terms of circularity in energy systems, we found that substantial amounts of energy could be produced from manure and plant-based biomasses without causing food-fuel competition in land use. We also observed that, the inclusion of human excreta would further improve recycling but this was significant only in the region with a high population density. Thus, in his study, we propose a concept of nested circularity in which nutrient, biomass and energy cycles are connected and closed across multiple spatial scales.

AB  - Norwegian wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus are divided into 23 virtually isolated populations, primarily due to the abandonment of traditional migration and movement corridors caused by the development of infrastructures. By conducting a nation-wide, interdisciplinary pre-post study on a temporal scale spanning centuries, we modelled current reindeer movements with respect to archaeological findings to quantify long-term changes in area use related to anthropogenic disturbance. The location of 3,113 pitfall traps and hunting blinds, built 600-2000 years ago and used until 350-400 years ago, testified the location of traditional movement corridors. Current movement routes were delineated using Brownian Bridge Movement Models based on 147 reindeer GPS-monitored during 10 years. Using Path Analysis we quantified direct, indirect and total effects of different infrastructures within multiple scales (1, 5, and 10 km-radius buffers) on the current probability of use of ancient movement corridors. Tourist cabins and roads had the strongest long-term direct effects at most scales: 1 tourist cabin and 1 km road within a 1 km-radius buffer would lead, respectively, to complete area abandonment, and to a 46 % decrease in the probability of use. Power lines and private cabins had significant indirect effects on area use through their effect on roads, while hiking trails and, in particular, hydroelectric dams had highly variable effects, not significant at a nation-wide scale. Finally, we provide a flexible tool to estimate the potential long-term direct and cumulative effects of different types of infrastructures at the desired spatial scale to be used for the development of future sustainable land management plans.

AB  - Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) can provide many needed ecosystem services (ES) to help address challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change while contributing to the health and wellbeing of urban inhabitants. In order to optimize UGI for a given city, a first step is to assess the local ES needs and the potential barriers to ES provision. However, it is not known how consistent these needs and barriers are among cities in different settings. To help address this knowledge gap, the aim of this study was to assess ES priorities and existing barriers to ES provision for three cities varying in socioeconomic, cultural and climatic setting: Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Cincinnati (USA) and Malmo (Sweden). In case studies of each of the three cities, we carried out workshops with key stakeholders and collected their assessments of both current provision of ES from UGI and future priorities. The workshops were followed by expert stakeholder interviews aimed at highlighting existing barriers to ES provision. In spite of the different urban contexts, expressed ES priorities were similar among the cities, with the highest cross-cutting priorities being climate change adaptation, stormwater runoff management and water quality, mental and physical health, biodiversity, and provision of local food. Stakeholder-expressed barriers to ES provision were also broadly similar among cities, falling into three main categories: structural pressures, gaps in governance, and lack of ecological awareness and vision. Our results suggest that certain key ES priorities and barriers may apply broadly to cities regardless of climatic or socio-cultural context. These generic needs can help direct the focus of future studies, and imply a clear benefit to international, even cross-continental study and knowledge-exchange among practitioners and researchers working with UGI.

AB  - To improve communication between reindeer-herders and other land users, we developed and implemented a system to produce reindeer husbandry plans together with Sami reindeer-herding communities. A central component of our communications strategy was the introduction and use of a participatory GIS (pGIS). We evaluated the potential and limitations of pGIS as a tool for collaborative learning. We concluded that by merging traditional and scientific knowledge in a pGIS, the process of spatial communication has contributed to a more inclusive planning process, and to improved knowledge-sharing. Furthermore, the process has contributed to a more efficient long-term perspective where land use planning focuses on key areas but with solutions applied to the landscape. The Model Forest offered an appropriate platform to facilitate the process.

AB  - The oribatid mite assemblages found in late-glacial and early-Holocene sediments in Krakenes Lake, western Norway, consist of 38 species within 24 genera. In accordance with known present habitat distribution we distinguish 4 true aquatic species, 6 species associated with wetland, 2 with mesic grassland, 12 with dry grassland and heathland, 3 with saxicolous and arboricolous lichens, 7 widely distributed species, and 4 with uncertainly known habitat preferences. The sediments from the pioneer phase (12,300-11,700 C-14 BP) contain 7 species, among them the 2 typical pioneer species Limnozetes ciliatus and Tectocepheus velatus.
   The sediments of the warmer Allerod interstadial (11,700-10,900 BP) contain 18 species, the cold Younger Dryas (10,900-10,000 BP) 9 species, and the early Holocene (10,000-9,000 BP) 36 species.
   The oribatid fossils of the pioneer phase indicate habitats and climate similar to the mid-alpine zone in western Norway today, the Allerod interstadial that of the low- to mid-alpine zone. L. ciliatus is the aquatic pioneer species in the Allerod. In the Younger Dryas the climate was more arctic, 60-70% of the species had presumably disappeared, and no aquatic species were found. In the early Holocene, 4 true aquatic species colonised the lake and showed a high productivity. The terrestrial oribatid fauna in this period contained a high diversity of more boreal species, while the alpine species declined or became extinct.

AB  - Cities are experiencing numerous challenges, adversely affecting human health and wellbeing. Urban green space provides ecosystem services that are important to meet urban challenges. One type of urban green space is private gardens (yards) that make up an essential part of many urban areas. Gardens can support urban biodiversity and provide cultural ecosystem services (CES) to its owner. However, the provision of garden benefits depends on garden size, design and management. This study aims to explore private gardens contribution to urban biodiversity and garden owners' wellbeing (in terms of CES), and to understand the influence of urban planning and garden design and management. We use a conceptual framework to illustrate complexities and interlinkages: the garden 'human-nature' nexus. The study is based on a garden land-use inventory and interviews with 35 garden owners in Lund, Sweden. Results show that urban development influence garden's biodiversity potential by limiting available space or garden vegetation. New properties were mainly covered by buildings and paved surfaces and their small gardens contained few biodiversity features and large trees. Garden owners used multiple information channels to gain inspiration and knowledge, and aesthetic and edibility are important plant qualities governing garden plant choice. Many garden owners experienced gardens problems that influence design and management. The most important garden CES were social bonds, recreation, nature experiences and relaxation. Age and gender influence both garden CES and garden design and management. We conclude that private gardens have a potential to function as multifunctional spaces, but to harness their full potential there is a need to transform how we plan, develop, manage and not at least recognize private green space. We argue that the garden 'human-nature' nexus can help to illustrate the important interlinkages existing between e.g. urban planning, biodiversity and garden ES, and to foster sustainable urban green space governance.

AB  - Global efforts to decrease dependence on fossil fuels have increased interest in bioenergy production. One source of bioenergy is fast growing deciduous tree species, such as hybrid aspen (Populus x wettsteinii Hamet-Ahti). The majority of research on hybrid aspen which assesses biodiversity implications, has however primarily focused on agricultural lands as the reference condition. This has resulted in a substantial gap in our knowledge regarding the biodiversity implications of replacing production forest types with hybrid aspen, a form of reforestation taking place in northern Europe. In this study we address this knowledge gap by comparing the avian biodiversity of young hybrid aspen and spruce (Picea abies L.) plantations of similar age, the latter being the most prevalent forestry alternative in in southern Sweden. We found that hybrid aspen stands had higher bird species richness and abundance as well as a distinct community composition compared to the spruce stands. We suggest that the most likely driver was the greater structural and tree species complexity in the aspen stands, provided for by the fenced exclusion of ungulates from the regenerating hybrid aspen stands. Our results indicate that at least during early stages of regeneration, and in comparison to the dominating production forest type in the region, hybrid aspen stands can support relatively high levels of bird diversity, and a bird species composition more closely associated with broadleaf habitat types requiring restoration in this region.

AB  - Climate in the Arctic has warmed at a more rapid pace than the global average over the past few decades leading to weather, snow, and ice situations previously unencountered. Reindeer herding is one of the primary livelihoods for Indigenous peoples throughout the Arctic. To understand how the new climate state forces societal adaptation, including new management strategies and needs for preserved, interconnected, undisturbed grazing areas, we coupled changes in temperature, precipitation, and snow depth recorded by automatic weather stations to herder observations of reindeer behaviour in grazing areas of the Laevas Sami reindeer herding community, northern Sweden. Results show that weather and snow conditions strongly determine grazing opportunities and therefore reindeer response. We conclude that together with the cumulative effects of increased pressures from alternative land use activities, the non-predictable environmental conditions that are uniquely part of the warming climate seriously challenge future reindeer herding in northern Sweden.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewClimate change poses a threat to European forests and threatens their capacity to deliver ecosystem services. Innovation is often considered critical to increasing resilience in wood-based value chains. However, the knowledge about types of innovation processes and how they enhance resilience, if at all, is largely dispersed. In this conceptual paper, we refer to examples from the forestry, bioeconomy, adaptation, and innovation literature to develop an overview of innovation pathways along the wood value chain. Thereafter, we evaluate the extent to which they enhance or compromise resilience to climate change and how they do so.Recent FindingsWe differentiate between forest and value chain resilience and assume that innovation positively influences both types of resilience via three resilience drivers: diversifying the product portfolio, making operations more efficient, or making the processes more flexible. Our literature review revealed nine innovation pathways along the value chain.The pathways rarely connect forest management and the processing industry. Consequently, a mismatch was identified between the innovation pathways and resilience drivers applied to increase diversification at the beginning of the value chain (in forest management) and those applied to increase efficiency towards the end of the value chain (in the processing industry). Considering this mismatch, we stress that it is critical to reconsider the term innovation as a silver bullet and to increase the awareness of resilience drivers and innovation pathways, as well as reconsider ways to combine them optimally. We recommend engaging in open innovation activities to cooperatively draft innovation strategies across the entire wood value chain and intercept pathways by making processes more flexible.

AB  - The ecotone, the spatial transition zone between two vegetation communities, is claimed to have more species than the adjoining communities. However, empirical studies do not always confirm higher richness at the ecotone. The ecotone position and structure are dynamic over time and space and it is driven by the changes in climate, land use or their interaction. In this context, we assessed the forest-grassland ecotone of temperate mountains in central Nepal by i) comparing species composition and richness across the ecotone, ii) analyzing if the forest-grassland ecotone is shifting towards the grassland center by colonizing them with trees, and iii) discussing the consequence of changed disturbance regime in the dynamics of this ecotone and the surrounding grasslands. We analyzed vegetation data sampled from belt transects laid across the forest-grassland ecotone in semi-natural grassland patches. Vegetation data consisting of species richness and composition, and size structure and regeneration of the two most dominant tree species, namely Rhododendron arboreum and Abies spectabilis, from the transects, were used to analyze the trend of the forest-grassland ecotone. Forest and grasslands were different in terms of floristic composition and diversity. Vascular plant species richness linearly increased while moving from forest interior to grassland center. Spatial pattern of tree size structure and regeneration infers that forest boundary is advancing towards the grasslands at the expense of the grassland area, and tree establishment in the grasslands is part of a successional process. Temporally, tree establishment in grasslands started following the gradual decline in disturbance. We argue that local processes in terms of changed land use may best explain the phenomenon of ecotone shift and consequent forest expansion in these grasslands. We underpin the need for further research on the mechanism, rate and spatial extent of ecotone shift by using advanced tools to understand the process indepth.

AB  - Forest owners and Indigenous Sami reindeer herders use the same land in northern Sweden for commercial forestry and winter grazing, respectively. Fire management has been controlled by foresters since the late-19th century, and Sami herders have had to deal with the effects of both fire suppression and prescribed burning. However, the environmental history of fire management and reindeer herding in Sweden has never been thoroughly investigated. We therefore analyzed written archives in order to understand how reindeer herding was considered in planned burning during the mid-20th century, and how the effects of prescribed burning on reindeer herding were interpreted by foresters. We supplemented the interpretation of written sources by including local Sami reindeer herders' insights about prescribed burning. Written records show that reindeer herding was increasingly integrated into the planning process during the 20th century, yet foresters failed to include important aspects of reindeer herding in their interpretation of the effects of prescribed burning. The Sami consider the effects of burning in terms of fodder availability, opportunities for reindeer to graze the fodder, and any impact on the reindeer's movement patterns and thus herd management. The Sami's historical perspective is essential in order to reconstruct a comprehensive picture of the past, and adapt forestry measures effectively in the future.

AB  - Treelines differentiate vastly contrasting ecosystems: open tundra from closed forest. Treeline advance has implications for the climate system due to the impact of the transition from tundra to forest ecosystem on carbon (C) storage and albedo. Treeline advance has been seen to increase above-ground C stocks as low vegetation is replaced with trees but decrease organic soil C stocks as old carbon is decomposed. However, studies comparing across the treeline typically do not account for elevational variation within the ecotone. Here we sample ecosystem C stocks along an elevational gradient (970 to 1300 m), incorporating a large-scale and long-term livestock grazing experiment, in the southern Norwegian mountains. We investigate whether there are continuous or discontinuous changes in C storage across the treeline ecotone, and whether these are modulated by grazing. We find that vegetation C stock decreases with elevation, with a clear breakpoint between the forest line and treeline above which the vegetation C stock is constant. C stocks in organic surface horizons of the soil were higher above the treeline than in the forest, whereas C stocks in mineral soil horizons are unrelated to elevation. Total ecosystem C stocks also showed a discontinuous elevational pattern, increasing with elevation above the treeline (8 gm 2 per metre increase in elevation), but decreasing with elevation below the forest line (15 gm 2 per metre increase in elevation), such that ecosystem C storage reaches a minimum between the forest line and treeline. We did not find any effect of short-term (12 years) grazing on the elevational patterns. Our findings demonstrate that patterns of C storage across the treeline are complex, and should be taken account of when estimating ecosystem C storage with shifting treelines.

AB  - Wetlands used as cost-effective nature-based solutions provide environmental and socio-economic benefits to people locally and regionally. With significant loss of wetland areas due to expansion of forest, agriculture, and energy production industries, some countries, including Sweden, have begun providing economic support for environmental objectives for wetland conservation and restoration. Targeting such objectives and setting up relevant plans can decrease the risk of losing valuable wetland-related benefits and help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Different ranges of wetland ecosystem services are broadly addressed by the SDGs, however, target-based assessments are required to better understand wetland functionality for sustainable development. This study investigates whether and how wetland ecosystems at local and regional scales can contribute to achieving the SDGs and their targets in Sweden. Scientific literature, policy documents, and international reports on Swedish wetland ecosystems are scrutinized to exemplify the SDGs and their targets, applying a scoring framework based on their interactions. This reveals that, overall, Swedish wetland ecosystems and implemented management plans can positively interact with 10 SDGs and 17 targets at different levels. The analysis also highlights synergies that need to be considered for integrated environmental governance and enhanced policy coherence for Swedish wetland management.

AB  - The productive performance of large ungulates in extensive pastoral grazing systems is modulated simultaneously by the effects of climate change and human intervention independent of climate change. The latter includes the expansion of private, civil and military activity and infrastructure and the erosion of land rights. We used Saami reindeer husbandry in Norway as a model in which to examine trends in, and to compare the influence of, both effects on a pastoral grazing system. Downscaled projections of mean annual temperature over the principal winter pasture area (Finnmarksvidda) closely matched empirical observations across 34 years to 2018. The area, therefore, is not only warming but seems likely to continue to do so. Warming notwithstanding, 50-year (1969-2018) records of local weather (temperature, precipitation and characteristics of the snowpack) demonstrate considerable annual and decadal variation which also seems likely to continue and alternately to amplify and to counter net warming. Warming, moreover, has both positive and negative effects on ecosystem services that influence reindeer. The effects of climate change on reindeer pastoralism are evidently neither temporally nor spatially uniform, nor indeed is the role of climate change as a driver of change in pastoralism even clear. The effects of human intervention on the system, by contrast, are clear and largely negative. Gradual liberalization of grazing rights from the 18th Century has been countered by extensive loss of reindeer pasture. Access to similar to 50% of traditional winter pasture was lost in the 19th Century owing to the closure of international borders to the passage of herders and their reindeer. Subsequent to this the area of undisturbed pasture within Norway has decreased by 71%. Loss of pasture due to piecemeal development of infrastructure and to administrative encroachment that erodes herders' freedom of action on the land that remains to them, are the principal threats to reindeer husbandry in Norway today. These tangible effects far exceed the putative effects of current climate change on the system. The situation confronting Saami reindeer pastoralism is not unique: loss of pasture and administrative, economic, legal and social constraints bedevil extensive pastoral grazing systems across the globe.

AB  - The swimming ability of shrimp is important for their survival and growth, which directly affects their avoidance of enemies and uncomfortable environment, search and capture of food, reproductive behavior, and distribution. The knowledge concerning the swimming ability of shrimp can be widely used in the conservation of fishery resources, improving capture efficiency and stock enhancement. As one of the edible marine organisms, Litopenaeus vannamei is a traditional fishery resource and an important economic aquaculture species in China. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and salinity are considered to play crucial roles in the swimming ability of L. vannamei. The tail-flip speed (S-tf) of whiteleg shrimp L. vannamei (79.90 +/- 0.41 mm, 5.76 +/- 0.10 g) that were exposed to various salinities (20 parts per thousand, 25 parts per thousand, 30 parts per thousand, 35 parts per thousand, and 40 parts per thousand) and DO concentrations (1.9, 3.8, 6.8, and 13.6 mg/L) was determined under laboratory conditions. Metabolite concentrations in the hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and abdominal muscles were measured before and after tail-flip fatigue to evaluate the physiologic effects of fatigue in L. vannamei. The results showed that salinity and DO significantly affected the S-tf of L. vannamei. The S-tf increased and subsequently decreased with the increase in salinity from 20 parts per thousand to 40 parts per thousand. The relationship between S-tf and salinity (s, parts per thousand) can be expressed by the quadratic model as S-tf = -0.2386s(2) + 15.528s - 145.12, R-2 = 0.9693. The optimum salinity and corresponding maximum S-tf were 32.54 parts per thousand and 107.52 cm/s, respectively. The S-tf increased as the DO concentration increased from 1.9 mg/L to 13.6 mg/L. The relationship between S-tf and DO (mg/L) can be expressed by the power model as S-tf = 75.621 DO0.1753, R-2 = 0.9981. The different salinities and DO concentrations directly affected the physiology of the shrimp, inducing changes in hepatopancreas total protein, plasma total protein, abdominal muscle lactate, plasma lactate, plasma glucose, hepatopancreas glycogen, and abdominal muscle glycogen concentration. Fatigue from tail-flip led to severe loss of hepatopancreas glycogen under 20 parts per thousand salinity and plasma glucose under 25 parts per thousand, 30 parts per thousand, and 35 parts per thousand salinity. The triglyceride and lactate in the plasma concentration increased significantly in a range of salinities. In the DO concentration experiment, fatigue from tail-flip led to a severe loss of plasma glucose under 1.9 mg/L and 3.8 mg/L DO concentrations. The plasma lactate concentration increased significantly in all DO groups. The results suggested that the inappropriate salinity and DO significantly limited the tail-flip speed of shrimp, which was due to the accumulation of metabolites. The proper salinity and DO accelerated the elimination of metabolites, reduced the energy consumption of shrimp, and thus, improved the exercise ability of shrimp. This conclusion is of particular value in evaluating the swimming ability of shrimp and understanding its ecological processes to improve capture and rearing techniques.

AB  - Trees are believed to improve air quality, thus providing an important ecosystem service for urban inhabitants. However, empirical evidence on the beneficial effects of urban vegetation on air quality at the local level and in boreal climatic regions is scarce. We studied the influence of greenbelt-type forest patches on NO2 levels (i) in front of, (ii) inside and (iii) behind greenbelts next to major roads in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, during summer and winter using passive collectors. Concentrations of NO2 were significantly higher in front of greenbelts compared to road sides without greenbelts. The more trees there were inside greenbelts the higher the NO2 level in front of greenbelts, likely due to the formation of a recirculation zone of air flow in front of greenbelts. Similarly, NO2 levels were higher inside greenbelts than in open areas without them, likely due to reduced air flow inside greenbelts. NO2 levels behind greenbelts were similar to those detected at the same distance from the road but without greenbelts. Our results suggest that, regardless of season, roadside greenbelts of mostly broadleaf trees do not reduce NO2 levels in near-road environments, but can result in higher NO2 levels in front of and inside greenbelts.

AB  - Peat mosses (Sphagnum) largely govern carbon sequestration in Northern Hemisphere peatlands. We investigated functional traits related to growth and decomposition in Sphagnum species. We tested the importance of environment and phylogeny in driving species traits and investigated trade-offs among them. We selected 15 globally important Sphagnum species, representing four sections (subgenera) and a range of peatland habitats. We measured rates of photosynthesis and decomposition in standard laboratory conditions as measures of innate growth and decay potential, and related this to realized growth, production, and decomposition in their natural habitats. In general, we found support for a trade-off between measures of growth and decomposition. However, the relationships are not strong, with r ranging between 0.24 and 0.45 for different measures of growth versus decomposition. Using photosynthetic rate to predict decomposition in standard conditions yielded R-2 = 0.20. Habitat and section (phylogeny) affected the traits and the trade-offs. In a wet year, species from sections Cuspidata and Sphagnum had the highest production, but in a dry year, differences among species, sections, and habitats evened out. Cuspidata species in general produced easily decomposable litter, but their decay in the field was hampered, probably due to near-surface anoxia in their wet habitats. In a principal components analysis, PCA, photosynthetic capacity, production, and laboratory decomposition acted in the same direction. The species were imperfectly clustered according to vegetation type and phylogeny, so that some species clustered with others in the same section, whereas others clustered more clearly with others from similar vegetation types. Our study includes a wider range of species and habitats than previous trait analyses in Sphagnum and shows that while the previously described growth-decay trade-off exists, it is far from perfect. We therefore suggest that our species-specific trait measures offer opportunities for improvements of peatland ecosystem models. Innate qualities measured in laboratory conditions translate differently to field responses. Most dramatically, fast-growing species could only realize their potential in a wet year. The same species decompose fast in laboratory, but their decomposition was more retarded in the field than that of other species. These relationships are crucial for understanding the long-term dynamics of peatland communities.

AB  - Chemical eradication of non-native species has become a widely used method to mitigate the potential negative impacts of altered competitive or predatory dynamics on biodiversity and natural ecosystem processes. However, the responses of non-target species can vary from rapid full recovery to delayed or absent recolonization, and little is known about the potential shifts in resource use and trophic diversity of native species following chemical treatments. We used a before-after-control-impact approach to study the effects of rotenone piscicide treatment on abundance and trophic niche of benthic invertebrates in three untreated and three treated lakes in central Norway, the latter group hosting non-native roach (Rutilus rutilus) and pike (Esox lucius) prior to rotenone treatment. Based on community composition data, the relative abundance of invertebrate grazers and collectors decreased while that of predators increased following fish removal in the treated lakes. The stable isotope data indicated minor shifts in resource use of, and trophic diversity among, benthic invertebrate communities. While the predatory dragonfly larvae (Odonata) and grazer snails (Lymnaeidae) showed increased delta C-13 values indicating increased reliance on littoral benthic algae, the collector mayfly larvae (Leptophlebia) showed decreased delta C-13 values following fish removal in treated lakes. Grazer snails also showed a shift to a lower trophic position, while the predatory dragonflies and collector mayflies showed no changes in delta N-15 values following fish removal. The community-level isotopic niches of benthic invertebrates showed no consistent changes, although the sample-size corrected and Bayesian estimates of standard ellipse areas (SEA(C) and SEA(B)) slightly increased in two of the three treated lakes due to an increased range in delta N-15. In conclusion, our study findings indicate some changes in species assemblages but minor shifts in the resource use and trophic diversity of benthic invertebrate communities following fish removal in rotenone treated lakes.

AB  - Differential survival up to harvest was evaluated for 73 communally reared families of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Progeny from known family crosses were produced and mixed as fertilized eggs (2-3 families per incubator), newly hatched larvae, or as similar to 7 g juveniles to evaluate differences in contribution among families based on stage of mixing. All progeny were stocked into a single sea cage. Progeny were harvested and fin tissue collected at 991-1037 days post-fertilization (n = 2001). A multiplex of six microsatellite markers was used to genotype broodstock and progeny for parentage assignment using PROBMAX. Of the progeny assigned (n=1996), only 34 were from 10 of the 27 families mixed as fertilized eggs. In contrast, all families mixed as hatched larvae or as similar to 7 g juveniles were represented (536 progeny from 11 of 11 families; 1426 progeny from 35 of 35 families, respectively). The differences in family survival were affected by sire and stage of mixing. The results indicate progeny should be combined as larvae or juveniles to reduce loss of genetic diversity in communally reared populations. Heritabilities for total body, carcass and fillet weight at time of harvest were >= 0.35 and suggest that the developing Canadian Atlantic cod aquaculture industry should benefit from genetic improvement of these traits. However, gonad weight was less heritable (0.11), indicating that sexual maturation will respond less favorably to traditional selective breeding methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies based on fossil pollen data have reported significant changes in vegetation on the alpine Tibetan Plateau during the Holocene. However, since the relative proportions of fossil pollen taxa are largely influenced by individual pollen productivities and the dispersal characteristics, such inferences on vegetation have the potential to be considerably biased. We therefore examined the modern pollen-vegetation relationships for four common pollen species on the Tibetan Plateau, using Extended R-value (ERV) models. Assuming an average radius of 100 m for the sampled lakes, we estimated the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) to be 2200 m (which represents the distance from the lake). Using Poaceae as the reference taxa (Pollen Productivity Estimate, PPE = 1), ERV Submodel 2 derived relative high PPEs for the steppe and desert taxa: 2.079 +/- 0.432 for Artemisia and 5.379 +/- 1.077 for Chenopodiaceae. Low PPEs were estimated for the Cyperaceae (1.036 +/- 0.012). whose plants are characteristic of the alpine Kobresia meadows. Applying these PPEs to four fossil pollen sequences since the Late Glacial, the plant abundances on the central and north-eastern Tibetan Plateau were quantified using the "Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites" (REVEALS) model. The proportions of Artemisia and Chenopodiaceae were greatly reduced compared to their original pollen percentages in the reconstructed vegetation, owing to their high productivities and their dispersal characteristics, while Cyperaceae showed a relative increase in the vegetation reconstruction. The reconstructed vegetation assemblages of the four pollen sequence sites always yielded smaller compositional species turnovers than suggested by the pollen spectra, as revealed by Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analyses (DCCA) of the Holocene sections. The strength of the previously reported vegetation changes may therefore have been overestimated, which indicates the importance of taking into account pollen-vegetation relationships when discussing the potential drivers (such as climate, land use, atmospheric CO(2) concentrations) and implications (such as for land surface-climate feedbacks, carbon storage, and biodiversity) of vegetation change.

AB  - Disturbances play a major role in shaping forest structure and composition. However, the effects of disturbances on forest ecosystems in central Europe are poorly understood, despite the importance of this information for forest management (e.g., for managing recent, large-scale, high-severity disturbances in the region). Using the tree-ring approach, this work investigates the past development, disturbance history and historical range of variability of the old mountain Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest stand in the high elevation Bohemian Forest (Protected Landscape Area Sumava) in the Czech Republic.
   The goals of the study were threefold: (1) to reconstruct the historical disturbances of the forest, (2) to describe the recruitment strategy of trees in response to disturbance, and (3) to describe the subsequent development of trees by their growth trends.
   We cored all stems within three 0.25 ha plots. The growth series were surveyed for events indicative of past tree mortality: (1) abrupt, sustained and rapid increases in growth (releases from suppression) and (2) rapid early growth rates (gap origins). We then conducted a cluster analysis of individual growth trends by fitting splines to the power-transformed and age-filtered (RCS-method) tree ring series.
   High-severity disturbances were identified in the 1820s and 1860s. Less severe disturbances also occurred every 10-50 years. The disturbances were synchronised among plots and consistent with data from distant locations in the Bohemian Forest. Most disturbances were explained by known historical windstorms; some by bark beetle outbreaks. Most trees regenerated shortly before or after disturbance and exhibited evidence of 1-3 disturbance events in their growth chronologies. A smaller proportion of trees was suppressed before disturbance for more than 10 years. The cluster analysis of growth trends revealed five types of tree behaviour classified according to their growth rate during (1) stand initiation and (2) later development.
   We conclude that disturbances (including large, high-severity and low-frequency disturbances) contribute to the broad range of variability of central European mountain spruce forests. Sustainable management strategies should therefore incorporate described disturbances and their biological legacies, as many species likely depend on them. In addition, the development trajectory of stands following stand-replacing disturbance, as described here, can be used to predict future development of presently disturbed stands.

AB  - Simple Summary Native wild boar populations are expanding across Europe, causing concern due to their significant soil disturbances and considerable impact on ecosystems. However, little is known about how wild boar activities affect other organisms. This study investigated the effects of wild boars on the abundance of fungal sporocarps and their respective fungal guilds (i.e., symbiotic, saprophytic and pathogenic) in boreal forests in Sweden. We selected 11 forested sites in central Sweden: six with and five without the presence of wild boar. We determined the presence or absence of wild boar and rooting intensity at each site. Simultaneously, we investigated the abundance of fungal sporocarps and their fungal guilds. We found that the presence of wild boar and rooting intensity were associated with the abundance of fungal sporocarps. Wild boar rooting was positively correlated with saprotrophic fungi and negatively with symbiotic fungi. Pathogenic fungi were more abundant in plots with no rooting but in the presence of wild boar. We conclude that wild boar represents a recurrent disturbance agent and, based on sporocarp abundance, could eventually affect entire fungal populations. Native wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are expanding across Europe. This is cause for concern in some areas where overabundant populations impact natural ecosystems and adjacent agronomic systems. To better manage the potential for impacts, managers require more information about how the species may affect other organisms. For example, information regarding the effect of wild boar on soil fungi for management application is lacking. Soil fungi play a fundamental role in ecosystems, driving essential ecological functions; acting as mycorrhizal symbionts, sustaining plant nutrition and providing defense; as saprotrophs, regulating the organic matter decomposition; or as plant pathogens, regulating plant fitness and survival. During autumn (Sep-Nov) 2018, we investigated the effects of wild boar (presence/absence and rooting intensity) on the abundance (number of individuals) of fungal sporocarps and their functional guilds (symbiotic, saprotrophic and pathogenic). We selected eleven forested sites (400-500 x 150-200 m) in central Sweden; six with and five without the presence of wild boar. Within each forest, we selected one transect (200 m long), and five plots (2 x 2 m each) for sites without wild boar, and ten plots for sites with boars (five within and five outside wild boar disturbances), to determine the relationship between the intensity of rooting and the abundance of sporocarps for three fungal guilds. We found that the presence of wild boar and rooting intensity were associated with the abundance of sporocarps. Interestingly, this relationship varied depending on the fungal guild analyzed, where wild boar rooting had a positive correlation with saprophytic sporocarps and a negative correlation with symbiotic sporocarps. Pathogenic fungi, in turn, were more abundant in undisturbed plots (no rooting) but located in areas with the presence of wild boar. Our results indicate that wild boar activities can potentially regulate the abundance of fungal sporocarps, with different impacts on fungal guilds. Therefore, wild boar can affect many essential ecosystem functions driven by soil fungi in boreal forests, such as positive effects on energy rotation and in creating mineral availability to plants, which could lead to increased diversity of plants in boreal forests.

AB  - Forests produce several types of benefits to both forest landowners and society. The social benefit of private forestry is equal to private benefit plus positive externalities minus negative externalities. This study developed alternative metrics for the evaluation of the social benefit of forest management. Forest management was assessed in terms of five criteria: economic, socio-cultural, environmental and ecological performance and the resilience of the forest ecosystem. Each criterion was described with three numerical indicators. Alternative performance indices were calculated from the indicator values using methods developed for multi-criteria decision making. It was concluded that indices based on the multiplicative Cobb-Douglas utility function might be the most recommendable when forestry should produce a balanced combination of different ecosystem services. When the indices were used to compare alternative silvicultural systems in terms of their social performance, continuous cover management was ranked better than even-aged management. The performance of even-aged management improved when it aimed at increasing the share of mixed stands and broadleaf species. Maximizing net present value (NPV) with a 1% discount rate led to better social performance than maximizing NPV with a 4% discount rate.

AB  - Adoption of a new land-use governance system requires acceptance from involved actors. We present a payments for ecosystem services (PES) design process with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) based evaluation of alternatives within a nature-based tourism area in northern Finland. The tourism activities are located on private lands, which are mainly managed for timber production, negatively affecting landscape and recreational values. Earlier attempts have not catalysed the required action among local actors. To increase the practical operability of the suggested PES an MCA process was organised with stakeholders. Alternative PES systems, meeting the demands of local conditions also in the future, were evaluated against good governance criteria in future scenarios. Then, SWOT analysis was carried out for the preferred alternative to reveal supporting and hindering factors for the uptake of the suggested system. The alternative that is obligatory for visitors to the area was preferred among stakeholders representing foresters and tourism entrepreneurs due to its cost-efficiency and funding base. Its implementation would still require a practically adoptable definition of the PES scheme and new co-management arrangements among the actors operating in the area.

AB  - Global seaweed production increased rapidly in the past 50 years, mostly in Asia. Recently seaweed aquaculture has been attracting more attention worldwide because of its potential as a form of sustainable agriculture that provides food, feed, fertiliser, bio-stimulants and other valuable products. Quality characteristics of seaweeds are species-dependent, influenced by the genetic makeup of the individual, and by the environmental conditions where the seaweeds are grown. Those two factors largely depend on their place of origin. Traceability in terms of geographic provenance would therefore add commercial value to seaweed products. Here we describe the development of a method to identify/certify the place of origin of the blown alga Alaria esculenta. We identified Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on the nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genomes by analysing whole-genome sequences of individuals originated from Ireland, Northern Ireland, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Norway and Atlantic Canada. Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots of the nuclear SNPs, but not of the organellar SNPs, showed a clear separation of individual samples by the country of origin. We then identified country-specific nuclear SNPs and designed a set of cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) assays to detect two or three of specific SNPs per country. The SNPs were tested on individuals, including those whose genome sequence had not been determined, and were shown to successfully identify individual's country of origin. This method allows accurate determination of the geographic provenance of Alaria esculenta. This tool could form the base for branding seaweed products with certified origin, and for the development of mass identification kits using metabarcoding. It also has the potential to be used to monitor seaweed farms for invasion of non-native varieties of a seaweed species, and, more broadly, to monitor effects of climate change on the diversity of seaweed populations.

AB  - Prior research has examined the relationship between physical landscapes and ecosystem services, but the distribution of ecosystem services by land tenure and protected areas is less developed. We analyze the spatial distribution of participatory mapped ecosystem values, as indicators of ecosystem services, to determine their relationship with land tenure in southern Norway, a region characterized by private, village, and state commons lands overlaid with designated protected areas managed by local governments. We found land tenure to be a significantly stronger predictor of the distribution of ecosystem values and land use preferences than protected area status. Protected area designations layered on older land tenures exert relatively little influence on how Norwegians perceive ecosystem values and land use preferences. The exception is a few iconic parks located on state commons where participants mapped a higher proportion of biological diversity and undisturbed, natural qualities. Hunting and fishing opportunities were especially important in village commons, whereas social interactions, gathering, and cultural identity clustered near settlements on private lands. The cultural ecosystem values of recreation and scenery were most frequently identified, but were unrelated to both land tenure and protected areas. Cabins, tourism development, and snowmobile use were important land uses to regional residents and most controversial in the commons and protected areas, but the overall potential for land use conflict appears highest on private land. Participants mapped preferences to increase predator control across all tenures reflecting the strong interest in large game hunting and livestock grazing in the region. Overlapping tenures that were in place before the designation of protected areas are important for understanding conservation effectiveness and the potential for land use conflict.

AB  - The recovery and expansion of large carnivores have increased livestock damage in Europe, one example being the reindeer husbandry in northern Fennoscandia. Mostly free-ranging reindeer herds have been exposed to increased predation. We studied connections between the contemporary predator management approach and the consequences of predation in reindeer husbandry within the reindeer management area in Finland. National and supranational management policies aim at biodiversity conservation; predator populations with favourable conservation status play an important role in this. The metapopulation status of large carnivores has been suffering from weak connections between Finland and Scandinavia, but such connections have the potential to be improved due to increased population sizes and changes in carnivore distribution in Finland. Although the sustainability of rural livelihoods is pursued concurrent with the recovering predator populations, the increasing amount of predation-caused reindeer damage has locally compromised the economic sustainability of reindeer husbandry and well-being of herders in Finland. If co-existence is pursued in the present situation, it will require both the development of novel coping strategies by herders to prevent damage, and adaptive management of predator populations. To increase the acceptance of predator protection by local communities, it is crucial to develop more interactive predator management strategies with a concrete role of local stakeholders to address trust issues between herders, policy makers and researchers. Open discussion on the population goals for predators in the reindeer management area as well as the desired role and status of reindeer husbandry is also needed.

AB  - Forests are essential biomes for global biogeochemical cycles, and belowground microorganisms have a key role in providing relevant ecosystem services. To predict the effects of environmental changes on these ecosystem services requires a comprehensive understanding of how biotic and abiotic factors drive the composition of microbial communities in soil. However, microorganisms are not homogeneously distributed in complex environments such as soil, with different features affecting microbes at different extent depending on the niche they occupy. Indeed, this spatial heterogeneity hampers the extrapolation of microbial diversity study results from particular habitats to the ecosystem level, even if the resolution of the more recent studies has increased significantly after the standardization of high-throughput sequencing techniques. The present work intends to give a comprehensive view of the knowledge accumulated until date defining the more important drivers determining the structure of forest soil microbial communities from fine to continental scales.

AB  - We focused our attention on quantifying the factor complex of forest regeneration in 423 mature and old stands with contrasting environmental conditions. We recorded the microhabitat selection of tree recruits, the frequency of tree seedlings, and evaluated the drivers of sapling abundance and diversity. The majority of forest regeneration was established on undisturbed forest floor. Dead wood was a frequent substrate in spruce-(co)dominated forests. Seedling frequency within a stand was related to the site-type specific productivity gradient of stands-pine seedlings were common in low-productivity and spruce in high-productivity boreal forests. Seedlings of temperate broad-leaved trees dominated in productive boreonemoral forests, except for oak, which showed a uniform distribution of abundance in all forest site-types. Sapling abundance was dictated by forest site-type, and facilitated by stand diversity, variability in stand closure, lying dead wood, abundant moss, and a thick organic layer. Only in boreal forests was sapling abundance suppressed by the abundant spruce and younger trees. Upon considering the relationship between sapling abundance and species richness, sapling diversity was dependent on forest site-type, suppressed by stand density and dead wood (old gap) abundance, and facilitated by stand diversity. In addition, boreonemoral stands, competition from herbs, and facilitation by mosses occurred. The observed pattern of tree recruitment points to the importance of top-down effects of the overstory, competing or facilitating interactions with forest floor vegetation, and availability of regeneration microhabitats, which in complex make their ecology comparable with forest herbs. Natural forest regeneration can be enhanced if silvicultural methods support mixed stands and enhance field layer diversity. Oak can provide the universal tree species to improve stand structure over a wide range of habitats.

AB  - The ecosystem services (ES) concept refers to benefits that humanity receives from nature. Investigating how this concept has been embraced within urban planning is important when assessing the awareness of human dependence on natural functions and the potential for the ES concept to increase this awareness. We analyzed planning documents from three small and three large municipalities in southern Sweden to see how explicitly the ES concept was addressed and which individual services were mentioned. We found that five of the municipalities mentioned the ES concept explicitly and the remaining municipality addressed it implicitly. Comprehensive and green plans referred to the ES concept more explicitly than did plans that focused on a single issue. We used 23 individual ES as a reference; each was mentioned in at least one document, but those concerning habitat and recreation were mentioned most frequently. Individual ES were generally described at an elaborate level. No major differences were identified between large and small municipalities except that large ones mentioned more individual ES. Our study demonstrates that municipalities in southern Sweden have started to integrate the ES concept into their planning documents. However, there is great potential to increase and concretize the awareness of ES.

AB  - Evaluations of agri-environment support at the European level are still rare. We used an expert survey to examine agricultural support schemes in the EU, Norway and Switzerland in terms of the shares of the payments that compensate farmers and other recipients for the costs of providing services. Furthermore, we explored to which categories of ecosystem services the funding for agri-environment measures contributed according to the experts. For the agri-environment payments in the EU we found a mean estimate of 'percent payment for services' (PPS) of 72.3%. Expert age, type of organisation and disciplinary background systematically affected the individual estimates. Controlling the individual-level variation, the estimates differed significantly by measure objectives. Particularly high PPS estimates were found for organic fanning and conservation related measures, while integrated production and more generic extensive management options were perceived to perform less well. The mean PPS estimate for the rural development programmes was 59.6% and that for single payments 16.8%. The results suggest that expert estimates of PPS may complement the evaluation of schemes at the national or regional level in cases where complex policy objectives prevent a comprehensive evaluation based on objective measures.

AB  - Swedish arable land covers 3 Mha and its topsoil contains about 300 Mton C. The mineral soils seem to be close to steady-state, but the organic soils (about 10% of total arable land) have been estimated to lose ca. 1 Mton/year. We have devised a conceptual model (ICBMregion), using national agricultural crop yield/manuring statistics and allometric functions to calculate annual C input to the soil together with a five-parameter soil carbon model (ICBMr), calibrated using long-term field data. In Sweden, annual yield statistics are reported for different crops, for each of eight agricultural regions. Present topsoil carbon content and regional distribution of soil types have recently been measured. We use daily weather station data for each region together with crop type (bulked from individual crop data) and soil type to calculate an annual soil climate parameter for each crop/soil type permutation in each region. We use 14 soil types and 9 crop types, which gives 126 parameter sets for each year and region, each representing a fraction of the region's area. For each year, region, crop and soil type, ICBMregion calculates the change in young and old soil carbon per hectare, and sums up the changes to, e. g., national changes. With eight regions, we will have 1008 parameter sets per year, which easily can be handled, and what-if scenarios as well as comparisons between benchmark years are readily made. We will use the model to compare the soil C pools between the IPCC benchmark year 1990 and the present. In principle, we use inverse modelling from the sampled, recent soil C pools to estimate those in 1990. In the calculations, soil climate and yield for each year from 1990 onwards are taken into account. Then we can project soil C balances into the future under different scenarios, e. g., business as usual, land use change or changes in agricultural crops or cultivation practices. Projections of regional climate change are also available, so we can quite easily make projections of soil C dynamics under, e. g., different climate scenarios. We can follow the dynamic effects of carbon sequestration efforts - and estimate their efficiency. The approach is conceptually simple, fairly complete, and can easily be adapted to different needs and availability of data. However, perhaps the greatest advantage is that the results from this comprehensive approach used for, e. g., a 10-year period, can be condensed into a very simple spread-sheet model for calculating effects of management/land use changes on C stocks in agricultural soils.

AB  - We examine roles and knowledge by which researchers can enhance connections between science, policy, and society. We arranged a participatory scenario workshop with representatives from environmental administration to discuss how different land-use governance arrangements link to sustainability of reindeer herding in northern Finland. We used fast track scenarios as boundary objects that aimed to bring reindeer herders' problem definitions to be discussed with administrators. First, we performed the role of science arbiter by using our previous research with reindeer herders as the starting point for the discussions. Next, we discussed and elaborated diverse future alternatives via the role of honest broker. Finally, we were interpreted as issue advocates because the scenario exercise reduced the scope of preferable policy options for administrators. Performing these boundary-spanning roles in the same process, but each, in turn, enables researchers to offer views on sustainability via scenarios that break easily acceptable conventions.

AB  - The social-ecological change in the Arctic is accelerated by the multifaceted effects of climate change and globalization. Among other things, this means changing human-ecosystem dynamics through altered availability, co-production, and governance of ecosystem services (ES). A group of species illustrative of this change are whales, migratory species that have played an important part in the culture and subsistence of Arctic communities for millennia. This study explores the changing human-nature interactions and whale ES governance by combining ES and interactive governance theories. A multi-method approach is applied to assess qualitatively the qualitative governability of whale ES in three Arctic coastal locations: H??sav??k in Iceland, Andenes in Norway, and Disko Bay in Greenland. Based on a literature review, stakeholder mapping, observations, and analysis of 54 semi-structured stakeholder interviews, the study finds that whale ES governance involves multiple actors with differing preferences and values and that much of it happens outside of formal institutions, necessitating inclusive approaches to improve it. The study reveals some whale ES governance deficiencies and potentials, such as a mismatch between governance scales and a need for more formal governance practices based on scientific research and stakeholder inputs. Governance frameworks were present for provisioning whale ES related to whaling, but they were lacking for non-consumptive whale ES, such as whale watching. Addressing these issues can help to direct marine resource management toward sustainability by making it more inclusive, adaptive, and reflective of stakeholder needs and values. This goal could be advanced by applying the governance principles that view humans as an integral part of social-ecological systems, e.g., ecosystem stewardship and ecosystem-based management.

AB  - Adaptation of forest management to changing climate may lead to remarkable changes in tree species composition. Deciduous species are predicted to be favoured in a warmer climate, but the competitive capacity of different tree species requires detailed analysis. The main objectives of this study were to assess how varied initial proportions of tree species affected productivity in mixed stands, and to evaluate the biomass production and carbon sequestration potential of trees and soil in mixed stands in a changing climate. We used the individual-based simulation model EFIMOD combined with the model of soil organic matter dynamics ROMUL to simulate spatially explicit competition between trees for light and nutrients. We focused our simulations on the most common type of site (mesic site, Myrtillus type) in southern Finland. The average carbon and nitrogen pools in the forest floor and mineral soil were used as initial soil data. The ambient climate scenario was based on measured data (1961-2007) from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Climate change scenarios were based on runs of three general circulation models. We simulated the forest stand dynamics of two- and three-species mixtures (Silver birch, Scots pine and Norway spruce) with different initial proportions. In mixed spruce-birch stands, spruce replaced birch whatever the initial density, regardless of climatic scenario. In the beginning of the development of mixed spruce-pine stands, pine grew faster and increased its proportion of biomass by 10-20%. In pine-birch stands, the dominant species maintained its dominating position, but the proportion of pine generally declined by the end of simulation in birch-dominated stands. In mixed stands of three tree species, spruce tended to dominate by the end of a 100-year simulation period, independently of the initial proportions. The highest average carbon stock in standing biomass was observed in mixed stands with three species and in spruce-dominated stands. Climate change increased stand productivity and the increase in coniferous stands was more remarkable than in birch-dominated stands. In addition, soil was affected by species composition: increased proportions of pine resulted in increasing carbon stocks in the forest floor. Climate change negatively affected accumulation of organic matter in soil, especially in the spruce-dominated stands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pollination, pest control, and soil properties are well known to affect agricultural production. These factors might interactively shape crop yield, but most studies focus on only one of these factors at a time. We used 15 winter oilseed rape (Brass/co napus L.) fields in Sweden to study how variation among fields in pollinator visitation rates, pollen beetle attack rates and soil properties (soil texture, pH and organic carbon) interactively determined crop yield. The fields were embedded in a landscape gradient with contrasting proportions of arable and semi-natural land. In general, pollinator visitation and pest levels were negatively correlated and varied independently of soil properties. This may reflect that above- and below-ground processes react at landscape and local spatial scales, respectively. The above-ground biotic interactions and below-ground abiotic factors interactively affected crop yield. Pollinator visitation was the strongest predictor positively associated with yield. High soil pH also benefited yield, but only at tower pest loads. Surprisingly, high pest loads increased the pollinator benefits for yield. Implementing management plans at different spatial scales can create synergies among above- and below-ground ecosystem processes, hut both scales are needed given that different processes react al different sptitial scales.

AB  - To evaluate which qualities of dead wood have the highest conservational value for invertebrates, substrate requirements were recorded for all 542 saproxylic (wood-living) red-listed invertebrates in Sweden. Preferred qualities of dead trees were described for each species in seven category variables: tree species, stage of decay, type of main stem, coarseness of stem, part of tree, light preference and microhabitat. For each duality we quantified the number of red-listed insect species using it and the number that are specific to the quality. The number of species associated with different tree genera ranged from five to 202. Species-rich genera had a higher proportion of monophagous species. To what extent different tree genera have faunas complementary to each other was also analysed. As the wood decays, the host range broadens and the flora of decay fungi will probably take over as the most important factor determining the saproxylic fauna. Because there are many different types of rot required by different invertebrates, an abundance of similar looking dead trees, logs and snags are probably needed. Some 59% of the invertebrate species can live in sun-exposed sites. Most of these are favoured when the forest burns and at least 29 of them are more strongly associated with fires. For the former category, leaving dead wood on clear cuts should be an effective way to increase the amount of breeding substrate. However, some species, especially those living in the last successional stages, are dependent on shaded sites. Hollow tree trunks are another important microhabitat; 64 of the 107 species living there are specialists. To maintain all saproxylic species we need a diversity of substrate types and management methods. Our data can help to decide how to optimize the conservation measures taken during forest operations.

AB  - Aquatic systems often lack physical boundaries for gene flow, but ecological and behavioural barriers can form surprisingly fine spatial scale genetic patterns that challenge traditional, large scale management. To detect fine spatial scale structures, understand sources of intraspecific diversity, and design appropriate management plans requires identification of reproductively isolated units. This study reports on genetic differentiation in pike (Esox lucius) within a coastal area stretching 55 km from south to north in the central Baltic Sea. Pike is here an economically and ecologically important top predator that has declined in abundance. However, population structures have mostly been studied on large spatial scales, and without considering the potential for genetic divergence between the sympatric anadromous fresh water and the resident brackish water spawning ecotypes. To this end, 487 individuals from the east coast of Sweden and the island of oland, representing sympatric anadromous and resident spawning individuals, categorized to ecotype based on spawning location or otolith microchemistry, were genotyped for 10 microsatellites and used to test for divergence between ecotypes. Furthermore, divergence between regions (island/mainland), neighbouring spawning locations (n = 13) and isolation by distance within and between regions were evaluated for the anadromous ecotype. The results revealed strong genetic differences between regions, between spawning locations separated by as little as 5 km and the first evidence of genetic differentiation between resident and anadromous ecotypes; despite a high dispersal capacity of pike and a high connectivity within the study area. The signatures of isolation by distance indicated that connectivity among populations differed between regions, probably reflecting availability of spawning habitats. To safeguard against the challenges and uncertainties associated with environmental change, adaptive conservation management should aim to promote high intra-population functional genetic diversity without compromising the continued integrity and coexistence of the different ecotypes and of locally adapted sub-populations.

AB  - Predation is a fundamental ecological process, but there are fe iv studies of predation risk for adult, breeding birds. In this study, we quantified Relative Predation Risk (RPR) for 46 species of passerine birds preyed on by sparrowhawks during the breeding season in south-western Sweden. The sparrowhawk is a major predator of smaller birds in Eurasian forests and woodland. Near nesting hawk pairs, prey abundance was estimated by line transects. From prey remains at hawk nests, we estimated the frequency of prey species in the diet of hawks. For each hawk pair, RPR values for different prey species were calculated. The mean RPR for each prey species, based on hawk pairs as sample units, indicated degree of overrepresentation (positive RPR) Or. underrepresentation (negative RPR) Of the prey in the diet. Prey species with a high positive RPR nested mainly near human habitations (villages or towns), at forest edges and in farmland. However, there were marked seasonal changes in RPR. Forest birds, such as the goldcrest and wren, had the highest RPR in April. Later, the hawks seemed to hunt mainly in the habitats mentioned above, where prey were more abundant or easier to catch, resulting in increasing RPR for the house sparrow, yellowhammer, greenfinch and other species.
   RPR values were analysed in relation to prey body size (mass) and relative density, as well as prey foraging height and nest height (categorized from the literature). In addition, the mean perch height and mean exposure of prey species were quantified in the field. Most predation was due to the smaller male hawks, providing food for their mates and young. RPR increased with prey body size up to a mass of about 40 g, then declined with increasing body size (larger prey being more difficult to catch). RPR decreased with increasing relative density of prey species. Nest height was not correlated with RPR, but foraging height seems to be an important factor: RPR decreased with increasing foraging height. A similar result was found for mean perch height, when larger prey (over 40 g) and singing individuals were excluded from the field data. RPR increased with mean exposure of prey species when larger prey and singing birds were excluded; a combination of perch height and exposure improved the correlation with RPR. Singing birds were generally perched high in the vegetation and may not suffer high predation risk, contrary to common belief. The results of this study are discussed in relation to temporal and geographical variation in RPR and antipredator adaptations in passerine birds.

AB  - Over the centuries, specific farming practices shaped permanent grasslands in mountains. With socioeconomic change, farming practices have changed and with them the landscape. Over time, food production has been increasingly decoupled from the preservation of permanent grassland, endangering the delivery of crucial ecosystem services. This contribution looks into the role of institutions including normative, regulative and cultural-cognitive elements in preserving current bundles of ecosystem services provided by mountain grasslands. In particular, we investigate how such institutions affect farmers' management choices. Based on a review of scientific literature and empirical data from three case studies, we compare institutions in Austria, France and Norway. The cases represent different modes of multi-level governance (EU and non-EU), different grassland management practices, linked to different farming systems (dairy, breeding, rearing of heifers, suckler cow and sheep production) and different socio-economic conditions. The results underpin that ecological insights into the impact of farming practices on the ecology of grassland need to be combined with an understanding of the complex institutional interactions that affect farming practices, to ensure the resilience of mountain grasslands. If the design of regulatory measures considers both changing dynamics, it may enable farms to adapt and transform while maintaining traditional grassland management practices (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - There is momentum, globally, to increase the use of plant biomass for the production of heat, power and liquid transport fuels. This review assesses the evidence base for potential impacts of large-scale bioenergy crop deployment principally within the UK context, but with wider implications for Europe, the USA and elsewhere. We focus on second generation, dedicated lignocellulosic crops, but where appropriate draw comparison with current first-generation oil and starch crops, often primarily grown for food.
   For lignocellulosic crops, positive effects on soil properties, biodiversity, energy balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, carbon footprint and visual impact are likely, when growth is compared to arable crops. Compared to replacement of set-aside and permanent unimproved grassland, benefits are less apparent. For hydrology, strict guidelines on catchment management must be enforced to ensure detrimental effects do not occur to hydrological resources. The threat of climate change suggests that action will be required to ensure new genotypes are available with high water use efficiency and that catchment-scale management is in place to secure these resources in future. In general, for environmental impacts, less is known about the consequences of large-scale deployment of the C4 grass Miscanthus, compared to short rotation coppice (SRC) willow and poplar, including effects on biodiversity and hydrology and this requires further research.
   Detailed consideration of GHG mitigation and energy balance for both crop growth and utilization suggest that perennial crops are favoured over annual crops, where energy balances may be poor. Similarly, crops for heat and power generation, especially combined heat and power (CHP), are favoured over the production of liquid biofuels. However, it is recognized that in contrast to heat and power, few alternatives exist for liquid transportation fuels at present and research to improve the efficiency and energy balance of liquid transport fuel production from lignocellulosic sources is a high current priority.
   Although SRC, and to a lesser extent energy grasses such as Miscanthus, may offer significant benefits for the environment, this potential will only be realized if landscape-scale issues are effectively managed and the whole chain of crop growth and utilization is placed within a regulatory framework where sustainability is a central driver. Land resource in the UK and throughout Europe will limit the contribution that crops can make to biofuel and other renewable targets, providing a strong driver to consider sustainability in a global context.

AB  - Sphagnum fuscum was collected from twenty-five ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat bogs surrounding open pit mines and upgrading facilities of Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) in northern Alberta (AB) in order to assess the extent of atmospheric contamination by trace elements. As a control, this moss species was also collected at a bog near Utilcuma (UTK) in an undeveloped part of AB and 264 km SW of the ABS region. For comparison, this moss was also collected in central AB, in the vicinity of the City of Edmonton which is approximately 500 km to the south of the ABS region, from the Wagner Wetland which is 22 km W of the City, from Seba Beach (ca. 90 km W) and from Elk Island National Park (ca. 45 km E). All of the moss samples were digested and trace elements concentrations determined using ICP-SMS at a commercial laboratory, with selected samples also analyzed using instrumental neutron activation analysis at the University of Alberta.
   The mosses from the ABS region yielded lower concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb, Tl, and Zn compared to the moss from the Edmonton area. Concentrations of Ni and Mo in the mosses were comparable in these two regions, but V was more abundant in the ABS samples. Compared with the surface vegetation of eight peat cores collected in recent years from British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and New Brunswick, the mean concentrations of Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl and Zn in the mosses from the ABS region are generally much lower. In fact, the concentrations of these trace elements in the samples from the ABS region are comparable to the corresponding values in forest moss from remote regions of central and northern Norway.
   Lithophile element concentrations (Ba, Be, Ga, Ge, Li, Sc, Th, Ti, Zr) explain most of the variation in trace metal concentrations in the moss samples. The mean concentrations of Th and Zr are greatest in the moss samples from the ABS region, reflecting dust inputs to the bogs from open pit mines, aggregate quarries, and gravel roads. Linear regressions of V, Ni, and Mo (elements enriched in bitumen) versus Sc (a conservative, lithophile element) show excellent correlations in the mosses from the ABS region, but this is true also of Ag, Pb, Sb and Tl: thus, most of the variation in the trace metal concentrations can be explained simply by the abundance of dust particles on the plants of this region. Unlike the moss samples from the ABS region and from UTK where Pb/Sc ratios resemble those of crustal rocks, the moss samples from the other regions studied yielded much greater Pb/Sc ratios implying significant anthropogenic Pb contributions at these other sites.

AB  - The Calluna vulgaris L. that dominated coastal heathlands of Western Europe were for millennia managed by regular burning cycles for improved grazing. Most places in Norway this practice has, however, been neglected over the last 5-7 decades, resulting in accumulation of above ground biomass including degenerated Calluna and successional fire-prone species, e.g., native juniper (Juniperus communis) and exotic blacklisted Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). Today, in dry periods, the heathland represents a fire threat to the increasing number of homes in the wildland-urban interface (WUI), as exemplified by the June 2021 Sotra Island WUI fire. The fire burned 700 ha of encroached heathlands, destroyed three buildings, and threatened settlements. In the present study, the Sotra fire was investigated to understand the fire development and analyse possible risk reducing measures. Photographic material obtained during the fire, weather conditions prior to and during the fire, involved fire fuel, fire spread mechanisms, firefighting response, and possible consequences under slightly changed circumstances were analysed. Compared to previous fires in coastal Norway, the Sotra fire represents a step change in fire development including, e.g., pyrocumulus-like clouds, fire whirls, and fire spread 270 m across a fjord. Preventive measures based on the local context are analysed, including engaging voluntary communities to remove fire-prone fuel, e.g., juniper and Sitka, to create defensible space. Moreover, strategic fire breaks in the terrain, e.g., well-managed heathland strengthening existing fuel breaks, e.g., lakes, cultivated fields, naked rock, and roads, are recommended. Mechanical cutting is suggested as a short-term measure while fenceless grazing may represent a long-term solution to prevent regrowth. During a period of record high energy prices, this may provide free of charge firewood and make way for future local food production, in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, while reducing the fire risk.

AB  - Analysing different future trajectories of technological developments we assess the prospects for Nordic carbon-intensive industries to significantly reduce direct CO2 emissions in the period 2010-2050. This analysis covers petroleum refining, integrated iron and steel production, and cement manufacturing in the four largest Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Our results show that the implementation of currently available abatement measures will not be enough to meet the ambitious emissions reduction targets envisaged for the Year 2050. We show how an extensive deployment of CCS (carbon capture and storage) could result in emissions reductions that are in line with such targets. However, large-scale introduction of CCS would come at a significant price in terms of energy use and the associated flows of captured CO2 would place high requirements on timely planning of infrastructure for the transportation and storage of CO2. Further the assessment highlights the importance of, especially in the absence of successful deployment of CO2 capture, encouraging increased use of biomass in the cement and integrated iron and steel industries, and of promoting the utilisation of alternative raw materials in cement manufacturing to complement efforts to improve energy efficiency.

AB  - Adaptation is necessary to cope with or take advantage of the effects of climate change on socio-ecological systems. This is especially important in the forestry sector, which is sensitive to the ecological and economic impacts of climate change, and where the adaptive decisions of owners play out over long periods of time. Relatively little is known about how successful these decisions are likely to be in meeting demands for ecosystem services in an uncertain future.
   We explore adaptation to global change in the forestry sector using CRAFTY-Sweden; an agent-based model that represents large-scale land-use dynamics, based on the demand and supply of ecosystem services. Future impacts and adaptation within the Swedish forestry sector were simulated for scenarios of socio-economic change (Shared Socio-economic Pathways) and climatic change (Representative Concentration Pathways, for three climate models), between 2010 and 2100.
   Substantial differences were found in the competitiveness and coping ability of land owners implementing different management strategies through time. Generally, multi-objective management was found to provide the best basis for adaptation. Across large regions, however, a combination of management strategies was better at meeting ecosystem service demands. Results also show that adaptive capacity evolves through time in response to external (global) drivers and interactions between individual actors. This suggests that process-based models are more appropriate for the study of autonomous adaptation and future adaptive and coping capacities than models based on indicators, discrete time snapshots or exogenous proxies. Nevertheless, a combination of planned and autonomous adaptation by institutions and forest owners is likely to be more successful than either group acting alone. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - East European forests dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies(L.) H. Karst.) in the broad-leaved-coniferous zone should be considered as secondary communities formed under the influence of centuries-long activities (logging, fires and planting) and extended outside their natural range. The study raises an issue-how stable is the current state of Norway spruce forests in the center of the Russian plain and what is the effect of silviculture on the forest cover of the large urban agglomeration-the Moscow Region? Current study is based on multidisciplinary research and consequently concerns the age dynamics of spruce plantation forests, the species and typological diversity of mature spruce forests and spatial pattern of spruce forests along the south edge of their range. The composition and structure of Norway spruce plantations have been studied for various age classes and compared with mature natural spruce forests and pine plantations on the basis of field data. Remote sensing data and modeling approach were applied to estimate the spatial structure of spruce forests. It is found that mature plantations (over 80 years) become similar to natural forests in terms of structure and composition. The relationship between the distribution of spruce formations and the climatic and geomorphological conditions are confirmed. The proportion of spruce and spruce-aspen/birch communities follows the pattern of zones-the transition from the coniferous and broad-leaved forest zone to the broad-leaved forest zone. Despite the significant anthropogenic impact and the high proportion of plantations in the composition of Norway spruce forests (about 60-80%), their floristic and typological diversities correspond to such properties of zonal broad-leaved-coniferous communities. Over-matured plantations can provide valuable habitats for the re-establishment of native typological diversity. This makes it possible to use silviculture stands as an accelerated alternative to the natural recovery of disturbed habitats.

AB  - The spatial transformation of cultivated land is an important element in the study of land use transformation. Analyzing the characteristics and direction of the global spatial transformation of cultivated land is of great significance in clarifying the spatial extent and quality of global cultivated land and ensuring global food security. In this context, this paper uses the global spatial data of cultivated land from 1992 to 2015 to analyze the characteristics of global cultivated land spatial transformation from the perspectives of cultivated land quantity, cultivated land landscape pattern, and cultivated land management pattern, applying the Mann-Kendall trend tests, trend analysis, landscape pattern index measures, and global rural per capita cultivated indicators. The global cultivated land area increased, followed by a decrease, during the study period; there were three distinct phases of change, with the years 1995 and 2005 as turning points. During the first phase, the global cultivated land area increased at an average annual rate of 0.19 %, in the second phase, the increase rate was 0.30 %, and in the third phase, the increase rate was -0.003 %. Based on the trend of cultivated land change during the study period, the areas with a dramatic change in cultivated land area were classified into six typical hotspot areas, involving the increase and decrease of area change in 10 different countries. The two countries with the largest increases in cultivated land area are Sweden and Brazil (24.82 % and 24.43 %, respectively), whereas Ukraine's cultivated land area decreased throughout the study period.

AB  - We studied mosquito faunas of four wetlands from northern to southern Sweden by trapping female mosquitoes in June, July, and August. A total of 52,298 individuals comprising 32 species in five genera were identified. The number of species increased from 10 and 12 in the two northern wetlands, to 16 in the central Sweden study area to 24 in the wetland in southern Sweden. or a further characterization of mosquito fauna diversity, we organized all species recorded from Sweden into 14 functional groups based on biological and life history characteristics. The number of groups increased from three in the two northern study areas, to eight in central Sweden and 13 in the southernmost study area. All functional groups present at one site were also present at the sites located farther south, Most successful species were univoltine, respiring from the water surface, laying their eggs on soil, overwintering in the egg stage, preferring forested or partly forested habitants, and having mammals as hosts for blood meals. The mosquito faunas of the two northern study areas were similar and lacked several of the functional groups occurring further south. The mosquito fauna of the study area in central Sweden included species feeding on I,birds and with overwhelming larvae In the southernmost study area, 13 out of 14 functional groups were found, indicating a large variety of habitats. Our results demonstrated a southward increase in the number of both mosquito species and functional groups in forested wetlands.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of designing PES-type contracts to encourage participation and spatial coordination amongst private forest owners in Finland. The aim of the policy is to increase efforts to mitigate risks from invasive forest pests and diseases. Such control actions yield spill-over benefits to other landowners and to wider society, meaning that the level of privately-optimal disease control is likely to be less than the socially-optimal level. The policy designer may wish to encourage spatial coordination in the uptake of such PES-type contracts, as spatial coordination delivers an increase in the effectiveness of control measures on disease risks. We conducted a choice experiment with private forest owners in Finland in October 2016. The study elicited the preferences of woodland owners with respect to the design of forest disease control contracts, and gauged their willingness to cooperate with neighbouring forest owners within the framework of such programs.

AB  - Land-cover changes have a clear impact on local climates via biophysical effects. European land cover has been affected by human activities for at least 6000 years, but possibly longer. It is thus highly probable that humans altered climate before the industrial revolution (AD1750-1850). In this study, climate and vegetation 6000 years (6 ka) ago is investigated using one global climate model, two regional climate models, one dynamical vegetation model, pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation cover using a model of the pollen-vegetation relationship and a statistical model for spatial interpolation of the reconstructed land cover. This approach enables us to study 6 ka climate with potential natural and reconstructed land cover, and to determine how differences in land cover impact upon simulated climate. The use of two regional climate models enables us to discuss the robustness of the results. This is the first experiment with two regional climate models of simulated palaeo-climate based on regional climate models.
   Different estimates of 6 ka vegetation are constructed: simulated potential vegetation and reconstructed vegetation. Potential vegetation is the natural climate-induced vegetation as simulated by a dynamical vegetation model driven by climate conditions from a climate model. Bayesian spatial model interpolated point estimates of pollen-based plant abundances combined with estimates of climate-induced potential un-vegetated land cover were used for reconstructed vegetation. The simulated potential vegetation is heavily dominated by forests: evergreen coniferous forests dominate in northern and eastern Europe, while deciduous broadleaved forests dominate central and western Europe. In contrast, the reconstructed vegetation cover has a large component of open land in most of Europe.
   The simulated 6 ka climate using reconstructed vegetation was 0-5 degrees C warmer than the pre-industrial (PI) climate, depending on season and region. The largest differences are seen in north-eastern Europe in winter with about 4-6 degrees C, and the smallest differences (close to zero) in southwestern Europe in winter. The simulated 6 ka climate had 10-20% more precipitation than PI climate in northern Europe and 10-20% less precipitation in southern Europe in summer. The results are in reasonable agreement with proxy-based climate reconstructions and previous similar climate modelling studies. As expected, the global model and regional models indicate relatively similar climates albeit with regional differences indicating that, models response to land-cover changes differently.
   The results indicate that the anthropogenic land-cover changes, as given by the reconstructed vegetation, in this study are large enough to have a significant impact on climate. It is likely that anthropogenic impact on European climate via land-use change was already taking place at 6 ka. Our results suggest that anthropogenic land-cover changes at 6 ka lead to around 0.5 degrees C warmer in southern Europe in summer due to biogeophysical forcing. (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly acknowledged as a potent global warming abatement option. It is demonstrated that whilst the global warming potential (GWP) decreases, the other environmental impact category potentials often increase in a life cycle perspective. Despite this, only a few studies clearly address this trade-off or use weighting to compare the positive and negative effects of CCS. The present life cycle assessment (LCA) study focuses, therefore, on presenting several environmental indicators and on weighting the inventory results in order to ascertain which of the analysed systems is to be preferred.
   The case studied is a projected gas power plant at Tjeldbergodden (Norway), where it is proposed to include post-combustion CCS. Four main scenarios have been analysed, one without and three with CCS. The principal variation between the CCS scenarios is that the steam required for amine regeneration is produced in three different ways: in a separate gas fuelled steam boiler; in a separate biomass fuelled steam boiler; and delivered from the low-pressure steam turbine in the power plant. Design information and technical specifications have been available. The study has used LCA methodology based on the ISO standard 14044, SimaPro 7.3.2.4 software and the Ecoinvent 2.0 database. The functional unit is 1 TWh electricity delivered to the grid. The following environmental impact categories have been included: GWP, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP) and cumulative energy demand (CED). Three weighting methods have been used to ascertain the robustness of the weighting results: ReCiPe, EPS 2000 and IMPACT 2002+.
   The characterisation results show that the CCS scenarios have reduced impacts only in the case of GWP. The weighting demonstrates that in the ReCiPe model, climate change is strongly in focus, whilst in EPS 2000, human health and depletion of reserves are dominant. Climate change is also an important factor in IMPACT 2002+, together with effects on human health (respiratory inorganics). The process integration scenario has, however, the best result for all three weighting models. This contrasts with the results from the impact analysis where four of the five analysed impact categories rated the CCS-3 scenario as worse than the reference scenario. One possible option for improving the biofuel boiler scenario is to capture the CO2 from the combustion of biomass in the external steam boiler. This would not, in all probability, affect the acidification, eutrophication, POCP and CED to any significant degree, but the GWP, and hence the ReCiPe and the IMPACT 2002+, weighting results could be expected to improve.
   The weighting exercise has identified toxicity as a concern with regard to the biofuel boiler scenarios (CCS-2) and human health issues as having importance for the CCS-3 scenario. It would seem that process integration is a better CCS option than that of CCS providing steam from a separate steam boiler (without CCS), even where this boiler is biomass-fuelled. Any future analysis should focus both on the process integration scenario and the biofuel boiler scenario with CCS of biological CO2.

AB  - As farms are consolidated into larger operations and small farms close down for economic reasons, rural areas lose ecological, social and economic functions related to farming. Biodiversity and scenic, open-vista landscapes are lost as fields are left unmanaged. Social and economic benefits such as local job opportunities and meeting places disappear. Four Swedish rural communities were examined to increase our understanding of the functions that a diverse agriculture provides and which of these are lost as farms cease operation and overall rural social capital is depleted. Workshops and interviews with village action groups and with farmers were carried out. Both groups identified key functions from farming that are important to the rural community, such as production of food and fiber, businesses and jobs, human services, local security, ecosystem services such as nutrient cycling and biodiversity, and functions pertaining to quality of life. Several ways in which village action groups can support agriculture were identified that current industrial agriculture and even agri-environmental schemes fail to achieve. These include organizing local meeting places, encouraging local processing and consumption and supporting farmers in their work. We conclude that agriculture and village action groups match well in community development and that policies supporting this match would be useful.

AB  - Ecological communities are structured by several mechanisms, including temporal, spatial and environmental factors. However, the simultaneous effects of these factors have rarely been studied. Here, we investigated their role on water beetle assemblages sampled over a period of 18 years. Water beetles were sampled in the spring of each year in lotic and lentic water bodies from mainland region of Kalmar and Oland Island in southeastern Sweden. We assessed how past assemblage structure, environmental factors and spatial variables correlated with current assemblage structure using a variation partitioning approach. We also tested for correlates of temporal beta diversity of water beetle assemblages with multiple regressions. We found that past water beetle assemblage structure explained current water beetle assemblage structure better than the environmental and spatial correlates. We also observed that temporal beta diversity of water beetle assemblages was mainly due to species gain rather than to species loss. Finally, environmental variables (e.g., hydroperiod, habitat size and hydrology) and timespan between sampling events explained part of temporal beta diversity and contribution of species loss to total assemblage dissimilarity variation. Despite the fact that most variation remained unexplained, we found that ecological factors that have been thought to be important for water beetle richness and abundance in past studies (e.g. water body size, water permanence, shore slope, and whether the water body is lentic or lotic) were also correlated to temporal beta diversity. From a conservation point of view, our study suggest that temporal variability of assemblage structure should be included in biological monitoring because of its potential to predict current assemblage structure.

AB  - A number of mammal species in Europe, including the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), have experienced a decline in population size in the 20th century due to persecution, environmental pollution and ongoing habitat fragmentation. This has often led to a substantial loss of genetic diversity which may threaten population viability. While otters have been studied in some detail genetically, the northern part of the Fennoscandian range has not been covered well so far. By explicitly focussing on the genetics of otter populations from northern Sweden and Finland we aimed at closing that gap. To infer their genetic structure and diversity, we analysed sequences of the mitochondrial control region and 12 nuclear microsatellite markers in 197 Eurasian otters from Sweden and Finland. Variability of the mitochondrial control region was low overall but still revealed previously undetected haplotypes unique to the Finnish otter population. Expected heterozygosities in Fennoscandia were within the range previously reported. Bayesian cluster analysis of our microsatellite data revealed genetic structuring of the Swedish otter populations. In contrast, we observed a high degree of admixture among the Finnish populations that we also found at the geographic border of the two countries (Lapland). Admixed ancestry in Finnish otters suggests that gene flow from the Swedish to Central European populations is potentially facilitated via the Finnish otter populations connecting the Swedish animals with otter populations in mainland Europe.

AB  - Intensive forestry practices have had a negative impact on boreal forest biodiversity; as a consequence, the need for restoration is pressing. Polypores (wood-inhabiting fungi) are key decomposers of dead wood, but, due to a lack of coarse woody debris (CWD) in forest ecosystems, many species are under threat. Here, we study the long-term effects on polypore diversity of two restoration treatments: creating CWD by felling whole trees and prescribed burning. This large-scale experiment is located in spruce-dominated boreal forests in southern Finland. The experiment has a factorial design (n = 3) including three levels of created CWD (5, 30, and 60 m(3) ha(-1)) crossed with burning or no burning. In 2018, 16 years after launching the experiment, we inventoried polypores on 10 experimentally cut logs and 10 naturally fallen logs per stand. We found that overall polypore community composition differed between burned and unburned stands. However, only red-listed species abundances and richness were positively affected by prescribed burning. We found no effects of CWD levels created mechanically by felling of trees. We show, for the first time, that prescribed burning is an effective measure for restoring polypore diversity in a late-successional Norway spruce forest. Burning creates CWD with certain characteristics that differ from what is created by CWD restoration by felling trees. Prescribed burning promotes primarily red-listed species, demonstrating its effectiveness as a restoration measure to promote diversity of threatened polypore species in boreal forests. However, because the CWD that the burning creates will decrease over time, to be functional, prescribed burns need to be applied regularly on the landscape scale. Large-scale and long-term experimental studies, such as this one, are invaluable for establishing evidence-based restoration strategies.

AB  - European wolves (Canis lupus) show population genetic structure in the absence of geographic barriers, and across relatively short distances for this highly mobile species. Additional information on the location of and divergence between population clusters is required, particularly because wolves are currently recolonizing parts of Europe. We evaluated genetic structure in 177 wolves from 11 countries using over 67K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. The results supported previous findings of an isolated Italian population with lower genetic diversity than that observed across other areas of Europe. Wolves from the remaining countries were primarily structured in a north-south axis, with Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece (Dinaric-Balkan) differentiated from northcentral wolves that included individuals from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia. Carpathian Mountain wolves in central Europe had genotypes intermediate between those identified in northcentral Europe and the Dinaric-Balkan cluster. Overall, individual genotypes from northcentral Europe suggested high levels of admixture. We observed high diversity within Belarus, with wolves from western and northern Belarus representing the two most differentiated groups within northcentral Europe. Our results support the presence of at least three major clusters (Italy, Carpathians, Dinaric-Balkan) in southern and central Europe. Individuals from Croatia also appeared differentiated from wolves in Greece and Bulgaria. Expansion from glacial refugia, adaptation to local environments, and human-related factors such as landscape fragmentation and frequent killing of wolves in some areas may have contributed to the observed patterns. Our findings can help inform conservation management of these apex predators and the ecosystems of which they are part.

AB  - Climate change threatens to release abundant carbon that is sequestered at high latitudes, but the constraints on microbial metabolisms that mediate the release of methane and carbon dioxide are poorly understood(1-7). The role of viruses, which are known to affect microbial dynamics, metabolism and biogeochemistry in the oceans(8-10), remains largely unexplored in soil. Here, we aimed to investigate how viruses influence microbial ecology and carbon metabolism in peatland soils along a permafrost thaw gradient in Sweden. We recovered 1,907 viral populations (genomes and large genome fragments) from 197 bulk soil and size-fractionated metagenomes, 58% of which were detected in metatranscriptomes and presumed to be active. In silico predictions linked 35% of the viruses to microbial host populations, highlighting likely viral predators of key carbon-cycling microorganisms, including methanogens and methanotrophs. Lineage-specific virus/host ratios varied, suggesting that viral infection dynamics may differentially impact microbial responses to a changing climate. Virus-encoded glycoside hydrolases, including an endomannanase with confirmed functional activity, indicated that viruses influence complex carbon degradation and that viral abundances were significant predictors of methane dynamics. These findings suggest that viruses may impact ecosystem function in climate-critical, terrestrial habitats and identify multiple potential viral contributions to soil carbon cycling.

AB  - This study aimed at investigating the genetic diversity, relationship and population structure of 110 local Swedish chickens derived from five breeds (Gotlandshona, Hedemorahona, Olandsk dvarghona, Skansk blommehona, and Bohuslan-Dals svarthona, in the rest of the paper the shorter name Svarthona is used) using 24 microsatellite markers. In total, one hundred thirteen alleles were detected in all populations, with a mean of 4.7 alleles per locus. For the five chicken breeds, the observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.225 to 0.408 and from 0.231 to 0.515, with the lowest scores for the Svarthona and the highest scores for the Skansk blommehona breeds, respectively. Similarly, the average within breed molecular kinship varied from 0.496 to 0.745, showing high coancestry, with Skansk blommehona having the lowest and Svarthona the highest coancestry. Furthermore, all breeds showed significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Across the five breeds, the global heterozygosity deficit (FIT) was 0.545, population differentiation index (F-ST) was 0.440, and the global inbreeding of individuals within breed (F-IS) was 0.187. The phylogenetic relationships of chickens were examined using neighbor-joining trees constructed at the level of breeds and individual samples. The neighbor-joining tree constructed at breed level revealed two main clusters, with Hedemorahona and Olandsk dvarghona breeds in one cluster, and Gotlandshona and Svarthona breeds in the second cluster leaving the Skansk blommehona in the middle. Based on the results of the STRUCTURE analysis, the most likely number of clustering of the five breeds was at K = 4, with Hedemorahona, Gotlandshona and Svarthona breeds forming their own distinct clusters, while Olandsk dvarghona and Skansk blommehona breeds clustered together. Losses in the overall genetic diversity of local Swedish chickens due to breeds extinction varied from -1.46% to -6.723%. The results of the current study can be used as baseline genetic information for genetic conservation program, for instance, to control inbreeding and to implement further genetic studies in local Swedish chickens.

AB  - Habitat loss and degradation are recognised as the most important causes of species decline and extinction in marine ecosystems. It is also widely recognised that a range of restoration actions are now essential to halt further decline. From a policy perspective, demonstration that restoration activity is in the interest of society is an important goal. In this paper, the welfare impacts of restoring Norwegian kelp forests to areas where they once were dominant but which now lie barren are estimated using the discrete choice modelling approach. The paper also examines if more direct contact with the environmental good under investigation influences respondents' willingness to pay to restore ecosystem features. The results indicate a positive and significant marginal societal willingness to pay for the ecosystem services associated with kelp forest restoration. The enhanced biodiversity levels as a result of the restoration activity are the most highly valued by the Norwegian public although the size of the area restored is more highly valued by respondents who are active marine environment users. It is argued that without incorporating these non-market values into the decision making process marine policy decisions may be made that are not in fact in the best interest of society.

   Study design: In-depth interviews with 14 Swedish reindeer herding Sami were performed, with purposive sampling. The interviews focused on the herders experiences of climate change, observed consequences and thoughts about this. The interviews were analysed using content analysis.
   Results: One core theme emerged from the interviews: facing the limit of resilience. Swedish reindeer-herding Sami perceive climate change as yet another stressor in their daily struggle. They have experienced severe and more rapidly shifting, unstable weather with associated changes in vegetation and alterations in the freeze-thaw cycle, all of which affect reindeer herding. The forecasts about climate change from authorities and scientists have contributed to stress and anxiety. Other societal developments have lead to decreased flexibility that obstructs adaptation. Some adaptive strategies are discordant with the traditional life of reindeer herding, and there is a fear among the Sami of being the last generation practising traditional reindeer herding.
   Conclusions: The study illustrates the vulnerable situation of the reindeer herders and that climate change impact may have serious consequences for the trade and their overall way of life. Decision makers on all levels, both in Sweden and internationally, need improved insights into these complex issues to be able to make adequate decisions about adaptive climate change strategies.

AB  - Background: Bacteria belonging to Planctomycetes display several unique morphological and genetic features and are found in a wide variety of habitats on earth. Their ecological roles in these habitats are still poorly understood. Planctomycetes have previously been detected throughout the year on surfaces of the kelp Laminaria hyperborea from southwestern Norway. We aimed to make a detailed investigation of the abundance and phylogenetic diversity of planctomycetes inhabiting these kelp surfaces.
   Results: Planctomycetes accounted for 51-53% of the bacterial biofilm cells in July and September and 24% in February according to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results. Several separate planctomycetes lineages within Pirellulae, Planctomyces and OM190 were represented in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and the most abundant clones belonged to yet uncultured lineages. In contrast to the abundance, the diversity of the planctomycete populations increased from July to February and was probably influenced by the aging of the kelp tissue. One planctomycete strain that was closely related to Rhodopirellula baltica was isolated using selective cultivation techniques.
   Conclusions: Biofilms on surfaces of L. hyperborea display an even higher proportion of planctomycetes compared to other investigated planctomycete-rich habitats such as open water, sandy sediments and peat bogs. The findings agree well with the hypothesis of the role of planctomycetes as degraders of sulfated polymeric carbon in the marine environment as kelps produce such substances. In addition, the abundant planctomycete populations on kelp surfaces and in association with other eukaryotes suggest that coexistence with eukaryotes may be a key feature of many planctomycete lifestyles.

AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HAB) are recurrent phenomena in northern Europe along the coasts of the Baltic Sea, Kattegat-Skagerrak, eastern North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. These HABs have caused occasional massive losses for the aquaculture industry and have chronically affected socioeconomic interests in several ways. This status review gives an overview of historical HAB events and summarises reports to the Harmful Algae Event Database from 1986 to the end of year 2019 and observations made in long term monitoring programmes of potentially harmful phytoplankton and of phycotoxins in bivalve shellfish. Major HAB taxa causing fish mortalities in the region include blooms of the prymnesiophyte Chrysochromulina leadbeateri in northern Norway in 1991 and 2019, resulting in huge economic losses for fish farmers. A bloom of the prymesiophyte Prymnesium polylepis (syn. Chrysochromulina polylepis) in the Kattegat-Skagerrak in 1988 was ecosystem disruptive. Blooms of the prymnesiophyte Phaeocystis spp. have caused accumulations of foam on beaches in the southwestern North Sea and Wadden Sea coasts and shellfish mortality has been linked to their occurrence. Mortality of shellfish linked to HAB events has been observed in estuarine waters associated with influx of water from the southern North Sea. The first bloom of the dictyochophyte genus Pseudochattonella was observed in 1998, and since then such blooms have been observed in high cell densities in spring causing fish mortalities some years. Dinoflagellates, primarily Dinophysis spp., intermittently yield concentrations of Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DST) in blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, above regulatory limits along the coasts of Norway, Denmark and the Swedish west coast. On average, DST levels in shellfish have decreased along the Swedish and Norwegian Skagerrak coasts since approximately 2006, coinciding with a decrease in the cell abundance of D. acuta. Among dinoflagellates, Alexandrium species are the major source of Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PST) in the region. PST concentrations above regulatory levels were rare in the Skagerrak-Kattegat during the three decadal review period, but frequent and often abundant findings of Alexandrium resting cysts in surface sediments indicate a high potential risk for blooms. PST levels often above regulatory limits along the west coast of Norway are associated with A. catenella (ribotype Group 1) as the main toxin producer. Other Alexandrium species, such as A. ostenfeldii and A. minutum, are capable of producing PST among some populations but are usually not associated with PSP events in the region. The cell abundance of A. pseudogonyaulax, a producer of the ichthyotoxin goniodomin (GD), has increased in the Skagerrak-Kattegat since 2010, and may constitute an emerging threat. The dinoflagellate Azadinium spp. have been unequivocally linked to the presence of azaspiracid toxins (AZT) responsible for Azaspiracid Shellfish Poisoning (AZP) in northern Europe. These toxins were detected in bivalve shellfish at concentrations above regulatory limits for the first time in Norway in blue mussels in 2005 and in Sweden in blue mussels and oysters (Ostrea edulis and Crassostrea gigas) in 2018. Certain members of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia produce the neurotoxin domoic acid and analogs known as Amnesic Shellfish Toxins (AST). Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia were common in the North Sea and the Skagerrak-Kattegat, but levels of AST in bivalve shellfish were rarely above regulatory limits during the review period.
   Summer cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea are a concern mainly for tourism by causing massive fouling of bathing water and beaches. Some of the cyano-bacteria produce toxins, e.g. Nodularia spumigena, producer of nodularin, which may be a human health problem and cause occasional dog mortalities. Coastal and shelf sea regions in northern Europe provide a key supply of seafood, socioeconomic well-being and ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic influence and climate change create environmental stressors causing shifts in the biogeography and intensity of HABs. Continued monitoring of HAB and phycotoxins and the operation of historical databases such as HAEDAT provide not only an ongoing status report but also provide a way to interpret causes and mechanisms of HABs.

AB  - Current scenarios of the consequences of global warming stimulate research on the carbon-depositing capacity of vegetation cover. The stem is the main part of the tree biomass, and the accuracy of its volume assessment determines the possibility of correct monitoring and forecasting of forest resources. In the Russian forest management system, willow was not among the main forest-forming species, and therefore there was no need to develop valuation standards for it. However, due to the increased relevance of assessing the carbon-deposing function of Russian forests and the requirement to take into account the contribution to the carbon balance of all types of vegetation, there is a necessity to develop such standards. The solution can be found in the development of a generic model (or table) that takes into account the morphology of willows within the Salix L. genus and is based on data published in different regions and countries. The object of our research is data on the volume of willow stems, which is published and freely available in Russia, Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, and Norway in the form of tables or regression models. However, the extent to which each local model is applicable in other regions is unknown. To resolve this uncertainty, we used meta-analysis as a statistical procedure that combines the results of several independent studies in order to find a common pattern. As a result, we obtained a generic model of stem volume for the Salix genus, which is characterized by a high coefficient of determination and can be applied to estimate the stem volume of any species of this genus with minimum deviations from the calculated values. The results of the work are aimed at improving the accuracy of accounting deciduous stands during forest management and monitoring activities, valuation of stands on permanent and temporary trial plots. The implementation of unified standards for the use, reproduction, conservation and protection of willow stands with all the diversity of its species will solve a number of practical issues.

AB  - Ecological intensification has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate the impacts of conventional intensive land use on pollinators and insect pollination. However, research has concentrated on the effects of land management on pollinator abundance and diversity, while studies directly measuring pollination services are still lacking for many crops and regions. This study examines the effects of landscape heterogeneity, pesticide use intensity and flowering time on insect pollination of turnip rape Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera, a major oil crop at high latitudes. The field experiment included monitoring pollinator visits on turnip rape flowers and measuring yield in 34 spring-sown turnip rape fields in Southern Finland. The fields were situated in two landscape types that differed in the cover of arable land and represented independent gradients of pesticide use intensity and flowering time. Based on flower visits and number of seeds per silique, turnip rape was best pollinated in fields with late flowering time. The result suggests a temporal mismatch between crop flowering and the availability of pollination service in early sown fields. The increase in flower visits during summer was steeper among fields with low than high pesticide use, possibly due to a faster colony growth of important bee pollinators. Pollinator community in turnip rape fields was more diverse in heterogeneous landscapes with less arable land than in homogeneous field-dominated landscapes, suggesting higher stability of pollination services in diverse landscapes. Total yield per plant was positively related to pesticide use intensity. The relationship between insect pollination and total yield was weakened by high compensation capacity of turnip rape, the plants producing more flowers under poor pollination.Synthesis and applications. Crop pollination can be enhanced by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving pollination services.
   Foreign Language AbstractTiivistelma
   Maatalouden ekologista tehostamista on esitetty strategiaksi, jonka avulla intensiivisen maankayton kielteisia vaikutuksia polyttajiin ja hyonteispolytykseen voidaan hillita. Tutkimukset maankayton vaikutuksista viljelykasvien hyonteispolytykseen kuitenkin puuttuvat yha monilta viljelykasveilta ja alueilta. Tama tutkimus tarkasteli maiseman monimuotoisuuden, torjunta-aineiden kayton ja kukinta-ajan vaikutusta rypsin hyonteispolytykseen. Peltokokeessa seurattiin polyttajien vierailuja rypsin kukilla ja mitattiin satoa 34 kevatrypsipellolla Uudellamaalla. Pellot sijaitsivat kahdessa maisematyypissa, joista toinen oli peltovaltainen ja toinen monimuotoisempi ja vahemman peltoa sisaltava. Lisaksi pellot erosivat toisistaan torjunta-aineiden kayton ja kukinta-ajan suhteen. Polyttajien kukkavierailut ja siementen maara per litu olivat korkeimmillaan myohaan kukkineilla rypsipelloilla, mika kertoo hyvasta polytyksesta. Tuloksen perusteella aikaisin kylvetyt rypsipellot saattavat kukkia liian aikaisin polyttajien saatavuuden nakokulmasta. Voimakkaimmin polyttajien maara lisaantyi kesan aikana niiden peltojen joukossa, joilla ei kaytetty torjunta-aineita. Mahdollinen selitys on, etta tarhamehilaisten ja kimalaisten yhdyskunnat kasvoivat nopeimmin naiden peltojen laheisyydessa. Polyttajien monimuotoisuus oli suurempi monimuotoisessa kuin peltovaltaisessa maisemassa, mika parantaa polytyspalvelun vakautta muuttuvissa olosuhteissa. Kokonaissato per kasvi nousi torjunta-aineiden kayton lisaantyessa. Hyonteispolytyksen ja sadon valista yhteytta heikensi rypsin hyva kompensaatiokyky, jonka ansiosta heikosti polyttyneet kasvit tuottivat enemman kukkia.Yhteenveto ja sovellukset. Viljelykasvin polytysta voi parantaa saatamalla kylvoaikaa siten, etta kasvin kukinta ajoittuu tarkeimpien polyttajien runsaushuippuun. Torjunta-aineiden kayton vahentaminen voi parantaa polytysta mutta laskea samaan aikaan satoa tuholaisten ja rikkakasvien lisaantymisen takia. Polyttajaystavallisten kasvinsuojelukeinojen kehittaminen on tarkeaa korkeiden rypsisatojen ja polytyspalveluiden sailymisen kannalta.
   Crop pollination can be enhanced by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving pollination services.

AB  - The dominant land-use change in the Southern Alps is grassland abandonment, followed by forest expansion. Forest expansion is commonly thought to increase ecosystem C sequestration, but contradictory results have been reported. Our objective was to investigate soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) changes after forest expansion on abandoned grasslands. A land use and management gradient was identified in a subalpine area of Trentino (Italy) comprising four successional stages: (i) managed grassland (manG), mown and manured annually for more than 100 years; (ii) grassland abandoned 10 years ago (abanG), with shrubs and Picea abies saplings; (iii) early-stage forest (earlyF), dominated by P. abies established on grassland abandoned around 1970; and (iv) old forest (oldF), dominated by Fagus sylvatica and P. abies, representing a reference for long-term forest land use. Organic and mineral soil layers were collected down to 30 cm at eight points within three plots for each successional stage.
   Significantly more SOC was stored in organic layers of oldF compared with other successional stages and the organic layer N stocks were higher in oldF compared with manG and abanG. The SOC and N concentrations were higher in the top 10 cm mineral soil of grassland plots compared with forest. The earlyF and oldF stored, on average, 28-35% less SOC in top 10 cm mineral soil compared with manG and abanG when stocks were calculated using equivalent soil mass (ESM) and equivalent soil depth (ESD) approaches respectively. SOC stocks in mineral soil (0-30 cm) calculated with ESD decreased from manG to oldF; when accounting for total stone content, SOC stocks in earlyF and oldF were 40% and 50% lower than in manG, respectively. The inclusion of organic layers offset mineral SOC stock differences when only stones <5 cm were accounted for, but when considering the total stone content, SOC stocks in earlyF remained significantly lower (-31%) than in manG. Tree biomass contributed to higher ecosystem C stocks in oldF, which stored 82-93 Mg ha(-1) of C more than grasslands.
   Our study revealed a decrease in total SOC stocks after forest expansion on abandoned subalpine grasslands. Tree biomass development contributed to increasing C storage, especially in a long-term forest land use. Forest management should consider that tree biomass and organic layer development require a minimum time period following grassland abandonment to compensate for the decrease in mineral SOC stocks and contribute positively to climate change mitigation.

Karst.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and mountain elm (Ulmus glabra Huds.)-was studied in the mixed stands (105-157 years) in the western Krkonose Mountains (Czech Republic) concerning climate change. These are communities of maple to fir beechwoods (association Aceri-Fagetum sylvaticae and Luzulo-Abietetum albae) on ranker soils at the altitude 590-700 m a.s.l. Production, structure, and biodiversity were evaluated in seven permanent research plots and the relationships of the radial growth (150 cores) to climatic parameters (precipitation, temperature, and extreme conditions) and air pollution (SO2, NOX, ozone exposure). The stand volume reached 557-814 m(3) ha(-1) with high production potential of spruce and ash. The radial growth of beech and spruce growing in relatively favorable habitat conditions (deeper soil profile and less skeletal soils) has increased by 16.6%-46.1% in the last 20 years. By contrast, for sycamore and ash growing in more extreme soil conditions, the radial growth decreased by 12.5%-14.6%. However, growth variability increased (12.7%-29.5%) for all tree species, as did the occurrence of negative pointer years (extremely low radial growth) in the last two decades. The most sensitive tree species to climate and air pollution were spruce and beech compared to the resilience of sycamore and ash. Spectral analysis recorded the largest cyclical fluctuations (especially the 12-year solar cycle) in spruce, while ash did not show any significant cycle processes. The limiting factors of growth were droughts with high temperatures in the vegetation period for spruce and late frosts for beech. According to the degree of extreme habitat conditions, individual tree species thus respond appropriately to advancing climate change, especially to an increase in the mean temperature (by 2.1 degrees C), unevenness in precipitation, and occurrence of extreme climate events in the last 60 years.

AB  - Tree damage by game browsing is one of the biggest threats to forest ecosystems at the time of climate change and large-scale forest disturbances. The aim of the paper was to determine the effect of browsing by ungulates on the diversity, abundance and species composition of natural regeneration in forest stands dominated by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). The research was conducted on 10 permanent research plots in the Krusne hory Mts. in the Czech Republic and Germany. The density of natural regeneration was in the range of 23,300-114,100 recruits ha & minus;1. A higher proportion of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) was found in the regeneration compared to the mature stands. A total of 78% of recruits was damaged by browsing. The most frequently damaged tree species were sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.; 98%) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa [L.] Gaertn.; 97%), while Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst; 31%) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea [Matt.] Liebl.; 50%) were the least affected. Seventy-nine percent of European beech recruits were damaged. The game significantly reduced the height of regeneration by up to 40%, especially by terminal browsing. Browsing also negatively affected the quality and abundance of regeneration. For successful dynamics of species-rich natural forest ecosystems, it is necessary to minimize tree damage by game browsing. These main measures include the reduction of ungulate population levels and the optimization of their age structure and sex ratio, an increase in the number of overwintering enclosures and food fields for game and a change in the political approach to game management with sufficient consideration of forestry interests.

AB  - The extent of gene flow during the range expansion of non-native species influences the amount of genetic diversity retained in expanding populations. Here, we analyse the population genetic structure of the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in north-eastern and central Europe. This invasive species is of management concern because it is highly susceptible to fox rabies and an important secondary host of the virus. We hypothesized that the large number of introduced animals and the species' dispersal capabilities led to high population connectivity and maintenance of genetic diversity throughout the invaded range. We genotyped 332 tissue samples from seven European countries using 16 microsatellite loci. Different algorithms identified three genetic clusters corresponding to Finland, Denmark and a large 'central' population that reached from introduction areas in western Russia to northern Germany. Cluster assignments provided evidence of long-distance dispersal. The results of an Approximate Bayesian Computation analysis supported a scenario of equal effective population sizes among different pre-defined populations in the large central cluster. Our results are in line with strong gene flow and secondary admixture between neighbouring demes leading to reduced genetic structuring, probably a result of its fairly rapid population expansion after introduction. The results presented here are remarkable in the sense that we identified a homogenous genetic cluster inhabiting an area stretching over more than 1500km. They are also relevant for disease management, as in the event of a significant rabies outbreak, there is a great risk of a rapid virus spread among raccoon dog populations.

AB  - Stakeholder engagement has become increasingly important in research programs focusing on climate change impact on ecosystem services. Communication between researchers and stakeholders, however, is often impaired by linguistic barriers, different priorities, and time constraints. This article examines the organizational aspects of science-stakeholder interactions, focusing on examples from the Swedish forestry sector. The study highlights the need articulated by the Swedish forestry sector for access to scientific knowledge, and we discuss how to present research findings in formats suitable to serve as decision support. Clear communication about common goals, expectations, resources, and time frames is needed in order to reduce the risk of stakeholder fatigue.

AB  - 1. Large herbivores can control plant community composition and, under certain conditions, even induce vegetation shifts to alternative ecosystem states. As different plant assemblages maintain contrasting carbon (C) cycling patterns, herbivores have the potential to alter C sequestration at regional scales. Their influence is of particular interest in the Arctic tundra, where a large share of the world's soil C reservoir is stored.
   2. We assessed the influence of grazing mammals on tundra vegetation and C stocks by resampling two sites located along pasture rotation fences in northern Norway. These fences have separated lightly grazed areas from heavily grazed areas (in close proximity to the fences) and moderately grazed areas (further away from the fences) for the past 50years. Fourteen years earlier, the lightly and moderately grazed areas were dominated by dwarf shrubs, whereas heavy grazing had promoted the establishment of graminoid-dominated vegetation. Since then, both reindeer densities and temperatures have increased, and more time has passed for transient dynamics to be expressed. We expected that the vegetation and C stocks would have changed under all grazing intensities, but not necessarily in the same way.
   3. At the site where relative reindeer numbers and trampling intensity had increased the most, graminoid-dominated vegetation was now also found in the moderately grazed area. At the other site, the dominant vegetation types under all grazing intensities were the same as 14 years earlier.
   4. We show that the heavily grazed, graminoid-dominated areas stored less C above-ground than the lightly grazed, shrub-dominated areas. Yet, the below-ground consequences of grazing-induced grassification varied between the sites: Grazing did not alter organic soil C stocks at the site where both evergreen and deciduous shrubs were abundant in the lightly grazed area, whereas heavy grazing increased organic soil C stocks at the site where the deciduous shrub Betula nana was dominant.
   5. Our results indicate that, despite the negative impacts of grazers on above-ground C storage, their impact on below-ground C may even be positive. We suggest that the site-specific responses of organic soil C stocks to grazing could be explained by the differences in vegetation under light grazing. This would imply that the replacement of deciduous shrubs by graminoids, as a consequence of grazing could be beneficial for C sequestration in tundra soils.

AB  - Life cycle assessments (LCAs) of forest-based products, such as beverage cartons, generally demonstrate lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuel-based alternatives and often contain the implicit assumption that removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) by a growing forest and emission of CO2 at the end of a product's life cancel each other out such that the net emission is zero. This study aims to test the validity of this assumption of biogenic CO2 neutrality in relation to beverage cartons by examining whether carbon stocks of the source forests are stable. The fact that over 95 % of the cartonboard used in their manufacture is sourced from the boreal forests of Sweden and Finland provides a scenario with a straightforward relationship between forest and product thus avoiding issues surrounding the complexities of global supply chains.
   The reviewed LCAs conclude that beverage cartons have lower greenhouse gas emissions than alternatives, although non-forest-derived components such as plastic caps and aluminium laminate often contribute disproportionately to those emissions. We discuss issues surrounding the assumption of biogenic CO2 neutrality and explore the factors that influence carbon stocks in boreal forests that supply much of the raw material for beverage cartons.
   An analysis of published rates of carbon sequestration in the managed forests of Finland and Sweden reveals that forest carbon is stable under current harvest rates. This lends support to the assumption of biogenic CO2 neutrality in the case of beverage cartons produced from these forests. We conclude that greenhouse gas emissions would not change if an LCA included forest carbon. However, future forest dynamics and thus carbon stocks are predicted to alter in response to climate change, for example, which will have knock on effects for greenhouse gas emissions from packaging derived from forests.
   This review combines current thinking on inclusion of forest carbon in LCAs with an analysis of issues that will influence carbon stocks in managed forests. Although current assumptions of biogenic CO2 neutrality are valid in the case of European-manufactured beverage cartons, we argue that this assumption needs to be explicitly addressed in LCAs. While there is no accepted methodology for integrating biogenic forest carbon uptake into LCA, our assessment of current trends in forest carbon stocks allows for assumptions of biogenic CO2 neutrality to be tested, although our approach may not be practical for more complex supply chains.

AB  - This paper investigates the optimal choice of building energy efficiency (BEE) standard in the context of centralised urban district heating system in northern China. By employing a techno-economic analysis approach, we demonstrate that the current BEE standard implemented in the Chinese cities should be tightened further in order to achieve a socially optimal level. Without considering the externality costs associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, current BEE standards need to be upgraded to the equivalent level of French RT2005 standard coupled with a properly designed district coal-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP). In contrast, the equivalent efficiency standard of Swedish building code is preferably to be implemented in the case of explicit carbon emission restriction as long as the marginal cost of carbon emission (carbon price) is sufficiently high. The fuel-switching policy (from coal to natural gas) in the urban district heating system would result in significant increase in overall costs if the BEE upgrade is not taken into account simultaneously. It is also found that BEE improvements in northern Chinese cities are more cost-effective than investing in low-carbon technologies such as wind power or Carbon Capture and storage in the EU and US with regard to CO2 emissions mitigation.

AB  - Understanding the processes underlying diversification can aid in formulating appropriate conservation management plans that help maintain the evolutionary potential of taxa, particularly under human-induced activities and climate change. Here we assessed the microsatellite genetic diversity and structure of three salmonid species, two native (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout, Salmo trutta) and one introduced (brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis), from an alpine lake in sub-arctic Sweden, Lake Ann. The genetic diversity of the three species was similar and sufficiently high from a conservation genetics perspective: corrected total heterozygosity, H'(T) = 0.54, 0.66, 0.60 and allelic richness, A(R) = 4.93, 5.53 and 5.26 for Arctic charr, brown trout and brook charr, respectively. There were indications of elevated inbreeding coefficients in brown trout (G(IS) = 0.144) and brook charr (G(IS) = 0.129) although sibling relationships were likely a confounding factor, as a high proportion of siblings were observed in all species within and among sampling locations. Overall genetic structure differed between species, Fst = 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 in Arctic charr, brown trout and brook charr respectively, and there was differentiation at only a few specific locations. There was clear evidence of hybridisation between the native Arctic charr and the introduced brook charr, with 6% of individuals being hybrids, all of which were sampled in tributary streams. The ecological and evolutionary consequences of the observed hybridisation are priorities for further research and the conservation of the evolutionary potential of native salmonid species.

AB  - Even-aged forests usually act as carbon sinks during most of their rotation. However, after clearcut they become sources of carbon for a period of several years. Applying uneven-aged forest management with selective cuttings will maintain tree cover and reduce the environmental impact on forest floor. The aim of this study was to compare the soil CO2 efflux between uneven-aged and even-aged Norway spruce stands with similar site properties, to investigate the effect of management practices on soil CO2 efflux and its possible correlation with soil environmental and chemical properties. We measured soil CO2 efflux in even- and uneven-aged Norway spruce stands (Picea abies [L.] Karst) in southern Finland during the summer of 2013 using closed chamber method on fixed measuring points. The study included two uneven-aged stands and two even-aged stands (a clearcut site and a mature even-aged stand). Soil moisture and soil temperature were measured at the same time as soil CO2 efflux. Soil cores were collected from the topsoil of each study plot to determine soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Mean soil CO2 efflux through the summer was highest in the clearcut plot (0.367 mg m(-2) s(-1)) followed by the uneven-aged stands (0.298 and 0.257 mg m(-2) s(-1), respectively) and the smallest fluxes were measured in the mature even-aged stand (0.224 mg m(-1)s(-1)). There was no statistically significant difference in soil CO2 efflux between the even-and uneven-aged stands of the same site fertility. Even- and uneven-aged stands did not differ significantly in soil moisture or soil temperature. Soil CO2 efflux increased steadily with soil temperature, whereas increasing soil moisture considerably increased soil CO2 efflux at lower moisture levels but only moderately at higher soil moisture levels. Soil carbon and nitrogen concentration did not differ between the study plots of the same fertility. Uneven-aged structure forestry did not prevent the increase in soil CO2 efflux after cuttings. However, the large variation in soil CO2 efflux rates within the uneven-aged stands suggests that the stand level CO2 efflux can be controlled with the intensity of the cutting.

AB  - Genetic diversity is the basis for population adaptation and long-term survival, yet rarely considered in biodiversity monitoring. One key issue is the need for useful and straightforward indicators of genetic diversity. We monitored genetic diversity over 40 years (1970-2010) in metapopulations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) inhabiting 27 small mountain lakes representing 10 lake systems in central Sweden using >1200 fish per time point. We tested six newly proposed indicators; three were designed for broad, international use in the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and are currently applied in several countries. The other three were recently elaborated for national use by a Swedish science-management effort and applied for the first time here. The Swedish indicators use molecular genetic data to monitor genetic diversity within and between populations (indicators Delta H and Delta F-ST, respectively) and assess the effective population size (N-e-indicator). We identified 29 genetically distinct populations, all retained over time. Twelve of the 27 lakes harboured more than one population indicating that brown trout biodiversity hidden as cryptic, sympatric populations are more common than recognized. The N-e indicator showed values below the threshold (N-e <= 500) in 20 populations with five showing N-e < 100. Statistically significant genetic diversity reductions occurred in several populations. Metapopulation structure appears to buffer against diversity loss; applying the indicators to metapopulations suggest mostly acceptable rates of change in all but one system. The CBD indicators agreed with the Swedish ones but provided less detail. All these indicators are appropriate for managers to initiate monitoring of genetic biodiversity.

AB  - Global transformations extend beyond local habitats; therefore, larger-scale approaches are needed to assess community-level responses and resilience to unfolding environmental changes. Using long-term data (1996-2011), we evaluated spatial patterns and functional redundancies in the littoral invertebrate communities of 85 Swedish lakes, with the objective of assessing their potential resilience to environmental change at regional scales (that is, spatial resilience). Multivariate spatial modeling was used to differentiate groups of invertebrate species exhibiting spatial patterns in composition and abundance (that is, deterministic species) from those lacking spatial patterns (that is, stochastic species). We then determined the functional feeding attributes of the deterministic and stochastic invertebrate species, to infer resilience. Between one and three distinct spatial patterns in invertebrate composition and abundance were identified in approximately one-third of the species; the remainder were stochastic. We observed substantial differences in metrics between deterministic and stochastic species. Functional richness and diversity decreased over time in the deterministic group, suggesting a loss of resilience in regional invertebrate communities. However, taxon richness and redundancy increased monotonically in the stochastic group, indicating the capacity of regional invertebrate communities to adapt to change. Our results suggest that a refined picture of spatial resilience emerges if patterns of both the deterministic and stochastic species are accounted for. Spatially extensive monitoring may help increase our mechanistic understanding of community-level responses and resilience to regional environmental change, insights that are critical for developing management and conservation agendas in this current period of rapid environmental transformation.

AB  - This paper examines the integration of three approaches towards developing a transdisciplinary framework for the evaluation of benefits from the conversion of evenaged secondary Norway spruce stands into mixed uneven-aged woodlands. To pre- sent a whole nexus of causal relationships in social-ecological interactions inherent for the conversion processes in a systemic and condensed way and to provide a common point of reference for decision-makers we develop a conceptual model based on the DPSIR (Driving forces - Pressures - States - Impacts - Responses) approach. The Ukrainian Carpathians are used as a case study. An extension of the cascade ecosystem service model through integration of societal processes is proposed to strengthen the functionality of the model and to make it more applicable for addressing adaptive forest management and ecosystem-based forest governance. A non-parametric analysis of the stated stakeholders' preferences with a high statistical significance shows that the flow of ecosystem services from mixed forests is considered more valuable than that from spruce monocultures. For the valuation of benefits from forest conversion we propose an impact matrix that reflects existing dichotomies both in valuation techniques and among beneficiaries. This matrix could serve as a checklist for an appraiser. We conclude that a proper integration of several methodological approaches may assist researchers to overcome limitations of a narrow disciplinary perspective, to take advantages of quantitative as well as qualitative research methods and may allow a wider involvement of stakeholders in a more participatory decision-making in order to tackle the challenge of spruce stands decline.

AB  - Background: Atlantic salmon have been subject to domestication for approximately ten generations, beginning in the early 1970s. This process of artificial selection will have created various genetic differences between wild and farmed stocks. Each year, hundreds of thousands of farmed fish escape into the wild. These escapees may interbreed with wild conspecifics raising concerns for both the fish-farming industry and fisheries managers. Thus, a better understanding of the interactions between domesticated and wild salmon is essential to the continued sustainability of the aquaculture industry and to the maintenance of healthy wild stocks.
   Results: We compared the transcriptomes of a wild Norwegian Atlantic salmon population (Figgjo) and a Norwegian farmed strain (Mowi) at two life stages: yolk sac fry and post first-feeding fry. The analysis employed 44 k oligo-microarrays to analyse gene expression of 36 farmed, wild and hybrid (farmed dam x wild sire) individuals reared under identical hatchery conditions. Although some of the transcriptional differences detected overlapped between sampling points, our results highlighted the importance of studying various life stages. Compared to the wild population, the Mowi strain displayed up-regulation in mRNA translation-related and down regulation in nervous and immune system -related pathways in the sac fry, whereas up-regulation of digestive and endocrine activities, carbohydrate, energy, amino acid and lipid metabolism and down-regulation of environmental information processing and immune system pathways were evident in the feeding fry. Differentially regulated pathways that were common among life stages generally belonged to environmental information processing and immune system functional groups. In addition, we found indications of strong maternal effects, reinforcing the importance of including reciprocal hybrids in the analysis.
   Conclusions: In agreement with previous studies we showed that domestication has caused changes in the transcriptome of wild Atlantic salmon and that many of the affected pathways are life-stage specific We highlighted the importance of reciprocal hybrids to the deconvolution of maternal/paternal effects and our data support the view that the genetic architecture of the strains studied highly influences the genes differentially expressed between wild and domesticated fish.

AB  - The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is widely distributed in Europe, from Iberia and Italy to Scandinavia, and in New Zealand. They inhabit a wide range of environments, from natural habitats to urban areas. Finland is the northern edge of the current distribution area, which has expanded from Pleistocene refugia in Europe. Finnish hedgehogs are not only found in the suburbs, but also in urban areas such as the capital city, Helsinki. However, the phylogenetic relationships to other populations and the population structure were unknown for the urban hedgehogs in Helsinki. We reconstructed a molecular phylogeny and analyzed the population structure and genetic diversity from samples of 106 hedgehogs collected around Helsinki in 2017-2019, based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region and cytochrome b gene as well as 11 microsatellite loci. Our phylogenetic data indicate that the Helsinki population is closely related to the Estonian population. This means that at least part of the Helsinki population originates from Estonia, due to natural expansion from glacial refugia and anthropogenic introduction for vermin control, as shown in previous reports. The microsatellite data indicated that the Helsinki population is genetically homogeneous, with low genetic diversity. This may be due to the absence of effective geographic barriers to gene flow at present, but it is also possible that the subpopulations formed by migration are concealed by the genetic uniformity resulting from founder effect of natural expansion to the northward or artificial introduction. Further study is necessary to evaluate the effect of urban fragmentation in Helsinki.

AB  - The history of population size and migration patterns leaves its mark in the genetics of populations. We investigate the genetic structure of the edible frog, Pelophylax esculentus in the Danish archipelago and adjacent countries. This frog is of particular interest because it is a hybrid that, in this area, forms all-hybrid populations of diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR and LRR) genomotypes with no (or very few) adults of the parental species (LL and RR). This study is the first to cover the entire geographic range of Danish, Swedish and German all-hybrid populations, documenting their extent and providing a broad picture of their diversity of neutral genetic markers and genomotype proportions. With 18 microsatellite markers, we found that genetic diversity declines northwards in agreement with the glacial refuge and central-marginal hypotheses; however, populations on small and medium-sized islands are no less diverse than those on large islands and continental peninsulas. Isolation by distance exists across the archipelago with limited influence of fragmentation by brackish seawater. The extremely low genetic diversity in all-hybrid populations, compared with adjacent populations, may be responsible for the maintenance of their special breeding system. We also show large variation among ponds in proportions of LLR, LR and LRR genomotypes, but little geographic pattern in their distribution. Instead, we found relationships between the genomotype proportions and some of 15 habitat parameters monitored. Body size differences among LLR, LR and LRR further suggest ecological differences.

AB  - The recent expansion of the Oil and Gas Industry in to the deep waters of the UK Atlantic Frontier prompted the industry and its regulator to reappraise the needs and means of environmental monitoring. In concert, deep-sea academics, specialist contractors, the regulator and the Industry, through the Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network (AFEN), devised and implemented a large-scale environmental survey of the deep waters to the north and west of Scotland. The AFEN-funded survey was carried out during the summers of 1996 and 1998, and involved two steps; an initial sidescan sonar mapping of the survey areas, followed up with direct seabed investigations by coring and photography. This contribution deals with the latter step. Seabed samples were collected to assess sediment type, organic content, heavy metals, hydrocarbons and macrobenthos. Photographic and video observations were employed to provide both 'routine' seabed assessments and to investigate particular sidescan features of note. Although essentially intended as a 'baseline' environmental survey, anthropogenic impacts are already evident throughout the areas surveyed. Indications of the effects of deep-sea trawling were frequently encountered (seabed trawl marks and areas of disturbed sediments), being present in almost all of the areas studied and extending to water depths in excess of 1000 m. Evidence of localised contamination of the seabed by drilling muds was also detected, though background hydrocarbon contamination is predominantly of terrestrial origin or derived from shipping. The benthic ecology of the UK Atlantic Margin is dominated by the marked differences in the hydrography of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (FSC) and the Rockall Trough (RT). Comparatively warm North Atlantic Water is common to both areas; however, in the FSC, cold (subzero) waters occupy the deeper parts of the channel ( > 600 m). The extreme thermal gradient present on the West Shetland Slope has a substantial influence on the distribution and diversity of the macrobenthos. While there is continuous variation in the fauna with depth, warm and cold water faunas are nonetheless quite distinct. The boundary region, centred on 400m water depth, may be best characterised as an ecotone, having a mixed warm and cold water fauna with a distinctly enhanced diversity. The Wyville-Thomson Ridge largely prevents the cold waters of the deep FSC from entering the RT (they certainly do not influence the areas of the Malin/Hebrides Slope assessed during the survey). Consequently, the deep-water faunas north and south of the ridge are highly distinct. There is also a very marked difference in the diversity of the two faunas: diversity declines with depth in the FSC but increases with depth in the RT. The distribution of macrobenthos in the RT is largely continuous with depth, with little indication of local variations but some evidence of enhanced rates of change at around 1200 m, possibly associated with the presence of Labrador Sea Water. Other observations made during the course of the survey include: (a) the occurrence of sponge dominated communities ('ostebund') at mid-slope depths (ca. 500 m) north and west of Shetland; Cb) the discovery of a population of sediment surface dwelling enteropneusts associated with a sandy contourite deposit at the base of the West Shetland Slope (ca. 900m); (c) the widespread and abundant occurrence of phytodetritus in the RT but not the FSC; and fd) the discovery of the 'Darwin Mounds' at ca. 1000m in the northern RT, a field of numerous, small seabed mounds that support significant growths of the coral Lophelia pertusa.
   These mounds also have 'acoustically visible tails' with dense populations of xenophyophores (Syringammina fragilissima), a species found to be common elsewhere in the RT. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry in northern Sweden, Norway, and Finland is an extensive agroforestry system, and the management of reindeer occurs alongside other land uses such as forestry, hunting, and tourism. The economic, social, and environmental impact of using GPS collars to track the reindeer was evaluated in the Sami village of Njaarke in boreal Sweden. A second objective was to evaluate how adapted forest management influenced reindeer husbandry. The results show that the use of GPS tracking enables the improved monitoring of the reindeer but the financial costs were greater than the financial benefits. The increased income did not cover the costs of depreciation and maintenance. Whilst the labour inputs associated with reindeer husbandry were high, 30-40% of the gross value added by village activities were related to hunting, tourism, and the renting of fishing rights. The use of adaptive forest management was assumed to increase the number of reindeer that could be reared through to slaughter and it was calculated to increase the gross value added by reindeer husbandry by more than 30%.

AB  - To protect grasslands and maintain the ecosystem services they provide, many European countries have been offering agri-environment measures aimed at maintaining extensive grazing by cattle, sheep or goats. Yet, despite more than two decades of agri-environment measures, semi-natural mountain pastures are still seen as threatened by abandonment and subsequent shrub encroachment. Building on a three-round Delphi inquiry, we analyse the perception of a range of experts on how measures aimed at maintaining mountain grasslands are designed and implemented in Austria, France and Norway. Results show that the experts see the need for a stronger involvement of diverse regional actors, the need to increase the flexibility given to farmers in managing mountain grasslands, and the need to reconceptualise monitoring as a social learning process. While these approaches are implemented in some 'best practice' examples, they are not widespread. Understanding these approaches as requiring double-loop learning may contribute to explaining their limited spread. Indeed, they build on a radically different conceptualization of farmers and of researchers, and thus of how agri-environment measures need to be designed and implemented tabe effective. Yet, such radical changes are likely to be resisted.

AB  - Most experimental additions of nitrogen to forest ecosystems apply the N to the forest floor, bypassing important processes taking place in the canopy, including canopy retention of N and/or conversion of N from one form to another. To quantify these processes, we carried out a large-scale experiment and determined the fate of nitrogen applied directly to a mature coniferous forest canopy in central Maine (18-20 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) as NH4NO3 applied as a mist using a helicopter). In 2003 and 2004 we measured NO3-, NH4+, and total dissolved N (TDN) in canopy throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) events after each of two growing season applications. Dissolved organic N (DON) was greater than 80% of the TDN under ambient inputs; however NO3- accounted for more than 50% of TF N in the treated plots, followed by NH4+ (35%) and DON (15%). Although NO3- was slightly more efficiently retained by the canopy under ambient inputs, canopy retention of NH4+ as a percent of inputs increased markedly under fertilization. Recovery of less than 30% of the fertilizer N in TF suggested that the forest canopy retained more than 70% of the applied N (> 80% when corrected for N which bypassed tree surfaces at the time of fertilizer addition). Results from plots receiving N-15 enriched NO3- and NH4+ confirmed bulk N estimations that more NO3- than NH4+ was washed from the canopy by wet deposition. The isotope data did not show evidence of canopy nitrification, as has been reported in other spruce forests receiving much higher N inputs. Conversions of fertilizer-N to DON were observed in TF for both (NH4+)-N-15 and (NO3-)-N-15 additions, and occurred within days of the application. Subsequent rain events were not significantly enriched in N-15, suggesting that canopy DON formation was a rapid process related to recent N inputs to the canopy. We speculate that DON may arise from lichen and/or microbial N cycling rather than assimilation and re-release by tree tissues in this forest. Canopy retention of experimentally added N may meet and exceed calculated annual forest tree demand, although we do not know what fraction of retained N was actually physiologically assimilated by the plants. The observed retention and transformation of DIN within the canopy demonstrate that the fate and ecosystem consequences of N inputs from atmospheric deposition are likely influenced by forest canopy processes, which should be considered in N addition studies.

AB  - Chronosequences are commonly used to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration after land-use change, but SOC dynamics predicted by this space-for-time substitution approach have rarely been validated by resampling. We conducted a combined chronosequence/resampling study in a former cropland area (Vestskoven) afforested with oak (Quercus robur) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) over the past 40 years. The aims of this study were (i) to compare present and previous chronosequence trends in forest floor and top mineral soil (0-25 cm) C stocks; (ii) to compare chronosequence estimates with current rates of C stock change based on resampling at the stand level; (iii) to estimate SOC changes in the subsoil (25-50 cm); and (iv) to assess the influence of two tree species on SOC dynamics.
   The two chronosequence trajectories for forest floor C stocks revealed consistently higher rates of C sequestration in spruce than oak. The chronosequence trajectory was validated by resampling and current rates of forest floor C sequestration decreased with stand age. Chronosequence trends in topsoil SOC in 2011 did not differ significantly from those reported in 1998, however, there was a shift from a negative rate (1998: -0.3 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) to no change in 2011. In contrast SOC stocks in the subsoil increased with stand age, however, not significantly (P = 0.1), suggesting different C dynamics in and below the former plough layer. Current rates of C change estimated by repeated sampling decreased with stand age in forest floors but increased in the topsoil. The contrasting temporal change in forest floor and mineral soil C sequestration rates indicate a shift in C source-sink strength after approximately 40 years. We conclude that afforestation of former cropland within the temperate region may induce soil C loss during the first decades followed by a recovery phase of yet unknown duration.

AB  - Forest management decisions increasingly rely on modelling tools, which help identify future risks, optimize management decisions, and provide a suite of indicators beyond timber production. Here we developed and tested a novel simulation and upscaling framework (SUF) and used it for prognosing forest resources of the Czech Republic (Central Europe), which is currently one of Europe's hotspots of disturbance intensification. The SUF is based on an empirical forest model that simulates the development of 8 240 forest stands representing forest conditions in 206 administrative districts of the Czech Republic. The effect of natural disturbances is considered via empirical species-and age-specific mortality probability (MP) functions parameterized based on the national forest damage reports and remote sensing data. An upscaling procedure was developed to obtain district-and country-wide estimates. We tested this framework for its ability to (i) reproduce the initial forest conditions from the year 2003, (ii) reproduce forest dynamics in 2003-2016 (i.e., before the recent disturbance wave), (iii) reproduce the recent mortality pulse in 2017-2020, and (iv) generate plausible and consistent outputs under several disturbance and management settings in 2003-2050. The SUF reliably reproduced forest dynamics in both testing periods. The country-wide growing stock (GS) simulated for 2004-2050 oscillated around the initial value of 661 mill. m3 if the reference MP and management were considered. Using the elevated MP (corresponding with the recent disturbance period) increased the mean annual mortality rate from 0.78 % to 1.19 % and caused GS to decrease by 21 % in 2050. The wave of elevated mortality lasted 16 years, ceasing in 2033 due to the depletion of vulnerable stands. Reducing the rotation length by 40 % increased the harvests temporarily and caused GS to decrease by 29 and 33 % in 2050 under reference and elevated MP, respectively. At the same time, mortality was reduced by up to 18 % due to the removal of potentially vulnerable stands. The presented SUF is able to accommodate diverse forestry data, reproduce real forest dynamics, and generate outputs that correspond with the national forestry statistics. Flexible adoption of different mortality and management regimes makes it a versatile tool for supporting management decisions and policies. The presented simulations highlighted the negative prospects of the regional forests and the need for a profound transformation of management practices and the regional forest-based sector.

AB  - Fish communities in the shallow waters (9-20 m depth) of outer Malangen (69 degrees N), Northern Norway was studied to investigate effects of season, bottom substrate associations and population dynamic parameters on the fish assemblages. In four fieldtrips during one year at four locations, fish were sampled by trammel nets and bottom substrate composition was monitored by underwater video. A total of 16 species of fish were caught, including four species from Pleuronectidae and six from the Gadidae family. Cod (Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758) was the most numerous species followed by plaice (Pleuronectes platessa Linnaeus, 1758), lemon sole (Microstomus kitt Walbaum, 1792) and halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus Linnaeus, 1758). Cod dominated the catches in all months except March, in which plaice and other flatfishes were most dominant. On a community scale, fish species richness was highest in October and lowest in March. Furthermore, the species richness and diversity were generally higher at locations with greater bottom substrate evenness. Cod showed a positive association with large macroalgae coverage and were less numerous at locations dominated by sand and pebble. Plaice and common dab (Limanda limanda Linnaeus, 1758) showed positive associations with sand and pebble coverage, while lemon sole was more associated with maerl beds, cobble and low algae coverage. Only halibut younger than 8 years of age were observed, and the sampling areas are suggested to be nursery area for this species. Von Bertalanffy growth functions were estimated for cod, plaice and lemon sole, and the growth coefficient K of cod and plaice were higher than for populations from adjacent fjords or the North Sea populations. Total mortality rates of cod and plaice were lower than for areas further south, and this may contribute to high and relative stable biomasses in the shallow Malangen area.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ES) research is currently widely utilized. However, qualitative approaches and socio-cultural valuations of ES are still limited. This may undermine future landscape conservation initiatives because important services for people may not be captured. We performed 29 face-to-face semi-structured interviews to capture stakeholders' perceptions of ES from the largest area with oak wood-pasture landscapes in Sweden (Ostergotland County). A total of 34 ES were mentioned, and compared among stakeholders from public, private and civil sectors at local and regional levels of governance. Cultural ES were highlighted the most by respondents from both levels of governance. At the local level, respondents appreciated especially provisioning services. In contrast, regional level respondents showed more appreciation for supporting services. Private sector stakeholders emphasized provisioning ES, whereas the civil and public sector stakeholders highlighted cultural ES in terms of recreational values and landscape beauty. Supporting ES were considered only in relation to biodiversity, especially species and habitats linked to old oaks. Farmers and farming activities (especially grazing regimes) are crucial to support important oak wood-pasture ES. We discuss important ES as expressed by stakeholders and challengestor wood-pasture conservation in Sweden and elsewhere. To integrate the different demands of stakeholder groups into policy, enable cross-sectorial flexibility and policy regional adaptation for wood-pasture conservation, are current challenges future research should focus upon.

AB  - Woody pastures represent keystone habitats for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, contributing to increased resource availability, landscape heterogeneity and structural variability. High taxonomic diversity is closely linked to vegetation structure in woody pastures, but examining functional characteristics of species assemblages can shed more light on the ecological mechanisms driving divergent responses to habitat characteristics and help guide good management practices. To this end, we use a multi-taxa approach to investigate how plant, bat and bird taxonomic and functional diversity are affected by pasture tree and shrub density, structural complexity and proximate forest cover in southern Sweden. In particular, we use a trait exclusion approach to estimate the sensitivity of diversity-environment relationships to specific traits. We found little congruence between corresponding diversity metrics across taxa. Bird species richness responded stronger to environmental variables than functional diversity metrics, whereas the functional response to the environment was stronger than the taxonomic response among plants and bats. While increasing tree densities increased the taxonomic diversity of all three taxa, a simultaneous functional response was only evident for plants. Contrasting measures of vegetation structure affected different aspects of functional diversity across taxa, driven by different traits. For plants and birds, traits linked to resource use contributed particularly to the functional response, whereas body mass had stronger influence on bat functional diversity metrics. Multi-taxa functional approaches are essential to understand the effects of woody pasture structural attributes on biodiversity, and ultimately inform management guidelines to preserve the biological values in woody pastures.

AB  - The quantitative assessment of forest management impacts on ecosystem services calls for ecological models to be linked to forest planning systems. In these systems, such models are expected to produce valid and accurate predictions to quantify the effects of alternative forest management strategies on ecosystem services. As an example, we present an evaluation of the model for the percent cover of ground lichens in forests on mineral soils in Finland. First, the performance of the lichen cover model fitted to the data of forest vegetation surveyed in 1985-1986 was comprehensively validated with the data resurveyed on the same plots in 1995. The differences between the observed and predicted values in lichen cover were calculated and analysed. Second, stand-level analyses were conducted to validate the predicted development of lichen cover in accordance with the rotation length development and management of forest stands. Third, the impacts of forest management scenarios on the average lichen cover at regional level were calculated to validate the results over larger areas. Lichen cover was predicted by site fertility, growing stock, forest harvests, soil preparation and geographic location. Our evaluation suggested that the model logically predicted the 10-year change in lichen cover at the stand level. A negative bias was found in predictions especially on xeric sites in northern Finland, although this was not related to stand management, but probably to global greening and reindeer grazing. The model based on the cross-sectional vegetation survey data showed its ability to describe the long-term changes in lichen cover along with the development and management of stands in different site fertility classes. On xeric and barren sites, the analyses showed decreasing trends in the average lichen cover at the regional level during the 30-year simulation period. However, the development of the average lichen cover varied only slightly among the alternative forest management scenarios. This study provides a modelling approach to evaluate the impacts of forest management on ecosystem services, here the cover of ground lichens, as an indicator of forest biodiversity and quality of reindeer pastures.

AB  - 1. Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly used in policymaking to promote biodiversity and enhance ecosystem services through the protection, creation, restoration and connection of natural and man -made green areas.2. The EU Commission adopted in 2013, the concept as a strategy. When member states apply the policy, it is translated into specific bureaucratic and political systems, creating different "policy assemblages' of ideas and institutional features.3. We analyse the Swedish GI policy to draw conclusions about how it has been assembled in one particular member state and what that particular assemblage will imply for biodiversity conservation. In combination with understanding policies as assemblages, we use the "What's the problem represented to be'-approach as method.4. We show that the Swedish GI policy assemblage consists of a mix of policy ideas developed in Sweden and the EU. Despite the current strong focus on biodiversity conservation, the notion of land's multifunctionality, characterizing the EU strategy and the possibility to conserve biodiversity on land used for purposes other than conservation increasingly influence the Swedish policy as it is formed.5. Although the policy has the potential to mainstream biodiversity conservation measures across different sectors, based on our analysis of current discourse, its implementation will likely promote GI measures less disruptive to existing land use activities, making its capacity to halt biodiversity loss marginal.

AB  - Biodiversity and forest management are analyzed for a 500 ha privately owned forest within the Natura 2000 area "ROSCI0122 Muntii Fagaras". Habitat types and indicator species are identified to measure environmental quality. Working towards an integrated approach to conservation, a range of options that will result in sustainable forest management are then considered. For beech forests light heterogeneity emerges as a crucial management target to ensure tree species richness and structural diversity as a basis for saving indicator species such as Morimus funereus, Cucujus cinnaberinus, Bolitophagus reticulatus and Xestobium austriacum. For spruce forests thinning over a broad range of diameters and maintenance of veteran trees would provide habitats for indicator species such as Olisthaerus substriatus. The populations of a number of bird species would be increased by strip-harvesting slopes: species such as Tetrao urogallus, Bonasia bonasia and Ficedula parva prefer forest margins. Steep slopes, and the areas around springs and watercourses, as well as rock faces, should remain unmanaged. Future management should start with a grid-based inventory to create an objective database of forest structure and life. An example is presented for high-elevation spruce forest. The inventory should quantify the variations in diameter, height and volume of trees per unit area. Such data would allow the advanced planning of forest operations. We discuss a wide range of administrative and organizational changes; changes that are needed for the sustainable forest management of the vast close-to-natural forests of the Muntii Fagaras, the maintenance of the Nardus grasslands and the protection of wetland vegetation around springs and streams in this Natura 2000-area.

AB  - Objectives. To describe the lifestyle of the Sami of southern Lapland 50 to 70 years ago in relation to the present-day Sami and non-Sami populations and, thereby, to provide a basis for future studies of culturally related determinants of health and illness.
   Study design. A qualitative analysis, and a quantitative comparison of Sami and non-Sami groups.
   Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 elderly Sami concerning their parents' lifestyle and diet 50 to 70 years ago. Questionnaire data from 81 reindeer-herding Sami, 226 non-reindeer-herding Sami and 1,842 sex-, age- and geographically matched non-Sami from the population-based Vasterbotten Intervention Project were analysed by non-parametric tests and partial least squares methodology.
   Results. Surprisingly, fatty fish may have been more important than reindeer meat for the Sami of southern Lapland in the 1930s to 1950s, and it is still consumed more frequently by reindeer-herding Sami than non-reindeer-herding Sami and non-Sami. Other dietary characteristics of the historical Sami and present-day reindeer-herding Sami were higher intakes of fat, blood and boiled coffee, and lower intakes of bread, fibre and cultivated vegetables, compared with present-day non-Sami. Physical activity was also a part of the daily life of the Sami to a greater extent in the 1930s to 1950s than today. Sami men often worked far from home, while the women were responsible for fishing, farming, gardening (which was introduced in the 1930-1950 period), as well as housework and childcare.
   Conclusions. For studies investigating characteristic lifestyle elements of specific ethnic groups, the elements of greatest acknowledged cultural importance today (in this case reindeer meat) may not be of the most objective importance traditionally.

AB  - The need for monetary valuation of recreational ecosystem services in urban areas is greatly acknowledged in several contexts. Most often, studies provide a total value of recreational visits, but a separate contribution of ecosystem, cultural, and commercial services to the value of recreation in urban ecosystems is rarely provided. In this study, the recreational importance of an urban park including streams is assessed, and the welfare implications of planned future improvements in three types of service are revealed, i.e. the restoration of the reproductive brown trout population, an increased number of happenings or events, and the service of a cafeteria-restaurant. Travel cost and contingent behavior methods are combined, which has not previously been applied in such a context. The results show that people perceive the park's importance for their well-being. The improvements of each service separately tended to increase the value between 14% and 21%, and of all services simultaneously by 66%. Remarkably, individuals with low incomes valued the park more than wealthier individuals. As the park is a free access environment, this suggests that the improvement of its recreational possibilities may especially benefit those with fewer opportunities for chargeable free time activities. Respondents' awareness of the reconstruction and management project of the park and the streams tended to increase the number of visits to and value of the park. At the societal level, the stream restoration was found to be highly profitable.

AB  - The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires Member States to assess the costs and benefits of Programmes of Measures (PoMs) put in place to ensure that European marine waters achieve Good Environmental Status by 2020. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to carry out such an assessment whereby economic analysis is used to evaluate the outputs from ecological analysis that determines the expected effects of such management measures. This paper applies and tests an existing six-step approach to assess costs and benefits of management measures with potential to support the overall goal of the MSFD and discusses a range of ecological and economic analytical tools applicable to this task. Environmental cost-benefit analyses are considered for selected PoMs in three European case studies: Baltic Sea (Finland), East Coast Marine Plan area (UK), and the Bay of Biscay (Spain). These contrasting case studies are used to investigate the application of environmental cost-benefit analysis (CBA) including the challenges, opportunities and lessons learnt from using this approach. This paper demonstrates that there are opportunities in applying the six-step environmental CBA framework presented to assess the impact of PoMs. However, given demonstrated limitations of knowledge and data availability, application of other economic techniques should also be considered (although not applied here) to complement the more formal environmental CBA approach.

AB  - There is an increasing awareness of ecosystem services and use of ecological engineering in today's search for more sustainable wastewater treatment systems, but there is still great uncertainty about how to compare and evaluate the ecological sustainability of different systems. The aim of this study was to analyze the use of resources in three different wastewater treatment systems: (i) conventional three-step treatment (WWTP), (ii) conventional mechanical and chemical treatment complemented with a constructed wetland (TP + CW), and (c) treatment in a natural wetland (NW), and to investigate to what extent increased space, time, and dependence of ecosystem services could substitute for purchased input in wastewater treatment. In order to compare resources of different quality we used emergy analysis, assessing the amount of solar energy required, directly and indirectly, for a certain production. Emergy use due to purchased inputs and to local renewable inputs differed substantially between the three treatment system studies, with emergy ratios of purchased to local renewable inputs of 9:1, 141:1, and 3056:1 for NW, TP + CW, and WWTP, respectively. Total use of emergy per person equivalent (p.e.) and kg phosphorus was similar in all three systems, strengthening our hypothesis of unchanged total emergy use in systems of different purchased input and land use. However, in the present study, purchased input was not fully substituted, while the natural wetland, apart from requiring a large land area, also needed a lot of purchased resources to fulfil the strict rules for wastewater treatment prescribed by society.

AB  - Morphological divergence was evident among three sympatric morphs of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) that are ecologically diverged along the shallow-, deep-water resource axis in a subarctic postglacial lake (Norway). The two deep-water (profundal) spawning morphs, a benthivore (PB-morph) and a piscivore (PP-morph), have evolved under identical abiotic conditions with constant low light and temperature levels in their deep-water habitat, and were morphologically most similar. However, they differed in important head traits (e.g., eye and mouth size) related to their different diet specializations. The small-sized PB-morph had a paedomorphic appearance with a blunt head shape, large eyes, and a deep body shape adapted to their profundal lifestyle feeding on submerged benthos from soft, deep-water sediments. The PP-morph had a robust head, large mouth with numerous teeth, and an elongated body shape strongly related to their piscivorous behavior. The littoral spawning omnivore morph (LO-morph) predominantly utilizes the shallow benthic-pelagic habitat and food resources. Compared to the deep-water morphs, the LO-morph had smaller head relative to body size. The LO-morph exhibited traits typical for both shallow-water benthic feeding (e.g., large body depths and small eyes) and planktivorous feeding in the pelagic habitat (e.g., streamlined body shape and small mouth). The development of morphological differences within the same deep-water habitat for the PB- and PP-morphs highlights the potential of biotic factors and ecological interactions to promote further divergence in the evolution of polymorphism in a tentative incipient speciation process. The diversity of deep-water charr in this study represents a novelty in the Arctic charr polymorphism as a truly deep-water piscivore morph has to our knowledge not been described elsewhere.

AB  - This study investigates the diversity and taxonomy of a mainly marine group of species lacking chaetae currently assigned to the genus Marionina. This achaetous group includes four nominal species: M. achaeta (Hagen, ), M. achaeta sensu Lasserre, , M. nevisensis Righi & Kanner, and M. arenaria Healy, . As Lasserre's () M. achaeta appears to be morphologically different from its (then) senior homonym M. achaeta (Hagen, ), the replacement name M. nothachaeta nom. nov. is proposed for it. We studied the genetic and morphological diversity of achaetous specimens of Marionina collected in Florida, the Great Barrier Reef, New Caledonia, Sweden, England and the Bahamas. The collection localities are almost all supralittoral and often brackish-water habitats. Parts of the mitochondrial genes 12S, 16S, COI and the nuclear genes 18S, 28S and ITS were analysed to assess the genetic variation and phylogeny of the achaetous Marionina species. The molecular data reveal one monophyletic group of 11 separately evolving lineages, and between these lineages, K2P distances in the barcoding gene COI vary between 5.4 and 25.0%. On a morphological basis, the lineages could be assigned to seven different groups (morphotypes), of which only two could be identified as described nominal taxa: M. nevisensis s. lat. (several lineages) and M. nothachaeta. Since the former taxon appears to be a complex of cryptic species around the world and the original type material no longer exists, a neotype from the Caribbean was designated for M. nevisensis s. str. The remaining achaetous lineages represent five morphologically distinct species that are left unnamed, awaiting finer morphological scrutiny and detailed comparisons with new collections of M. achaeta and M. arenaria. Summing up, the group of achaetous Marionina now seems to contain up to 13 different species, seven of which are yet to be formally described and named.

AB  - Litter decomposition, a key process by which recently fixed carbon is lost from ecosystems, is a function of environmental conditions and plant community characteristics. In ice-rich peatlands, permafrost thaw introduces high variability in both abiotic and biotic factors, both of which may affect litter decomposition rates in different ways. Can the existing conceptual frameworks of litter decomposition and its controls be applied across a structurally heterogeneous thaw gradient? We investigated the variability in litter decomposition and its predictors at the Stordalen subarctic peatland in northern Sweden. We measured in situ decomposition of representative litter and environments using litter bags throughout two years. We found highly variable litter decomposition rates with turnover times ranging from five months to four years. Surface elevation was a strong correlate of litter decomposition across the landscape, likely as it integrates multiple environmental and plant community changes brought about by thaw. There was faster decomposition but also more mass remaining after two years in thawed areas relative to permafrost areas, suggesting faster initial loss of carbon but more storage into the slow-decomposing carbon pool. Our results highlight mechanisms and predictors of carbon cycle changes in ice-rich peatlands following permafrost thaw.

AB  - The grey wolf (Canis lupus) is an iconic large carnivore that has increasingly been recognized as an apex predator with intrinsic value and a keystone species. However, wolves have also long represented a primary source of human-carnivore conflict, which has led to long-term persecution of wolves, resulting in a significant decrease in their numbers, genetic diversity and gene flow between populations. For more effective protection and management of wolf populations in Europe, robust scientific evidence is crucial. This review serves as an analytical summary of the main findings from wolf population genetic studies in Europe, covering major studies from the 'pre-genomic era' and the first insights of the 'genomics era'. We analyse, summarize and discuss findings derived from analyses of three compartments of the mammalian genome with different inheritance modes: maternal (mitochondrial DNA), paternal (Y chromosome) and biparental [autosomal microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)]. To describe large-scale trends and patterns of genetic variation in European wolf populations, we conducted a meta-analysis based on the results of previous microsatellite studies and also included new data, covering all 19 European countries for which wolf genetic information is available: Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Belarus, Russia, Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Spain and Portugal. We compared different indices of genetic diversity in wolf populations and found a significant spatial trend in heterozygosity across Europe from south-west (lowest genetic diversity) to north-east (highest). The range of spatial autocorrelation calculated on the basis of three characteristics of genetic diversity was 650-850 km, suggesting that the genetic diversity of a given wolf population can be influenced by populations up to 850 km away. As an important outcome of this synthesis, we discuss the most pressing issues threatening wolf populations in Europe, highlight important gaps in current knowledge, suggest solutions to overcome these limitations, and provide recommendations for science-based wolf conservation and management at regional and Europe-wide scales.

AB  - Restoration of boreal forests by emulating natural disturbances is used to bring back typical components of natural forests that are reduced by silvicultural management. The volume, diversity and continuity of deadwood are the most important factors determining the diversity of deadwood-dependent species. In a large-scale experiment consisting of 43 experimental stands and 15 controls we assessed how alternative restoration methods enhancing deadwood availability (felling and felling + burning with two levels of felling: 20 and 40 % of initial volume of living trees, and a storm treatment) would affect short-and long-term deadwood volume and diversity using 7-year deadwood measurements and simulation modelling. In short-term, restoration by felling + burning increased both the volume and diversity of deadwood, whereas felling only increased merely the volume of deadwood. The simulations of tree growth, mortality and wood decomposition indicated that in comparison to controls, felled and storm-treated stands have greater deadwood volumes up to 40 years and felled + burned stands more than 60 years after restoration. Our results suggest that felling with 20 % of initial tree volume does not harm the future deadwood continuity, whereas intensive burning may imperil the deadwood continuity in a stand level. In conclusion, restoration clearly speeds up the development of the deadwood volumes needed to host large portions of biodiversity, and burning is the most effective restoration method in short- and long term. In practice, several restoration methods could be used concurrently in the landscape to obtain the best results.

AB  - In the 1930s, the Scandinavian brown bear was close to extinction due to vigorous extermination programmes in Norway and Sweden. Increased protection of the brown bear in Scandinavia has resulted in the recovery of four subpopulations, which currently contain close to 1000 individuals. Effective conservation and management of the Scandinavian brown bear requires knowledge of the current levels of genetic diversity and gene flow among the four subpopulations. Earlier studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity revealed extremely low levels of genetic variation, and population structure that grouped the three northern subpopulations in one genetic clade and the southernmost subpopulation in a second highly divergent clade. In this study, we extended the analysis of genetic diversity and gene flow in the Scandinavian brown bear using data from 19 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. Results from the nuclear loci were strikingly different than the mtDNA results. Genetic diversity levels in the four subpopulations were equivalent to diversity levels in nonbottlenecked populations from North America, and significantly higher than levels in other bottlenecked and isolated brown bear populations. Gene flow levels between subpopulations ranged from low to moderate and were correlated with geographical distance. The substantial difference in results obtained using mtDNA and nuclear DNA markers stresses the importance of collecting data from both types of genetic markers before interpreting data and making recommendations for the conservation and management of natural populations. Based on the results from the mtDNA and nuclear DNA data sets, we propose one evolutionarily significant unit and four management units for the brown bear in Scandinavia.

AB  - The aim of this study was to adapt the Soil-Plant-Nitrogen (SPN) model to silage maize, as an explorative tool for evaluating the possibility of expanding maize cultivation to regions which historically have been too cold for maize production, and for estimating the effects of management practices as fertiliser and manure application on C and N fluxes. The model was validated using data from a 5-year maize experiment conducted in northern Germany. Available observations included shoot biomass and N yield, soil mineral N (0-90 cm) sampled in spring and autumn, and nitrate in the soil solution during winter; occasionally also the soil water content and ground water level were recorded. The SPN crop module, originally developed for barley production in Norway, Was Successfully adapted to maize. The strategy adopted was to assess the maize-specific algorithms for the radiation use efficiency (RUE) and the leaf area index (LAI) by statistical analysis of selected Subsets of the available observations. In addition, parameters were modified with respect to crops characteristics. The baseline mineralisation of the SPN soil module was inspected with respect to the ability to predict both the observed plant N uptake and soil mineral N of the unfertilised plots. In order to predict the time course of plant N uptake it was necessary to incorporate a ploughing effect. as a transient mineralisation burst. The modified SPN was evaluated with respect to the whole range of mineral N and cattle Slurry treatments. Nitrogen and biomass yields were successfully predicted. The dynamicity of the soil mineral N prediction was reasonable, but a statistical analysis oft lie model performance was hampered by the selective timing of the soil samples. The good fit of the time Course of the plant N uptake under contrasting fertiliser treatments suggests that the predictions of soil N immobilisation and losses can also be assumed to be reasonable. The SPN model seems a suitable tool for the prediction of the effects of climate and management on the yield and on the soil-plant N economy of silage maize. However, under extreme combination of high radiation and low temperature or vice-versa, RUE estimation may be a source Of uncertainty and more empirical studies are recommended.

AB  - We explored the most influential stand-scaled drivers of ectomycorrhizal, terricolous saprotrophic, and wood-inhabiting (main functional groups) macrofungal species richness in mixed forests by applying regression models. We tested 67 potential explanatory variables representing tree species composition, stand structure, soil and litter conditions, microclimate, landscape structure, and management history. Within the main functional groups, we formed and modeled guilds and used their drivers to more objectively interpret the drivers of the main functional groups. Terricolous saprotrophic fungi were supported by air humidity and litter mass. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were suppressed by high soil nitrogen content and high air temperature. Wood saprotrophs were enhanced by litter pH (deciduous habitats), deadwood cover, and beech proportion. Wood saprotrophic guilds were determined often by drivers with hidden effects on all wood saprotrophs: non-parasites: total deadwood cover; parasites: beech proportion; white rotters: litter pH; brown rotters: air temperature (negatively); endophytes: beech proportion; early ruderals: deciduous stands that were formerly meadows; combative invaders: deciduous tree taxa; heart rotters: coarse woody debris; late stage specialists: deciduous deadwood. Terricolous saprotrophic cord formers positively responded to litter mass. Studying the drivers of guilds simultaneously, beech was a keystone species to maintain fungal diversity in the region, and coniferous stands would be more diverse by introducing deciduous tree species. Guilds were determined by drivers different from each other underlining their different functional roles and segregated substrate preferences. Modeling guilds of fungal species with concordant response to the environment would be powerful to explore and understand the functioning of fungal communities.

AB  - Understanding social-ecological system dynamics is a major research priority for sustainable management of landscapes, ecosystems and resources. But the lack of multi-decadal records represents an important gap in information that hinders the development of the research agenda. Without improved information on the long-term and complex interactions between causal factors and responses, it will be difficult to answer key questions about trends, rates of change, tipping points, safe operating spaces and pre-impact conditions. Where available long-term monitored records are too short or lacking, palaeoenvironmental sciences may provide continuous multi-decadal records for an array of ecosystem states, processes and services. Combining these records with conventional sources of historical information from instrumental monitoring records, official statistics and enumerations, remote sensing, archival documents, cartography and archaeology produces an evolutionary framework for reconstructing integrated regional histories. We demonstrate the integrated approach with published case studies from Australia, China, Europe and North America.

AB  - Conifer regeneration failure in the presence of dense ericaceous cover resulting from the removal of canopy trees by forest harvesting observed in boreal and temperate forest has been attributed to allelopathy, competition, and soil nutrient imbalance. Ecosystem-level alleopathic effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession. It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers, which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession. The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed.
   On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus. Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae. On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species.
   Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. If, on the other hand, the land management objective is to maintain heathlands for herbivore production or conservation of cultural landscape, as in the case of certain Calluna-dominated heathland in Western Europe, then moderately hot prescribed burning is useful as a management tool.

AB  - Stand-replacing disturbance and post-disturbance salvage-logging influence forest succession in different ways; however, limited knowledge regarding how salvage-logging affects vegetation patterns compared to natural development of forest ecosystems is still lacking. In this study, we described the diversity pattern of understory vegetation and tree regeneration in mountain spruce forest of Tatra Mountains, northern Slovakia, where a high severity windstorm affecting over 10,000 ha occurred in 2004. The area was consequently subjected to salvage-logging. We asked how the species composition, vegetation diversity, and its spatial heterogeneity were modified by severe salvage-logging. Vascular plants, deadwood coverage, and tree species densities were monitored on non-intervention (NI; n = 108) and salvage-logged (SL; n = 95) experimental plots (spatially nested design, sample plot area 3.14 m(2)) six and seven years after disturbance, respectively. The NI sites were structurally more diverse with post-windstorms legacies such as deadwood and pit and mound topography being recorded. The NI plots contained more late-successional plant and moss species that are commonly found in the pre-disturbance forest. The NI plots were also more diverse in terms of alpha- and beta-diversity with abundant natural regeneration of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst). The structure of SL site was more homogeneous and its species composition shifted towards being dominated by grasses, although the site accommodated a higher number of plant species due to newly established pioneer plant- and tree species. The retreat of late-successional species in favour of grasses can lead to structural and functional homogenization of habitat and to delayed succession towards establishment of spruce forest. We conclude that the removal of wind-disturbance legacies significantly diverts natural successional pathways. We recommend avoiding salvage-logging in protected areas since large-scale application of salvage-logging reduces beta-diversity of the landscape.

AB  - Background: Vegetation parameters determining nest site selection by the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius were studied in a typical habitat where dormice are relatively common in Lithuania, the northern periphery of its distributional range.
   Results: Dormice preferred nest sites with a better-developed understory, particularly with a good cover of hazel shrubs taller than 4 m and plentiful bird cherry trees, a high diversity of woody plant species in the understory and overstory, and better connectivity of the nest tree with its surroundings. They avoided sites with a high number of mature Norway spruce trees in the canopy and a high density of young trees. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, three vegetation parameters of the number of shrub species, the cover of hazel shrubs, and the number of Norway spruce trees in the canopy determined over 85% of the index of nestbox use by M. avellanarius. The number of shrub species in the surroundings of the nest site had the highest impact of all. Nest sites used by dormice for breeding were distinguished by a better-developed understory, particularly by a significantly higher number of bird cherry trees and a lower number of Norway spruce trees in the canopy, as well as a higher diversity of plants in the understory and overstory.
   Conclusions: Selection of nest sites by M. avellanarius is a combination of safety from predators and the presence of food. A well-developed inter-connected understory ensures the safety of nest sites from predators, and the diversity of understory and overstory species guarantees continuity of the food supply in the vicinity of nest sites.

AB  - Soil communities are considered to be remarkably species-rich and to have many generalist species with seemingly similar niche requirements. The composition of soil fauna communities is often highly variable even at the plot scale, and both the environment and the spatial configuration of microhabitats are regarded as important forces shaping the structure of local communities. However, to what extent these forces are important in different ecosystems is not clear. We examined the relative roles of environmental (abiotic), vegetation (biotic) and spatial variables (using Moran's eigenvector maps, MEM) for the small-scale variation in springtail (Collembola) communities in a 100 m(2) area of the forest floor of a mature Scots pine forest in central Sweden, with small variation in important environmental variables.
   We found that most of the small-scale variation in community composition could be explained by spatial variables, either alone or jointly with the environmental variables. Spatial variability in community composition, in turn, could be related to shifts in functional traits of the component species. Within local communities (samples), species showed a higher diversity than expected by chance in almost all examined traits, indicating that differences in resource and micro-habitat utilisation enable Collembola species to coexist. Competition between species is therefore likely to be important for structuring Collembola communities at this spatial scale. The results indicate that the spatial scale of study and heterogeneity of environmental factors influence soil fauna community assembly processes through effects on the relative importance of environmental filtering compared to filtering by limiting similarity or competitive exclusion.

AB  - AimFreshwater biodiversity is declining world-wide as a result of human-caused degradation of freshwater ecosystems. Declines in species richness are well documented for many taxonomic groups, but less is known about how and why species composition and beta diversity () change in response to environmental degradation in freshwater environments.
   LocationThe Mid-Atlantic Highlands region of the USA (36-42 degrees N, 74-82 degrees E) and Finland in northern Europe (60-68 degrees N, 20-32 degrees E).
   MethodsWe used null models, occupancy analyses, ordinations and multitaxon niche models to assess how of stream macroinvertebrate assemblages in two biogeographically distinct regions responded to environmental alteration and what mechanisms were most likely to have caused the observed differences in .
   ResultsMacroinvertebrate assemblages at anthropogenically disturbed sites were significantly more dissimilar from one another than were reference sites, a result contrary to those reported in several other studies. In this study, anthropogenic disturbances decreased the regional prevalence of most common taxa and increased the prevalence of several less common taxa. These differences in taxon occupancies and between the reference condition and disturbed streams are unlikely to be the result of a single mechanism, although environmental filtering was probably of primary importance.
   Main conclusionsThe effects of anthropogenic disturbance on assemblage composition can be variable and probably depend on: initial ecological conditions; the magnitude, type and uniformity of environmental alteration occurring in a region; and the sensitivity of individual taxa. It is unlikely that is controlled by a single mechanism, and these variable mechanisms may have diverse effects on taxon occupancies and hence . Restoration ecologists will need to consider how varies naturally across different landscape settings and in response to different types of disturbance when developing region-wide restoration strategies.

AB  - The erosion of domestic animal diversity due I to natural causes and creative human activity is of serious concern if current production levels are to be sustained and the changing demands of future markets are to be addressed. The application of quantitative genetic principles that have proven to be successful in the genetic improvement of livestock and poultry species has made it possible to combine endangered landrace, population or breed with one or more established breeds into multi-breed (composite) populations for specific objectives. he formation of composite populations does not directly increase the number of animals in breeds under threat of being endangered or extinct. However, the high productivity of the newly developed composite population not only promotes the conservation 4 the inherent potential in some rare breeds with considerable genetic merit but can ensure their utilization to satisfy varying husbandry practices, marketing forces and consumer preferences for future markets of animals and animal products. The higher reproductive rate and lower generation interval are performance traits of economical importance to breed formation in sheep and goats where a larger number of breeds are associated with some degree of risk and declining at rates that may reach critical levels in the near future. The Finnish Landrace sheep, outstanding in fecundity, first brought to attention in 1963 has since been imported by more than 40 countries and combined with breeds established in the country to form composite populations contributing towards substantial reduction in ewe costs per unit of lamb marketed. This is a typical example of conservation with utilization. In the past centuries, more than 443 composite breed populations of sheep have been developed in 68 countries. At the same time in goats, there are more than 80 composite breed populations in 37 countries. Finally, the enhanced production efficiencies in the newly developed composite population provide an opportunity for exploiting genetic diversity to the benefit of the livestock and poultry industries, and at the same time conserving the inherent potential of the foundation breeds.

AB  - Aims The area influenced by road construction is large, and measures to re-establish vegetation in disturbed areas are routinely carried out to reduce impacts on biodiversity. However, goals of mitigation measures are often unclear, and the effects on biodiversity of mitigation measures is rarely monitored. We assessed the effects of different revegetation treatments (natural revegetation, seeding, planting) on vegetation development along highways, and on wildlife crossings of different age. Location Highways in southeast Norway. Methods We collected data on vascular plant species, vegetation cover and height, soil grain size and organic matter content, and compared the species composition, richness, and diversity of the restored sites with reference plots in the adjacent target vegetation (mature forest). Results Our results show a significantly higher richness and diversity in restored plots compared to reference plots, and an increased similarity of species composition over time. Species composition was most similar to reference plots in naturally revegetated plots and seeding seemed to reduce both species and functional trait composition similarity. Conclusions It is unrealistic that the defined target vegetation will develop on restored sites. Defining a realistic and achievable target vegetation for each road construction project in relation to land use, adjacent vegetation type and successional stage, as e.g., forest edge instead of forest, would be useful. While this may require more effort for management it will translate to higher mitigation success.

AB  - Chronic nitrogen (N) deposition from anthropogenic emissions alter N cycling of forests in Europe and in other impacted areas. It disrupts plant/microbe interactions in originally N-poor systems, based on a symbiosis of plants with ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM). ECM fungi that are capable of efficient nutrient mining from complex organics and their long-distance transport play a key role in controlling soil N mineralization and immobilization, and eventual nitrate (NO3-) leaching. Current meta-analyses highlight the importance of ECM biomass in securing the large soil N pool. At the same time, they point to the adverse effect of long-term N input on ECM fungi. The functioning of N-poor and N-overloaded forests is well understood, while the transient stages are much less explored. Therefore, we focused on the spruce-forest dominated catchment at Gardsjon (Sweden) that received N addition of 40 kg N ha(-l) yr(-1) over 24 years (a cumulative N input of >1200 kg N ha(-1)) but still loses via runoff only <20% of annual N input (deposition + addition) as NO3-. We found that, compared to the control, the N-addition catchment had a much larger soil microbial biomass. The N addition did not change the fungi/ bacteria ratio, but a larger share of the bacterial community was made up of copiotrophs. Furthermore, fungal community composition shifted to more nitrophilic ECM fungi (contact and short exploration type ECM species) and saprotrophs. Such a restructured community has been more active, possessed a higher specific respiration rate, enhanced organic P and C mining through enzymatic production and provided faster net N mineralization and nitrification. These may be early indications of alleviation of N limitation of the system. We observed no signs of soil acidification related to N additions. The larger, structurally and functionally adapted soil microbial community still provides an efficient sink for the added N in the soil and is likely to be one of the explanations for low NO3- leaching that have stabilized in the last decade. Our results suggest that a microbial community can contribute to effective soil N retention in spite of the partial relative retreat (20-30%) of nitrophobic ECM fungi with large external mycelia, provided the fungal biomass remains high because of replacement by other ECM and saprotrophic fungi. Furthermore, we assume that N retention of similar C-rich boreal forests (organic soil molar C/N similar to 35) is not necessarily threatened by a large cumulative N dose provided N enters at a moderate rate, does not cause acidification and the soil microbial community has time to adapt through structural and functional changes.

AB  - Northern peatlands are important carbon (C) reservoirs, storing about one-third of the global terrestrial soil C pool. Anthropogenic influences, such as drainage for agriculture and forestry, lower the originally high groundwater level, leading to peat aeration and decomposition. This is particularly reflected in significant losses of CO2, while fluxes of N2O and CH4 are generally considered of minor importance for the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of cultivated peatlands in Scandinavia. Setting land aside from agricultural production has been proposed as a strategy to reduce GHG emissions from drained peatland, restore natural habitats, and increase C sequestration. However, the evidence for this is rather scarce unless drainage is terminated. In this study, we measured respiration using dark automatic chambers, and CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes using manual static chambers, on: 1) cultivated peatland and 2) adjacent set-aside peatland in Central Sweden. The set-aside site was found to be a greater source of respiration than the cultivated site, while higher N2O fluxes and lower CH4 uptake rates were observed for the cultivated site. However, to compare the full GHG balance and assess the abandonment of drained cultivated peatland, additional measures, such as gross primary production (GPP) but also dissolved organic C losses would have to be taken into account.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability plays a crucial role for carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effect of nutrient supply on soil organic matter decomposition and microbial metabolism is generally not well understood. In this study, we incubated soils with three contrasting nutrient regimes from each of three Swedish long-term agricultural experiments (>45 years, 7-30% clay), namely an unfertilised control (0NPK), high P but no N fertilisation (PK0N) and high N but no P fertilisation (N-0pk). In the laboratory, we amended all soils with no fertiliser or with N, P and N P, with and without glucose, and monitored CO2 and heat production over five hours. Significant effects of the treatments were observed when nutrients were added in combination with glucose. Averaged over all field treatments, Glucose + N addition reduced CO2 and heat production by 14% and 14%, respectively, compared with glucose addition alone, while glucose + P addition increased CO2 and heat production by 17% and 9%, respectively. Similar results were found comparing the contrasting long-term field-treatments: PK0N showed higher glucose-induced CO2 and heat production per unit SOC than 0NPK, while both variables were suppressed in N-0pk-fertilised soils. Basal respiration per unit soil organic carbon (SOC) proved to be linked to long-term losses in SOC stocks, which were highest in the PK0N-fertilised plots at all three sites. Combined analyses of field and laboratory treatments revealed that the suppressing effect of laboratory N-addition on respiration only occurred in N-deficient soils, which clearly indicates that long-term N-addition alleviated N-mining. In conclusion, N and P showed opposing effects on the microbial metabolic processes, including respiration. The observed effects were similar in the short- and long-term and across different sites, which suggests that direct physiological controls of nutrients on microbial metabolism strongly regulate SOC turnover. Short-term nutrient effects were only observed in combination with a labile C source and the N-effect was restricted to N-deficient soils. Therefore, we conclude that those findings might be more important for nutrient-poor but carbon-rich ecosystems exposed to sudden nutrient inputs in comparison with nutrient rich and relatively carbon poor agricultural systems.

AB  - This study investigates outdoor recreation participation within a multifunctional landscape, a UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve. The reserve, the Kristianstad Vattenrike located in southern Sweden, has made a deliberate effort to make the experience of biodiversity possible for residents and visitors. Recreation is a key part of the biodiversity conservation effort in the area, represented by the infrastructure of the Kristianstad Vattenrike's 21 visitor sites. Given the biosphere reserve context, this study investigates the question of whether there is a relationship between outdoor recreation participation and place attachment. Survey data was collected using concurrent application of multiple sampling strategies including both probability and purposive sampling of local adult residents of the biosphere area. Quantitative analysis showed a significant positive relationship between the level of outdoor recreation participation and place attachment. Qualitative data supported this relationship with more details about place attachment within the studied area. The study confirms a relationship between place attachment and outdoor recreation and provides insight into how the biosphere reserve context supports this relationship. The results of this study show that significant biodiversity management in close conjunction with outdoor recreational opportunity can be achieved and provides opportunities for human engagement and experience of biodiversity.
   Management Implications: This research can help managers design recreational settings that support biodiversity conservation goals. Our research found that:
   A leading motivation for outdoor recreation participation is nature experience and this motivation can be used by managers to highlight a biodiversity conservation interpretive message in the design of outdoor recreation infrastructure.
   Providing proximate access to nature based outdoor recreation, to support deliberate and direct experience of biodiversity, is an important component of engaging the public in biodiversity conservation.
   Recreation proximity alone will not create public engagement in biodiversity conservation. However, proximity as a part of a deliberate institutional design including biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, and logistic support for research and monitoring may be critical for public engagement.

AB  - The intensification of agriculture has led to a dramatic decrease in traditional forest pastures in Northern Europe. Furthermore, the remaining forest pastures have often lost their typical characteristics due to eutrophication and forestry practices. We investigated whether the common management practice of fencing forest pastures within the same enclosures as fertilized grassland pastures leads to eutrophication and the consequent decline of bryophyte and vascular plant diversity in Finnish forest pastures, given that when cattle can freely roam between the fertilized grassland pastures and unfertilized forest pastures, nutrients are transported to the forest pastures in the feces and urine of the grazing animals. We found that grazing led to higher electrical conductivity and potassium (K) levels in the forest pastures (n = 18) compared to the background levels in adjacent non-grazed forests (n =18). Vascular plant species richness and diversity (Shannon's entropy) were higher and community structures different in the forest pastures compared to the adjacent forests. Highest species richness was observed in the forest pastures that were unconnected to fertilized grasslands (n = 7). Connection here refers to the situation where cattle can access both forest pasture and adjacent fertilized grassland simultaneously. Furthermore, many species indicative of valuable semi-natural pasture biotopes were found only in these traditionally managed forest pastures. In contrast, bryophyte species richness did not differ between the forests and the two types of forest pastures. Moreover, bryophyte communities largely overlapped between the forests and the forest pastures. Our results indicate that even if the forest pastures connected to the fertilized grasslands sustain plant communities that are characteristic of unfertilized semi-natural forest pastures, the conservational quality and diversity of vascular plant communities in particular may be reduced in comparison to the forest pastures without grassland connection. This decline can, at least partially, be caused by the transport of nutrients to the forest pastures and, hence, we recommend that forest pastures are not connected with fertilized grasslands.

AB  - Six stations in Oresund and Skalderviken between Kattegat and the Baltic were revisited in 1990. These were originally established in 1910-1912 before large-scale industrialization and modern agriculture began. Total biomass and abundance were generally higher in the 1990 samples and the species' average size was significantly smaller. Fewer benthic fauna communities, fewer species and increased dominance of the ophiuroid Amphiura filiformis were noted. Generally, the changes indicate a transition from great biological variation, with different dominants, to conditions where a few species dominate, especially Amphiura filiformis and deposit-feeding polychaetes. The changes in species composition were supported by other data from early in the 1900s and from surveys performed in 1989-2000. These confirmed several of the observations made in 1990. The observed fauna changes correspond in several aspects with results from the Oslo Fjord, Skagerrak, Kattegat and the Belts, suggesting certain large-scale changes and emphasizing the need to study the biological diversity and distribution of species. Some of these changes seem to have taken place during the last decades, parallel with increased nutrient load to the coastal waters, with subsequent high sedimentation of organic material and oxygen deficiency. High concentrations of different xenobiotics, e.g. organic tin compounds, might explain why some species of gastropods are very rare today. Trawling or changed hydrographical conditions are not likely to have caused the observed great structural changes. Considering the high turnover of water in Oresund, an impact in this area is particularly alarming.

AB  - Light is a vital factor affecting tree growth, survival and reproduction. In forests, natural and anthropogenic disturbances are the main drivers of abrupt changes in environmental conditions, including solar irradiance. We examined interspecific differences in the responses of European beech and silver fir to canopy gap characteristics and positions within gaps across various life stages (small seedlings, tall seedlings and saplings) in old-growth stands in Swietokrzyski National Park, Central Poland. Additionally, we analyzed sapling architectural responses to light. Regeneration densities were strongly affected by gap characteristics. The largest interspecific differences in responses to gap characteristics were found for small seedlings, which indicated their different preferences not only for light conditions created within gaps, but also toward various microsites distributed on a fine-scale after gap creation. Small beech seedlings responded only to the position within the gap, but small fir seedlings reacted in a more complex way, including such variables as gap size, shape and distance from a gap border. Gap size and the distance from its border had the most noticeable positive effect on tall seedlings and saplings, indicating that successful transition of regeneration to taller life stages may be possible only in larger gaps and in places further from a canopy border. Light conditions did not affect sapling length to diameter ratio. However, both direct and diffuse light had a negative effect on beech and fir crown area and length. Fir had wider but shorter crowns compared with beech in the whole light spectrum. This result indicates that these two species might have contrasting strategies regarding light interception, with fir being better adapted to increase a crown laterally, and with beech either being more tolerant to self-shading than fir or able to keep a favorable spatial leaf arrangement to avoid self-shading. Beech had the highest height growth increments in low levels of direct light, but its height growth was positively affected by diffuse light. Fir height growth rates showed no response to direct light, but were highest in medium levels of diffuse light. No effect of light on beech height to lateral growth rate ratio was found. The effect of direct light on this parameter for fir was negative, and nonlinear in the case of diffuse light, with the highest ratios observed in medium light levels. Our results stress the need of using both direct and diffuse light when analyzing light effects on sapling architecture.

AB  - The aim of our study was to experimentally investigate whether it is possible to reduce nuisance growth of filamentous algae in freshwater ecosystems. We used an experimental set-up mimicking a shallow pond system and performed a field investigation in the eutrophic moat of Krapperup castle (Southern Sweden), which exemplifies an extremely impaired ecosystem with ample growth of filamentous green algae. The indoor experiment tested three treatments: I) reduced nutrient concentrations, II) invertebrate grazers and III) addition of barley straw, which may constitute measures against filamentous algal growth and thereby improve the quality of the ecosystem services provided by water bodies. Our results show a decrease in cyanobacteria and diatom abundances in all mesocosms as filamentous algae biomass increased, suggesting that the microalgae suffered from nutrient and light competition with filamentous algae. A tendency for lower filamentous algae final biomass, as well as coverage, was observed in the treatment where the concentration of nutrients was reduced. Grazers treatment showed a tendency to inhibit filamentous algae growth on artificial macrophytes towards the end of the experiment, suggesting that snails initially fed on their preferred food source (diatoms), until it was almost depleted and then started to feed on filamentous algae. Interestingly, the barley straw treatment was the only treatment promoting macrophytes growth and enhancing diatom biomass, but this did not affect filamentous algae biomass. However, the ratio between filamentous algae and macrophyte final biomasses was significantly lower in the straw treatment. In a broader context, it is likely that in a long-term perspective the positive effect of barley straw on macrophyte growth will promote a shift from dominance by filamentous algae to macrophytes as main primary producer. Moreover, our experiment shows that barley straw may be effective in reducing cyanobacterial growth, which may lead to improved water quality and thereby ecosystem services, such as supporting and cultural ecosystem services, since cyanobacteria may produce potent toxins and pose a serious risk to human and animal health. Altogether, our experimental results have important implications for the challenge of reversing nuisance filamentous algal blooms in highly eutrophic systems.

AB  - In the Norwegian North Sea, the Sleipner field produces gas with a high CO2 content. For environmental reasons, since 1996, more than 11 Mt of this carbon dioxide (CO2) have been injected in the Utsira Sand saline aquifer located above the hydrocarbon reservoir. A series of seven 3D seismic surveys were recorded to monitor the CO2 plume evolution. With this case study, time-lapse seismics have been shown to be successful in mapping the spread of CO2 over the past decade and to ensure the integrity of the overburden.
   Stratigraphic inversion of seismic data is currently used in the petroleum industry for quantitative reservoir characterization and enhanced oil recovery. Now it may also be used to evaluate the expansion of a CO2 plume in an underground reservoir. The aim of this study is to estimate the P-wave impedances via a Bayesian model-based stratigraphic inversion.
   We have focused our study on the 1994 vintage before CO2 injection and the 2006 vintage carried out after a CO2 injection of 8.4 Mt. In spite of some difficulties due to the lack of time-lapse well log data on the interest area, the full application of our inversion workflow allowed us to obtain, for the first time to our knowledge, 3D impedance cubes including the Utsira Sand. These results can be used to better characterize the spreading of CO2 in a reservoir. With the post-stack inversion workflow applied to CO2 storage, we point out the importance of the a priori model and the issue to obtain coherent results between sequential inversions of different seismic vintages. The stacking velocity workflow that yields the migration model and the a priori model, specific to each vintage, can induce a slight inconsistency in the results.

AB  - The spatial display of fire over time on the landscape is ecologically important, and spatially explicit analyses offer a possibility of revealing anthropogenic influence on fire regimes. Nonetheless few such analyses have been attempted for longer time frames. We identified past fires in a northern Swedish boreal landscape using fire scars on Pinus sylvestris trees. Within a 19 X 32 km area, local fin chronologies were established at 203 points by cross-dating fire scars on 1133 wood samples, the earliest dating back to the 1100s. A total of 349 separate fires were identified to location and size. The estimated number of fires per unit area and time (after correcting for varying sample density over time) was relatively constant at 0.095 fires.(10(4) ha)(-1).yr(-1) from 1350 to 1650. It increased gradually thereafter, except for a low period in the early 1700s, peaked at 1.17 fires (10(4) ha)(-1) yr(-1) in the mid-1800s, and then dropped dramatically after 1860. The proportion of the area burned per unit time also increased after 1650, in parallel with the increase in the number of fires (although much less strongly due to a counteracting trend in fire size), from an annual rate of 0.8% prior to 1650 to 2.8% in the mid-1800s. Prior to 1650, 90% of the total burned area was due to fires larger than 1000 ha, compared to 55% after 1650. This decrease in fire size with increasing number of fires may be an intrinsic property of the system: a negative feedback caused by lack of fuel in early succession. Fire intervals shorter than 15 yr were rare, and there was an increase in the hazard of burning during the first 3-5 decades after fire, suggesting an effect of fuel accumulation. Thus, the proportion of the area burned per unit time does not increase linearly with the number of fires in the landscape, because the probability that fires will stop at boundaries with recently burned areas increases over fires.
   The changes in the number of fires per unit time mirror changes in the cultural use of the land, i.e., the gradual expansion of permanent settlements in the area after the late 1600s. They are not explained by changes in climate records. This suggests that the increase in fire numbers from the second half of the 1600s represents an increase in anthropogenic fires. Before 1650, the number of fires detected per unit area and time was only marginally different from the present-day density of lightning ignitions in the region (similar to 0.1 fires (10(4) ha)(-1) yr(-1)), whereas during the mid 1800s it was 11.7 times higher.
   These results show that large alterations in the fire regime can occur without substantial changes in the proportion of area burned per unit time, as exemplified by the trend after 1650, when there were concurrent changes in the number of fires and in average fire size. Therefore, the number of fire events per unit area and time should be an important variable in the analysis of fire history and its underlying causes.

AB  - The UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative has recently developed a guideline framework for land use impact assessment. This article evaluates the feasibility and highlights the challenges of applying a set of methods that adhere to this framework, and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the indicators used in these methods, for the purpose of supporting further methodological development.
   The methods were tested in two case studies of animal protein production in Sweden: dairy milk and pork. The reference situations were defined as the potential natural vegetation. County-level characterization factors (CFs) were calculated and occupation impacts were assessed for five ecosystem services, using six ecosystem service indicators: carbon flow change, groundwater recharge, mechanical filtration capacity, physicochemical filtration capacity, soil loss, and soil organic carbon, at two geographic scales: county and biome. Strengths and weaknesses of the ecosystem service indicators were identified using an evaluation framework for selected quality characteristics: representativeness, reliability, feasibility, and transparency.
   Occupation impacts at the two geographic scales, and for the two production cases, differ both in absolute numbers, and-for mechanical and physicochemical filtration capacity-in the ranking of cases. Results at both geographic scales indicate positive effects-or lower negative impacts-in protein production from dairy milk compared to pork, due to grass production on dairy farms, and lower use of land per unit protein. However, some of the observed benefits may be exaggerated due to challenges in adequately representing the reference situations. Most indicators were assigned medium or high degrees of representativeness, feasibility, and transparency, but several were assigned low degrees of reliability, due to the weak scientific basis upon which they were selected, low degrees of accuracy, and insufficient information on how they should be assessed.
   Occupation impact results should be interpreted with caution due to challenges in applying the methods and use of indicators with identified weaknesses. The most challenging part of developing regionalized CFs was finding suitable land areas from which to derive representative data to parameterize the reference situations. More research is needed to provide adequate support to life cycle assessment practitioners who wish to calculate regionalized CFs and to address the identified weaknesses.

AB  - IntroductionAs suspension-feeders, bivalves play a key role in maintaining regulatory functions of coastal ecosystems, which are linked to important ecosystem services. The functions attributed to bivalves depend on the life habits of a species (epi- or infauna) and their abundance and biomass. To properly quantify and assess these functions, detailed information the distribution, abundance and biomass at the ecosystem scale is critical. Amongst others, this requires an understanding on how environmental conditions shape special patterns in distribution. In this study we investigate this fundamental information on the Swedish west coast, an area where this information is lacking. MethodsA survey which was designed to representatively sample both epi- and infaunal bivalves from randomized locations in various habitat types was conducted. Specifically, abundance and biomass of all species were recorded in the intertidal (0-0.5 m) and the shallow subtidal zone (0.5-2 m). The sites were distributed over an offshore gradient and at two exposure levels. This sampling structure allowed to extrapolate the results to an ecosystem level though information on the areal extent of these habitats using GIS layers. ResultsIt was found that even though there exist a great variability among sites, in general epifaunal bivalves outweigh infaunal bivalves approximately 3 to 1. In terms of abundance, the ratio is more or less reversed and infaunal species occur in greater numbers. Most bivalves were found at an intermediate level of exposure, but due to the areal extend of the sheltered inner-archipelago this was the most important habitat for bivalve abundance and biomass. It was also found that invasive epifaunal oyster Magallana gigas and the invasive infaunal clam Ensis leei both dominated their respective groups in terms of biomass. DiscussionThough the survey was relatively small, these results serve as a valuable insight of the relative importance of epi- and infaunal bivalves in this region. This gives understanding on which species and habitats are particularly important for ecosystem functions and services related to bivalves. This also provide a starting baseline for attempts to quantify ecosystem services provided by certain species or groups of bivalves in the future.

AB  - Climate change represents a global challenge that impacts the environment, traditional lifestyle and health of the Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic zone of Western Siberia and threatens their food security. Reindeer are an important food source for this population since reindeer herding products are used as traditional nutrition and effective preventive means and remedies for adapting to the cold and geomagnetic activity in the High North. Longer off-season periods, high summer and winter temperatures, melting ice, and forest and tundra fires have a significant impact on the trampling and degradation of reindeer pastures. These effects may lead to massive reindeer losses and changes in the traditional diet of the Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic, which result in increases in the prevalence of respiratory diseases, overweight and hypertension. This study applied a multidisciplinary approach based on ecological and medical research methods with the inclusion of socioeconomic analysis. The primary sources included data on the longitudinal dynamics of air temperature as a climate change indicator and reindeer livestock populations (1936-2018), consumption of reindeer products and physiological impacts on the Yamal Indigenous population collected during expeditions to the Arctic zone of Western Siberia in 2012-2018.

AB  - Rushes, such as soft rush (Juncus effusus L.), hard rush (Juncus inflexus L.), and compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus L.) have become problem species within upland grasslands across the United Kingdom and the coastal grasslands of western Norway. Indeed, being largely unpalatable to livestock and having a vigorous reproductive ecology means that they can rapidly come to dominate swards. However, rush dominance results in a reduction in grassland biodiversity and farm productivity. Anecdotal evidence from the United Kingdom suggests that rush cover within marginal upland grasslands has increased considerably in recent decades. Yet, there is currently no published evidence to support this observation. Here, we use recent and historical Google Earth imagery to measure changes in rush frequency over a 13-year period within four survey years: 2005, 2009, 2015, and 2018. During each survey year, we quantified rush presence or absence using a series of quadrats located within 300 upland grassland plots in the West Pennine Moors, United Kingdom. Data were analysed in two stages, first, by calculating mean rush frequencies per sample year using all the available plot-year combinations (the full dataset), and second by examining differences in rush frequency using only the plots for which rush frequency data were available in every sample year (the continuous dataset). The full dataset indicated that rush frequency has increased by 82% between 2005 and 2018. Similarly, the continuous dataset suggested that rush frequency has increased by 174% over the same period, with the increases in frequency being statistically significant (p < .05) between 2005-2018 and 2009-2018. We discuss the potential drivers of rush expansion in the West Pennine Moors, the ecological and agronomic implications of grassland rush infestations, and priorities for future research.

AB  - The species richness of flower-visiting insects has declined in past decades, raising concerns that the ecosystem service they provide by pollinating crops and wild plants is threatened. The relative commonness of different species with shared ecological traits can play a pervasive role in determining ecosystem functioning, but information on changes in abundances of pollinators over time is lacking. We gathered data on relative abundances of bumble-bee species in Swedish red clover fields during three periods in the last 70 years (1940s, 1960s and present), and on clover seed yields since 1921. We found drastic decreases in bumble-bee community evenness, with potential consequences for level and stability of red clover seed yield. The relative abundances of two short-tongued bumble-bees have increased from 40 per cent in the 1940s to entirely dominate present communities with 89 per cent. Average seed yield declined in recent years and variation in yield doubled, suggesting that the current dependence on few species for pollination has been especially detrimental to stability in seed yield. Our results suggest a need to develop management schemes that promote not only species-rich but also more evenly composed communities of service-providing organisms.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is a popular leisure activity many consider to be an environmentally friendly practice that promotes care for the natural world. This study uses a survey to investigate transportation use and gear purchasing habits among Norwegians who participate regularly in outdoor life. Using a hybrid life-cycle assessment, it was estimated that the average participant releases between 3.4 and 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per year due to outdoor recreation activities. This is equal to around one fifth of the average Norwegian's yearly greenhouse gas emissions and is more than double the per capita boundary required to limit global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius. Regression analysis highlights level of disposable income as the best predictor of environmental load. This indicates that the facade of a green lifestyle based on ecological values masks the global environmental consequences of excessive consumption related to outdoor recreation activities.

AB  - Nestedness represents the degree to which species assemblages are proper subsets of larger assemblages. Highly nested assemblages are characterized by a high number of species conforming to nested subset pattern and a low number of species which depart from nested pattern, that is, idiosyncratic species. The main aims of this paper were to (i) examine whether local stream habitat factors and spatial variables govern the number of nested stream diatom species at sites, (ii) to examine whether nested and idiosyncratic species differ in ecological characteristics, and (iii) to study if these distinctions have implications for turnover in stream diatom communities. Stream diatom communities showed a highly significant nested pattern, with observed matrix temperature of 28.4 degrees C. However, number of idiosyncratic species was high, constituting 44% of total species number of the survey. The number of nested species at sites was not related to any of the measured habitat factors or geographical location of the sampling sites. Idiosyncratic species were significantly ( ANOVA: P = 0.002) more widely distributed than nested species. Partial mantel tests showed that idiosyncratic species exhibited faster turnover along geographical and environmental distance than nested species. These data showed that although the degree of nestedness was highly significant, stream diatom communities were nevertheless characterized by a number of idiosyncratic species departing from the nested subset pattern. It seems that the compositional turnover is faster in communities that are dominated by idiosyncratic species suggesting that turnover diversity in diatoms may be governed more by the distribution of idiosyncratic species.

AB  - LiDAR-based segmentation of urban tree canopies and their physical properties (canopy height, canopy diameter, 3D surface and volume) is a replicable, complementary and useful information source for urban ecosystem condition accounts, and an important basis for ecosystem service modeling and valuation. However, using available LiDAR data collected for municipal purposes other than vegetation mapping (such as for example engineering) entails a level of accuracy which may limit the usefulness of the data for change detection in ecosystem accounts. To account for changes in the urban tree canopy of Oslo (capital city of Norway) between 2011 and 2017, a segmentation model was developed based on available airborne LiDAR data scanned for general purposes. The results from the entire built-up area of Oslo indicate a general increase in the number of tall trees ( 10 m) and a moderate decrease in tall trees ( 10 m). The total tree canopy area within the Small House plan area decreased by 1.04%, with a corresponding 2.13% decrease in the tree canopy volume. With respect to the segmentation accuracy, the changes in aggregate tree canopy cover are too small to determine canopy change with confidence. This study demonstrates the potential for identifying ecosystem condition indicators as well as the limitations of using general purpose LiDAR data to improve the precision of urban ecosystem accounting. For future ecosystem service accounting in urban environments, we recommend that municipalities implement data acquisition programs that combine concurrent field data sampling and LiDAR campaigns designed for urban tree canopy detection, as part of general urban structural inventorying. We recommend using LiDAR and satellite remote sensing data depending on canopy densities. We also recommend that future tree canopy segmentation is done within a cloud-computing environment to ensure sufficient geoprocessing capacity.

AB  - The transformation of the forest sector toward a bioeconomy calls for finding new sources of competitive advantage for the whole sector to retain its future viability. Non-industrial private forest owners are an important group of actors in the Finnish forest-based sector, as they supply 80% of industrial roundwood and control numerous other tangible and intangible forest-based ecosystem services. Our study analyzes forest owner views on the future use of forests in Finland, their perceptions on the evolving sectorial interlinkages and the position of the forest sector now and in the future bioeconomy. The data were collected in two phases: through telephone interviews of forest owners (n=278) and four focus group (FG) discussions (n=17), and were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The interviews showed that forest owners consider the highest potential for strengthening the sector toward bioeconomy to come from collaboration with energy and construction businesses. During the FG phase, we identified new possibilities founded on forest-based recreational services, cooperation with nature-based tourism and in increasing value-added wood products. In total, forest owners as a high-involvement group emphasized future value creation to be based upon forest ecosystem services and in diversifying the utilization of forests beyond the dominant raw material-driven mindset.

AB  - The potential for implementing carbon capture in Nordic industry sectors such as iron and steel production, cement and lime production, onshore and offshore oil and gas activities and pulp and paper production has been addressed. In Norway, much of the CO2 is emitted from the oil and gas sector. In Denmark the power and heat production comprises the largest share while in Sweden and Finland biomass based industry such as power and heat production in CHP plants and pulp and paper production generates most of the CO2 emissions. Iceland emits most CO2 from metal industry, in particular non-ferrous metal production. In a Nordic perspective, the oil and gas industry has a high potential for implementation of CCS along with iron and steel production and cement production. Only cement production and pulp and paper production industries seem to have potential to decrease the CO2 emissions close to zero. Capturing biogenic CO2 from pulp and paper production could remove CO2 from the atmosphere and create a carbon sink. Clustering of emission sources and implementing a joint CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) chain could possibly lower the CCS unit costs. Process alterations and industry specific solutions due to the implementation of CCS in industry could improve existing processes. However, the possibility for carbon leakage could decrease the competitiveness of Nordic industries significantly as long as there is no global agreement on reduction of CO2 emissions.

AB  - Urban landscapes constitute the future environment for most of the world's human population. An increased understanding of the urbanization process and of the effects of urbanization at multiple scales is, therefore, key to ensuring human well-being. In many conventional natural resource management regimes, incomplete knowledge of ecosystem dynamics and institutional constraints often leads to institutional management frameworks that do not match the scale of ecological patterns and processes. In this paper, we argue that scale mismatches are particularly pronounced in urban landscapes. Urban green spaces provide numerous important ecosystem services to urban citizens, and the management of these urban green spaces, including recognition of scales, is crucial to the well-being of the citizens. From a qualitative study of the current management practices in five urban green spaces within the Greater Stockholm Metropolitan Area, Sweden, we found that 1) several spatial, temporal, and functional scales are recognized, but the cross-scale interactions are often neglected, and 2) spatial and temporal meso-scales are seldom given priority. One potential effect of the neglect of ecological cross-scale interactions in these highly fragmented landscapes is a gradual reduction in the capacity of the ecosystems to provide ecosystem services. Two important strategies for overcoming urban scale mismatches are suggested: 1) development of an integrative view of the whole urban social -ecological landscape, and 2) creation of adaptive governance systems to support practical management.

AB  - Night radiative frost is a highly limiting factor for agriculture in Andean highlands. Nevertheless, a diversity of crop species have been domesticated there, commonly showing high heterogeneity in plant growth at the field level. The possible protective effect of crop canopy heterogeneity against nocturnal radiative frost is examined using a dual approach, combining a field experiment and a simplified energy balance model at the leaf level. Leaf and air temperatures were registered over an entire quinoa crop cycle in the Andean highlands of Bolivia, comparing two cultivars: Blanca de Yanamuyu, a traditional landrace with high plant height heterogeneity, and Surumi, a more homogeneous selected variety. In both cultivars, inverted air density profiles during calm and clear nights result in air temperature changes up to 3 degrees C over 0.5 m height, with minimum air temperature concentrated at the upper part of the canopy. In these conditions, leaf temperature gradients of up to 2.6 degrees C m(-1) develop within the canopy of the traditional landrace, with minimum leaf temperature significantly higher (P < 0.001) in shaded plants of the landrace than in the selected cultivar. A dynamic model of leaf temperature based on canopy parameters and climatic records at screen level adequately simulates leaf temperature differences in the case of a vertically heterogeneous quinoa canopy. A sensitivity analysis of the model reveals that canopy height, leaf area index, and sky cloudiness have the most important influences on the development of the sheltering effect, while air temperature and air humidity play a minor role under typical radiative frost conditions. As for wind speed, its actual influence remains unclear due to experimental and modelling limitations at low wind speeds. The significance of these results is discussed in terms of the trade-off between stress adaptation and biomass productivity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sea lice represent a persistent and growing problem, challenging the resilience and growth of the salmon aquaculture industry. In this Norwegian case study, we studied and discuss how the absence of policy instruments directed at stimulating breeding for lice resistance (LR) might be explained. We found well-documented opportunities for selection progress for LR. Hence, breeding on LR appears with an untapped potential. We discuss how market-based, legal, institutional and interest-based factors can explain the absence of policy instruments stimulating LR breeding. Methodologically, we obtained data from document and literature studies and interviews with key players (salmon breeders, farmers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental bodies in Norway). First, LR is a polygenic trait, which makes it poorly suited for patenting. Furthermore, if only a small proportion of fish farmers choose seeds with higher LR, other operators can easily take on the free-rider role because they will not suffer from reduced gain in growth performance as a result of a much stronger emphasis on LR in the breeding goal. The market is thus not expected to stimulate stronger selection for LR in Norwegian salmon breeding. Second, neither genetic engineering (e.g., gene editing), still struggling with consumer acceptance, nor the uncertainty associated with possible changes in the Norwegian Gene Technology Act stimulate investment in LR via, for example, CRISPR technology. Thirdly, public policy instruments in their entirety have targeted other types of innovations against salmon lice, and none have so far been used to stimulate breeding companies to emphasize LR more strongly in their breeding programmes. From a political point of view, it seems that breeding has been left to the market and the private sector. However, neither the NGOs nor the public seem to be aware of, or pay significant attention to, the breeding potential to improve LR and fish welfare. Fragmented management of the aquaculture sector can camouflage the close ties between political and business interests. The industry is hesitant to invest significantly in long-term breeding targets such as significantly higher genetic LR. This may strengthen the assumption that strong economic interests will reduce the role of science in knowledge-based management. As farmed salmon are increasingly being exposed to stressful delousing treatments, mortality and associated welfare problems have increased significantly. For instance, large fish die more often from cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS), resulting in growing demand for CMS-resistant salmon. This gives rise to a paradoxical situation: increasing treatments with high mortality and fish welfare issues in farmed salmon, while the lice threat to wild salmon persists.

AB  - Forests sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) which is important for climate mitigation. Net ecosystem production (NEP) varies significantly across forests in different regions depending on the dominant tree species, stand age, and environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate forest NEP and its potential changes under climate change in different regions to inform forestry policy making. Norway spruce (Picea abies) is the most prevalent species in conifer forests throughout Europe. Here, we focused on Norway spruce forests and used eddy covariance-based observations of CO2 fluxes and other variables from eight sites to build a XGBoost machine learning model for NEP estimation. The NEP values from the study sites varied between -296 (source) and 1253 (sink) g C m(-2) yr(-1). Overall, among the tested variables, air temperature was the most important factor driving NEP variations, followed by global radiation and stand age, while precipitation had a very limited contribution to the model. The model was used to predict the NEP of mature Norway spruce forests in different regions within Europe. The NEP median value was 494 g C m(-2) yr(-1) across the study areas, with higher NEP values, up to >800 g C m(-2) yr(-1), in lower latitude regions. Under the "middle-of-the-road" SSP2-4.5 scenario, the NEP values tended to be greater in almost all the studied regions by 2060 with the estimated median of NEP changes in 2041-2060 to be +45 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Our results indicate that Norway spruce forests show high productivity in a wide area of Europe with potentially future NEP enhancement. However, due to the limitations of the data, the potential decrease in NEP induced by temperature increases beyond the photosynthesis optima and frequent ecosystem disturbances (e.g., drought, bark beetle infestation, etc.) still needs to be evaluated.

AB  - Excess heat from industrial processes can be used for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as providing heat to a district heating network, leading to increased energy efficiency and reduction of on-site and/or off-site CO2 emissions. In this work, both options are assessed with respect to economic performance and potential reduction of CO2 emissions. The work includes a generic study based on five heat load curves for each of which three CO2 capture plant configurations were evaluated. The economic assessment indicates that the specific cost of capture ranges from 47-134 (sic)/t CO2 depending on heat profile and capture plant configuration. Having excess heat available during a long period of the year, or having a high peak amount of heat, were shown to lead to low specific capture costs. The paper also includes results of a case study in which the methodology was applied to actual seasonal variations of excess heat for an integrated steel mill located in northern Sweden. Specific capture costs were estimated to 27-44 (sic)/t CO2, and a 36% reduction of direct plant emissions can be achieved if the CO2 capture plant is prioritized for usage of the available excess heat.

AB  - The presence of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg), arsenic (TAs), inorganic arsenic (iAs), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) was investigated in seafood collected from European marine ecosystems subjected to strong anthropogenic pressure, i.e. hotspot areas. Different species (Mytilus galloprovincialis, n=50; Chamelea gallina, n=50; Liza aurata, n=25; Platichthys flesus, n=25; Laminaria digitata, n=15; and Saccharina latissima, n=15) sampled in Tagus estuary, Po delta, Ebro delta, western Scheldt, and in the vicinities of a fish farm area (Solund, Norway), between September and December 2013, were selected to assess metal contamination and potential risks to seafood consumers, as well as to determine the suitability of ecologically distinct organisms as bioindicators in environmental monitoring studies. Species exhibited different elemental profiles, likely as a result of their ecological strategies, metabolism and levels in the environment (i.e. seawater and sediments). Higher levels of Cd (0.15-0.94 mg kg(-1)), Pb (0.37-0.89 mg kg(-1)), Co (0.48-1.1 mg kg(-1)), Cu (4.8-8.4 mg kg(-1)), Zn (75-153 mg kg(-1)), Cr (1.0-4.5 mg kg(-1)) and Fe (283-930 mg kg(-1)) were detected in bivalve species, particularly in M. galloprovincialis from Ebro and Po deltas, whereas the highest content of Hg was found in P. flesus (0.86 mg kg(-1)). In fish species, most Hg was organic (MeHg; from 69 to 79%), whereas lower proportions of MeHg were encountered in bivalve species (between 20 and 43%). The highest levels of As were found in macroalgae species L digitata and S. latissima (41 mg kg-1 and 43 mg kg(-1), respectively), with iAs accounting almost 50% of the total As content in L digitata but not with S. latissima nor in the remaining seafood samples. This work highlights that the selection of the most appropriate bioindicator species is a fundamental step in environmental monitoring of each contaminant, especially in coastal areas. Furthermore, data clearly shows that the current risk assessment and legislation solely based on total As or Hg data is limiting, as elemental speciation greatly varies according to seafood species, thus playing a key role in human exposure assessment via food.

AB  - Conservation and management of large carnivores requires knowledge of female and male dispersal. Such information is crucial to evaluate the population's status and thus management actions. This knowledge is challenging to obtain, often incomplete and contradictory at times. The size of the target population and the methods applied can bias the results. Also, population history and biological or environmental influences can affect dispersal on different scales within a study area. We have genotyped Eurasian lynx (180 males and 102 females, collected 2003-2017) continuously distributed in southern Finland (similar to 23,000 km(2)) using 21 short tandem repeats (STR) loci and compared statistical genetic tests to infer local and sex-specific dispersal patterns within and across genetic clusters as well as geographic regions. We tested for sex-specific substructure with individual-based Bayesian assignment tests and spatial autocorrelation analyses. Differences between the sexes in genetic differentiation, relatedness, inbreeding, and diversity were analysed using population-based AMOVA, F-statistics, and assignment indices. Our results showed two different genetic clusters that were spatially structured for females but admixed for males. Similarly, spatial autocorrelation and relatedness was significantly higher in females than males. However, we found weaker sex-specific patterns for the Eurasian lynx when the data were separated in three geographical regions than when divided in the two genetic clusters. Overall, our results suggest male-biased dispersal and female philopatry for the Eurasian lynx in Southern Finland. The female genetic structuring increased from west to east within our study area. In addition, detection of male-biased dispersal was dependent on analytical methods utilized, on whether subtle underlying genetic structuring was considered or not, and the choice of population delineation. Conclusively, we suggest using multiple genetic approaches to study sex-biased dispersal in a continuously distributed species in which population delineation is difficult.

AB  - Maerl beds are vital habitats for a diverse array of marine species across trophic levels, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities and climate change. Furthermore, little is known about the genetic diversity of maerl-forming species and the population structure of maerl beds, both of which are important for understanding the ability of these species to adapt to changing environments and for informing marine reserve planning. In this study, we used a whole genome genotyping approach to explore the population genomics of Phymatolithon calcareum, a maerl-forming red algal species, whose geographical distribution spans the north-east Atlantic, from Norway to Portugal. Our results, using 14,150 genome-wide SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), showed that P. calcareum maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic are generally structured geographically, a pattern likely explained by low dispersal potential and limited connectivity between regions. Additionally, we found that P. calcareum from the Fal Estuary, south-west England, is genetically distinct from all other P. calcareum sampled, even from The Manacles, a site located only 13 km away. Further analysis revealed that this finding is not the result of introgression from two closely related species, Phymatolithon purpureum or Lithothamnion corallioides. Instead, this unique diversity may have been shaped over time by geographical isolation of the Fal Estuary maerl bed and a lack of gene flow with other P. calcareum populations. The genomic data presented in this study suggest that P. calcareum genetic diversity has accumulated over large temporal and spatial scales, the preservation of which will be important for maximizing the resilience of this species to changes in climate and the environment. Moreover, our findings underline the importance of managing the conservation of maerl beds across western Europe as distinct units, at a site-by-site level.

EC is commonly associated with the Polluter-Pays Principle, but we propose the Developer-Pays Principle as a more comprehensive principle. Safeguards that are relevant to local and national contexts are needed when addressing social-ecological resilience in the face of risks associated with EC. The operationalisation of EC in Sweden is assessed through two case studies: the E12 highway and Mertainen mine. The institutional design and implementation procedures are investigated through semi-structured interviews as well as an analysis of legal and other written documents. Using a multi-level governance framework, we examine four key disputed issues within compensation. Our results suggest that (i) Risk of a license-to-trash can be minimised; (ii) Complementary quantitative and qualitative ecological valuation methods are needed to achieve additionality and No Net Loss; (iii) Compensation pools may be a promising strategy to secure land availability; and (iv) Social safeguards are vital for EC in high-income countries as well, where they are currently understudied. We conclude that EC cannot be the main instrument for nature conservation, but rather complementary to a strong legal framework that protects biodiversity and ecosystems in addition to the sustained and equitable benefits of ecosystem services.

AB  - This study provides monetary estimates of the benefits of achieving Good Environmental Status (GES) in the Finnish marine waters of the Baltic Sea. The designed contingent valuation study addresses the non-market benefits related to all descriptors defining GES in the Baltic Sea, and it is designed to conform to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive's request to estimate the national costs of the degradation of the marine environment. According to the results, Finns are willing to contribute annually (sic) 105-123 per person to achieve GES in the Finnish marine area. This indicates that the total monetary benefits of reaching GES are (sic) 432-509 million annually in Finland. The results also show that Finns value a healthy marine environment irrespective of how far from the coast they live and even if they do not use the sea themselves. They particularly want public funding to be allocated to reducing hazardous substances and eutrophication. Moreover, Finns place especially high importance on cultural ecosystem services related to the existence of habitats for species as well as on recreation and aesthetic values. This confirms that the public funds used for Baltic Sea protection measures seem to be largely accepted even by the population mainly benefiting from non-use values.

AB  - Scientific advancements on Green Infrastructure (GI) and Ecosystem Services (ES) have been conducted by experts from several disciplines such as landscape ecology, landscape architecture and, more recently, regional and urban planning. However, there are still difficulties in defining and operationalizing GI and ES within planning. This paper explores the possibilities and obstacles in incorporating the GI and ES concepts into policy frameworks, planning strategies and planning practices by taking as case studies the Helsinki-Uusimaa Region and the City of Jarvenpad in Finland. In both cases, several studies on GI and ES have been developed with the collaboration of academics, research institutes and planners. The literature review focuses on the understanding and integration of GI and ES within land use planning. A qualitative content analysis was conducted of policy and planning documents and interviews with regional and city planners. The results show that while the national policy has already embraced the two concepts, the planning strategies of the Helsinki-Uusimaa Region and the City of Jarvenpaa need to fully integrate GI and ES. A wider and more concrete picture about the difficulties in operationalising GI and ES is provided by the planning practitioners. Rigid regulatory framework and current planning tools still represent obstacles to the effective integration of GI and ES. More science-practice collaborations between experts, practitioners and policymakers should support the development of our cities and urban regions having GI and ES in mind.

AB  - Bioenergy projects can lead to direct and indirect land use change (LUC), which can substantially affect greenhouse gas balances with both beneficial and adverse outcomes for bioenergy's contribution to climate change mitigation. The causes behind LUC are multiple, complex, interlinked, and change over time. This makes quantification uncertain and sensitive to many factors that can develop in different directions-including land use productivity, trade patterns, prices and elasticities, and use of by-products associated with biofuels production. Quantifications reported so far vary substantially and do not support the ranking of bioenergy options with regard to LUC and associated emissions. There are however several options for mitigating these emissions, which can be implemented despite the uncertainties. Long-rotation forest management is associated with carbon emissions and sequestration that are not in temporal balance with each other and this leads to mitigation trade-offs between biomass extraction for energy use and the alternative to leave the biomass in the forest. Bioenergy's contribution to climate change mitigation needs to reflect a balance between near-term targets and the long-term objective to hold the increase in global temperature below 2 degrees C (Copenhagen Accord). Although emissions from LUC can be significant in some circumstances, the reality of such emissions is not sufficient reason to exclude bioenergy from the list of worthwhile technologies for climate changemitigation. Policy measures to minimize the negative impacts of LUC should be based on a holistic perspective recognizing the multiple drivers and effects of LUC. (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The ability of urban vegetation to improve air quality for the benefit of urban residents is often considered fact since plants can absorb and capture air pollutants. However, there is little empirical evidence that urban air quality at the local scale is improved by the presence of, e.g. trees, especially in northern climatic regions. We studied the impact of urban forest vegetation on the levels of five types of air pollutants (NO2, ground-level O-3, anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs, and particulate matter) in near-road environments during summer (June) using passive samplers in Helsinki, Finland. Concentrations of gaseous pollutants did not differ significantly between tree-covered and adjacent open areas, while particle pollutant levels were significantly lower in tree-covered areas than in adjacent open, treeless areas. Vegetation-related variables (canopy closure, tree number and size, and ground vegetation) did not explain differences in air quality. Our results suggest that the role of urban, mostly deciduous, vegetation is negligible in improving local air quality, in terms of the anthropogenic pollutants measured here, in northern climates. However, air particulate pollution, which is likely to be dominated by large-sized particles in our study, can be reduced by urban vegetation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Northern landscapes accumulate carbon in vegetation and soils while rivers transport significant amounts of land-derived carbon to coastal areas. Here, we quantify carbon sources and sinks in main ecosystems (forests, peatlands, mountains, agricultural areas, lakes) in Norway for 1990-2008, and compare riverine carbon transport with terrestrial carbon accumulation in Norway's four major discharge areas. Mean annual carbon accumulation (6.0 +/- A 0.9 Tg C; 19 g C m(-2)) in terrestrial ecosystems balanced 40 % of national greenhouse gas emissions. The area-normalized terrestrial sink strength declined in the following order (in g C m(-2) year(-1)): tree biomass (40 +/- A 3) > peatlands (19 +/- A 15) > forest soils (9 +/- A 1) a parts per thousand << lakes (2 +/- A 1) > mountains (0.5 +/- A 0.3), while agricultural soils were sources of carbon (-36 +/- A 74). The most precise estimate in the carbon balance was for tree biomass, because of the underlying forest inventory data. Poor data on land management and soil type in agricultural soils, and on (former) drainage and peatland type resulted in high uncertainty in carbon loss and uptake estimates in agricultural soils and peatlands, which impacted the uncertainty in total terrestrial carbon accumulation. Also, carbon losses from disturbance in organic soil types were poorly constrained. Riverine coastal inputs of land-derived organic carbon (OC) were 1.0 +/- A 0.1 Tg C year(-1) (3.0 g C m(-2) year(-1)), with highest area-specific riverine export in western (4.5 g C m(-2) year(-1)) and lowest (1.7 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in subarctic Norway. In west and middle Norway, river OC export was approximately equal to carbon accumulation in soils and wetlands, while it was 50 % of soil and wetland carbon accumulation in southeast and subarctic Norway. Lateral aquatic transport of carbon is not explicitly accounted for in forest soil carbon accumulation estimates, although aquatic fluxes represent a climate-dependent carbon loss from soil carbon pools. The lack of methods that adequately account for lateral fluxes in carbon balances adds considerable uncertainty to soil carbon sink estimates. Climate warming and associated changes in precipitation may result in substantial alterations of terrestrial and aquatic carbon fluxes, with uncertain implications for the terrestrial carbon sink of northern landscapes.

AB  - The Sognefjord is the longest (205 km) and deepest (1308 m) fjord in Norway, and the second-longest in the world. Coast-fiord exchange in Sognefjord is limited by a seaward sill at 170 m water depth, which causes a clear stratification between water masses as the dense oxygen-poor basin water mixes slowly with the well-oxygenated water directly above from the coastal ocean. Due to the homogeneity and limited variability in the deep-water, the deep slopes of Sognefjord represent the ideal setting to study how abiotic factors influence the deep-water benthic community structure. During the summer of 2017, two remotely operated vehicle (ROV) video transects were performed to compare the megabenthic community behind the sill (water depth: 1230 to 55 m; transect length: 1.39 km; distance from sill: similar to 17 km) and within the central fjord (water depth: 1155-85 m; transect length: 2.43 km; distance from sill: similar to 79 km). Accompanying conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) deployments were made to measure the in situ abiotic factors and nutrient concentrations at each transect location, while the substrate characteristics (percent cover of soft and hard exposed substrate) were documented from the video footage. Here, Sognefjord's megabenthic community composition, distribution, and species richness were analyzed in relation to abiotic factors (e.g., depth, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a concentration, and percent cover of hard and soft substrata) within the fiord. Basin communities were homogeneous and characterized by sponges, echinoderms, and crustaceans, whereas the shallower regions were dominated by mobile scavengers. Contrary to other lord-based studies, species richness and diversity were stable in the fjord basin and decreased with proximity to the sill, decreasing water depth, and at the boundary between intermediate and basin water. The findings demonstrate that highly stratified fjords support stable communities in their basins; however, further research is needed to investigate the influence water mass dynamics have on silled-fjord megafauna communities.

AB  - This study explores the decade-long effects of release cutting around old retained oaks (Quercus robur L.) in a Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) stand that was 33 year old when thinned. The impacts on both nature conservation values and spruce wood production were evaluated in a randomized block design. To release oaks from competition, stems of Norway spruce were cut around 33 oaks, in three different treatments: high release (HR), medium release (MR) and no release (NR). Trees within a circular sample plot (15 m radius from the oak) were measured at time of treatment and 10 years after. The treatment effects on stand development, oak vitality and understory vegetation were evaluated after ten years, using tree diameter, height measurements, oak crown and tree structure estimates as well as ground vegetation surveys. Release cutting did not impact spruce production within the sample plot, and given that there were no other obvious sources of spruce suppression in the stand, we speculate that release cutting has little to no impact at the stand scale. Oak crowns in the control plots (NR) became smaller after ten years, while the crowns expanded and colonized the gap in the release treatments. Simultaneously, the amount of dead wood in the crown increased among oaks in the control treatment, indicating dieback. Cover and species richness of vascular plants in the understory were significantly higher in the HR and MR treatments compared to NR. These results suggest that the creation of relatively wide gaps (greater than 2 m) around retained oak crowns is one efficient approach to maintain their conservation values in a spruce dominated stand on a longer time frame. This will allow oaks to expand their crowns, increase their vitality and increase species richness and diversity of plants under the canopy. The economic loss of creating large gaps instead of no gaps may be negligible since the overall spruce production was not affected within 15 m of each oak.

AB  - Conserving genetic diversity within and among populations of northern pike Esox lucius is important for maintaining their short-term fitness and long-term evolutionary potential. Northern pike have consistently shown low within-population variation, as detected by allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, and randomly amplified polymorphic DNA. Microsatellite DNA loci reveal considerably greater variation in northern pike, yet microsatellite variation tends to be less than that in other fish species. Low genetic variation within populations may result from compounding factors of low effective population size and bottlenecks. Allozyme, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, and microsatellite markers have revealed significant differentiation of populations located in different continents and major drainages, but only microsatellites have differentiated populations on finer geographic scales. Within the north-central United States, analyses with microsatellites have detected genetic differences among most populations but have inconsistently detected structure, or genetic relationships, among populations. Microsatellites did reveal fine-scale structure between freshwater and brackish-water populations in Finland, showing that population structure does develop in this species. The lack of structure in the north-central United States may be the result of repopulation from a common glacial refugium, but stock transfers also may have played a role in obscuring past structure. Allozyme studies indicated that western North American populations might have recolonized from a second glacial refugium. Northern pike biologists should consider how management actions affect within- and among-population variation. Stock transfers are the most common means by which genetically differentiated populations are mixed. Genetic data support avoiding transfers of northern pike across continents and between populations in western and central North America. Management actions such as harvest and habitat manipulations can also reduce genetic variation within populations by altering demographic factors that determine effective population size.

AB  - In the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), the Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) has been traditionally targeted at reducing flood risk. However, other Ecosystem Services (ES) became increasingly relevant in response to the challenges of urbanization and climate change. In total, 90 scientific articles addressing ES considered crucial contributions to the quality of life in cities are reviewed. These are classified as (1) regulating ES that minimize hazards such as heat, floods, air pollution and noise, and (2) cultural ES that promote well-being and health. We conclude that the planning and design of UGI should balance both the provision of ES and their side effects and disservices, aspects that seem to have been only marginally investigated. Climate-sensitive planning practices are critical to guarantee that seasonal climate variability is accounted for at high-latitude regions. Nevertheless, diverging and seemingly inconsistent findings, together with gaps in the understanding of long-term effects, create obstacles for practitioners. Additionally, the limited involvement of end users points to a need of better engagement and communication, which in overall call for more collaborative research. Close relationships and interactions among different ES provided by urban greenery were found, yet few studies attempted an integrated evaluation. We argue that promoting interdisciplinary studies is fundamental to attain a holistic understanding of how plant traits affect the resulting ES; of the synergies between biophysical, physiological and psychological processes; and of the potential disservices of UGI, specifically in Nordic cities.

AB  - 1. Often, closely related insect species feed on different host plant species, and the tremendous diversity of phytophagous insects is therefore attributed to host plant-driven speciation. However, for most taxa, host use information comes from field observations of egg-laying females or feeding caterpillars, which means that the underlying reason for a particular host-affiliation is not easily determined. 2. Therefore, it is often unclear whether an insect feeds on a certain host because it prefers that plant to alternative hosts, or because the host distribution overlaps with the habitat requirements of the insect. 3. We ask to what extent a divergent host use in the field mirrors the host plant preferences of two closely related butterflies, Pieris napi and Pieris rapae (Pieridae). In nature, P. napi typically occurs in moister habitats than P. rapae. 4. We scanned several microhabitats at a field site in Southern Sweden during multiple years, and collected Pieris eggs from three different plants, Cardamine pratensis (wet meadows), Barbarea vulgaris (drier micro-habitats) and Alliaria petiolata (intermediate areas). 5. As predicted, P. rapae eggs were more common than P. napi eggs on B. vulgaris, whereas all of the 358 individuals collected from C. pratensis were P. napi, indicating a divergence in host use between the Pieris species. However, under controlled laboratory conditions, both species had virtually identical oviposition preferences, laying eggs on all three plants, notably P. rapae also laying eggs on C. pratensis, indicating that habitat use, not plant preference, drives host plant use in nature.

AB  - Against the background of the ongoing climate change, forest science and Central-European forest management need information about tree species that are suitable of forming resistant and resilient multispecific and multipurpose forest stands. Non-native species are also considered for this purpose. One of these species may be the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), which has been introduced from western North America to Europe in the 19th century. The aim of this review is to compile recent scientific results that are relevant in the context of the use of the Douglas fir in future Central-European forestry to create a foundation for science-based decisionmaking, and to formulate future research tasks on that basis. Due to its high growth rates and low susceptibility to needle cast fungi, the Douglas fir's coastal variety (P. menziesii var. menziesii, syn.: var. viridis) is being preferred in Central-European silviculture. It is competitively superior to all indigenous Central-European forest tree species due to rapid height growth and efficient shading of competing plants; high drought tolerance, water use efficiency and resilience after drought stress; and efficient water and nutrient uptake and high nutrient use efficiency. In Central Europe, the Douglas fir is currently less threatened by pests and pathogens than are the indigenous Norway spruce and Scots pine. Its litter is better decomposable compared to native conifers, but increased nitrification, especially at sites with former agricultural use or under anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, or lower nitrate uptake rates due to lower nitrogen demand of the species can result in enhanced soil acidification, aluminum mobilization and leaching of nitrate, "base" cations and aluminum compounds. Mixtures of Douglas fir and native trees may be particularly effective in sequestrating carbon and nitrogen in the soil. Negative effects of the Douglas fir on the plant diversity of a given community seem to be small or even non-existent, but its interactions with the fauna is more ambiguous. The majority of nature conservation organizations recommend avoiding Douglas-fir monocultures and restricting the fraction of Douglas-fir admixtures to stands of native tree species to 30% at maximum in considering current regulations for nature protection. Future research tasks comprise monitoring of the Douglas-fir provenances in cultivation and of introduced pests and pathogens, investigations of responses to consecutive and combined stress factors and of the species' invasiveness at dry sites as well as comparative long-term studies on interactions with animal communities and on matter flux and turnover in the ecosystems.

AB  - Mass developments of macrophytes occur frequently worldwide and are often considered a nuisance when interfering with human activities. It is crucial to understand the drivers of this perception if we are to develop effective management strategies for ecosystems with macrophyte mass developments. Using a comprehensive survey spanning five sites with different macrophyte species in four countries (Norway, France, Germany and South Africa), we quantified the perception of macrophyte growth as a nuisance among residents and visitors, and for different recreational activities (swimming, boating, angling, appreciation of biodiversity, appreciation of landscape and birdwatching). We then used a Bayesian network approach to integrate the perception of nuisance with the consequences of plant removal. From the 1234 responses collected from the five sites, a range of 73-93% of the respondents across the sites considered macrophyte growth a nuisance at each site. Residents perceived macrophytes up to 23% more problematic than visitors. Environmental mindedness of respondents did not influence the perception of nuisance. Perceived nuisance of macrophytes was relatively similar for different recreational activities that were possible in each case study site, although we found some site-specific variation. Finally, we illustrate how Bayesian networks can be used to choose the best management option by balancing people's perception of macrophyte growth with the potential consequences of macrophyte removal.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities need to be ramped up to address the climate crisis. Abatement cost curves can help to identify low-cost starting points and formulate roadmaps for the implementation of CCS at industrial sites. In this work, we introduce the concept of energy supply cost curves to enhance the usefulness and accuracy of abatement cost curves. We use a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to find an optimal mix of heat sources considering the existing site energy system. For a Swedish refinery, we found that residual heat and existing boiler capacities can provide the heat necessary for CCS that avoids >75% of the site's CO2 emissions. Disregarding the existing site energy system and relying on new heat supply capacities instead, would lead to capture costs that are 40-57% higher per tonne of CO2-avoided (excl. CO2 liquefaction, transport, and final storage). Furthermore, we estimated that temporal variations of heat sources (intermittent residual heat) increases the heat supply cost and emissions by 7-26% and 9-66%, respectively. The proposed method for optimization of the energy supply mix considering temporal variations of heat sources enables detailed estimates of energy supply costs for CO2 capture rates ranging from partial to full capture, and thus, improve abatement cost curves.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi are important mutualists for the growth and health of most boreal trees. Forest age and its host species composition can impact the composition of ECM fungal communities. Although plentiful empirical data exist for forested environments, the effects of established vegetation and its successional trajectories on ECM fungi in urban greenspaces remain poorly understood. We analyzed ECM fungi in 5 control forests and 41 urban parks of two plant functional groups (conifer and broadleaf trees) and in three age categories (10, similar to 50, and > 100 years old) in southern Finland. Our results show that although ECM fungal richness was marginally greater in forests than in urban parks, urban parks still hosted rich and diverse ECM fungal communities. ECM fungal community composition differed between the two habitats but was driven by taxon rank order reordering, as key ECM fungal taxa remained largely the same. In parks, the ECM communities differed between conifer and broadleaf trees. The successional trajectories of ECM fungi, as inferred in relation to the time since park construction, differed among the conifers and broadleaf trees: the ECM fungal communities changed over time under the conifers, whereas communities under broadleaf trees provided no evidence for such age-related effects. Our data show that plant-ECM fungus interactions in urban parks, in spite of being constructed environments, are surprisingly similar in richness to those in natural forests. This suggests that the presence of host trees, rather than soil characteristics or even disturbance regime of the system, determine ECM fungal community structure and diversity.
   IMPORTANCE In urban environments, soil and trees improve environmental quality and provide essential ecosystem services. ECM fungi enhance plant growth and performance, increasing plant nutrient acquisition and protecting plants against toxic compounds. Recent evidence indicates that soil-inhabiting fungal communities, including ECM and saprotrophic fungi, in urban parks are affected by plant functional type and park age. However, ECM fungal diversity and its responses to urban stress, plant functional type, or park age remain unknown. The significance of our study is in identifying, in greater detail, the responses of ECM fungi in the rhizospheres of conifer and broadleaf trees in urban parks. This will greatly enhance our knowledge of ECM fungal communities under urban stresses, and the findings can be utilized by urban planners to improve urban ecosystem services.

AB  - To evaluate the efficiency by which fine-scale diversity hotspots capture threatened species in northern forests, we investigated the spatial distribution of vascular plants, bryophytes, macrolichens, and polypore fungi with 1-ha resolution (in 0.25-ha plots) within six approximately 2-km(2) forest landscapes in Norway Of 1295 recorded species (118,000 records), 62 species (842 records) were on the Norwegian Red List, of which 7 species (12 records) were new to Norway. We studied the degree of clustering of different red-listed species among plots by comparing observed co-occurrence of red-listed species to a null model of random co-occurrence. Red-listed species were moderately clustered within study areas but less so within each forest type. Clustering was similar for areas with high and low densities of red-listed species. However the proportion of records captured in rarity hotspots (plots with the highest number of red-listed species) depended on both the total number of records of red-listed species per area and the degree of clustering of species among plots. The 5% highest-ranking rarity hotspots captured, on average, 59% of red-listed species and 23% of all records of red-listed species in study areas, compared with 56% and 18% captured by hotspots selected from a random distribution of species, respectively. Hotspots based on the most species-rich plots (richness hotspots) were significantly less effective than rarity hotspots in capturing red-listed species and their records. Based on the observed pattern of species co-occurrence and the high proportion of area seemingly occupied by red-listed species in mature forest, we hypothesize that 20-25% of the populations of red-listed species may be located within rarity hotspots constituting 5% at the scale of 1 ha. We conclude that limited spatial overlap of species constitutes an important constraint on the efficiency of a fine-scale hotspot conservation strategy, such as the "woodland key habitats" (0.1-10 ha) currently mapped and protected in northern European forests.

AB  - In all Swedish lakes, the concentration of mercury (Hg) in fish exceeds the European Union threshold limit. While the ultimate source of Hg is primarily airborne emissions from fossil energy, forestry plays a small but important role because some forestry operations help mobilize and transform Hg, increasing Hg loads in downstream aquatic ecosystems. Simultaneously, climate change is placing additional demands on forests to provide biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel. Thus, decision-makers are facing a complex situation, a "wicked problem," when it comes to how to handle the problem of forestry's effects on Hg in aquatic ecosystems while at the same time securing other ecosystem services. In order to explore forestry's degree of responsibility as well as possible solutions to this problem in Sweden, a transdisciplinary method has been used consisting of a structured dialogue with actors from relevant governmental agencies, forest companies, and forest associations. The analysis shows that while the issue can be addressed constructively, the complex character of the problem requires consideration of not only management practices for forestry but also current regulatory goals and environmental objectives. The Hg problem represents a class of difficult issues for forestry where stand- or property-based production has an impact on a greater spatial scale. This means that regulating the more direct impacts of forestry needs to be weighed against the implications this regulation may have on the overall issue of ecosystem services.

AB  - There are plant-based alternatives to cow's milk that resemble milk in appearance and function, but differ nutritionally. These are associated with lower land use and environmental impact than milk. However, there are places where dairy herds contribute positively to conservation of high nature value pastures through their grazing. The dairy system also produces meat, but it can be questioned how much beef is needed/demanded. This study evaluated the environmental impact of production of oat drink in comparison with production of milk in terms of: i) the necessity for sufficient grazing animals in the landscape for biodiversity conservation; ii) different perspectives on the need for beef and protein; iii) the opportunity cost of land; and iv) the differing protein content of milk and oat drink. The climate impact, eutrophication and acidification potential and ecotoxicity impacts of a typical Swedish dairy farm were calculated and compared with those of the same farm when milk production was replaced by production of oat drink and three different alternatives to dairy beef: 1) beef from suckler herds; 2) chicken; and 3) plant-based protein. In all scenarios, the same area of semi natural grassland was grazed. The opportunity cost of land use was included by producing bioenergy on spare land. The direct greenhouse gas emissions were considerably lower (16-41%) for all oat drink scenarios than for the milk scenario. When the bioenergy produced on the spare land was assumed to replace diesel, this substitution effect together with the carbon sequestration in soils cancelled out the direct emissions almost entirely when chicken or plant-based protein was produced instead of beef. The eutrophication potential was similar for all scenarios, while the acidification potential was 21-37% higher in the oat drink scenarios due to the need for handling increased amounts of digestate from bioenergy (biogas) production. This explorative study demonstrated great potential for reduced climate impact through production of oat drink instead of cow's milk, while still preserving grazing services for biodiversity conservation. However, for this to happen, incentives to manage semi-natural grassland need to be introduced, as such management is not an inherent effect of oat drink production. In addition, for the environmental benefits demonstrated in this study to come about, consumers must be incentivised to consume oat drink instead of milk and, to achieve the largest climate impact reductions, to replace some beef with chicken or cereals and legumes.

T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Land use in general and particularly agricultural practices can significantly influence soil carbon (C) storage. Changes in topsoil C mass measured in long-term agricultural field trials in Sweden and other Northern European countries were compiled and aggregated into seven treatment classes, including manured, fertilized and straw exported. The impact of crop rotations and management practices on C stocks in the topsoil was analyzed using both a static model and a dynamic soil carbon model (introductory C Balance Model; ICBM), ICBM consists of two state variables and four fluxes (governed by four rate-determining parameters), and one parameter. r(e) combining most external factors affecting C mineralization (temperature, precipitation, drainage, etc.). Simple 'front-end models' were used to estimate values for two of the parameters, i (annual C input) and h (humification coefficient) initially based on incomplete records from the field trials, official agricultural statistics and other literature. The r(e) parameter was then optimized for each class of treatments, using an algorithm for non-linear least squares. Initial soil C mass, present C inputs and abiotic conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture. were the deciding factors in whether C stocks declined or increased. Steady-state values calculated using the static and dynamic model were similar for both models, but differed greatly between treatment classes. For cereal-dominated cropping systems where the straw was removed, manure application increased steady-state values about three times (from 3 to 9 kg C m(-2)) compared with corresponding treatments. Incorporation of straw resulted in intermediate steady-state values (5-6 kg C m(-2)) C mineralization rates were highest in bare fallow treatments. For one class of soils, C retention in the soil was found to increase significantly with increasing clay content. The hypothesis that the climatic gradients in Northern

AB  - Increasing pressures on the coastal zone calls for new approaches to its governance. The ecosystem services (ES) concept has been presented as a solution for more integrated and ecosystem-based management, providing tools to categorise knowledge on ecosystems, the services they provide, and their value. This paper offers an analysis of the introduction of the ES concept into Norwegian coastal spatial planning as a new governance approach. The study is based on document analysis of relevant legal and policy documents, such as white papers, parliamentary bills, official reports, acts and regulations. Through this process this study finds that only incremental changes have been made to integrate the ES concept into the governance of the coastal zone. ES terms and methods to apply the concept in day-to-day governance have not yet been provided. The multilevel and multiscale governance system is not structured to accommodate such an intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach. The municipal planning system could however be well suited, in particular the strategic environmental assessments. The municipalities act like an integrating body, where the trade-offs between different uses or non-uses of natural resources are considered before making decisions. There is, however, a need for adapted knowledge databases, clarification of methods and training for the municipalities to be able to take on this task. If the government intends to introduce ES based management in Norway, a first step would be to designate the appropriate authority to facilitate a process of relevant authorities across sectors and/or levels to take on this task and to develop guidelines for municipal planners. The experience from Norway therefore shows that without a decision on how the concept should be implemented and who should provide the necessary tools for practitioners to apply, the ES concept will not be effectively integrated into the governance system.

AB  - Geosystem services produced by geological processes are the abiotic equivalents of ecosystem services. Geosystems also contribute to satisfying human needs and produce welfare in the form of, e.g., mineral deposits, landscapes for recreation and tourism, and habitats for rare species that require protection. Geosystems are inherently linked to ecosystems, which causes overlap between provided services. This overlap may in turn cause conflicts over land-use needs and interests. Such controversies can be manifested as mining and mineral exploration disputes (MMEDs). Six MMEDs from Finland were selected for a closer examination. The MMEDs are described and spatially analyzed from the geosystem services perspective. The main causes for the examined MMEDs are land-use issues, i.e., the location of a project in a sensitive context (a protected area (PA), tourism destination, reindeer herding area, or lake area with vacation homes), and/or association with uranium. There have been attempts to block some of the projects through land-use planning by expanding PAs or excluding mining from the municipality. Conversely, one of the projects is an example of the safeguarding of mineral deposits by province-level land-use planning. A more comprehensive consideration of geosystem services by land-use planning may help to accommodate and reconciliate diverse interests and alleviate disputes.

AB  - Aim Previous studies indicate that many plant species present in a surrounding region are absent from potentially suitable sites (i.e. they constitute dark diversity). However, quantitative analyses are lacking where and why dispersal limitation occurs within species occurrence range at the continental scale. We test if species characteristics related to dispersal limitation, that is, low seed production and short potential dispersal distance, affect the formation of dark diversity at large spatial scales. In addition, we explore how the levels of dispersal limitation are affected by climate, landscape heterogeneity and anthropogenic activity.
   Location Seven study areas in Central and Northern Europe - Iceland, Finland, Estonia, the British Isles, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland.
   Methods We used data on vascular plant species occurrences in ca. 10x10km grid cells from each study area. To estimate dark diversity for each grid cell, we applied geographical, biogeographical and environmental filters. Seed production was estimated directly (number of seeds per ramet), and indirectly from seed mass. We used several plant traits in combination (e.g. dispersal syndrome and seed characteristics) to estimate potential dispersal distance of seeds.
   Results Species contributing to dark diversity produced generally fewer seeds and had shorter potential dispersal distances than observed species. Dispersal limitation tended to decrease with increasing environmental stress, human population density and agricultural land use.
   Main conclusions Many species are absent from potentially suitable sites in Central and Northern Europe because of dispersal limitation, induced by low seed production and short potential dispersal distances. However, strong abiotic stress, biotic resistance and human activities have reduced the importance of dispersal limitation. This knowledge can be considered in the predictions of how changes in climate and land use affect biodiversity in the future.

AB  - Coastal areas are especially important to human well-being with half the world's population living within 60 km of the sea and three-quarters of all large cities located in the coastal zone. Supporting and regulatory ecosystem services in coastal areas have received considerable research attention given human vulnerability to climate change, but cultural ecosystem services in the coastal zone are less understood. This study describes and analyzes the distribution of cultural ecosystem values found in coastal areas in multiple countries (n = 5) and compares the results with non-coastal areas. Mapped cultural ecosystem values were collected from public participation GIS (PPGIS) processes in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Norway, and Malaysia and analyzed to identify the type and intensity of ecosystem values located in coastal areas. Mapped ecosystem values were significantly more abundant in all coastal zones, regardless of ecosystem value category, country, population, or dominant land use. Compared to cultural ecosystem values, biological and life-sustaining values were mapped less frequently in the coastal zone. Economic and social values were significantly associated with developed (built) coastal zones, while aesthetic and recreation values were more strongly associated with natural coastal zones. Coastal access, especially by road, influences the mix of perceived values from nature-based values to anthropocentric values. Coastal zones will continue to be the principle location for potential future land use conflict given their high social and cultural value relative to other ecological values. Understanding trade-offs in coastal zone planning and management requires a systematic inventory of the full range of ecosystem services, including cultural services. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - In this study we estimated the amount of carbon (C) stored in the forest growing stock and in wood-based products, and the C-sequestration capacity of the forest sector in Finland. Comparison of different management and utilization options for forest resources over the period 1990-2039 indicates that C is stored more efficiently in standing timber than in wood-based products. This implies that an appropriate increase in the length of the rotation in forestry could be optimal for balancing the needs of forest resources for C sequestration and timber production. Increased use of wood, based on sustainable use of forest resources, to substitute for fossil fuels and materials, could decrease the overall C emissions. Release of sequestered C back to the atmosphere can be delayed by prolonging product lifespans, by increasing recycling, or by disposing of discarded products in landfills. To delay C release, and affect the C balance, however, these changes should be substantial.
   In 1990, the net C balance of the growing stemwood stock was 5.5 Tg C/a, which increased to 16.3 Tg C/a by 2039 if in the future the use of wood would be at the level of the late 1980s. Increased use of wood resulted in a balance of 6.6 Tg C/a or -0.2 Tg C/a, depending on the extent of the use of wood. The average C balance in wood products for the whole period was 3.9, 5.6 or 6.6 Tg C/a, respectively. Changes in production capacity, and consideration of timber and product import and export decreased the average balance from 6.6 Tg C/a to 0.9-1.3 Tg C/a. By comparison, emission from the use of fossil fuels in 1990 C was 14.5 Tg C/a.

AB  - Dormant life stages are important strategies for many aquatic organisms. The formation of resting stages will provide a refuge from unfavourable conditions in the water column, and their successive accumulation in the benthos will constitute a genetic reservoir for future planktonic populations. We have determined the genetic structure of a common bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema marinoi, in the sediment and the plankton during spring, summer and autumn two subsequent years (2007-2009) in Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish west coast. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to assess the level of genetic differentiation and the respective gene diversity of the two different habitats. We also determined the degree of genetic differentiation between the seed banks inside the fjord and the open sea. The results indicate that Gullmar Fjord has one dominant endogenous population of S. marinoi, which is genetically differentiated from the open sea population. The fjord population is encountered in the plankton and in the sediment. Shifts from the dominant population can happen, and in our study, two genetically differentiated plankton populations, displaying reduced genetic diversity, occurred in September 2007 and 2008. Based on our results, we suggest that sill fjords maintain local long-lived and well-adapted protist populations, which continuously shift between the planktonic and benthic habitats. Intermittently, short-lived and mainly asexually reproducing populations can replace the dominant population in the water column, without influencing the genetic structure of the benthic seed bank.

AB  - Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) are commonly recognised as important agents of tree mortality in coniferous forests of the Western Carpathians. They, together with weevils, are consistently associated with ophiostomatoid fungi. Information regarding conifer beetle-associated fungi in the Western Carpathians remains incomplete and unreliable, particularly with respect to fir-infesting bark beetles. This study aims to clarify associations between fungi in the genera Graphilbum, Leptographium, Ophiostoma and Sporothrix (Ophiostomatales) and their beetle vectors in Norway spruce (Picea abies), European larch (Larix decidua) and silver fir (Abies alba). Samples associated with 20 bark beetle species and weevils were collected from nine stands in Poland and the Czech Republic. Fungi were isolated from adult beetles and galleries. Isolates were identified based on morphology, DNA sequence comparisons for four gene regions (ITS, LSU, -tubulin, TEF 1-alpha) and phylogenetic analyses. In total, 46 distinct taxa were identified, including 25 known and 21 currently unknown species. Several associations between fungi and subcortical insects were recorded for the first time. In addition, O. borealis and O. quercus were detected from A. alba for the first time. The composition of the fungal communities varied among the studied tree species and to a lesser degree among the beetle species. The spruce-infesting bark beetles were commonly associated with species of Leptographium s. l. and Ophiostoma s. str.; the larch-infesting bark beetles were often associated with Ophiostoma s. str. and Sporothrix, while the fir-infesting bark beetles were commonly associated with Ophiostoma s. str. and Graphilbum. The most commonly encountered fungal associates of the examined insects were (a) Grosmannia cucullata, G. piceiperda, Grosmannia sp. 1, Ophiostoma macroclavatum and O. piceae with the spruce-infesting bark beetles; (b) O. pseudocatenulatum and Sporothrix sp. 1 with the larch-infesting bark beetles; and (c) O. piceae, Ophiostoma sp. 2 and Graphilbum sp. 2 with the fir-infesting bark beetles. The differences in fungal associates among the bark beetle species occurring on P. abies, L. decidua and A. alba could be linked to the different habitats that these beetles occupy.

AB  - The expansion of nature-based tourism on private land requires new mechanisms to coordinate tourism industry and commercial forestry interests. This attribute-based contingent valuation study elaborated the supply side of potential payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanism named Landscape and Recreational Values Trading (LRVT), proposed to enhance the provision of amenity values in privately owned forests located in tourism and recreation areas. Using a mail survey data set, we analyzed forest owners' willingness to participate in LRVT and the related compensation claims in the Ruka-Kuusamo area, Finland. We found that more restrictive rules regarding forest management practices decrease the probability of participating and increase forest owners' compensation claims in LRVT. Furthermore, forest owners seem to claim more compensation if, instead of private negotiations, competitive tendering is used to make contracts. Moreover, besides the protection of landscape values, biodiversity protection may be a motive for participation. This indicates that, in addition to improved landscape quality, respondents gain personal benefits from enhanced biodiversity in their own forests. The results can help in designing and implementing a future payment mechanism for the provision of forest landscape and recreational values in terms of how to proceed and whom marketing and recruiting efforts should target.

AB  - Reindeer grazing has been entitled as ecological keystone in arctic-alpine landscapes. In addition, reindeer husbandry is tightly connected to the identity of the indigenous Sami people in northern Europe. Nowadays, reindeer husbandry is challenged in several ways, of which pasture degradation, climate change, conflicting land uses and predation are the most important. Research on reindeer-related topics has been conducted for more than half a century and this review illuminates whether or not research is capable to match these challenges. Despite its high quality, traditional reindeer-related research is functionally isolated within the various disciplines. The meshwork of ecology, socio-economy, culture and politics, however, in which reindeer husbandry is embedded by various interactions, will remain unclear and difficult to manage, if actors and relationships are kept separate. We propose some targets for new integrative research approaches that incorporate traditional knowledge and focus on the entire human-ecological system 'reindeer husbandry' to develop solutions for its challenges.

AB  - Silvicultural techniques aimed at promoting forest biomass production can help meet the growing demand for renewable materials and mitigate climate change. One-time nitrogen (N) addition late in the rotation is a wellestablished method to stimulate growth in coniferous forests in northern Europe, but the potential gains from earlier and repeated fertiliser application remain uncertain. Here, we tested the impact of repeated fertilisation in juvenile Norway spruce stands across 9 sites covering a wide range of growing conditions over a 700 km stretch from central to southern Sweden. We tested the fertilisation effects using two separate studies: i) an interval trial with a fertilisation frequency of one (F1), two (F2), or three years (F3) performed at plot-level across five sites (2002-2014), and ii) a practice-oriented trial with a two-year fertilisation interval (F2) applied at stand-level and replicated at four sites (2003-2013). The composition of the nutrient mix in each plot was optimised based on foliar nutrient analyses. In the interval trial, all three fertilisation schedules strongly increased periodic annual increment (PAI) (F1: 105 %, F2: 93 %, F3: 79 %) relative to the unfertilised control, resulting in more than a doubling of stem volume yield in the F1 and F2 treatments (110 % and 120 %, respectively) and a significantly smaller but still sizeable yield stimulation of 82 % in the F3 treatment. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE, stemwood volume increase per unit mass of N added) was similar among fertilisation intervals (on average 130 m3 ha-1 1000 kg N-1), indicating that the extra N provided through yearly fertilisation (F1) is redundant given the similar stemwood yields in the F2 treatment. In the practice-oriented trial, the sole F2 treatment increased PAI by 95 % over the control, translating into a yield stimulation of 114 % and an almost identical NUE to that of the interval trial. NUE greatly exceeded the figures typically observed with traditional late-rotation fertilisation and correlated inversely with baseline site productivity (using site index as a proxy) in the F1 and F2 treatments (the latter pooled across the two trials). Our results clearly indicate that nutrient limitation restricts growth and carbon (C) capture in young Norway spruce plantations in northern Europe to less than half of their potential, highlighting repeated fertilisation at nutrient-poor sites as an effective management tool to support a growing bioeconomy and enhance C sequestration.

AB  - Ecosystem conservation programs are increasingly incorporating both preservation and restoration strategies for ensuring the flow of ecosystem services from public lands. While preservation and restoration have similar end ecological objectives, differences in these conservation types may create systematic variation in willingness to pay (WTP) for their benefits. There has also been conflicting evidence of whether or not the amount, or scope, of conservation influences the demand for environmental improvements in manners consistent with neoclassical economics (greater value for more conservation). To investigate the sensitivity of conservation values to type and scope, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We synthesized 127 data points from 22 primary studies that provided WTP estimates for preservation, forest restoration, and freshwater restoration conducted primarily on public lands. Estimates were derived from choice experiments, contingent rankings, and dichotomous choice contingent valuation studies for conservation programs in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. from 1987 to 2013. We found strong evidence for systematic variation of WTP depending on conservation type and scope. Values for preservation were greater than both forest and freshwater restoration; and freshwater restoration was valued greater than forest restoration. Meta-estimates were found to be sensitive to scope effects, as value increased with conservation intensity but at diminishing marginal rates. We provide quantitative policy analysis in the form of within-sample predictions of mean WTP for each conservation type and scope and conclude with recommendations.

AB  - Conversion of farmland to built-up land threatens future supply of food and other ecosystem services. However, little research covers how different goods provided by farmland are taken into consideration in planning processes or how different actors influence land-use outcomes. This paper explores this by undertaking a comparative case study in two Norwegian municipalities. One of the main findings is that the national policies' emphasis on food security is not decisive for local farmland preservation decisions. The land-use plan of the municipality which has the strictest farmland conversion policy is guided by other local values, such as the farmland's provision of place identity and local food. In both municipalities, informal support networks of developers, other landowners, business interests, and politicians are established. Farmland preservation interests were less visible locally, and politicians found conversion proposals difficult to resist. The municipality which had converted most farmland was in favor of opening more land for development than needed. Then, the possibility space for development interest groups to influence land-use outcome increased. Findings indicate that farmland preservation policies require more emphasis on local public goods and inclusion of farmland preservation interests within the community. Further, farmland preservation strategies could benefit from linking agricultural policies and land-use planning, as well as more restrictive land-use planning.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on nitrogen (N) cycling in forest ecosystems, many uncertainties remain, particularly regarding long-term N accumulation in the soil. Models validated against tracer isotopic data from field labeling experiments provide a potential tool to better understand and simulate C and N interactions over multiple decades. In this study, we describe the adaptation of the dynamic process-based model TRACE to a new site, Alptal, where long-term N-addition and N-15-tracer experiments provide unique datasets for testing the model. We describe model parameterization for this spruce forest, and then test the model with 9- and 14-year time series of N-15-tracer recovery from control and N-amended catchments, respectively. Finally, we use the model to project the fate of ecosystem N accumulation over the next 70 years. Field N-15 recovery data show that the major sink for N deposition is the soil. On the control plot, tracer recovery in the soil increased from 32 % in the second year to 60 % in the ninth year following tracer addition, whereas on the N-saturated plot, soil recovery stayed almost constant from 63 % in the third year to 61 % in the twelfth year. Recovery in tree biomass increased over the decadal time scale in both treatments, to ca. 10 % over 9 years on the control plot and ca. 13 % over 14 years on the N-amended plot. We then used these time series to validate TRACE, showing that the adaptation and calibration procedure for the Alptal site was successful. Model-data comparison identified that the spreading method of N-15 tracers needs to be considered when interpreting recovery results from labeling studies. Furthermore, the ground vegetation layer was recognized to play an important role in controlling the rate at which deposited N enters soil pools. Our 70-year model simulation into the future underpinned by a Monte-Carlo sensitivity analysis, suggests that the soil is able to immobilize a constant fraction of 70 and 77 % of deposited N for the treated and the control plot, respectively. Further, the model showed that the simulated increased N deposition resulted in a relatively small elevated C sequestration in aggrading wood with an N use efficiency of approximately 7 kg C per kg N added.

AB  - 1. Ant nests are also inhabited by other invertebrates, ant associates. The oribatid mite (Acari: Oribatida) fauna of nests is poorly known, both in terms of abundance and diversity.
   2. We compared the oribatid assemblages within and outside red wood ant Formica polyctena nests in a Finnish oak forest. Altogether ten mounds were investigated and comparable samples were collected from adjacent soil 4 m from each mound.
   3. A total of 10 529 specimens were recovered, 4959 of them in mounds and 5633 in soil. The specimens represented 74 species (and two higher taxa) belonging to 60 genera and 39 families. Significant differences in abundance or diversity were not observed between nests and soil habitats. For nest samples the abundance of specimens significantly correlated with diversity indicating that mounds form rich habitat patches with a diverse set of niches. Mound size had no effect on community composition.
   4. The nest and soil habitats were predominantly occupied by different species resulting in dissimilarities in community composition; 34% of the species showed a preference for nest habitat and 50% for soil habitats, whereas16% were indifferent with equal abundances in both habitats. Nonetheless, most of the species with a preference for nests are frequently found in various habitats in nature, and may be classified as facultative myrmecophiles that maintain populations also in ant nests.
   5. Ant nests host abundant and diverse oribatid assemblages, which differ from the fauna in adjacent soil, and wood ants are therefore important factors in maintaining biodiversity.

AB  - With the increasing individualization of society, perceptions and attitudes towards nature and forest management is changing. Knowledge about motives for visiting woodlands as well as the aesthetic perception of forests can support forest management and communication strategies. In Central Europe, multifunctional, close-to-nature silviculture aims to convert the still dominating conifer monocultures towards mixed, structured forests to establish forests that are better adapted to the changing climate, thus enhancing the value for nature conservation and increasing their ability to provide ecosystem services. Reflecting these management objectives, we examined the perception and scenic preferences of the resulting forest stands in Munich ' s urban proximate woodlands. We applied both surveys with choice experiments using visualizations of different forest stands and conducted Photovoice walks. In the choice experiments, most interviewees preferred the visualizations of mixed forests. Deadwood was appreciated in mixed stands. Knowledge about the positive effects of deadwood influenced this choice. With the Photovoice walks, it could be shown that many forest types and even monocultures were perceived to be very attractive, such as tall Norway spruce (Picea abies) stands. In addition, small details such as single trees, colorful leaves, or small vegetation features contributed to a positive perception of the forest.

AB  - Afforestation of former agricultural soils is an important tool to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels because of the high capacity of both biomass and soil to store carbon (C). The long-term effect of afforestation on the role of soil as C sink was investigated in a chronosequence of 18-, 29-, 64-, 73-, and 91-year-old Picea abies stands, established on former agricultural soils in southwestern Sweden.
   The forest floor was sampled both as a whole and in the three horizons (unaltered, semialtered, and altered organic horizons), whereas the mineral soil was sampled at 0 to 5, 5 to 15, and 15 to 30 cm depth. The physicochemical characterization of soil, C and nitrogen content, and lignin characterization by the cupric oxide oxidation method was conducted.
   Within the first decades of afforestation, the soil properties reflected the former soil management, and C accumulation involved mainly the organic layer (3.41-5.92 Mg C ha(-1)), where the new litter was accumulating, and coniferous lignin showed a low degree of degradation. Meanwhile, the mineral soil behaved as a C source (95.5-80.2 Mg C ha(-1)), loosening the C inherited from the previous land use probably because of the nutrient needs of the growing trees that accelerated organic matter mineralization. Vanillyl moieties were almost absent, and the syringyl units, derived from angiosperms, were considerably oxidized, indicating a low C input from the conifer litter and high degradation of the inherited organic material.
   With age, the C stock started to increase both in the organic and mineral layers, reaching 191.5 Mg ha(-1) in 91 years. The accumulation in organic soil was accompanied by a litter nitrogen impoverishment and decrease of soil pH, which probably limited the microbial community to fungi, able to degrade lignin. In the oldest stands, the lignin material seemed to be intensively altered, mainly in the deeper organic horizons, where aromatic, mobile, acidic compounds were produced and/or translocated down in the profile. This could contribute to organic matter incorporation into mineral layers and to mineral weathering, driving the soil toward the restarting of the podzolization process.
   From these results, it seemed that even if the previous land use caused an initial acceleration of organic matter mineralization, soil started to accumulate C when the influence of the new vegetation dominated. The soil became a major C sink with a long forest growth of about a century. The accumulation was strongly affected by litter composition, which changed with spruce age.

AB  - The main focus of the study was to find out whether and how the forestry management in the Bialowieza Forest has influenced the mosaic diversity of field layer vegetation and habitat heterogeneity in the temperate hard wood forest (Tilia-Carpinetum). Five belt-transects represent natural and semi natural old-growths in Bialowieza National Park (BNP), the commercial forest (CF), and secondary stands in the CE Along the transects, distinct patches of field layer vegetation were identified and delimited, and their species composition was assessed. Along central lines of the transects the environmental data was collected from sample points established at regular intervals: soil pH and the distances to the 4 closest trees, their species, and dbh (diameter at the breast height = 135 cm). The group of patches (on average 50 per transect) was subjected to the dichotomous classification in order to identify a number of characteristic types of microphytocoenoses - synusiae. Beta-diversity of the vegetation was expressed with the Simpson diversity index calculated on the basis of areas occupied by synusiae. The most structurally diversified were the transects representing natural old-growths in the BNP. A calculation of similarity coefficients between the transects on the basis of their mosaic composition displayed sharper differences between old-growth and secondary communities in summer than those found in spring. Forestry management has seriously modified the tree species composition in two studied stands, through planting oak or initiating succession. This resulted, both in plantation and pioneer stand, in loss of the main components of natural old-growths: hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Norway spruce (Picea abies), lime (Tilia cordata) and maple (Acer platanoides). Significantly a wider range of soil pH values in natural old-growths coincided with a higher diversity of herbaceous mosaics comparing to secondary stands. The elimination of spruce (the species being most commonly blown down, projecting an acid canopy shadow) in two studied areas, elimination of dead wood, and destruction of humus layers through ploughing, could contribute to a reduction of specific microenvironments. A lower mosaic diversity of secondary stands coinciding with the unification of environmental conditions along the transects may indicate that forestry management can lead to the disappearance of a highly structural character in natural forest communities.

AB  - Engaging civil society in conservation activities is an important complementary strategy to counteract ongoing biodiversity decline and loss of ecosystem services. Since 2011, the Swedish Anglers Association (SAA) has cooperated with landowners to restore wetlands nationwide. We investigated factors that enabled or hindered civil society-led wetland restoration in Sweden through interviews and surveys with the SAA's project leaders and landowners. Principal internal and external factors contributing to the project's implementation included: flexibility and adaptive management of its leadership; support from authorities and policies; the good reputation of the SAA team; and landowners' willingness to cooperate. The latter was linked to their feelings of environmental responsibility, the low investment required by them, and expectations of some benefits. We discuss the need to enable adaptive management in environmental management projects, adjust existing policies to their needs, and re-think funding strategies to consider the long-term nature of such projects.

AB  - The forest industry is a significant emitter of CO2 and thus it needs to transform toward a more sustainable operation in order to contribute to tackling climate change. This paper looks at the progress, tools, possibilities, and barriers of Finnish and Swedish forest industries in achieving deep decarbonization. Finland and Sweden have set ambitious national targets to reach net negative greenhouse gas emissions. The role of the forest industry in reaching national targets in these countries remains unclear even if significant fossil CO2 emission reduction and efficiency improvement has occurred. If the forest industries in these countries fulfill their planned future visions, their contribution to meeting the targets will be substantial. This study identified the largest CO2 emitting sectors in the forest industry. They are for both countries, arranged by size, transport including non-road mobile machinery, on-site energy production, fossil fuel use in processes (lime kilns and dryers), and purchased electricity. Viable decarbonization measures exist for key fossil CO2 emissions sources, but several technical, economic, and political barriers are hindering their implementation. Fuel switching from fossil energy sources to bio-based alternatives is the main tool in the decarbonization of the forest sector in both countries, but also electrification of e.g. transport, provides emission reduction opportunities. The forest industry has a high and sustainable potential to become carbon-negative by investing in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) but achieving net-zero emissions might not be realistic without changes in policies and suitable incentives.

AB  - The species we have studied the spatiotemporal genetic change in the northern dragonhead, a plant species that has experienced a drastic population decline and habitat loss in Europe. We have added a temporal perspective to the monitoring of northern dragonhead in Norway by genotyping herbarium specimens up to 200 years old. We have also assessed whether northern dragonhead has achieved its potential distribution in Norway. To obtain the genotype data from 130 herbarium specimens collected from 1820 to 2008, mainly from Norway (83) but also beyond (47), we applied a microfluidic array consisting of 96 SNP markers. To assess temporal genetic change, we compared our new genotype data with existing data from modern samples. We used sample metadata and observational records to model the species' environmental niche and potential distribution in Norway. Our results show that the SNP array successfully genotyped all included herbarium specimens. Hence, with the appropriate design procedures, the SNP array technology appears highly promising for genotyping old herbarium specimens. The captured genetic diversity correlates negatively with distance from Norway. The historical-modern comparisons reveal similar genetic structure and diversity across space and limited genetic change through time in Norway, providing no signs of any regional bottleneck (i.e., spatiotemporal stasis). The regional areas in Norway have remained genetically divergent, however, both from each other and more so from populations outside of Norway, rendering continued protection of the species in Norway relevant. The ENM results suggest that northern dragonhead has not fully achieved its potential distribution in Norway and corroborate that the species is anchored in warmer and drier habitats.

AB  - Non-Wood Forest Products (NWFPs) provide social and cultural services related to e.g., the tradition and social role of collecting berries, mushrooms and herbs. These services can be ranked among intangible outputs as a part of the recreational function of forests. However, their social value is only partially captured in non-forest activities. We used a Choice Experiment to explore individuals' preferences towards NWFPs and associated services in Italy, Sweden, and Czechia. We estimated the individual marginal willingness to pay for the supply and maintenance of NWFPs. In addition, we analysed the determinants of people's choices using the framework of the Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). The results show that people collect NWFPs mostly for self-consumption and recreation, rather than for livelihood or to sell them on the market. Despite this, they are willing to pay for sustainable forest management practices that favour NWFPs supply, as well as for forest conservation. Additionally, Care and Fairness traits in the MFT determine people's willingness to pay for NWFPs. The results from this study highlight the value of the social component of non-wood forests products and the expenses related to picking. This is a first step towards a value chain analysis of the NWFPs.

AB  - River regulation for hydropower is undertaken worldwide, causing profound alterations to hydrological regimes and running water habitats. Regulated catchments are often subjected to additional stressors, arising inter alia from agriculture, forestry and industry, which are likely to interact with impacts of river regulation on fish and other biota. Such interactions are poorly understood, hindering planning of effective mitigation and restoration. We investigated fish responses to increased discharge (as a restoration measure) in regulated rivers in Sweden. We compiled electrofishing data from river channels downstream of hydropower dams, each of which either has or lacks a mandated minimum discharge corresponding to c. 5% of pre-regulation discharge. We further analysed interactions between flow restoration and co-occurring local and regional stressors. River channels without a mandated minimum discharge were characterized by a low diversity of fish species with traits favouring persistence under unpredictable environmental conditions, including omnivory, short life cycles and small size. Additional stressors further reduced diversity and increased dominance by broad-niched, opportunistic species. Both the presence and magnitude of a mandated minimum discharge were positively related to fish diversity and density, and the relative density of three economically and recreationally valuable species. However, the size of these relationships frequently varied with the presence of additional stressors. Increasing levels of hydrological degradation and reduced connectivity at the catchment scale reduced positive flow-ecology relationships and hindered the restoration of fish communities towards reference conditions. However, application of a mandated minimum discharge also assisted in mitigating impacts of some co-occurring stressors, especially reduced riparian integrity. Synthesis and applications. Additional stressors can strongly influence the outcomes of flow restoration for fish community diversity and composition. Our approach combining fish species and trait data from multiple flow restoration projects with information on additional stressors yielded valuable insights into factors affecting flow restoration success, useful for (a) identifying the systems most likely to benefit from mandated minimum flows, (b) modelling influences of multiple stressors on flow-ecology relationships, (c) prioritizing additional measures to manage co-occurring stressors and enhance outcomes from flow restoration.

AB  - Arctic coastal communities are a part of co-evolving marine social-ecological systems (SES), which support livelihoods, provide sustenance and underpin cultural identity. Whale ecosystem services (ES) represent a useful lens for gaining greater understanding of the linkages between marine ecosystems and human well-being, in the Arctic and beyond. The increasingly popular well-being economy paradigm recognises the contribution of different capital assets to human well-being and how these underpin the pursuit of sustainability domains: environmental, social and economic. This study explores the ways in which capital assets (natural, social, human, and financial and physical) provide essential natural and non-natural inputs into the delivery of whale ES in Arctic coastal communities. Through the deployment of a well-being economy framework linking capital assets to well-being goals and domains, examples are reported from three Arctic coastal communities in Iceland, Norway and Greenland. These case studies are based on data collected using multiple qualitative research methods: stakeholder mapping, participant and non-participant observations, literature reviews, and 54 semi structured interviews with various stakeholders. The findings affirm that non-natural capital assets interact with natural capital in order to supply various whale ES, which include but are not limited to provisioned food products, recreational tourism, education, and artistic expressions. These results are significant since they provide a basis for understanding when, where and how decision-makers should intervene in whale ES delivery to maximise well-being and sustainability.

AB  - Finland is a Northern country where mineral exploration and mining has significantly increased during the 2000s. At the same time there occurs competition over the right to use land and ecosystem services. Main competitors over land with mineral exploration and mining industry are especially tourism, reindeer herding, and environmental protection. In this study we combine information over geology, location, timescales, and uncertainty to provide mineral related foresight tools: 1) Mine potential tool, and 2) Mineral deposit potential tool. The former is applied to known mineral deposits and targeted mineral exploration, the latter to regional mineral exploration. Cases presented include Sodankyla for nickel, Kolari for iron, copper and gold, and Kittila for gold. In a long-term foresight, the usefulness of information on mineral exploration licenses proved limited. Better support for the long-term foresight is given by geological potential (prospectivity), time framing and narrative probabilities for known mineral deposits. Visualising the long timescales and uncertainties in a spatial context is the greatest value of these foresight tools. Also the concept of 'deposit archive', adopting those detected mineral deposits that have proven uninteresting or uneconomic in the current market environment, provides a valuable insight to availability of raw materials in a long term together with the adaptation of the assessment of undiscovered mineral resources.

AB  - Forests are sources of multiple ecosystem services (ESs) essential for human wellbeing. Forest owners are critical actors to decide which benefits they produce from their forests. To support the uptake of alternative forest management strategies in a way that is beneficial from the perspective of society as whole, new incentive schemes could be implemented in the future. We applied the choice experiment method to investigate Finnish forest owners' potential participation in an incentive scheme in which they were asked to practice a 'Timber Oriented' or a 'Nature Oriented' management strategy according to the terms of a hypothetical contract. We found that the majority forest owners are willing to participate in the considered contract-based payment scheme, especially those supporting biodiversity and non-market ESs. Non-profitability attributes including biodiversity, carbon stock, and probability of climate change induced damage were highly valued. Forest owners prefer the management contract with the Nature Oriented strategy. Forest owners' preferences for the contractbased management and associated effects are heterogenous.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Chronic wasting disease (CWD), the most transmissible of the prion diseases, was detected in 2016 in Norway in a wild reindeer. This is the first case in Europe, an unexpected one. This paper focuses on the issues that the arrival of CWD raises in Northern Europe, especially regarding the Indigenous Sami reindeer husbandry in Sweden. The study offers a diagnosis of the situation regarding the management of the disease and its risks. We present the importance of the involvement of the Sami people in the surveillance program in order to understand better the diseases and the reindeer populations, movement, and behavior. However, the implementation of new European health standards in the Sami reindeer herding could have tremendous consequences on the evolution of this ancestral activity and the relationship between herders and reindeer.
   Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is the most transmissible of the prion diseases. In 2016, an unexpected case was found in Norway, the first in Europe. Since then, there have been 32 confirmed cases in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. This paper aims to examine the situation from a social and political perspective: considering the management of CWD in the Swedish part of Sapmi-the Sami ancestral land; identifying the place of the Sami people in the risk management-because of the threats to Sami reindeer herding that CWD presents; and understanding how the disease can modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer husbandry, whether or not CWD is epizootic. Based on interviews with various stakeholders and by examining the social sciences literature, this paper shows that the health risk management is structured by a politico-scientific controversy about the recognition, or not, of atypical and classical CWD. The Sami herders are currently cooperating with the state authorities in the surveillance program to sample their herds. This involvement takes place in a situation where the balance of power between the Sami people and the state, or the European Union, is framed by its colonial context. This has consequences with respect to the definition of a common interest and to implementing sanitary measures. The particular features of reindeer herding are seen as a challenge to managing CWD risk, compared with European health standards. We argue that CWD will greatly modify the modalities of Indigenous reindeer herding, whether there are positive cases or not in the Sami reindeer. By implementing new health guidelines, the authorities will create a cascading effect in Sami land and its use. The CWD situation in Fennoscandia is full of uncertainty but may cause a major shift in the organization and the governance of Sapmi. In September 2020, the identification of a new CWD case in a wild reindeer in Norway started a new episode in the disease management in Fennoscandia. Our paper raises various questions linked to understanding this new step in this crisis which is not only epidemiological, but also socio-cultural and political.

AB  - This study focusses on the analysis of governance innovations to promote the provision of forest ecosystem services framed as social innovations. Social innovations can refer to any solution that addresses a social or environmental issue and that creates social relationships in the process leading to new types of collaborations among actors. Up until now, it is not well known how exactly such processes are initiated and maintained over time. Against this backdrop, an analysis is conducted for three European cases of such governance innovation processes in Finland, Germany, and Sweden. The Process-Net-Map is employed for data collection and analysis with the aim to map the innovation process against a timeline in terms of all relevant events and actors, also marking the challenging and positive moments in the process. Results highlight on similarities and differences between the analyzed cases in regard to the typical roles that actors assume for the initiation and continuation of the innovation process over time and the identification of typical types of so-called action situations, in which actors interact with each other throughout the process. Furthermore, the criteria which interview respondents use to define success and failure of the innovation process are investigated and compared across cases.

AB  - Surface mineral horizons from four ecosystems sampled in the northwestern Italian Alps were incubated at -3 and +3 degrees C to simulate subnivial and early thaw period temperatures for a seasonally snow-covered area. The soil profiles at these sites represent extreme examples of management, grazed meadow (site M) and extensive grazing beneath larch (site L) or naturally disturbed by avalanche and colonized by alder (site A) and the expected forest climax vegetation beneath fir (site F). Changes in labile pools of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were active at all sites at both temperatures during 14 days of laboratory incubation. Ammonium was the dominant inorganic form of total dissolved N (TDN), being equivalent to 1.8-9.8 g N m(-2) within the mineral horizon. Gross rates of ammonification were similar at the two temperatures but significantly (p < 0.05) greater in soil from beneath fir than in the other three. Nitrification occurred in all soils and displayed a wide range in rates, from 2 to 85 mg N m(-2) day(-1), and was least in the two most acid soils, A and F. Immobilization of NH4+ as microbial N was greater in the fir soil than in the other three. Also, the fir soil showed greatest gross ammonification and least accumulation of NO3- and greatest tendency to retain N. This high N retention capacity in the climax ecosystem contrasted with the managed systems characterized by higher nitrification rates and greater potential spring NO3- loss. Dissolved organic N ranged between 30 and 50% of the TDN, while dissolved organic P was greater than 70% of total dissolved P (TDP). The dissolved organic compounds were important components of the labile pool, in equilibrium with a large reserve of organic N, and may significantly contribute to the soil N availability at low temperatures.

AB  - 1. Norway rat Rattus norvegicus populations are usually controlled with toxic baits, but this approach is increasingly recognized as having negative welfare and environmental impacts. An integrated strategy that relies less on rodenticides is therefore required. Here we investigate the possibility of using a resource-based approach to rat population management.
   2. Structurally complex habitats provide rat populations with nest sites and opportunities to avoid predators; modifying habitats to reduce structural complexity might reduce their potential to support rat populations. As part of an integrated approach, this could be more sustainable than relying exclusively on lethal control. However, in order to target habitat management efforts most effectively with minimum impact on other species, an understanding of habitat utilization by Norway rats is required.
   3. In this study, rat populations on farms in the north-east of England were monitored by radio-tracking and population counts before and after a single phase of habitat modification. Rats living near farm buildings utilized areas with high levels of cover; habitat modification reduced the survival rate and size of these rat populations. Rats living in field margins also preferred areas with high levels of cover, but they had significantly bigger home ranges than rats living near farm buildings and were largely unaffected by small-scale habitat management.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that habitat management near farm buildings has the potential to reduce the size of rat populations. As part of an integrated approach, this technique offers a way of reducing reliance on rodenticides. Habitat use by rats within the wider farm landscape suggests that land management practices have the potential to influence the size and distribution of rat populations; many game-rearing practices and environmental policies designed to create habitats for 'desirable' farm wildlife, inadvertently create desirable habitats for rats.

AB  - A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that explain the diversity and distribution of species. The evolutionary history of species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals. Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the northern region than in the southern part of the study region. Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.

AB  - Key message Norway spruce needle trait variation in natural populations along elevational gradient (980-1860 m a.s.l.) was driven more by environmental than genetic factors. Humid habitats conditioned higher mean values of morpho-anatomical needle traits in relation to dry habitats. Geographical and climatic characteristics (elevation, mean annual temperature, summer heat: moisture index, evaporation, climatic moisture deficit, growing degree-days, heating degree-days, de Martonne's aridity index) drive variations in the morphological and anatomical traits of the Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) needle (needle length, needle thickness, needle width, epidermis thickness with cuticle, hypodermis height, central bundle diameter, resin duct diameter, and the number of resin ducts). We studied the pattern of variation in these needle characteristics in 15 Balkan Mountains (BM) and Dinaric Alps (DA) natural populations (altitudes ranging from 1100 to 1860 and from 980 to 1530 m a.s.l., respectively). The needle traits showed significant differentiation between mountain regions, between populations and within populations. The largest contribution of genetic component in phenotypic variation had the needle length, both components had the same share in the needle width, whereas the environmental component of variability had the largest share in the other needle traits. The principal component analysis revealed that anatomical needle traits and the climatic conditions contributed to differences between populations from different mountain regions. An agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three dendogram clusters: three BM populations made one cluster, DA populations made the second, whereas seven populations close to the BM populations and five close to the DA populations made the third cluster. Patterns of morpho-anatomical phenotypic variability point to selective mechanisms and adjustments, enable to define the boundaries of climate niches, and may provide a starting point for conservation program according to climate change projections in the Balkan region.

AB  - The importance of tree species identity and diversity for biogeochemical cycles in forests is not well understood. In the past, forestry has widely converted mixed forests to pure stands while contemporary forest policy often prefers mixed stands again. However, the hydrological consequences of these changes remain unclear. We tested the hypotheses (i) that significant differences in water use per ground area exist among the tree species of temperate mixed forests and that these differences are more relevant for the amount of stand-level canopy transpiration (E-c) than putative complementarity effects of tree water use, and (ii) that the seasonal patterns of E-c in mixed stands are significantly influenced by the identity of the present tree species. We measured xylem sap flux during 2005 (average precipitation) and 2006 (relatively dry) synchronously in three nearby old-growth forest stands on similar soil differing in the abundance of European beech (pure beech stand, 3-species stand with 70% beech, 5-species stand with <10% beech). In summer 2005 with average rainfall, E-c was 50% higher in the beech-poor 5-species stand than in the two stands with moderate to high beech presence (158 vs. 97 and 101 mm yr(-1)); in the dry summer 2006, all stands converged toward similar E-c totals (128-139 mm yr(-1)). Species differences in E-c were large on a sapwood area basis, reflecting a considerable variation in hydraulic architecture and leaf conductance regulation among the co-existing species. Moreover, transpiration per crown projection area (E-CA) also differed up to 5-fold among the different species in the mixed stands, probably reflecting contrasting sapwood/crown area ratios. We conclude that E-c is not principally higher in mixed forests than in pure beech stands. However, tree species-specific traits have an important influence on the height of E-c and affect its seasonal variation. Species with a relatively high E-CA (notably Tilia) may exhaust soil water reserves early in summer, thereby increasing drought stress in dry years and possibly reducing ecosystem stability in mixed forests.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) stored in northern peatlands and permafrost-affected soils are key components in the global carbon cycle. This article quantifies SOC stocks in a sub-Arctic mountainous peatland environment in the discontinuous permafrost zone in Abisko, northern Sweden. Four machine-learning techniques are evaluated for SOC quantification: multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, support vector machine and random forest. The random forest model performed best and was used to predict SOC for several depth increments at a spatial resolution of 1 m (1 x 1 m). A high-resolution (1 m) land cover classification generated for this study is the most relevant predictive variable. The landscape mean SOC storage (0-150 cm) is estimated to be 8.3 +/- 8.0 kg C m(-2) and the SOC stored in the top meter (0-100 cm) to be 7.7 +/- 6.2 kg C m(-2). The predictive modeling highlights the relative importance of wetland areas and in particular peat plateaus for the landscape's SOC storage. The total SOC was also predicted at reduced spatial resolutions of 2, 10, 30, 100, 250 and 1000 m and shows a significant drop in land cover class detail and a tendency to underestimate the SOC at resolutions > 30 m. This is associated with the occurrence of many small-scale wetlands forming local hot-spots of SOC storage that are omitted at coarse resolutions. Sharp transitions in SOC storage associated with land cover and permafrost distribution are the most challenging methodological aspect. However, in this study, at local, regional and circum-Arctic scales, the main factor limiting robust SOC mapping efforts is the scarcity of soil pedon data from across the entire environmental space. For the Abisko region, past SOC and permafrost dynamics indicate that most of the SOC is barely 2000 years old and very dynamic. Future research needs to investigate the geomorphic response of permafrost degradation and the fate of SOC across all landscape compartments in post-permafrost landscapes.

AB  - The paper presents empirical data on motivation for mountain biking in Norway In the study a mountain biker was defined as a person who had cycled on rough trails or in difficult terrain more than ten times during the previous year. The research sought to establish the degree to which the motivation for the 'modern' activity of mountain biking differs from the motivation for more 'traditional' outdoor recreational activities. In 2002 two surveys were conducted among bikers to take into account two different ways of practising mountain biking. A factor analysis was undertaken with 27 items from the Recreation Experience Preference (REP) scales to establish the relative importance of various kinds of motivation. Participants rated the importance of the factors on a scale from I (not at all important) to 5 (very important). 'Physical exercise' scored a mean value of 4.46, 'contemplation' 3.91 'nature & place' 3.52, 'speed & excitement' 3.43, 'managing challenges' 3.35, 'social relations 2.49, and 'equipment & appreciation' 2.02. The paper concludes that a theoretical perspective which focuses on both change and stability in cultural development in the late-modern period is necessary for a nuanced understanding of the complexities of Norwegian outdoor recreation today.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is vulnerable to environmental changes. With the increasing shipping activities, the risk of oil spills remains high. Archaea are widely distributed in many environments. However, the distribution and the response of archaeal communities to oil contamination have rarely been investigated in brackish habitats. Hence, we conducted a survey to investigate the distribution, diversity, composition, and species interactions of indigenous archaeal communities at oil-contaminated sites along the coast of the Gulf of Finland (GoF) using high-throughput sequencing. Surface water and littoral sediment samples were collected at presumably oil-contaminated (oil distribution facilities) and clean sites along the coastline of the GoF in the winter 2015 and the summer 2016. Another three samples of open sea surface water were taken as offshore references. Of Archaea, Euryarchaeota dominated in the surface water and the littoral sediment of the coast of the GoF, followed by Crenarchaeota (including Thaumarchaeota, Thermoprotei, and Korarchaeota based on the Greengenes database used). The unclassified sequences accounted for 5.62% of the total archaeal sequences. Our study revealed a strong dependence of the archaeal community composition on environmental variables (e.g., salinity, pH, oil concentration, TOM, electrical conductivity, and total DNA concentration) in both littoral sediment and coastal water in the GoF. The composition of archaeal communities was season and ecosystem dependent. Archaea was highly diverse in the three ecosystems (littoral sediment, coastal water, and open sea water). Littoral sediment harbored the highest diversity of archaea. Oil was often detected in the littoral sediment but rarely detected in water at those presumably contaminated sites. Although the composition of archaeal community in the littoral sediment was sensitive to low-input oil contamination, the unchanged putative functional profiles and increased interconnectivity of the archaeal core species network plausibly revealed resilience and the potential for oil degradation. Halobacteriaceae and putative cytochrome P450 pathways were significantly enriched in the oil-contaminated littoral sediment. The archaeal taxa formed highly interconnected and interactive networks, in which Halobacteriaceae, Thermococcus, and methanogens were the main components, implying a potential relevant trophic connection between hydrocarbon degradation, methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, and/or fermentative growth.

AB  - Windstorms, bark beetle outbreaks and fires are important natural disturbances in coniferous forests worldwide. Windthrown trees promote biodiversity and restoration within production forests, but also cause large economic losses due to bark beetle infestation and accelerated fungal decomposition. Such damaged trees are often removed by salvage logging, which leads to decreased biodiversity and thus increasingly evokes discussions between economists and ecologists about appropriate strategies. To reveal the reasons behind species loss after salvage logging, we used a functional approach based on four habitat-related ecological traits and focused on saproxylic beetles. We predicted that salvage logging would decrease functional diversity (measured as effect sizes of mean pairwise distances using null models) as well as mean values of beetle body size, wood diameter niche and canopy cover niche, but would increase decay stage niche. As expected, salvage logging caused a decrease in species richness, but led to an increase in functional diversity by altering the species composition from habitat-filtered assemblages toward random assemblages. Even though salvage logging removes tree trunks, the most negative effects were found for small and heliophilous species and for species specialized on wood of small diameter. Our results suggested that salvage logging disrupts the natural assembly process on windthrown trees and that negative ecological impacts are caused more by microclimate alteration of the dead-wood objects than by loss of resource amount. These insights underline the power of functional approaches to detect ecosystem responses to anthropogenic disturbance and form a basis for management decisions in conservation. To mitigate negative effects on saproxylic beetle diversity after windthrows, we recommend preserving single windthrown trees or at least their tops with exposed branches during salvage logging. Such an extension of the green-tree retention approach to windthrown trees will preserve natural succession and associated communities of disturbed spruce forests.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that processes of upward treeline expansion and shifts in vegetation zones may occur in response to climate change. However, such shifts can be limited by a variety of non-climatic factors, such as nutrient availability, soil conditions, landscape fragmentation and some species-specific traits. Many changes in species distributions have been observed, although no evidence of complete community replacement has been registered yet. Climatic signals are often confounded with the effects of human activity, for example, forest encroachment at the treeline owing to the coupled effect of climate change and highland pasture abandonment. Data on the treeline ecotone, barriers to the expected treeline or dominant tree species shifts due to climate and land use change, and their possible impacts on biodiversity in 11 mountain areas of interest, from Italy to Norway and from Spain to Bulgaria, are reported. We investigated the role of environmental conditions on treeline ecotone features with a focus on treeline shift. The results showed that treeline altitude and the altitudinal width of the treeline ecotone, as well as the significance of climatic and soil parameters as barriers against tree species shift, significantly decreased with increasing latitude. However, the largest part of the commonly observed variability in mountain vegetation near the treeline in Europe seems to be caused by geomorphological, geological, pedological and microclimatic variability in combination with different land use history and present socio-economic relations.

AB  - Soil nitrogen (SN) and soil phosphorus (SP) contents support several ecosystem services and define the forest type distribution at local scale in Southern Patagonia. The quantification of nutrients during forest surveys requires soil samplings and estimations that are costly and difficult to measure. For this, predictive models of soil nutrients are needed. The objective of this study was to quantify SN and SP contents (30 cm depth) using different modelling approaches based on climatic, topographic and vegetation variables. We used data from 728 stands of different forest types for linear regression models to map SN and SP. The fitted models captured the variability of forest types well (R-2-adj. 92-98% for SN and 70-87% for SP). The means were 9.3 ton ha(-1) for SN and 124.3 kg ha(-1) for SP. Overall, SN values were higher in the deciduous forests than those in the mixed evergreen, while SP was the highest in the Nothofagus pumilio forests. SN and SP are relevant metrics for many applications, connecting major issues, such as forest management and conservation. With these models, the quantification of SN and SP stocks across forests of different protection status (National Law 26,331/07) and national/provincial reserve networks is possible, contributing to the determination of nutrient contents at landscape level.

AB  - Appropriate fertilization practices play a crucial role in the maintenance of genetic diversity within captive fish broodstocks. We assessed the influence of in vitro storage of gametes (0-, 7- and 14-days post-stripping) at 1 degrees C on ovarian fluid pH, sperm motility, and embryo viability in the critically endangered Finnish landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) population. A repeated full-factorial design used in both sperm-ovarian fluid activation analyses and fertilizations allowed us to separate the effects of female, male and their interaction on gamete quality and embryo survival across storage times. The ovarian fluid pH decreased most significantly during the first week of storage and showed considerable variation among females. The decrease of sperm motility varied across males, females and male-female (sperm-ovarian fluid) combinations. The mean proportion of viable embryos was initially 96.4%, but dropped to 45.5% after 7 days, and to 13.1% after 14 days of gamete storage. Embryo viability responses to gamete storage time predominantly increased among- and within-female variation but also showed major differences between female x male combinations (non-additive genetic effects). Interestingly, embryo viability showed virtually complete re-ranking (change of order) among full-sib families between the first two fertilization times (r(s) = - 0.03) but consistency between the first and last times (r(s) = 0.59). Overall, our results indicate that even when the primary aim is to maximize the genetic diversity of endangered fish populations, it may be advisable to prioritize minimal egg storage time rather than maximizing the number of parental combinations in fertilizations.

AB  - Research Highlights: Bark beetles are important agents of disturbance regimes in temperate forests, and specifically in a connected wind-bark beetle disturbance system. Large-scale windthrows trigger population growth of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) from endemic to epidemic levels, thereby allowing the killing of Norway spruce trees over several consecutive years. Background and Objectives: There is a lack of evidence to differentiate how outbreaks are promoted by the effects of environmental variables versus beetle preferences of trees from endemic to outbreak. However, little is known about how individual downed-tree characteristics and local conditions such as tree orientation and solar radiation affect beetle colonization of downed trees. Materials and Methods: To answer this question, we investigated the infestation rates and determined tree death categories (uprooted, broken, and stump) in wind-damaged areas in Western Tatra Mts. in Carpathians (Slovakia) from 2014-2016, following a windthrow in May 2014. In total, we investigated 225 trees over eight transects. For every tree, we measured its morphological (tree height, crown characteristics), environmental (solar radiation, terrain conditions, trunk zenith), temporal (time since wind damage), and beetle infestation (presence, location of attack, bark desiccation) parameters. We applied Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM) to unravel the main drivers of I. typographus infestations. Results: Over the first year, beetles preferred to attack broken trees and sun-exposed trunk sides over uprooted trees; the infestation on shaded sides started in the second year along with the infestation of uprooted trees with lower desiccation rates. We found that time since wind damage, stem length, and incident solar radiation increased the probability of beetle infestation, although both solar radiation and trunk zenith exhibited nonlinear variability. Our novel variable trunk zenith appeared to be an important predictor of bark beetle infestation probability. We conclude that trunk zenith as a simple measure defining the position of downed trees over the terrain can anticipate beetle infestation. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to understanding of the bark beetle's preferences to colonize windthrown trees in the initial years after the primary wind damage. Further, our findings can help to identify trees that are most susceptible to beetle infestation and to prioritize management actions to control beetle population while maintaining biodiversity.

AB  - With the aim of addressing the broader issues of land use, climate change and energy crisis, eddy covariance measurements of energy and CO2 exchange from a bioenergy crop (reed canary grass, Phalaris arundinaceae, L) cultivated on a drained organic soil (a cutover peatland) in eastern Finland were initiated in the spring of 2004. Based on the climatically diverse dataset from the 2004 to 2010 period, the objectives of the work presented here are to characterize the interannual variability in water vapor exchange and to understand the linkage between energy and CO2 exchange from this perennial crop during two extreme growing seasons. Correcting the measured soil heat flux by accounting for the change in heat storage above the heat flux plates helped close the energy balance at this site. Interannual variability in ecosystem processes of energy and CO2 exchange were attributed primarily to marked differences in the amount and distribution of seasonal precipitation. Differences in the phonological development of the crop during seasons with contrasting climatic conditions were reflected in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) estimated from the radiation instruments installed on the tower. Wet years were characterized by an even distribution of seasonal precipitation, low to moderate air and soil temperatures, lower solar and net radiation intensities (owing to reduced number of bright sunshine hours and therefore, higher amount of diffuse sky radiation), moderate to saturated soil moisture conditions and lower vapor pressure deficit. These climatic conditions resulted in high bulk surface conductance (g(s)), high evapotranspiration (ET) and low sensible heat flux with a peak seasonal Bowen ratio (beta = 0.1). These conditions were favourable for a high uptake of atmospheric CO2. Dry years, on the contrary, were marked by long dry spells during important phases of crop growth, climatic and soil moisture stress leading to high evaporative demand, low g(s) values, reduced evapotranspiration and high sensible heat flux (beta = 0.3-0.4). On a seasonal basis, the ET losses during a dry year were 13% lower compared to those during a wet year. The corresponding reduction in gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), however, was to the extent of 21%. Owing to the ability of this perennial crop to sequester large amounts of atmospheric carbon into its above- and below-ground biomass, the water use efficiency (defined as the slope of the linear regression of monthly values of GEP against ET) of this cultivation system was found to be 9.1 g CO2 per kg of H2O lost as ET. The results stemming from this work further support our earlier conclusions that this bioenergy system is a suitable land use option on drained and abandoned cutover peatlands with a high potential for offsetting CO2 load to the atmosphere.

AB  - In this study different possibilities and the feasibility of applying carbon capture at an integrated steel mill based on blast furnace process, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions were studied. Technologies considered for capturing of CO2 are post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) and oxygen blast furnace route (OBF). Post-combustion capture for the integrated steel mill was evaluated in an earlier study by Arasto et Al. and Tsupari et Al. [1, 2]. Implications of different capture amounts, different solvents for post-combustion capture and process integration levels to the greenhouse gas balance and operation economics are compared to the steel production base case with varying costs of CO2 emission allowances. Furthermore the effect of reducing the carbon intensity of steel production on the final steel production cost is evaluated.
   Iron and steel industry is responsible of around 5% of the overall global CO2 emissions [3]. Steel production based on the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace-based route is the main technology corresponding to the growth in global steel production [4] and this technology route is also the main source of CO2 emissions in the iron and steel industry.
   The assessment of potential and cost for carbon capture and storage in the iron and steel industry is based on a case study on Ruukki Metals Oy's steel mill in Raahe. The mill is situated on the northeastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. It is the largest integrated steel mill in the Nordic countries producing hot rolled steel plates and coils. It is also the largest CO2 point source in Finland emitting approximately 4 Mton of CO2 / year. Raahe steel mill produces district heat for use in the town nearby as well as for use onsite for heating of the premises. The power plant is connected to the national electricity grid, and thus it is possible to buy and sell electricity across system boundary. In contrast to power plant applications of CCS, CO2 emission sources at an integrated steel mill are scattered around the industrial site and the flue gases are led to several stacks. Due to this, the capture process evaluation is much more complex and requires system level optimization. Carbon capture processes and process integration options were modeled using Aspen Plus process modeling software and the results were used to estimate CO2 emission reduction possibilities and carbon abatement costs at the integrated steel mill from an investor's point of view. Different heat integration options and heat utilization scenarios were investigated and optimized with a custom-built CC-Skynet (TM) economics toolkit. Heat available for solvent regeneration varies between these heat utilization scenarios and thus different capture amount are investigated depending on the heat available for solvent regeneration in different case studies. Also different technologies related to oxygen blast furnace were considered, both for oxygen production and for top gas treatment. The application of oxygen blast furnace effects directly e. g. to the coke consumption of process and power production on site, and thus a new design considering new heat and process gas integration opportunities is essential.
   With a whole chain approach, including CO2 capture, processing, transport and storage, results show significant reduction potential at an integrated steel mill with carbon capture technologies. Ship transportation of CO2 is considered due to the location of the installation. Results show also the cost structure and feasibility of the studied technologies. Cost breakeven points for carbon capture at an integrated steel mill, for the plant owner and costs for globally avoided emissions are calculated. The study also reveals some major technical restrictions of the application. Finally the pros and cons of the technologies are compared and the role and potential of CCS as a carbon abatement tool in the European steel industry is considered. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB  - The carbon (C) cycle of forests produces ecosystem services (ES) such as climate regulation and timber production. Mapping these ES using simple land cover-based proxies might add remarkable inaccuracy to the estimates. A framework to map the current status of the C budget of boreal forested landscapes was developed. The C stocks of biomass and soil and the annual change in these stocks were quantified in a 20 x 20 m resolution at the regional level on mineral soils in southern Finland. The fine-scale variation of the estimates was analyzed geo-statistically. The reliability of the estimates was evaluated by comparing them to measurements from the national multi-source forest inventory. The C stocks of forests increased slightly from the south coast to inland whereas the changes in these stocks were more uniform. The spatial patches of C stocks were larger than those of C stock changes. The patch size of the C stocks reflected the spatial variation in the environmental conditions, and that of the C stock changes the typical area of forest management compartments. The simulated estimates agreed well with the measurements indicating a good mapping framework performance. The mapping framework is the basis for evaluating the effects of forest management alternatives on C budget at high resolution across large spatial scales. It will be coupled with the assessment of other ES and biodiversity to study their relationships. The framework integrated a wide suite of simulation models and extensive inventory data. It provided reliable estimates of the human influence on C cycle in forested landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessing policy robustness of climate change adaptation measures across sectors and scenarios
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - Recent research has increasingly focussed on whether long-term policies for adaptation to climate change are robust given uncertainties about future climate change, technological advances and alternative socio-economic development pathways. The aim of this study was to examine whether adaptation responses are 'robust', by looking at whether they reduce vulnerability to climate and socio-economic changes for a selection of ecosystem services across scenarios and two spatial scales: Europe (EU27 plus Norway and Switzerland) and a case study in Scotland. Outputs of the CLIMSAVE Integrated Assessment Platform (IAP) for multiple land-based sectors were used to test whether clusters of adaptation options referred to as policy archetypes reduced vulnerability to climate and socio-economic change for ecosystem service indicators related to biodiversity, flooding, water exploitation, land use diversity, land use intensity and food provision. The results show that the People-based Adaptation archetype is the most robust. This is because it reduces vulnerability by increasing coping capacity (people learn and build networks) and not only by reducing the impacts of climate and socio-economic change. By allowing comparative levels of vulnerability to be explored across sectors and scenarios, the CLIMSAVE approach provides a flexible tool for decision-makers and other stakeholders to increase understanding of which mixes of adaptation measures are robust responses to climate change.

AB  - In Swiss mountain areas, the protective function of forests is the predominant ecosystem service having high cultural and economic significance. It is assumed that natural forests or close-to-natural forests, i.e., forests being in the equilibrium with environmental conditions are the most resilient and resistant in regard to disturbances and hence best protecting people and assets on the long run. Here, we estimated the naturalness of the tree species composition by comparing Swiss National Forest Inventory (NFI) data with current and future potential Natural forest Site Types (NST). Based on this analysis, we identified species that are under or over-represented in protective mountain forests and derived the subsequent potential for management interventions. The urgency of management interventions is expected be small if all predominant tree species of the idealized potential natural forests are present and only their relative portions in the stand need adjustment. In contrast, interventions are advisable, if predominant tree species of the current and future potential natural forests are absent. Based on NFI data, the tree species composition of 47% of the protective mountain forests were classified as "natural" or "close-to-natural," while the remaining 53% were classified as "not natural" or "partly natural." Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.] and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) were the two most over-represented species under current and even more so under predicted future climatic conditions. To date, silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) were the two species most frequently absent in protective mountain forests, in which they should prevail. Apart from European beech, the most prominent increase in prevalence is predicted for oak (sessile oak and pubescent oak; Quercus petrea Liebl., Q. pubescens Willd.) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.). These species were currently missing from more than 75% of the stands, in which they are expected to be dominant under future conditions. Our analysis indicates the need to transform tree species compositions of protective mountain forests to optimize fitness under future climates. Some of these transformations will take place naturally, incited by disturbances, others-the majority of them-will need active management interventions.

AB  - The inherently variable nature of epidemics renders predictions of when and where infection is expected to occur challenging. Differences in pathogen strain composition, diversity, fitness, and spatial distribution are generally ignored in epidemiological modeling and are rarely studied in natural populations, yet they may be important drivers of epidemic trajectories. To examine how these factors are linked to epidemics in natural host populations, we collected epidemiological and genetic data from 15 populations of the powdery mildew fungus, Podosphaera plantaginis, on Plantago lanceolata in the angstrom land Islands, Finland. In each population, we tracked spatiotemporal disease progression throughout one epidemic season and coupled our survey of infection with intensive field sampling of the pathogen. We found that strain composition varied greatly among populations in the landscape. Within populations, strain composition was driven by the sequence of strain activity: early-active strains reached higher abundances, leading to consistent strain compositions over time. Co-occurring strains also varied in their contribution to the growth of the local epidemic, and these fitness inequalities were linked to epidemic dynamics: a higher proportion of hosts became infected in populations containing strains that were more similar in fitness. Epidemic trajectories in the populations were also linked to strain diversity and spatial dynamics: higher infection rates occurred in populations containing higher strain diversity, while spatially clustered epidemics experienced lower infection rates. Together, our results suggest that spatial and/or temporal variation in the strain composition, diversity, and fitness of pathogen populations are important factors generating variation in epidemiological trajectories among infected host populations.

AB  - Background: In the last decade, the demand for and supply of energy wood from forests has increased, and experts expect a further increase in the future due to political and societal changes. The objective of this paper was to provide a qualitative analysis of stakeholders' perceptions of current and future trade-offs as well as of synergies between energy wood production and use and other forest ecosystem services (ES).
   Methods: We developed an explorative research approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with a total of 103 interviewees of six selected stakeholder groups in five European countries: Finland, Germany, Norway, Slovenia and Spain. For the analysis, we adopted a qualitative content analysis approach.
   Results: The results of this empirical study indicate that, across the five countries, stakeholders perceive similar trade-offs and synergies. Stakeholders perceive a strong synergy with employment whereas trade-offs regarding conservation of biodiversity are the most critical issue related to energy wood production in forests. Furthermore, stakeholders continue the classic debate about forest protection versus forest use in the energy wood context.
   Conclusions: Effects of energy wood production and use need to be taken into account in policy development and forest management in order to address current and future trade-offs and to tap the full potential of synergies related to other forest ES. Different characteristics of countries and regions need to be considered, and decisions need to be fostered by long-term and far-reaching political frameworks.

AB  - This article reviews a study into the relationships between greenspaces and the benefits to psychological, social, and physical aspects of human wellbeing achieved through interaction in the Helsinki urban region in Finland. This relationship is theorized, analyzed, and measured through the transactional paradigm of affordance theory and is operationalized through the use of a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) questionnaire, SoftGIS, which activated the urban greenspace-human wellbeing interaction through its map-based data collection. Over 1800 unique place-based relationships were statistically analyzed. Findings revealed that Helsinki's greenspaces provided, overall, mostly physical and social wellbeing benefits; the psychological benefits such as reduction in stress and mental relaxation were not as frequent in these urban greenspace interactions. The results indicate multiple aspects of human wellbeing are supported by interaction with urban greenspaces of varying characteristics within the region but the urban greenspaces which provided the most human wellbeing benefits included large size, woodland typology, moderately maintained with loose or 'wild' vegetation, and few amenities such as benches and structures. The study's implications include urban planning, public policy, and human health as well as insight into the multifunctional design and strategic management of greenspaces in urbanizing regions to provide continued and improved ecosystem services and benefits to humans and nature.

AB  - This qualitative study explores community resilience factors within an indigenous Sami community in Northern Norway. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 22 informants, 12 females and 10 males, ranging in age from 13 to 19 years old, 12 of whom had reindeer husbandry affiliation. Data analysis used a modified grounded theory approach and narrative analysis. Interpretation of the data was based on ecological perspectives theory and the identification of possible community resilience factors including Sami language competence, use of recreational and natural resources, and traditional ecological knowledge, such as reindeer husbandry related activities. These cultural factors appear to strengthen adolescents' ethnic identity and pride, which in turn act as potential resilience mechanisms. Land was a significant arena for traditional practices and recreation. The majority of the youth reported support from relationships with extended godparents (faddarat) and extended family (sohka) networks. The fattar network was particularly strong among adolescents with reindeer husbandry affiliations. Native language competence and reindeer husbandry were key components in adolescent social networks. Interconnectedness among the community members and with the environment seemed to promote resilience and well-being. Two factors that excluded adolescents from full community membership and participation were being a nonnative Sami language speaker and the absence of extended Sami family networks.

AB  - Excessive mental and physical health challenges among immigrant women in Norway call for a response. Interaction with nature has proven to benefit mental and physical well-being among immigrant women, but knowledge about the determinants of such behavior in this target group is scarce. This study thus aims to explore the influences on outdoor recreation behavior among immigrant women in Norway. Data were gathered through individual interviews with 14 women from Iran (2), Poland (2), Palestine, Afghanistan, Congo, Kenya, Thailand, Russia, Portugal, Latvia, Colombia, and Bulgaria. These were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Interviewees' outdoor recreation behavior was influenced by multiple, mostly interrelated factors, including attitudes towards nature, perceived control over making use of nature, role models, access to outdoor companions, cultural norms, access to attractive natural environments, climate and light conditions, available time, and access to economic resources. The factors influencing the women's outdoor recreational behavior are related both to their immigrant or ethnic backgrounds and to their other identities and can be found at the personal, social-environmental, and physical environmental/structural socio-ecological levels. Findings suggest that efforts to promote outdoor recreation among immigrant women would benefit from a multi identity, multilevel socio-ecological approach.

AB  - Despite their importance for biodiversity and other ecosystem services, many semi-natural grasslands deteriorate or have even disappeared due to insufficient grazing and neglect. Preservation of grassland habitats depends on a good understanding of sustainable grazing management as well as effective agricultural policy measures that ensure long-term economic sustainability for the farmer. Through meta-evaluation and synthesis of previous investigations and discussion of scientific literature, we aimed to evaluate factors that determine the extent to which cattle and sheep in Sweden graze semi-natural grasslands instead of more productive land and what this means for biodiversity and sustainability. We also aimed to propose which practises and policy measures may be the most cost-effective to promote habitat quality and the sustainable use of grasslands. Results from a nationwide survey of Swedish farmers' attitudes towards agri-environmental payment schemes are discussed in relation to farm characteristics and other factors influencing the use of cattle and sheep for sustainable grazing. This study supports recommendations by environmental economists that payments should be targeted more strongly at the most valuable grasslands, emphasising the need for a more detailed and nuanced framework for classifying grasslands in Europe. A comparison with independent estimates of the area of agricultural land from nation-wide, sample-based monitoring shows that the data from official statistics normally used for nationwide evaluations are partly biased and of insufficient quality, underscoring the need for more sophisticated and precise methods for monitoring both overall trends and detailed environmental effects related to the preservation of semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Security of energy supply, promotion of the bio-economy, nutrient recycling, and innovation are prioritized policy areas in the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUBSR). The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has a great bioenergy potential worth exploring in this context. This paper explores the state-of-art of bioenergy systems and synergies with eco-systems services in the BSR region in the context of developing the region's bio-economy. In this brief assessment, we consider 8 countries (i.e. Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, and Belarus) in the region. While the production and use of modern bioenergy can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, promote energy security, diversify energy resources, and contribute to a successful circular economy and rural development, it is important to find a balance between the exploration of resources and the management of eco-systems services. In addition, both climate change vulnerability and bioenergy production may affect the environment and the capacity of the BSR to deliver ecosystem services (ESS). We recommend integrated strategies for optimal use of bioresources in the region.

AB  - Question: Dark diversity refers to the set of species that are not observed in an area but could potentially occur based on suitable local environmental conditions. In this paper, we applied both niche-based and co-occurrence-based methods to estimate the dark diversity of vascular plant species in the subarctic mountains. We then aimed to unravel the drivers explaining (a) why some locations were missing relatively more suitable species than others, and (b) why certain plant species were more often absent from suitable locations than others.Location: The Scandinavian mountains around Abisko, northern Sweden.Methods: We calculated the dark diversity in 107 plots spread out across four mountain trails using four different methods: two co-occurrence-based (Beals' index and the hypergeometric method) and two niche-based (the climatic niche model and climatic niche model followed by species-specific threshold). We then applied multiple Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models and General Linear Models to determine which habitat characteristics and species traits contributed the most to dark diversity.Results: The study showed a notable divergence in the predicted drivers of dark diversity depending on the method used. Nevertheless, we can conclude that plot-level dark diversity was generally 17% higher in areas at low elevations and 31% higher in areas with a low species richness.Conclusion: Our findings call for caution when interpreting statistical findings of dark-diversity estimates. Even so, all analyses point toward an important role for natural processes such as competitive dominance as the main driver of the spatial patterns found in dark diversity in the northern Scandes.

AB  - Agro-environmental schemes (AES) aim to counteract declining biodiversity on farmland and to improve ecosystem services, such as pollination and pest regulation. Studies show, however, that an involvement in AES does not lead to any substantive cognitive or motivational change in farmers' behaviour. Hermeneutic studies have tried to explain these modest effects by analysing farmers' mentalities and behaviour. This article contributes to these studies by using self-identifications and stories of 16 Swedish farmers about nature and AES to create a typology of different farmers' valuations. In pursuit of this objective the article establishes a conceptual link between these hermeneutic studies and so-called farming style analysis (FSA). The study lays bare latent points of friction between the views of these farmers and more conventional sociocultural notions about nature and nature conservation.

AB  - Although wind power is regarded as a sustainable way to produce electrical energy, wind turbines may cause harmful effects locally. A possible solution is to reduce the effects through forest management practices, for example leaving forest stands uncut as landscape shields to hide the turbines and stop them from spoiling the scenery. Using data from an online survey of landowners, we investigated whether voluntary mechanisms could encourage forest owners to change their forest management practices near wind farms to minimize the harmful effects. More precisely, we analyzed forest owners' willingness to participate in an initiative involving payment for ecosystem services called Landscape Value Trade (LVT) and studied the related compensation claims in southwestern Finland. We explained willingness to participate and the claims made with the characteristics of the landowners or their holding and with attitudinal variables. According to our results, 73.6% of the respondents would possibly or certainly participate in the mechanism. The average annual compensation requirement in this study was (sic)298 per hectare. In addition, we found that low dependence on forestry and forest-related income tended to increase interest in participation in the LVT initiative and reduce the compensation claims. An important result related to the cost-effective application of the mechanism, is that the more interested the respondents were in cooperation with the LVT initiative the less compensation they would claim. Thus, the voluntary nature of the LVT initiative simultaneously acted as a cost-reducing element. The results could help in detecting some of the key features of the supply side of LVT initiatives.

AB  - Today, climate change and competing land use practices are threatening rangelands around the world and the pastoral societies that rely on them. Reindeer husbandry practised by the indigenous Sami people is an example. In Sweden, approximately 70% of the most productive lichen pastures (important in winter) has been lost, either completely or because of a reduction in forage quality, as a result of competing land use (primarily commercial forestry). The remaining pastures are small and fragmented. Yet, the number of reindeer in Sweden shows no general decline. We investigated the strategies that have allowed reindeer herders to sustain their traditional livelihood despite a substantial loss of pastures and thus natural winter forage for their reindeer. Changes in harvest strategy and herd structure may partially explain the observed dynamics, and have increased herd productivity and income, but were not primarily adopted to counteract forage loss. The introduction of supplementary feeding, modern machinery, and equipment has assisted the herders to a certain extent. However, supplementary feeding and technology are expensive. In spite of governmental support and optimized herd productivity and income, increasing costs provide low economic return. We suggest that the increased economical and psychosocial costs caused by forage and pasture losses may have strong effects on the long-term sustainability of reindeer husbandry in Sweden.

AB  - This paper explores whether the perceptions of forest owners and professionals could be nudged towards more sustainable management practices by adjusting a policy text's metaphorical content. Recent research has demonstrated a link between information interventions and preference change, but there is a need to further explore individuals' reactions to information on forest-based ecosystem services and to link these to the design of policy instruments. We contribute to narrowing this gap by nudging the content of a policy text comparing rotation forest management (RFM) and continuous cover forestry (CCF), and exposing it to forest stakeholders. The research is carried out in Finland, the so-called 'forest nation' of Europe, whose economy and culture is closely tied to forests. The results highlight a deep-rooted opinion divide between Finnish forest owners and professionals: the professionals reacted significantly more negatively towards policy text emphasising continuous cover practice than forest owners. Our results support the use of linguistic nudging as a complement to other policy instruments, but they also highlight the challenges of using one-fits-all approaches to make policies more palatable. In our study, the stakeholders' different reaction to nudge was also explained by their age, and type and degree of prior knowledge on forest management.

AB  - Forests provide a wide range of ecosystem services, and ecosystem models can be applied to assess the contribution of different forest management strategies to climate mitigation and adaptation. Complex model output and trade-offs between environmental, economic, and social sustainability dimensions are difficult to convey. To facilitate stakeholder communication, we developed composite indicators based on ten ecosystem service indicators obtained from ecosystem model simulations representing 19 forestry management strategies across three ecoregions and climate scenario projections in Sweden. Eight alternative composites were generated around a central framework addressing sustainability aspects in terms of wood production, preservation of biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation (risk management). A combination of principal component analysis, exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's coefficient alpha, and hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to account for the statistical relationships between indicators. Z-score normalization was superior to min-max normalization in capturing differences among management strategies. Two weighting schemes were applied, based on policy prioritization between sub-components that reflected 1) current policy with an equal emphasis on production and biodiversity, and 2) a stronger focus on nature protection. Equal emphasis generated a larger range of scores (76.0 +/- 21.2) than the focus on nature protection (32.0 +/- 5.8), as the latter would provide less production benefits and thereby fewer trade-offs between production and other aspects. The final scores of the 19 management strategies fell within a variance boundary of each other, showing their contribution to different policy targets and the usefulness of combining strategies at the landscape level. The composites displayed agreement across regions and scenarios. They indicated that a shift from even-aged conifer monocultures towards a combination of continuous cover, broadleaf-mixture, and unmanaged would work well for balancing goals under changing climate conditions.

AB  - Restoration of damaged ecosystems has become an important tool to slow down biodiversity loss and to maintain ecosystem services. Peatland bird populations have shown a substantial decline during the recent decades in Northern Europe as a consequence of peatland drainage. We studied whether restoration of peatlands drained for forestry affects bird communities. We conducted bird surveys at 11 peatlands in Western Finland, where each of the restored and their pristine counterparts were surveyed before restoration and yearly after restoration during 2010-2018. We used linear mixed effect models to analyze whether restoration affected the number of species and territories of peatland specialist and non-specialist species and permutational multivariate analysis of variance to analyze the change in community composition. Drained parts of the peatlands had higher number of territories of non-specialist species before restoration, and restoration seemed to decrease these numbers towards the level of pristine parts. By contrast, restoration did not affect the number of peatland specialists and their territories, which was lower in drained than in pristine parts of the peatlands. Bird communities in restored parts remained different from pristine parts in terms of community composition after restoration. Thus, despite the effect of restoration on non-specialists, a substantially long time may be required for a recovery of the peatland bird communities. Based on our results, it seems that long-term monitoring of the restored and pristine peatlands is needed to determine whether restoration is effective in recovering the peatland specialist bird species and bird communities in general.

AB  - Currently, we are experiencing biodiversity loss on different spatial scales. One of the best studied taxonomic groups in decline is the butterflies. Here, we review evidence for such declines using five systematic studies from southern Sweden that compare old butterfly surveys with the current situation. Additionally, we provide data on butterfly and burnet moth extinctions in the region's counties. In some local areas, half of the butterfly fauna has been lost during the last 60-100 years. In terms of extinctions, counties have lost 2-10 butterfly and burnet moth species. Land use has changed markedly with key butterfly habitats such as hay meadows disappearing at alarming rates. Grazed, mixed open woodlands have been transformed into dense coniferous forests and clear-cuts, and domestic grazers have been relocated from woodlands to arable fields and semi-natural grasslands. Ley has increased rapidly and is used for bale silage repeatedly during the season. Overall, the changed and intensified land use has markedly reduced the availability of nectar resources in the landscape. Species that decline in Sweden are strongly decreasing or already extinct in other parts of Europe. Many typical grassland species that were numerous in former times have declined severely; among those Hesperia comma, Lycaena virgaureae, Lycaena hippothoe, Argynnis adippe, and Polyommatus semiargus. Also, species associated with open woodlands and wetlands such as, Colias palaeno, Boloria euphrosyne and the glade-inhabiting Leptidea sinapis have all decreased markedly. Current management practise and EU Common Agricultural Policy rules favour intensive grazing on the remaining semi-natural grasslands, with strong negative effects on butterfly diversity. Abandoned grasslands are very common in less productive areas of southern Sweden and these habitats may soon become forests. There is an urgent need for immediate action to preserve unfertilized, mown and lightly grazed grasslands. It is also crucial to encourage that management of abandoned grasslands resumes before it is too late. In order to mitigate risks of further species loss and to work towards recovery of threatened butterfly populations using best known practises, we recommend twelve types of management measures favourable for many butterflies.

AB  - IntroductionThe Swedish National Forest Program emphasizes that the forest can be more multifunctional where the values created by human experiences of the forest, i.e., social values, can be used for tourism and outdoor recreation, leading to rural development and sustainable growth. To develop multifunctional forests in this respect, private forest owners' perspectives on development are critically important. For example, the place attachment of the private forest owners affects how they manage their forests. Therefore, it is crucial to consider private forest owners' perspectives when planning land use. MethodThe study area is a region in southwest Sweden (Hallandsas) designated as a national interest area for outdoor recreation. There is interest in expanding and developing nature-based tourism, including trail systems, based on the perception of the areas as having great outdoor recreation value. This article aims to present findings from a study that investigated the potential for outdoor recreation development in the forests of Hallandsas. A questionnaire was sent out to private forest owners, which contained questions about social values, perspectives on the Swedish right of public access, development of outdoor recreation, and place attachment. ResultsThe results showed that private forest owners considered health, well-being, and a good living environment the most important social values of their forested lands. The identity and cultural heritage value of private forest lands and the value of working on the land were the second and third most highly identified forest social values. Outdoor recreation was not identified as a top forest social value. DiscussionThe analysis identified seven key factors that must be considered with outdoor recreation development, given concerns and the importance of other forest social values. Careful consideration of these factors and their interactions can provide a path for outdoor recreation development that is respectful to people and places. This consideration is at the core of landscape protection and management as interpreted by the European Landscape Convention. Forest owners' social values are a critical part of landscape quality objectives, along with planning that links public aspirations with landscape character.

AB  - QuestionsWhat are the latitudinal diversity patterns in Scandinavia over the last 8ka? Have they been consistent over time? What are the long-term diversity trends at different sites? Is there a consistent rate-of-change between sites?
   LocationThirty sites in Norway, two sites in north-west Sweden.
   MethodsPollen data from these 32 lakes. The sites lie within six of the vegetation zones of Moen (1998). The data are used to estimate pollen diversity using Hills effective species numbers N0, N1 and N2. Diversity relationships in time and along latitude are assessed using ANCOVA. Linear regression is used to investigate site-independent long-term trends. Patterns in the regression slopes are investigated between vegetation zones and along the latitudinal gradient.
   ResultsThe latitudinal pattern of decreasing diversity with increasing latitude existed over the last 8ka, although for the number of effectively common (N1) and abundant (N2) pollen taxa the relationship was slightly weaker between 8-6ka. Long-term trends show that diversity increases at most sites over time. However, the magnitude and rate-of-change vary between sites. Highest rate-of-change in N0 over time is observed in southern sites, although the spatial relationship of rate-of-change is not statistically significant.
   ConclusionsThe constant increase in diversity over time may reflect additional taxa arriving and changes in abundances. Most sites change in the same direction, but at different rates and magnitudes. There is no clear spatial pattern in rate-of-change, and the general patterns of increasing diversity over time are consistent with the hypothesis of post-glacial (Holocene) dispersal limitation. Drivers of these changes have not been rigorously investigated, but our results suggest that environmental and historical processes are not mutually exclusive. During the last 2-1ka BP diversity patterns have probably been increasingly affected by human land use.

AB  - This study demonstrates the characteristics of the new generic project portfolio selection tool YODA ("Your Own Decision Aid"). YODA does not include a mathematical aggregation model. Instead, the decision maker's preferences are defined by the interactive articulation of acceptance thresholds of project-level decision criteria. Transparency and ease of adopting the method in participatory planning are sought using the method's simple preference input. The characteristics of the YODA tool are introduced by presenting how it has been applied in participatory land use planning in northern Finland in selecting a combination of peat production sites to attain the goals defined at municipal level. In this process, each stakeholder first constructed a project portfolio that best met his or her preferences. In doing this, acceptance thresholds for project-level decision criteria were defined. In total, eight decision criteria were related to economic value, biodiversity, social impacts, and ecosystem services. Subsequently, the portfolios of different stakeholders were combined in line with the principles of robust portfolio modelling. Core projects were accepted by all stakeholders, while exterior projects were not accepted, and borderline projects by some of the stakeholders. Although the land use planning situation at hand was highly sensitive, because it was related to various aspects of sustainability, the use of YODA provided useful results. The first meeting with stakeholders identified 52 out of 99 sites that none of the stakeholders would use for energy peat production, due to their characteristics, whereas, in the second meeting, a smaller stakeholder group found 18 core projects and 26 borderline projects which could be potential areas for energy peat production. We conclude that YODA-as a generic project portfolio tool-can be used in various planning situations.

AB  - Simple Summary Bryozoans are predominantly short-lived sessile organisms inhabiting both living and dead hard substrates. This group is considered a good biological indicator of environmental conditions. The Svalbard Archipelago is located at high latitudes, and the local benthic communities are affected by severe environmental conditions. In general, the bryozoan fauna in this region has been well studied, albeit to varying spatial degrees. Information regarding Gronfjorden is scarce and, therefore, we aimed to study species composition, diversity, and biomass of bryozoans in this glacier fjord. We found a rather diverse fauna with low biomasses for all species. Cluster analysis distinguished two groups of stations: one with lower diversity and biomass in warmer water, and the other with higher values in colder water. The most important factors shaping the bryozoan communities were water temperature and the proportional occurrence of macrophytes. Taking into account ongoing climate change, our results may be useful for further monitoring the effects of elevated temperatures on benthic organisms in the Arctic. Despite significant research efforts focused on benthic assemblages in West Spitsbergen, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the shallow water bryozoan communities in Gronfjorden, a glacier fjord belonging to the Isfjorden system, Norway. Here, we studied species composition, richness, distribution, and biomass of bryozoans in the intertidal and upper subtidal zones of Gronfjorden in summer. We found 62 bryozoan species, among which Celleporella hyalina (Linnaeus, 1767), Harmeria scutulata (Busk, 1855), and Tegella arctica (d'Orbigny, 1853) were most prevalent while the highest contributions to the total biomass were registered for Eucratea loricata (d'Orbigny, 1853), Tricellaria gracilis (Van Beneden, 1848), Turbicellepora incrassata (Lamarck, 1816), and Tricellaria ternata (Ellis and Solander, 1786). Alpha-diversity varied from 1 to 50 averaging 15.1 +/- 2.6 species. Bryozoan biomass ranged from 0.008 to 10.758 g m(-2) with a mean value of 2.67 g m(-2) being lower than in the central and northern parts of the Barents Sea. For the first time, we registered the presence of the circumpolar bryozoan Amathia arctica in Svalbard waters probably as a result of stronger advection of Atlantic water into the fjord. Cluster analysis revealed two groups, mainly composed of stations in colder and warmer waters. A relatively high proportion of outlying stations reflected habitat heterogeneity in Gronfjorden. Redundancy analysis indicated that bryozoan diversity and biomass were strongly negatively associated with temperature. A positive relationship was found between bryozoan biomass and the proportional contribution of macrophytes to a pool of substrates. Our study provides a reference point for further monitoring of changing marine ecosystems at high latitudes.

AB  - Northern Swedish forests provide multiple ecosystem services. Integrating these values into the forest planning process frequently requires that not only forest owners but also other stakeholders be involved. The objective of this study is to assess the potential of future scenario development as a tool in forest planning. In a case study of the Vilhelmina municipality in northern Sweden, forest owners and stakeholders were interviewed, and a workshop was held to discuss important factors for the future development of the local landscape regarding ecological, socioeconomic and political issues. Combined with a researcher-conducted process, this resulted in three alternative scenarios. We conclude that the scenario development process has produced information that can be used in forest planning. The participatory element of the scenario development process could be extended further to enhance communication, learning and knowledge exchange. The participants' contribution to the scenario construction could also be elaborated, e.g., by further involving stakeholders in the formulation of alternative future manifestations and in the elaboration of scenarios. To achieve this, it is necessary to adapt the quantitative methods to the participatory situation, to foster discussion qualities, to secure representation and increase motivation for participation in different ways.

AB  - It has been claimed that natural enemies of pests perform important ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. These services have rarely been evaluated in yield or monetary terms at farm level. We have examined the degree to which ground-living natural enemies of the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi (L.)) reduced aphid abundance and influenced barley yields on ten commercial farms in central Sweden. On average, ground-living natural enemies of pests increased barley yields by 303 kg/ha. This corresponded to a potential 52% reduction in yield loss from R. padi compared with a scenario where no natural enemies were present. Measured as the percentage increase of actual yield, ground-living natural enemies of aphids increased the yield by 23%. The increase in yields in absolute terms was larger on conventional farms than organic farms, but the percentage increase of yields was larger on organic farms. The study only considered I year, with high aphid abundance. However, we also discuss the effects of predators as well as insecticides in the long-term. Our study shows that yield increases attributable to predators can be compared with yield increases from insecticide use for the evaluation of different management strategies.

AB  - Wild and semidomesticated reindeer are one of the key species in Arctic and subarctic areas, and their population dynamics are closely tied to winter conditions. Difficult snow conditions have been found to decrease the calving success and survivability of reindeer, but the economic effects of variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry have not been studied. In this study, we combine state-of-the-art economic-ecological modeling with the analysis of annual reindeer management reports from Finland. These contain local knowledge of herding communities. We quantify the occurrence probabilities of different types of winters from annual management reports and analyze the effects of this variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry using an age- and sex-structured bioeconomic reindeer-lichen model. Our results show that difficult winters decrease the net revenues of reindeer husbandry. However, they also protect lichen pastures from grazing, thereby increasing future net revenues. Nonetheless, our solutions show that the variability of winter conditions overall decrease the net income of herders compared to constant winter conditions. Low lichen biomass appears to make reindeer management more sensitive to the effects of difficult winter conditions. We also found that it is economically sensible to use supplementary feeding during difficult winters, but the net revenues still decrease compared to average winters because of the high feeding costs. Overall, our analysis suggests that the increasing variability of winter conditions due to climate change will decrease net revenues in reindeer husbandry. This decrease will still occur even if the most extreme effects of climate change do not occur. This study shows that combining a state-of-the-art bioeconomic model and practitioner knowledge can bring compatible insights, ideas, results, and a bottom-up perspective to the discussion.

AB  - 1. Connections between outdoor recreation and various health and well-being benefits are well established. However, questions remain regarding which landscape characteristics that best predict places in the landscape that correspond to people's needs and preferences. The perceived sensory dimensions (PSDs) model proposes eight basic perceived qualities that people commonly seek in outdoor environments to support complementary needs: a Natural, a Cultural, a Cohesive, a Diverse, a Sheltered, an Open, a Serene and a Social quality respectively.2. These PSDs have increasingly been suggested as a tool for green space assessment and planning. How strongly they correlate with objective landscape characteristics is, however, still an open question. We surveyed recreationists in Sweden, tasking them with noting their favourite places on a map (n = 275), and to report the degree to which the PSDs were present. The qualities typically reported as most prominent at these places were Open, Serene and Sheltered, while the least prominent were Social and Cultural.3. A cluster analysis further revealed that favourite places could be classified into two main groups regarding perceived qualities. One associated with presumably more restorative qualities, emphasising Natural and Serene settings, the other instead suggesting a more outward-directed experience, strong in the perceived Social and Cultural dimensions.4. Machine learning models, however, revealed weak links between objective landscape characteristics and perceived qualities, with stronger correlations found with attributes connected to personal characteristics, such as the degrees to which a person identifies as nature or urban oriented.5. Although largely confirming the basic relations between the PSDs suggested by earlier studies, our results cast some doubt on the way they often have been understood and used, as describing an 'objective' truth of places, rather than representing qualities that largely emanate from the individual experience. Our results instead confirm previous reports of weak general links between objective landscape measures and perceived qualities.

TI  - Reindeer-herding cultures in northern Nordland, Norway: Methods for documenting traces of reindeer herders in the landscape and for dating reindeer-herding activities
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - This paper focuses on reindeer-herding culture in northern Scandinavia. Reindeer herding concerns the day to day work with the herd on seasonal pastures and on the spring and autumn migrations. The main purpose is to discuss the age of reindeer pastoralism in northern Scandinavia. The transition to a reindeer-herding culture in northern Scandinavia occurred as reindeer came into private ownership, by which means reindeer acquired a new status in society. At the same time a new settlement pattern was established, involving a shift away from watercourses and new landscape elements coming into use. These new areas were the high hills between the rivers. In following the reindeer, people established new settlements in the reindeer pastures. At the same time, new types of physical features were established in the same areas, such as milking places "(gieddi)" and bone deposits. In Hamaroy municipality there is a large number of documented physical cultural remains related to reindeer pastoralism. These are hearths, places where reindeer were milked, and bone deposits that have been dated from the end of the late Iron Age, through the medieval period and to recent times. It is argued that they can be linked to a transition from a hunter-gatherer society to pastoralism, a change that can be dated back to the transition between the Iron Age and the Middle Ages, with the initial phase apparently dating from the end of the late Iron Age. This is a pattern that coincides with similar surveys in other areas, such as on the Swedish side of the Norwegian border. It is argued therefore that the transition to reindeer pastoralism occurred at this time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil contamination is one of the major threats constraining proper functioning of the soil and thus provision of ecosystem services. Remedial actions typically only address the chemical soil quality by reducing total contaminant concentrations to acceptable levels guided by land use. However, emerging regulatory requirements on soil protection demand a holistic view on soil assessment in remediation projects thus accounting for a variety of soil functions. Such a view would require not only that the contamination concentrations are assessed and attended to, but also that other aspects are taking into account, thus addressing also physical and biological as well as other chemical soil quality indicators (SQIs). This study outlines how soil function assessment can be a part of a holistic sustainability appraisal of remediation alternatives using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The paper presents a method for practitioners for evaluating the effects of remediation alternatives on selected ecological soil functions using a suggested minimum data set (MDS) containing physical, biological and chemical SQIs. The measured SQls are transformed into sub-scores by the use of scoring curves, which allows interpretation and the integration of soil quality data into the MCDA framework. The method is demonstrated at a study site (Marieberg, Sweden) and the results give an example of how soil analyses using the suggested MDS can be used for soil function assessment and subsequent input to the MCDA framework.

AB  - Urban green spaces are essential elements of cities, contributing to the quality of life in numerous ways. However, densification strategies create a complex relationship between urban development and the quality, as well as the quantity, of urban green space. This paper examines the Green Walkable City Programme in Stockholm, a document developed to supplement the comprehensive plan as a strategic backbone for green urban planning. Based on interviews and content analysis, this paper identifies and discusses concerns raised in the development of the planning programme, and addresses the importance of urban green space for citizens' well-being. The new comprehensive plan has introduced a shift in the attitude towards the urban green space in Stockholm. The need for urban growth is used to justify development of green fields, and a focus on the quality, rather than the quantity, of urban green space is promoted. Despite this progress, the public requests definitions for this quality approach and fears that nature within the city will be parkified. Therefore, this paper offers a critical reflection on the role of the Green Walkable City Programme, its situation within the context of Swedish green urban planning, and various areas of concern that have been highlighted.

AB  - The color of freshwaters, often measured as absorbance, influences a number of ecosystem services including biodiversity, fish production, and drinking water quality. Many countries have recently reported on increasing trends of water color in freshwaters, for which drivers are still not fully understood. We show here with more than 58000 water samples from the boreal and hemiboreal region of Sweden and Canada that absorbance of filtered water (a(420)) co-varied with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations (R-2 = 0.85, P<0.0001), but that a(420) relative to DOC is increased by the presence of iron (Fe). We found that concentrations of Fe significantly declined with increasing water retention in the landscape, resulting in significantly lower Fe concentrations in lakes compared to running waters. The Fe loss along the aquatic continuum corresponded to a proportional loss in a(420), suggesting a tight biogeochemical coupling between colored dissolved organic matter and Fe. Since water is being flushed at increasing rates due to enhanced runoff in the studied regions, diminished loss of Fe along the aquatic continuum may be one reason for observed trends in a(420), and in particular in a(420)/DOC increases. If trends of increased Fe concentrations in freshwaters continue, water color will further increase with various effects on ecosystem services and biogeochemical cycles.

AB  - CONTEXT: The dairy sector has undergone profound transformation over recent decades, resulting in considerably fewer but larger and more specialised farms, with unclear implications across sustainability dimensions.OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop and employ a framework for assessing sustainability in the Swedish dairy sector to shed light on how recent historical developments (1990-2020) have influenced sustainability outcomes.METHODS: Using a data-driven, multidisciplinary approach, main areas of concern for sustainability in the primary production stages of the dairy sector were identified. These were then populated with indicators to track developments over time and highlight synergies and trade-offs.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Four areas of concern were identified and populated with eight indicators (listed in brackets): 'supporting ecosystems' (semi-natural grassland area, ley area, mean field size), 'climate impact' (methane from enteric fermentation), 'animal welfare' (veterinary treatments, percentage of culled cows due to diseases) and 'farm viability' (competitive wages, farmer age structure). The results showed that area of seminatural grassland per dairy cow decreased by 27% from 2003 to 2020. Area of ley per cow decreased slightly but the proportion of arable land on dairy farms devoted to ley cultivation increased, due to improved roughage quality enabling an increase in proportion of roughage in feed rations. In terms of climate impact, enteric methane emissions per kg milk decreased by 21%. Regarding animal welfare, veterinary treatments of diseases decreased from 45% to 21% over the 30 years, with declining trends for most recorded diseases except hoof disease. The indicators for farm viability showed that the average dairy farm was unable to pay a wage com-parable to the national average throughout most of the period 2004-2020, but a slightly positive trend was observed, although with large year-on-year variability. A rapid change in age structure was seen between 2003 and 2020, with the proportion of land managed by older farmers (+60 years) increasing from 12% to 22%, indicating challenges with demographic viability.SIGNIFICANCE: Tracking changes over time across sustainability dimensions gives important insights into improvements made and challenges that remain to be solved. Overall, developments in the Swedish dairy sector have diminished its capacity to support ecosystems, particularly related to semi-natural grasslands, while reducing its climate impacts and improving animal welfare. An increased specialisation has also resulted in spillover effects where services and impacts have shifted from dairy herds to specialised beef herds. These findings are important in navigating policy processes targeting developments in the dairy sector.

AB  - Wood-pastures are complex social-ecological systems (SES), which are the product of long-term interaction between society and its surrounding landscape. Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity management that enhanced a wide range of ecosystem services (ES), current farm management has shifted toward more intensive farm models. This study assesses the supply of ES in four study areas dominated by managed wood-pastures in Spain, Sweden, and Romania. On the basis of 144 farm surveys and the use of multivariate techniques, we characterize farm management and structure in the study areas and identify the trade-offs in ES supply associated with this management. We link these trade-offs to multiple factors that characterize the landholding: economic, social, environmental, technological, and governance. Finally, we analyze how landholders' values and perspectives have an effect on management decisions. Results show a differentiated pattern of ES supply in the four study areas. We identified four types of trade-offs in ES supply that appear depending on what is being promoted by the farm management and that are associated with different dimensions of wood-pasture management: productivity-related trade-offs, crop production-related trade-offs, multifunctionality-related trade-offs, and farm accessibility-related trade-offs. These trade-offs are influenced by complex interactions between the properties of the SES, which have a direct influence on landholders' perspectives and motivations. The findings of this paper advance the understanding of the dynamics between agroecosystems and society and can inform system-based agricultural and conservation policies.

AB  - Food availability in fjords is unusual among deep-sea environments due to the increased availability of nutritional sources that are comparatively rare in the open sea, such as influxes of macrophytodetritus and terrestrial organic matter. In open waters, these deep-sea 'organic falls' have been shown to increase beta diversity in comparison to surrounding, unenriched sediments, and support a range of specialised fauna. There has been unprecedented loss of coastal kelp forests in Norway and this is likely to greatly reduce the transfer of an important carbon subsidy to deep-sea communities in Norwegian fjords. In contrast, progress in terrestrial land management and reforestation has resulted in a large increase in the area covered by boreal forests. With such an expansion in forests fringing deep Norwegian fjords, an increase in the transport of wood material and forest detritus to these deep-sea habitats seems inevitable. Benthic landers containing experimental substrates (wood blocks and kelp parcels) were deployed for 10 months at a depth of 530 m in Osterfjorden, and stable isotope analysis (13C, 15N) was used to investigate and compare trophic relationships between wood and kelp substrates and the macrofauna that colonised them. Trophic shift analyses showed a dependence on kelp either as a direct dietary source or a primary source of carbon in most of the fauna analysed, whereas there was little evidence of wood providing an importance dietary subsidy. Modelling analyses showed that kelp detritus comprised a large percentage of the diet of all of the taxa collected from the kelp samples, and several from the wood samples. Ontogenetic trophic changes (i.e., differences in delta 13C or delta 15N depending on animal size) were seen in several of the taxa analysed, revealing changes in dietary preference and increasing trophic level as a function of size/age. This study provides evidence of the importance of kelp in the trophic ecology of communities living at the Norwegian deep-sea floor. The continued loss of kelp from shallow, coastal systems may have profound effects for these communities as they face a reduction in this important subsidy.

AB  - As an integral part of the resident microbial community of fish intestinal tract, the mycobiota is expected to play important roles in health and disease resistance of the host. The composition of the diverse fungal communities, which colonize the intestine, is greatly influenced by the host, their diet and geographic origin. Studies of fungal communities are rare and the majority of previous studies have relied on culture-based methods. In particular, fungal communities in fish are also poorly characterized. The aim of this study was to provide an in-depth overview of the intestinal mycobiota in a model fish species (zebrafish, Danio rerio) and to determine differences in fungal composition between wild and captive specimens. We have profiled the intestinal mycobiota of wild-caught (Sharavati River, India), laboratory-reared (Bodo, Norway) and wild-caught-laboratory-kept (Uttara, India) zebrafish by sequencing the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 region on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Wild fish were exposed to variable environmental factors, whereas both laboratory groups were kept in controlled conditions. There were also differences in husbandry practices at Bodo and Uttara, particularly diet. Zebrafish from Bodo were reared in the laboratory for over 10 generations, while wild-caught-laboratory-kept fish from Uttara were housed in the laboratory for only 2 months before sample collection. The intestine of zebrafish contained members of more than 15 fungal classes belonging to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. Fungal species richness and diversity distinguished the wild-caught and laboratory-reared zebrafish communities. Wild-caught zebrafish-associated mycobiota comprised mainly Dothideomycetes in contrast to their Saccharomycetes-dominated laboratory-reared counterparts. The predominant Saccharomycetes in laboratory-reared fish belonged to the saprotrophic guild. Another characteristic feature of laboratory-reared fish was the significantly higher abundance of Cryptococcus (Tremellomycetes) compared to wild fish. This pioneer study has shed light into the differences in the intestinal fungal communities of wild-caught and laboratory-reared zebrafish and the baseline data generated will enrich our knowledge on fish mycobiota.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a model to measure and compare transaction costs in situations of multiple land use, where interdependence prevails between the agents-thus actions of one agent affects others. Transaction costs typically occur in situations where limited resources are used by more than one agent and bargaining of the use is conducted to mitigate conflict. The model of the paper is empirically tested on one such situation: forestry and reindeer husbandry, which is pursued in northern Sweden where transaction costs occur in common land use as a result of consultations. The results indicate that transaction costs are unevenly distributed between the two agents, where reindeer husbandry carries the highest costs, resulting in uneven power relations. Transaction costs are driven by the presence of Land Use Plans of reindeer husbandry, interestingly enough driving the costs in different directions for the two agents. The model illustrates the elements of transaction costs in a common pool resource situation, and the results are not only useful for this specific situation in policymaking, but also for other similar situations.

AB  - P>The blue-stain fungus and vascular stain pathogen Ceratocystis polonica and its associated bark beetle vectors, particularly Ips typographus and I. typographus japonicus, cause significant losses to several spruce species in Eurasia. Nothing is, however, known about the population genetics of this conifer pathogen. In this study, a set of single sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed to determine the population structure and genetic diversity of C. polonica in Europe and Japan. ISSR-PCR primers were used to target SSR-rich regions and specific primers were designed flanking the SSR regions found in these amplicons. The SSR primers developed for C. polonica were found to be transferable to six other Ceratocystis species from conifers, residing in the Ceratocystis coerulescens complex. Ninety-eight isolates representing four populations of C. polonica (Austria, Norway, Poland and Japan) were tested using 10 selected polymorphic SSR markers. A high level of gene diversity was found in C. polonica as a whole (H = 0.53). Analysis of G statistics showed a low degree of population structure in Europe and a high level of gene flow between populations (Gst = 0.05, Nm = 8.5). In contrast, the Japanese and the European populations of C. polonica displayed strong genetic separation, which is likely caused by geographic isolation. The low level of population structure of C. polonica in Europe and the differentiation between the European and the Japanese fungal populations mirror previous findings for I. typographus and I. typographus japonicus, the main insect vectors of this fungus. These results support the view that the fungus and the insect have closely co-evolved together. This study also suggests that movement of C. polonica and its vectors between Europe and Asia pose a threat to forestry on both continents and this should clearly be avoided.

AB  - This article follows the journey of Guyana's Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) programme, from its promising emergence in 2009 as an ambitious, Norway-funded scheme worth US$250m to its near-abandonment by all actors ten years later. It is based on primary fieldwork conducted in Guyana in 2016 and 2017 and a deep review of the theoretical and empirical literature on REDD+ policy processes and the Norway-Guyana agreement. The article shows how, contrary to the mainstream understanding of environmental policy as a disinterested search for a rational, scientific solution, decisions governing REDD+ policy in Guyana were rather shaped throughout by the political objectives and calculations of a small number of opportunistic elite actors. It further shows how even the modest incarnation of REDD+ in Guyana (which ended up resembling more of a results-based aid programme than a Payment for Ecosystem Services scheme) was continually affected by political factors beyond the control of policy managers. These included fluctuations in the world gold price that led to an increase in mining activity and deforestation, the departure of a key international investor which caused the collapse of the flagship REDD+-funded Amaila Falls hydropower project, and legislative gridlock in Guyana generated by a hung Parliament. While not suggesting that REDD+ (or similar Payment for Ecosystem Services schemes) can never work, the article nonetheless illustrates the ways in which political objectives and unforeseen events can overwhelm substantive policy efforts towards fighting climate change. The findings also illustrate the dangers of prioritizing short-term 'success stories' over longer-term and more consultative environmental policy processes.

AB  - In the Ebersberger Forest, which is the largest enclosed wooded region in the lowlands of Southern Germany, the effects of forest conversion of spruce monocultural stands into mixed spruce-beech forests on humus and ground vegetation (assessing plant diversity and composition) were examined. Three management systems (pure Norway spruce stands "Z" vs. conversion of pure Norway spruce stands into mixed stands of Norway spruce and European beech with a low "L" or high percentage of hardwood "H") were compared to one another. On a total of 54 sample areas (18 per system), humus (humus form and thickness of the humus layer) and ground vegetation (vascular plants, bryophytes) were recorded by using standardized sampling methods.
   The proportion of "unfavorable" humus forms, designated as raw humus-like moder and moder in the German system, decreased with increasing beech proportion, while the favorable humus forms, designated as mull-like moder and F-mull, showed an increase. Along with these changes, a significant lower average thickness of the organic humus layers (O) considering the fermented (f) and the humus (h) O horizon could be found in the L- and H-system.
   The effects of forest conversion caused changes in the constancy and/or cover of species of the understorey vegetation. The "losers" of forest conversion (indicator species of pure spruce stands) were predominantly species indicating acidic and nutrient poor sites and low temperatures. The "winners" (indicator species of L- and H-system), on the other hand, were predominantly the natural regeneration of deciduous trees and indicators of increased nutrient availability and base saturation.
   The introduction of beech affected the dominance of single species or species groups, resulting in a significant increase in evenness and Shannon diversity (and thus a higher alpha diversity) or a significant decrease in the cover of the moss layer in the H-system. Changes in total species number (gamma diversity) play a less important role. Due to a mosaic of small patches of spruce and beech dominated parts in the forest conversion variants with heterogeneous site conditions, there is also an increased floristic heterogeneity between the individual sampling plots and thus a continuous increase in beta diversity from the Z- over the L- to the H-system. The degree of naturalness or the proportion of species of closed forests also increases due to conversion. Accordingly, the overall effects of forest conversion on plant diversity can be assessed as positive.

AB  - This opinion paper discusses urban lawns, the most common part of open green spaces and urban green infrastructures. It highlights both the ecosystem services and also disservices provided by urban lawns based on the authors' experience of working within interdisciplinary research projects on lawns in different cities of Europe (Germany, Sweden and Russia), New Zealand (Christchurch), USA (Syracuse, NY) and Australia (Perth). It complements this experience with a detailed literature review based on the most recent studies of different biophysical, social, planning and design aspects of lawns. We also used an international workshop as an important part of the research methodology. We argue that although lawns of Europe and the United States of America are now relatively well studied, other parts of the world still underestimate the importance of researching lawns as a complex ecological and social phenomenon. One of the core objectives of this paper is to share a paradigm of nature-based solutions in the context of lawns, which can be an important step towards finding resilient sustainable alternatives for urban green spaces in the time of growing urbanisation, increased urban land use competition, various user demands and related societal challenges of the urban environment. We hypothesise that these solutions may be found in urban ecosystems and various local native plant communities that are rich in species and able to withstand harsh conditions such as heavy trampling and droughts. To support the theoretical hypothesis of the relevance of nature-based solutions for lawns we also suggest and discuss the concept of two natures-different approaches to the vision of urban nature, including the understanding and appreciation of lawns. This will help to increase the awareness of existing local ecological approaches as well as an importance of introducing innovative landscape architecture practices. This article suggests that there is a potential for future transdisciplinary international research that might aid our understanding of lawns in different climatic and socio-cultural conditions as well as develop locally adapted (to environmental conditions, social needs and management policies) and accepted nature-based solutions.

AB  - Several disciplines, such as landscape architecture, species conservation and water management, have contributed to the advancement of knowledge of Green Infrastructure (GI). However, doubts remain on the best approach to embed the concept of GI and related components in planning policies and practice. This paper presents a literature review of the scientific and policy frameworks of GI as well as the knowledge gap that exists between academics and practitioners. Furthermore, a discourse analysis of planning documents was conducted in the metropolitan regions of Milan, Montreal and Helsinki. The three metropolitan regions are challenging new forms of cooperation between academics and practitioners. The results show that while studies on GI are used to support planning strategies, they struggle to address spatial, landscape and environmental issues at the local scale. Closer interdisciplinary cooperation between academics, as well as between academics and practitioners, can help to find new approaches to urban landscape.

AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stocks and their medium-term and readily decomposable fractions in topsoils were compared in relation to soil microbial biomass and activity along sequences from coniferous to deciduous stands. The study was carried out in the Ore Mountains and the Saxonian lowland, representing two typical natural regions in Saxony, Germany. In accordance with current forest conversion practices, the investigation sites represent different stands: mature conifer stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (type A); Norway Scots spruce and pine with advanced plantings of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) or European beech/Common oak (Quercus petreae Liebl.) (type B); and mature deciduous stands of European beech and European beech/Common oak (type Q. The investigated forest sites can be grouped into three silvicultural situations according to the development from coniferous stands to advanced plantings and finally mature deciduous forests (chronosequence A-B-C). The organic layer (L, F and H horizons) and uppermost mineral soil (0-10 cm) were analysed for potential C mineralisation, microbial biomass, concentrations of total C and N (TOC and TN) and for medium-term and readily decomposable C and N fractions, obtained by hot- and cold-water extraction respectively. The results showed an increase in organic layer thickness and mass as well as TOC and TN stocks along the forest sequences in the lowland. Yet, under-planted sites with two storeys revealed higher organic layer mass as well as TOC and TN stocks as compared to coniferous and deciduous stands. Stocks of hot- and cold-water-extractable C and N in relation to microbial biomass and its activity revealed a high turnover activity in deeper organic horizons of deciduous forests compared to coniferous stands. The stand-specific differentiation is discussed in relation to microbial biomass, litter quantity and quality and forest structure, but also with respect to the site-specific climatic factors and water budget as well as liming and fly-ash impacts. Results indicate higher dynamics in deciduous stands in the lowland especially during the initial turnover phase. The elevated microbial activity in deeper organic horizons of deciduous litter-influenced sites in spring is discussed as a specific indicator for long-term C sequestration potential as besides C mineralisation organic compounds are humified and thus, can be stored in the organic layer or in deeper soil horizons. Due to liming activities, stand-specific effects on organic matter turnover dynamics have evened out today in the Ore mountain region, but will presumably occur again once base saturation decreases. Here, the stand-specific effect on microbial biomass can currently be seen again as C-mic in the L horizon increased from spruce to beech. Our study sites in the lowland revealed no significant fly-ash impact. Differences between sites were evaluated by calculating the discriminance function. TOC and TN as well as medium-term degradable C and N were defined in this study as indicators for turnover dynamics along forest conversion sites.

AB  - Aim Understanding variation in biodiversity typically requires consideration of factors operating at different spatial scales. Recently, ecologists and biogeographers have recognized the need of analysing ecological communities in the light of multiple facets including not only species-level information but also functional and phylogenetic approaches to improve our understanding of the relative contribution of processes shaping biodiversity. Here, our aim was to disentangle the relative importance of environmental variables measured at multiple levels (i.e., local, catchment, climate, and spatial variables) influencing variation in macroinvertebrate beta diversity facets (i.e., species, traits, and phylogeny) and their components (i.e., replacement and abundance difference) in boreal streams. Taxon Location Aquatic macroinvertebrates Western Finland Methods Results A total of 105 streams were sampled in western Finland, encompassing a geographical extent over 500 km. We analysed variation in the different beta diversity facets and components using distance-based redundancy analysis and associated variation partitioning procedures. We modelled spatial structures using distance-based Moran eigenvector maps. We found that the relative influence of explanatory variables on each diversity facet and component revealed relatively similar patterns. Our main finding was that local environmental and spatial variables generally contributed most to the total explained variability in all facets and components of beta diversity, whereas catchment and climate variables explained less variation in the beta diversity facets at the spatial scale considered in this study. Main conclusions Different facets of beta diversity were mainly influenced by local environmental variables and spatial structuring, likely acting through deterministic and stochastic pathways respectively. Identifying the ecological variables and mechanisms that drive variation in beta diversity may be used to guide the conservation and restoration efforts for biodiversity under global change.

AB  - The practice of harvesting forest residues is rapidly increasing due to rising demand for renewable energy. However, major concerns have been raised about the sustainability of this practice and its net impact on long term soil ability to support forest productivity, particularly through second and subsequent rotations. In this study, soil chemical properties such as acidity, total N and C, available NO3-N and NH4-N and exchangeable cations were measured in all horizons in peaty gleys soils under one of the oldest experiments in Europe-a 28-year-old second rotation stand of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis), in Kielder forest, UK. Treatments included Whole Tree Harvesting (WTH-of all above ground biomass), Conventional stem-only harvesting (CH) of the first rotation crop, and repeated Fertilisation (FE) after the planting of the second rotation forest. This study demonstrates the soil changes underpinning the reduced second rotation tree productivity on these acidic upland sites under WTH, a further 18 years after the investigation by Proe and Dutch (1994). Overall, WTH increased soil acidity significantly (p < 0.05) and reduced soil base saturation whilst FE reduced soil acidity (p < 0.05) and increased soil base saturation as compared to CH. Soil moisture was significantly higher (p < 0.01) under WTH compared to CH and FE plots. There was no evidence that WTH decreased soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (N), but to the contrary there were significantly (p < 0.01) higher concentrations and stocks of total C and N in the WTH soils compared with CH and FE. The depletion of SOC and N in CH and FE plots was attributed to much higher soil mineralisation rates associated with the brash and fertilisation as compared to the WTH plots, where significantly less soil available NO3-N (p < 0.01) was found. In the long term WTH on peaty gley soils appears positive for soil C and N storage. However, WTH had a long term negative impact on soil and tree nutrition of K+ and P, which are currently at deficient levels, but has had a stabilising effect on tree N nutrition as measured in twigs and needles. These results suggest that whilst WTH lead to a reduction in aboveground tree biomass compared to conventional harvest, these practices on selected soil types and certain sites may be beneficial for soil C and N sequestration. The overall findings of this study imply that cost benefit analyses for each site should be carried out before decisions are made on the appropriate type of forest operations (harvesting and replanting), considering both geology and soils in order to serve both environmental benefits, long term sustainability and the available biomass production for timber and biofuel.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry and forestry are two main land users in boreal forests in northern Sweden. Modern forestry has numerous negative effects on the ground-growing and arboreal lichens that are crucial winter resources for reindeer husbandry. Using digitized historical maps, we examined changes in the forest landscape structure during the past 100 years, and estimated corresponding changes in suitability of forest landscape mosaics for the reindeer winter grazing. Cover of old coniferous forests, a key habitat type of reindeer herding system, showed a strong decrease during the study period, whereas clear-cutting and young forests increased rapidly in the latter half of the 20th century. The dominance of young forests and fragmentation of old-growth forests (decreased patch sizes and increased isolation) reflect decreased amount of arboreal lichens as well as a lowered ability of the landscape to sustain long-term persistence of lichens. The results further showed that variation in ground lichen cover among sites was mainly related to soil moisture conditions, recent disturbances, such as soil scarification and prescribed burning, and possibly also to forest history. In general, the results suggest that the composition and configuration of the forest landscape mosaic has become less suitable for sustainable reindeer husbandry.

AB  - The recovering population of white-tailed eagles Haliaeetus albicilla was studied in Lithuania, Central Europe. In the present study, we focused on (1) clarifying which theoretical distribution model better fits and describes the observed pattern of eagle settlement, (2) examining habitat preference at the level of nesting territory and its relationship with reproduction, (3) ascertaining the genetic diversity profile of the population using D-loop mtDNA. Between 1985 and 2011, the white-tailed eagle population recovered from 0 to 120 pairs and by the end of the period occupied a range of 34,000 km(2). As indicated by a mean annual breeding success of 0.67, productivity 1.15, and brood size 1.73, the population reproduced well. The pattern of habitat settlement during the period of population expansion was not random as high-quality habitats were occupied first. Supporting the ideal free distribution model, reproduction was similar across nesting territories in three different habitat types, as well as between territories established in different years. The eagles preferred aquatic habitats, but these preferences were not adaptive in terms of breeding performance. Increased brood failures in later years possibly indicated the growing effect of density-dependent regulation. In total, six different haplotypes were identified in the sample of 45 individual birds. Haplotype diversity was 0.711. Phylogenetically, the Lithuanian population is most closely related to the populations of Sweden, Poland, and Germany, while similarity with Lapland, Kola, and Estonian populations was evident too. These findings indicate possible source populations directly or indirectly participating in the process of recovery of the formerly extinct Lithuanian population. Haplotypes distribution across the three habitat types in Lithuania was uneven.

AB  - Time geography has been applied to study geographical situations characterised by intertwining temporal and spatial aspects. The availability of space for the conduct of land-use activities as temporal-action sequences can be investigated using time geography. The present study utilises time geography to examine how geography matters in the context of a contested mining proposal in Swedish Lapland, namely the case of reindeer herding in Gallok. The time-geographic notion of "packing" that denotes time-space compactness is utilised to investigate the room to manoeuvre available for reindeer herding. The theoretical entry lies in the idea that maximum nearness in human society has to do with the manner in which activities are organised in space and time. This is embraced by the time-geographic concept of the pocket of local order. The article reviews discussion in the literature of the notion of packing and discusses the organisation of reindeer herding as land use in the case studied. The study examines how space and time may matter in detail, as well as how the concept of the pocket of local order can be utilised to assess this and to detect the prevailing degree of packing. It suggests that such dependences represent more-than-subjective preconditions of operational character in land use. The study contributes to understanding of how the successful conduct of the business of land use may depend on the ability to maintain organisational coherence in a temporal-spatial sense.

AB  - Current urban green space planning processes are typically guided by greenspace-to-residence proximity indicators. Alone, these indicators are unable to assess, and respond, to the growing socio-spatial polarisation of environmental risks, impacts, and benefits among distinct societal groups within a city. In this research, we present a municipal green space planning tool for measuring the spatial distribution of urban green space diversity within a city, developed using a novel spatial application of the Shannon diversity index to urban green spaces. We illustrate the use of this planning tool in the case of Vantaa, a city in Southern Finland, and examine the association of this diversity indicator with three spatially polarising socio-demographic factors in the region. Contrary to the dominant environmental distributive justice narrative, and stark trends towards socio-spatial polarisation observed in many cities internationally, our findings reveal that urban green space diversity does not currently correlate with income, age structure, or share of population with a foreign background in Vantaa. However, given the changing social dynamics present in our case city, ongoing monitoring and evaluation of who benefits and how from ecosystem service benefits of a diverse urban green space network is necessary. This research offers a practical tool for urban green space planners in European cities facing similar periods of significant differential spatial expansion and changing social dynamics.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has been recognized as an important driver of declines in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Changes in agricultural policy aims to mitigate these declines, but little is known about actual outcome of large scale changes in agricultural policy on communities of service-providing organisms. Two data sets containing captures of ground beetles (Carabidae) collected at an interval of 24 years were analyzed; the data were collected in the same area in Sweden under different environmental conditions before and after the introduction of a national pesticide risk reduction program. Environmental changes were analyzed by considering indicators of land use and agricultural management over time. Ground beetles collected over the whole season were considered and species were categorized according to functional traits. Environmental changes between the two time periods were characterized by increases in fallow and organic farming and a strong reduction in the amount of pesticide active ingredients sold and risk factors associated with pesticides. Although there were no changes in ground beetle species richness and community evenness after mitigation of agricultural intensification, there were differences in dominance distribution and functional composition. Ground beetles collected in the 1980s had higher proportions of carnivorous, cursorial, and small and intermediate size beetles than those collected in 2003. Communities sampled in 2003 had increased proportions of omnivorous, mobile, spring breeding, and large beetle species. These shifts in functional characteristics of ground beetle communities may improve biological control of cereal aphids and reduce variability in this ecosystem service over time.

AB  - Aim Understanding the spatial patterns of species distribution and predicting the occurrence of high biological diversity and rare species are central themes in biogeography and environmental conservation. The aim of this study was to model and scrutinize the relative contributions of climate, topography, geology and land-cover factors to the distributions of threatened vascular plant species in taiga landscapes in northern Finland.
   Location North-east Finland, northern Europe.
   Methods The study was performed using a data set of 28 plant species and environmental variables at a 25-ha resolution. Four different stepwise selection algorithms [Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), adaptive backfitting, cross selection] with generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted to identify the main environmental correlates for species occurrences. The accuracies of the distribution models were evaluated using fourfold cross-validation based on the area under the curve (AUC) derived from receiver operating characteristic plots. The GAMs were tentatively extrapolated to the whole study area and species occurrence probability maps were produced using GIS techniques. The effect of spatial autocorrelation on the modelling results was also tested by including autocovariate terms in the GAMs.
   Results According to the AUC values, the model performance varied from fair to excellent. The AIC algorithm provided the highest mean performance (mean AUC = 0.889), whereas the lowest mean AUC (0.851) was obtained from BIC. Most of the variation in the distribution of threatened plant species was related to growing degree days, temperature of the coldest month, water balance, cover of mire and mean elevation. In general, climate was the most powerful explanatory variable group, followed by land cover, topography and geology. Inclusion of the autocovariate only slightly improved the performance of the models and had a minor effect on the importance of the environmental variables.
   Main conclusions The results confirm that the landscape-scale distribution patterns of plant species can be modelled well on the basis of environmental parameters. A spatial grid system with several environmental variables derived from remote sensing and GIS data was found to produce useful data sets, which can be employed when predicting species distribution patterns over extensive areas. Landscape-scale maps showing the predicted occurrences of individual or multiple threatened plant species may provide a useful basis for focusing field surveys and allocating conservation efforts.

This study presents a detailed temporal reconstruction of habitats surrounding the cave, using various proxies based on rich large mammal assemblages and related to biological activities. The levels correlated to MIS 3 and MIS 2 are characterized by alternating carnivore, Neanderthal, and Anatomically Modern Human (AMH) occupations. Faunal exploitation was mainly oriented towards Equus caballus and Rangifer tarandus, with a significant increase in the latter prey from the last Aurignacian level onwards. The results exhibit geographic and temporal variations of reindeer and horse body size. Reindeer can be used as a suitable ecological marker, as rapid changes are correlated to environmental turnover, whereas the horse presents a different pattern and is an accurate chronological estimator. The palaeoecological results indicate a major climate change between the two Aurignacian levels. The Mousterian and the first Aurignacian levels, documenting the Middle to Late Palaeolithic transition, show high indices of specific richness and diversity of large mammals in relation with a periglacial moderate cold and wet climate. The region developed a mixed landscape and displayed a non-analogue fauna with E. caballus, R. tarandus, Cervus elaphus, Megaloceros giganteus, Bison priscus, Bos primigenius, Capra caucasica praepyrenaica, Sus scrofa and Coelodonta antiquitatis for the ungulates and Ursus spelaeus, Ursus arctos, Crocuta crocuta spelaea, Panthera leo spelaea, Panthera pardus, Lynx spelaeus, Canis lupus and Vulpes vulpes for the carnivores. The breakdown occurring in the last Aurignacian level is characterized by a change in ecological settings, with a colder and drier climate and opening of the landscape, involving shifts in seasonality, plant phenology, reindeer body size and animal population densities. This impacted habitat fragmentation and geographic distribution of populations, implying various selective pressures that were reflected in human meat procurement and dispersal events. At Tournal Cave, the late Middle/early Late Palaeolithic transition is not directly marked by significant differences in terms of faunal exploitation, due to local climate and site function, but the major environmental shift recorded is delayed. The results indicate that abrupt climate oscillations during MIS 3 contributed to the decline of Neanderthal populations, notably because of habitat fragmentation. AMHs could have generated additional stresses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change sets high pressures on the construction industry to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the carbon storage properties and potential to use renewable resources efficiently, wooden multi-storey construction (WMC) is an interesting alternative for the construction industry to enhance sustainable development combined with the aesthetic and well-being benefits of wood perceived among many consumers. For forest industry firms, industrial wood construction is a possibility to seek for business opportunities and bring socio-economic benefits for local economies. Despite positive drivers, WMC still remains a niche even in the forest-rich countries.The purpose of our study is to add understanding on the WMC market development by conducting a systematic literature analysis on international peer-reviewed studies from the past 20 years. Our special focus is on the role of WMC in the housing markets studied from the perspectives of the demand, supply and local governance factors. As specific aims, we 1) synthesize the key barriers and enabling factors for the WMC market growth; 2) identify the actors addressed in the existing studies connected to the WMC market development, and 3) summarize research methods and analytical approaches used in the previous studies. As a systematic method to make literature searches in Web of Science and Scopus for years 2000-2020, we employed PRISMA guidelines. By using pre-determined keywords, our searches resulted in a sample of 696 articles, of which 42 full articles were after selection procedure included in-depth content analysis. Our results showed cost-efficiency gains from industrialized prefabrication and perceived sustainability benefits by consumers and architects enabled a WMC market diffusion. The lack of experiences on the WMC, and path dependencies to use concrete and steel continue to be key barriers for increased WMC. Although our research scope was the global WMC market development, most of the literature concerned the Nordic region. The key actors covered in the literature were businesses (e.g., contractors, manufacturers and architects) involved in the wood construction value-chains, while residents and actors in the local governance were seldomly addressed. Currently, case studies, the use of qualitative data sets and focus on the Nordic region dominate the literature. This hinders the generalizability of findings in different regional contexts. In the future, more research is needed on how sustainability-driven wood construction value-chains are successfully shaping up in different geographical regions, and how they could challenge the dominant concrete-based construction regime.

AB  - Agricultural ecosystems are facing critical loss of biodiversity, soil nutrients, and cultural values. Intensive crop production has caused landscape homogenisation, with trees and hedges increasingly disappearing from agricultural land. Changes in farming practices are essential to increase biodiversity and improve soil biogeochemical processes, such as nutrient cycling, soil carbon uptake, and sequestration, as well as to improve the resilience and fertility of farming systems. Agroforestry is an important practice for implementing and improving natural and cultural value of landscapes, but in northern countries, agroforestry methods remain rarely utilised. Our study was conducted in Southern Finland on an agricultural field where a row of willow and alder was planted 6 years prior to our study. We concentrated on the effects of the tree row on crop growing conditions and how far from the trees possible impacts can be observed. We studied soil properties, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) exchange, and soil microbial communities. The impact of trees on crop growing conditions, biomass production, and greenhouse gas fluxes was modest and did not extend further than few meters from the tree row in the warm and dry growing season of 2019. N2O and CH4 fluxes were negligible and the tree row did not increase greenhouse gas emissions from soil. Soil microbial diversity was clearly improved by the presence of trees due to more diverse habitats. The tree row also slightly decreased the estimated annual net emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. Due to positive indications of the effects of agroforestry on biodiversity and carbon uptake, we highly recommend further studies within various agroforestry practices in Nordic countries.

AB  - Post Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian war are significantly impacting energy systems worldwide, faltering investments and threatening to throttle the expansion of primary clean energy technologies, even in the case of a well-structured and managed energy system, such as Norway. This unprecedented crisis requires deeper analyses and well-measured actions from the main actors in Norway's energy and climate sector. Hence, providing and highlighting needed interventions and improvements in the energy system is crucial. This study analyzes demand-side energy in Norway's households, industry, transport, and "other" sectors. LEAP model, a powerful energy system analysis tool, was used to conduct the analysis based on Baseline and Mitigation scenarios. The energy demand by sector and fuel type toward 2050 is forecasted, firstly by considering a set of parameters and key assumptions that impact the security of supply and secondly on the ambitious target of Norway's government in decreasing GHG emissions by 55% in 2030 and 90-95% by the year 2050 compared to 1990 levels. The mitigation scenario aims to diversify the overall national energy system and technological changes based on large-scale renewable energy sources (RES) integration. From the perspective of climate change issues, EV's include an attractive option for deep decarbonization, including other sustainable fuel sources such as H2, biofuel mixed with diesel, the use of excess heat deriving from industry to cover households' heating demand, and integration of large-scale heat pumps driven by RES during off-peak demand is applied. Energy demand pro-jections are uncertain, and the main goal is to show how different scenario projections up to 2050 affect the whole of Norway's energy system, leading to a combined global warming potential (GWP) of around 7.30 MtCO2 in the mitigation scenario from 56.40 MtCO2 tones released in the baseline scenario, by reaching only 77.5% reduction referring to 1990 level. This study's findings show that the net-zero ambitions by the end of 2050 are impossible without the carbon tax application and carbon capture storage (CCS), especially in the oil and gas industry.

AB  - Participative strategy development serves to integrate the interests and perspectives of multiple stakeholders involved in today's complex environmental challenges, aiming at a better-informed strategy for tackling these challenges, increased stakeholder ownership, and more democratic decision making. Prior research has observed inherent tensions between the need for participative strategy to be open to stakeholders' input and the need for closure and guidance. We extend this reasoning using a framing perspective. Our evidence from the development of the England Peat Action Plan suggests that tensions can emerge between the necessary ambiguous initial framing of intended change and the persistence of stakeholders' different framings of this change as well as perceptions of lacking knowledge, guidance, and control. We argue that strategy openness can thereby impede stakeholders' willingness and ability to change and counteract the strategy's aim for major transformation. Interactive spaces help mitigate the tensions and facilitate stakeholders' willingness and ability for change. Related ArticlesBrant, Hanna K., Nathan Myers, and Katherine L. Runge. 2017.

AB  - The predicted extreme temperatures of globalwarming aremagnified in cities due to the urban heat island effect. Even if the target for average temperature increase in the Paris Climate Agreement is met, temperatures during the hottest month in a northern city like Oslo are predicted to rise by over 5 degrees C by 2050. We hypothesised that heat-related diagnoses for heat-sensitive citizens (75+) in Oslo are correlated to monthly air temperatures, and that green infrastructure such as tree canopy cover reduces extreme land surface temperatures and thus reduces health risk from heat exposure. Monthly air temperatures were significantly correlated to the number of skin-related diagnoses at the city level, but were unrelated to diagnoses under circulatory, nervous system, or general categories. Satellite-derived spatially-explicit measures revealed that on one of the hottest days during the summer of 2018, landscape units composed of paved, midrise or lowrise buildings gave off the most heat (39 degrees C), whereas units composed of complete tree canopy cover, ormixed (i.e. tree and grass) vegetation maintained temperatures of between 29 and 32 degrees C. Land surface temperatureswere negatively correlated to tree canopy cover (R-2= 0.45) and vegetation greenness (R-2= 0.41). In a scenario inwhich each city tree was replaced by the most common non-tree cover in its neighbourhood, the area of Oslo exceeding a 30 degrees C health risk threshold during the summerwould increase from 23 to 29%. Combining modelling results with population at risk at census tract level, we estimated that each tree in the city currently mitigates additional heat exposure of one heatsensitive person by one day. Our results indicate that maintaining and restoring tree cover provides an ecosystem service of urban heat reduction. Our findings have particular relevance for health benefit estimation in urban ecosystem accounting and municipal policy decisions regarding ecosystem-based climate adaptation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In the management of forest ecosystems, spatial information about the extent, condition and pressures are essential. In the current study, we present a framework for a remote sensing-based forest ecological base map covering Norway. Combining remotely sensed imagery from optical satellite systems such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat provides information about forest ecosystem extent and change over time. Utilizing a national dataset of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data allowed predicting a range of attributes describing forest condition, including naturalness. In total, seven definitions of naturalness were evaluated. Pressures on the forest ecosystems were mapped using a change detection algorithm and satellite data from 1986 to 2020. Change detection is the cornerstone in monitoring and for understanding the pressures on the ecosystems. The predicted forest extent had an overall accuracy of 85 to 89% using Sentinel-2 imagery from 2020 and 71 to 81% using Landsat imagery from 1986. For the forest condition attributes, the explained portion of the variances were >70% for biomass, height and volume and from 21% to 64% for number of stems, crown coverage and a diversity index. Naturalness was classified with accuracies of 77 to 98%, except for age-based definitions. Nevertheless, a large number of false positives were present. Change detection was evaluated in terms of final harvest and was identified with an overall accuracy of 84-92%. The land cover change classification had an overall accuracy of 70-92%. The detailed maps of forest condition and forest pressures were aggregated to a local level using model-based inference, providing estimates of mean values and uncertainty at a scale suitable for ecosystem indicator development. The collection of map layers describing forest extent, condition and pressures form a forest ecological base map important for environmental management.

AB  - Various national policies guide forest use, but often with competing policy objectives leading to divergent management paradigms. Incoherent policies may negatively impact the sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services (FES), and forest multifunctionality. There is uncertainty among policymakers about the impacts of policies on the real world. We translated the policy documents of Finland into scenarios including the quantitative demands for FES, representing: the national forest strategy (NFS), the biodiversity strategy (BDS), and the bioeconomy strategy (BES). We simulated a Finland-wide systematic sample of forest stands with alternative management regimes and climate change. Finally, we used multi-objective optimization to identify the combination of management regimes matching best with each policy scenario and analysed their long-term effects on FES.
   The NFS scenario proved to be the most multifunctional, targeting the highest number of FES, while the BES had the lowest FES targets. However, the NFS was strongly oriented towards the value chain of wood and bioenergy and had a dominating economic growth target, which caused strong within-policy conflicts and hindered reaching biodiversity targets. The BDS and BES scenarios were instead more consistent but showed either sustainability gaps in terms of providing timber resources (BDS) or no improvements in forest biodiversity (BES). All policy scenarios resulted in forest management programs dominated by continuous cover forestry, set-aside areas, and intensive management zones, with proportions depending on the policy focus. Our results highlight for the first time the conflicts among national sectoral policies in terms of management requirements and effects on forest multifunctionality. The outcomes provide leverage points for policymakers to increase coherence among future policies and improve implementation of multiple uses of forests.

AB  - Land use in general and particularly agricultural practices can significantly influence soil carbon (C) storage. Changes in topsoil C mass measured in long-term agricultural field trials in Sweden and other Northern European countries were compiled and aggregated into seven treatment classes, including manured, fertilized and straw exported. The impact of crop rotations and management practices on C stocks in the topsoil was analyzed using both a static model and a dynamic soil carbon model (introductory C Balance Model; ICBM). ICBM consists of two state variables and four fluxes (governed by four rate-determining parameters), and one parameter, r(e), combining most external factors affecting C mineralization (temperature, precipitation, drainage, etc.). Simple 'front-end models' were used to estimate values for two of the parameters, i (annual C input) and h (humification coefficient) initially based on incomplete records from the field trials, official agricultural statistics and other literature. The r(e) parameter was then optimized for each class of treatments, using an algorithm for non-linear least squares. Initial soil C mass, present C inputs and abiotic conditions, such as soil temperature and moisture, were the deciding factors in whether C stocks declined or increased. Steady-state values calculated using the static and dynamic model were similar for both models, but differed greatly between treatment classes. For cereal-dominated cropping systems where the straw was removed, manure application increased steady-state values about three times (from 3 to 9 g C m(-2)), compared with corresponding treatments. Incorporation of straw resulted in intermediate steady-state values (5-6 g C m(-2)). C mineralization rates were highest in bare fallow treatments. For one class of soils, C retention in the soil was found to increase significantly with increasing clay content. The hypothesis that the climatic gradients in Northern Europe affect decomposition and primary production rates similarly, leading to the same soil C stocks, could not be rejected.

AB  - Climate change and human activities influence the development of ecosystems, with human demand of ecosystem services altering both land use and land cover. Fossil pollen records provide time series of vegetation characteristics, and the aim of this study was to create spatially continuous reconstructions of land cover through the Holocene in southern Sweden. The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) was applied to obtain quantitative reconstructions of pollen-based vegetation cover at local scales, accounting for pollen production, dispersal, and deposition mechanisms. Pollen-based local vegetation estimates were produced from 41 fossil pollen records available for the region. A comparison of 17 interpolation methods was made and evaluated by comparing with current land cover. Simple kriging with cokriging using elevation was selected to interpolate the local characteristics of past land cover, to generate more detailed reconstructions of trends and degree of variability in time and space than previous studies based on pollen data representing the regional scale. Since the Mesolithic, two main processes have acted to reshape the land cover of southern Sweden, originally mostly covered by broad-leaved forests. The natural distribution limit of coniferous forest has moved southward during periods with colder climate and retracted northward during warmer periods, and human expansion in the area and agrotechnological developments has led to a gradually more open landscape, reaching maximum openness at the beginning of the 20th century. The recent intensification of agriculture has led to abandonment of less fertile agricultural fields and afforestation with conifer forest.

AB  - Agricultural intensification both increases disturbances at the field level and reduces habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level and this can have detrimental effects on biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. A few studies have shown that agricultural intensification can diminish the ecosystem service of weed seed predation, but it is not known to what extent availability of crop and non-crop habitat can provide disturbance refugia for weed seed predators and how those effects cascade to ecosystem service provisioning. Using data from 13 fields in Southern Sweden, we first combined diet preference traits, activity density and metabolic theory, in order to develop a metric that approximates the community strength of seed predation. We then explored how the impact of field management intensity and habitat refugia on seed card predation rates mediated by weed seed availability and the metric of community strength of seed predation. We found that increasing field management intensity directly reduced seed card predation rates and weed seed availability and that reduced weed seed availability in turn impaired the community strength of seed predation. This suggests an indirect mechanism by which field management limits seed predator potential for weed seed predation. We found no evidence that either crop or non-crop refugia can increase seed card predation rates or community strength of seed predation during dis-turbances in the crop. Consequently, weed seed predation can be promoted by reducing disturbances at the field level, regardless of the availability of disturbance refugia in the landscape. Reduction of field management in-tensity can directly increase weed seed predation and indirectly seed predator communities' potential for weed seed predation by increasing weed seed availability. Future research is needed to explore if supporting a diversity of non-competitive weeds to enhance seed availability can improve the suppression of dominant and competitive weed species.

AB  - Society faces the double challenge of increasing biomass production to meet the future demands for food, materials and bioenergy, while addressing negative impacts of current (and future) land use. In the discourse, land use change (LUC) has often been considered as negative, referring to impacts of deforestation and expansion of biomass plantations. However, strategic establishment of suitable perennial production systems in agricultural landscapes can mitigate environmental impacts of current crop production, while providing biomass for the bioeconomy. Here, we explore the potential for such "beneficial LUC" in EU28. First, we map and quantify the degree of accumulated soil organic carbon losses, soil loss by wind and water erosion, nitrogen emissions to water, and recurring floods, in similar to 81.000 individual landscapes in EU28. We then estimate the effectiveness in mitigating these impacts through establishment of perennial plants, in each landscape. The results indicate that there is a substantial potential for effective impact mitigation. Depending on criteria selection, 10-46% of the land used for annual crop production in EU28 is located in landscapes that could be considered priority areas for beneficial LUC. These areas are scattered all over Europe, but there are notable "hot-spots" where priority areas are concentrated, e.g., large parts of Denmark, western UK, The Po valley in Italy, and the Danube basin. While some policy developments support beneficial LUC, implementation could benefit from attempts to realize synergies between different Sustainable Development Goals, e.g., "Zero hunger", "Clean water and sanitation", "Affordable and Clean Energy", "Climate Action", and "Life on Land".

AB  - Heavy trucks contribute significantly to climate change, and in 2020 were responsible for 7% of total Swedish GHG emissions and 5% of total global CO2 emissions. Here we study the full lifecycle of cargo trucks powered by different energy pathways, comparing their biomass feedstock use, primary energy use, net biogenic and fossil CO2 emission and cumulative radiative forcing. We analyse battery electric trucks with bioelectricity from stand-alone or combined heat and power (CHP) plants, and pathways where bioelectricity is integrated with wind and solar electricity. We analyse trucks operated on fossil diesel fuel and on dimethyl ether (DME). All energy pathways are analysed with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS). Bioelectricity and DME are produced from forest harvest residues. Forest biomass is a limited resource, so in a scenario analysis we allocate a fixed amount of biomass to power Swedish truck transport. Battery lifespan and chemistry, the technology level of energy supply, and the biomass source and transport distance are all varied to understand how sensitive the results are to these parameters. We find that pathways using electricity to power battery electric trucks have much lower climate impacts and primary energy use, compared to diesel- and DME-based pathways. The pathways using bioelectricity with CCS result in negative emissions leading to global cooling of the earth. The pathways using diesel and DME have significant and very similar climate impact, even with CCS. The robust results show that truck electrification and increased renewable electricity production is a much better strategy to reduce the climate impact of cargo transport than the adoption of DME trucks, and much more primary energy efficient. This climate impact analysis includes all fossil and net biogenic CO2 emissions as well as the timing of these emissions. Considering only fossil emissions is incomplete and could be misleading.

AB  - Context As forest harvesting remains high, there is a crucial need to assess the remaining large, contiguous and intact forests, regionally, nationally and globally. Objectives Our objective was to analyze the spatial patterns and structural connectivity of intact and primary forests in northern Sweden with focus on the Scandinavian Mountain region; one of the few remaining large European intact forest landscapes. Methods Over 22 million ha with 14.5 million ha boreal and subalpine forest and with data consisting of a 60-70 year retrospective sequence, we analyzed distribution, density and connectivity of forests that have not been clear cut, using moving window and landscape analyzes derived from Circuitscape. Results We revealed a contiguous, connected and semi-connected intact forest landscape forming a distinct Green Belt south to north along the mountain range. Almost 60% of the forestland remains intact, including contiguous clusters 10,000 ha and larger. The connectivity is particularly high in protected areas with primary forests outside contributing substantially to overall connectivity. We found gaps in connectivity in the southern parts, and furthermore low or absent connectivity across the whole inland and coastal areas of northern Sweden. Conclusions Given its ecological values, the Scandinavian Mountains Green Belt is a key entity supporting ecological legacies, boreal biodiversity and ecosystem services, resilience and adaptive capacity, which needs to be safeguarded for the future. On the very large areas outside the mountain region, forestlands are severely fragmented, connectivity values are lost, and forest landscape restoration is needed for conservation and functional green infrastructure.

AB  - Ecosystems approaches, and among them the ecosystem services (ES) framework, are held as promising vehicles for holistic thinking which is usually taken to mean integration of society and nature. The notion of ES is also seen to aid us in saying something about how and what people value in nature. It is hence surprising that among a huge number of scientific works couched in terms in ES, still relatively few explore the explicit engagement of such concepts with stakeholders with respect to empirical issues, including integration. Motivated by a need to empirically test rather than assume the integrative work of ES, we ask: what ways of using the framework as a stakeholder tool are invited, and does integration unfold in practice? Our evidence comes from a study of a group of stakeholders' perspectives on sustainable management of sheep grazing in low alpine landscapes in the south of Norway. According to the stakeholders, grazing intensity, type and spatiality cannot be understood and arrived at without accounting for how grazing pressure is the result of the co-production of nature and society. By way of four empirical examples, we demonstrate 1) the integrative agency ES can have, 2) how ES can work to integrate despite the framework, 3) how ES can work against integration, and 4) the implicit agency of ES for the co-production of sustainability and grazing pressures. The study demonstrates that there are particular weaknesses in the concept as an integrative device regarding the invisibility of human co-agency. Furthermore, the precise methodological framing of the research is found to be crucial for whether and how human co-agency is made visible through the framework, and thus how ES works as an integrative framework.

AB  - Despite the great importance of fine roots, which are referred to as roots smaller than 2 mm in diameter, in terms of carbon and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, how fine root biomass, production, and turnover rate change with stand development remains poorly understood. Here we assessed the variations of fine root biomass, production, and morphology of trees and understory vegetation in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook) plantations at the ages of 7 years old, 17 years old and 25 years old in southern China, representing the sapling, pole and mature stage, respectively. Fine roots of trees and understory vegetation were sampled with sequential coring method to a depth of 60 cm and sliced into 4 layers (0-15, 15-30, 30-45 and 45-60 cm). Fine root biomass and necromass were highest in the pole stages among these three different aged Chinese fir plantations, although the significant differences were only detected for fine root necromass between 25-year-old and 7-year-old plantations. Fine root biomass of Chinese fir was heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Seasonal variation of fine root biomass in three age groups showed a similar pattern that the standing fine root biomass reached a peak in January and fell to the lowest in July. Vertically, the fine root biomass decreased with the increase of soil depth, but this extinction rate decreased with stand development. The effects of stand age on either total fine root length and surface area, or specific root length were not significant. However, the root tissue density increased significantly with Chinese fir stand ages, which suggested that the fine roots on Chinese fir may resort more to the mycorrhizal associations for the nutrient and water acquisition in the later stage of Chinese fir plantations. In addition to the stand age effect, the fine roots exhibited highly spatial and temporal variations in Chinese plantations, indicating different root foraging strategies for soil nutrient and water acquisition. Therefore, the fine root research not only helps to understand its role in carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystem under global climate change, but can also improve our understanding of nutrient management in forest ecosystem. At the same time, the research on the productivity of the Chinese fir growth stage provides guiding significance for the construction and management of Chinese fir.

AB  - Fallow strips are promoted through agri-climate-environment schemes to enhance farmland biodiversity, but their effects on biodiversity-mediated ecosystem services remain poorly studied in different cropping systems. The effects of fallow strips on biological control of bird cherry-oat aphids in spring barley were examined in a field experiment in Finland in 2014-2016. Two types of sown perennial fallow strips - grass strip and wildflower strip - were compared. The relative efficiency of biological pest control was tested by monitoring the number of experimentally added aphids in the fallow strips and in the adjacent barley fields at different distances from the strips. Data were also collected on the densities of naturally occurring aphids and ground-dwelling natural enemies. The effects of the fallow strips differed between years. When aphid pressure was high, the proximity of the strips slowed the growth of aphid population. In the year of low aphid abundance, the fallow strips sustained more aphids than the adjacent barley fields, but did not constitute a risk for pest control. In the second and third years, especially wildflower strips supported high activity density of ground-dwelling predators. The activity densities were particularly high in the both fallow strip types in early summer, highlighting the role of the perennial strips as refuges for natural enemies. The results suggest that perennial fallow strips, and especially those sown with diverse wildflower mixtures, can promote pest control in spring cereals, thus contributing to ecological intensification in agriculture.

AB  - The tree species used in production forests can have direct implications for the understory vegetation, due to species-specific differences in the environmental conditions provided, and silviculture applied. In southern Sweden, there is an ongoing shift from even-aged managed stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) to even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies). Here we evaluate the potential ecological consequences of these conversions by surveying the understory vascular plants, stand structural characteristics, and associated understory light levels in three age categories of Scots pine and Norway spruce stands. We quantify the extent of difference in light transmittance between the two stand types, and find large differences in understory abundance, especially among the dwarf shrubs species. Whereas bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) generally dominated Scots pine stand understory, the understory of Norway spruce stands was comparably sparse. Differences in vascular plant community composition indicate associated differences between the two stand types in the conditions prior to stand establishment, and subsequent understory development. In Scots pine stands the high abundance of dwarf shrubs may be outcompeting other species of vascular plants, causing a decline in species richness. In Norway spruce stands, species richness and abundance was instead apparently inhibited by limited light transmittance. In these stands generalist ruderal species and remnants from previous land use constituted a considerable part of plant species composition. Our findings suggest that the regional replacement of Scots pine with Norway spruce will lead to a noticeable loss of understory diversity, for which the decline in Vaccinium species will be the most prominent. We discuss the associated implications of our results for forest ecosystem services, and how shortened rotation lengths in Norway spruce stands would compound these impacts.

AB  - In order to prevent irreversible impacts of climate change on the biosphere it is imperative to phase out the use of fossil fuels. Consequently, the provisioning of renewable resources such as timber and biomass from forests is an ecosystem service of increasing importance. However, risk factors such as changing disturbance regimes are challenging the continuous provisioning of ecosystem services, and are thus a key concern in forest management. We here used simulation modeling to study different risk management strategies in the context of timber production under changing climate and disturbance regimes, focusing on a 8127 ha forest landscape in the Northern Front Range of the Alps in Austria. We show that under a continuation of historical management, disturbances from wind and bark beetles increase by +39.5% on average over 200 years in response to future climate change. Promoting mixed forests and climate-adapted tree species as well as increasing management intensity effectively reduced future disturbance risk. Analyzing the spatial patterns of disturbance on the landscape, we found a highly uneven distribution of risk among stands (Gini coefficients up to 0.466), but also a spatially variable effectiveness of silvicultural risk reduction measures. This spatial variability in the contribution to and control of risk can be used to inform disturbance management: Stands which have a high leverage on overall risk and for which risks can effectively be reduced (24.4% of the stands in our simulations) should be a priority for risk mitigation measures. In contrast, management should embrace natural disturbances for their beneficial effects on biodiversity in areas which neither contribute strongly to landscape-scale risk nor respond positively to risk mitigation measures (16.9% of stands). We here illustrate how spatial heterogeneity in forest landscapes can be harnessed to address both positive and negative effects of changing natural disturbance regimes in ecosystem management.

AB  - Human induced land-use change through natural resource extraction has significant ecological, social and cultural effects for indigenous communities. Indigenous rights, cultural practices and identities are strongly interconnected with traditional lands. In northern Sweden, the cumulative effects from natural resource extraction have become increasingly problematic for Sami reindeer herding. Land use planning and permit processes are organized based on single projects or policy sectors, instead of the needs and rights involving reindeer herding. Existing research has demonstrated loss of ground and arboreal lichen, fragmentation of pastures and reindeer avoidance of otherwise valuable pastures due to disturbance caused by competing land uses. There is however a lack of synthesis of the amount and scale of encroachments on traditional Sami territories in Sweden so far. Likewise, while research has looked at weaknesses of the sectoral regulations in terms of cumulative impact assessment and the inadequate recognition of Sami reindeer herding rights, no studies have analyzed the meta-pressure caused by the fragmented planning regime as a whole, as the amount of regulations regarding different land use sectors and permitting processes increases with each new type of competing activity. Through the concept ofdouble pressurecaused by the inter-related processes of fragmented landscapes and fragmented 'planscapes', this study seeks to capture the actual pressure the affected communities are currently experiencing. Using multiple quantitative and qualitative data sets consisting of Geographical Information Systems, policy documents, workshops discussions and interviews, we study how natural resource extraction like mining and wind energy has increased on traditional indigenous Sami lands in northern Sweden. By expanding the analytical focus from today's landscapes to both planscapes and the pressure from not-yet realized future projects, our results highlight the need for a holistic understanding of the situation reindeer herding is facing, calling for more relevant and legitimate land use permitting and planning mechanisms to reduce the industrial pressure on the landscape, and to address the social injustices caused by today's planscape.

AB  - Although nature-based tourism is increasingly recognized in forest strategies, economic incentives for private landowners supporting the production of amenity values are largely lacking. This study focused on possibilities to enhance the scenic and recreational values of private forests for nature-based tourism in Finland. More specifically, we studied forest owners' attitudes towards - and willingness to participate in - a Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) initiative called Landscape and Recreation Value Trade. We also investigated the acceptability of forest management alternatives sustaining landscape qualities, the relative importance of different features of Landscape and Recreation Value Trade for landowners, and the magnitude of overall compensation claims of alternative Landscape and Recreation Value Trade models. A choice experiment survey was conducted in Kuusamo, a popular nature-based tourism destination, located in northeastern Finland. The results show that several forest owners were interested in the suggested scheme if economic losses were to be compensated. The landowners' preferences for Landscape and Recreation Value Trade were somewhat heterogeneous, suggesting that private forest owners in Kuusamo have rather diverse motivations and objectives for their ownership. Owners who stated to have scenic landscapes on their land, and those living outside Kuusamo area, were more willing to join in the suggested mechanism. In general, landowners' willingness to participate was strongly dependent on the amount of compensation as well as on other terms of the contract, such as the duration and severity of harvesting restrictions. The largest marginal compensation claims were related to long contract durations and the stringent "no harvesting at all" restriction. Given the heterogeneity in landowners' preferences, a Landscape and Recreation Value Trade model, offering flexibility to join the system, is needed to attract landowners of forests in hotspot locations for tourism that would help in designing a cost-efficient model for practical application.

AB  - Agriculture is the major land use at a global scale. In addition to food production, multifunctionality of landscapes, including values and ecosystem services like biodiversity, recreation and culture, is now focus for management. This study explores how a scenario approach, involving different stakeholders, may help to improve landscape management for biodiversity conservation. Local farmers and executives at the County Administrative Board were invited to discuss rural development and conditions for farmland biodiversity in two Swedish landscapes. The potential biodiversity for three future land use scenarios for the two landscapes was discussed: nature conservation, outdoor recreation and energy production, and compared with current and historical landscapes in each region.
   Analyses of habitat areas, connectedness and landscape diversity suggested that the energy and recreation scenarios had a negative impact on farmland biodiversity, whereas the nature conservation scenario, the current and historically reconstructed landscapes had a higher potential for biodiversity. The farmers appreciated the nature conservation scenario, but also the energy production scenario and they highlighted the need of increased subsidies for management of biodiversity. The farmers in the high production area were less interested in nature quality per se. The executives had similar opinions as the farmers, but disagreed on the advantages with energy production, as this would be in conflict with the high biodiversity and recreational values. The local physical and socio-economical conditions differ between landscapes and potentially shaped the stakeholders emotional attachment to the local environment, their opinions and decisions on how to manage the land. We stress the importance of incorporating local knowledge, visions and regional prerequisites for different land uses in conservation, since site and landscape specific planning for biodiversity together with a flexible subsidy system are necessary to reach the conservation goals within EU.

AB  - Quantifying green visual exposure is necessary to assess aesthetic, social and health benefits from urban greenery. Viewshed analysis has been successfully used to model and map green visual exposure from human perspective in continuous representation and in places where street view imagery for widely-used photography-based methods is not available. However, current viewshed-based methods for modelling green visual exposure are often difficult to generalise beyond their specific application purpose, inefficient in processing large spatial extents and have limited use due to demands on technical knowledge. This hampers their wider use in research and practice. In this paper, we develop a viewshed analysis-based method for modelling visual exposure to urban greenery with special focus on the method's applicability in research and practice. The method is implemented as a tool in GRASS GIS which makes it available as a practical and flexible tool. Extensive validation and assessment of the method on the specific case of urban trees confirm that the method is a highly accurate alternative to modelling visual exposure from street view imagery (rho = 0.96) but that data quality and viewshed para-metrisation are essential for achieving accurate results. Thanks to parallel processing and effective imple-mentation, the method is applicable for city-wide scale analysis with high-resolution data on commodity hardware (here illustrated on the case of Oslo, Norway). Therewith, the method has potential application in many areas including strategic tree planting, scenario modelling and urban ecosystem accounting, as well as ecosystem service research.

AB  - In many parts of Europe and North America, populations of large mammals and birds have recovered during recent decades. In Sweden, this has resulted in more wildlife than was historically recorded. This positive development provides a number of opportunities for ecosystem services and for biodiversity. More wildlife also means more interactions with humans, as many birds and mammals may interfere with human interests in the landscape, such as natural resource use. Thus, more wildlife may shift the baseline for societal perception of wildlife. Wildlife species may host pathogens with potential for infecting humans and domestic animals. With increasing knowledge about zoonotic diseases and their dynamics, more scientific, media, and public attention is given to zoonotic processes. We are concerned with how the public image of the wild animals is affected, because many of the recent zoonotic outbreaks connect animal groups to diseases such as avian and swine influenza, lyme disease, and tick-borne encephalitis. The societal focus on zoonotic diseases may increase the fear of the wild and will separate the public further from the outdoors in general and wildlife in particular. Ultimately, we risk a juxtaposition of the overall acceptance of biological diversity and a shifting societal perception of wildlife that could be harmful for life on earth. We therefore suggest multidisciplinary research on societal awareness of zoonotic diseases and its implications for public acceptance for wildlife and biological diversity.

AB  - Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a major threat for cultivated steep terrain, including vineyards that are typically established on hillslopes. Vineyards represent high-value cultivation in many countries; there is a tendency to adopt new and more intensive cultivation practices and/or to extend plantations to inappropriate sites, which influences the natural environment. Considerable damage thus increasingly affects vineyards in terms of partial or total destruction of cultivation, structures and infrastructures, as well as the surrounding landscape. However, little research has been conducted to date to investigate the role of grapevine plants on slope stability and to reduce the related impacts on the environment.
   Aiming to help fill the gap, we carried out a study to quantify the role of vineyards on slope stability by modelling the additional reinforcement to the soil provided by grapevine roots and their spatial distribution (i.e. considering the distance from the trunk) using the Root Bundle Model. A back analysis on a number of shallow landslides that occurred in vineyards was also conducted to validate the results. The area of our investigation was in the northeastern part of Oltrepo Pavese, Northern Italy, which is a hilly terrain cultivated for many decades with vineyards and prone to landslide phenomena that in recent years have caused great economic losses to the agricultural sector and damage to buildings and roads. Moreover, abandoned vineyards represent an issue in terms of their "return" to a natural state
   Values simulated by modelling and back-calculated from the landslide inventory completely agree and are in the range of reinforcements commonly obtained for many other species. However, in contrast to native species, the spatial variability of the reinforcement in the case of vineyards is lower because of the regularity of planting and the lack of differences in plant age. Additionally, the variability of the rooting depth is negligible because it is controlled by the rootstock.
   Finally, the results obtained in this work show that the models developed for native species can also be adopted for grapevines and, if coupled with a slope stability model, represent a basis for providing guidelines to design vineyard plantations in those areas susceptible to instability, to support decisions concerning land management and land use change and more generally to reduce environmental impacts.

AB  - The decline in farmland birds observed throughout Europe during recent decades has attracted much attention. Agricultural intensification or land abandonment are commonly forwarded as key drivers. Several countries have established agri-environmental schemes (AES) to counter these negative trends among farmland birds. This paper reports a study of the relationship between land use and bird species in the agricultural landscape of Norway. The main objective was to investigate the effect of spatial heterogeneity and diversity of land use on total richness and abundance of farmland birds at a national level. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of birds is part of the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes. The monitoring programme is based on mapping of 1 x 1 km squares distributed across the entire agricultural landscape. Within these squares permanent observation points are established for bird monitoring. Detailed interpretation of aerial photographs provides the land classification. We tested the relationship between landscape metrics at different levels of land type detail and species richness and abundance of farmland and non-farmland birds. There was a positive relationship between species richness and abundance of farmland birds and agricultural area. For non-farmland birds the relationship was negative. Spatial heterogeneity of land use was a significant positive factor for both farmland and non -farmland species. High land type diversity was positive for farmland bird richness, but negative for abundance. Non -farmland bird richness was not affected by land type diversity, but abundance had a negative response. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of a spatial heterogeneous landscape. However, we also found that land type diversity could negatively affect the abundance of both farmland and non -farmland birds. Our findings suggest a need for different management approaches depending on whether the aim is increased species richness or abundance. Achieving both aims with the same means might be difficult. We thus suggest a need for land use analyses before proper management strategies can be implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the article is to assess whether agricultural landscapes play a role in the perception of Norway held by tourists and residents. An additional aim is to analyse whether information accompanying images on social media indicate that the photographers have acknowledged the agricultural landscape. The authors used geotagged images uploaded to the image-sharing platform Flickr in their analyses. They selected photos from within the agricultural landscapes, inspected them, and categorized them according to extent and content. Additionally, they analysed the accompanying hashtags. The findings revealed that a large proportion of the photos contained agricultural landscapes, and thus confirmed the importance of the agricultural landscape for visual perception of and access to Norwegian landscapes. In addition, the lack of agricultural-related hashtags strengthened the authors' suspicions that this might not have been widely recognized by the photographers. Thus, while agricultural landscapes commonly are considered primarily as landscapes of food production, the authors conclude that these landscapes also fulfil other functions and that their contribution to the perception of Norway is important. Additionally, many of the landscape elements seen and analysed in the sample of photos are elements that play a role in providing cultural ecosystem services.

AB  - Five commercial tree species comprise nearly 80% of the forest standing stock volume in Western Europe. Nowadays, there is a strong need to consider a wider diversity of tree species, as evidenced by the impact of climate change and the forest health crises over the past decades. In this context, this study focuses on the potential of birch (Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.), a neglected indigenous species, for forestry and the forest-based industry sector. We have therefore compiled, analyzed, and discussed literature regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the species and the opportunities and threats of its use for this purpose. Among the strengths, birch tolerates various climates and sites, and high genetic variability promotes its adaptability. Birch improves forest resilience by colonizing forest gaps and quickly increasing soil functioning and biodiversity. Birch is also remarkably resistant to game overpopulation-associated damage. Large-sized logs are produced within relatively short periods with proper silvicultural treatment, and the wood characteristics allow versatile and valuable uses, as shown in Northern Europe. However, its weaknesses include high sensitivity to crown competition and to wood rot as challenges for silviculture. Among the opportunities, birch is well-suited to the global changes with its adaptability to climate change and its possible integration in diverse productive mixed tree stands. In the context of societal evolutions and customer perceptions, birch wood could play an increasing role in the building and furniture sectors, and among non-wood forest products. In Western Europe, the main obstacle to birch development is the lack of information on the wood uses and, consequently, the lack of interest among forest managers and wood processing professionals, which have led to a poor quality of the resource and to insufficient demand for its wood. Moreover, its fast height growth can affect the vitality of other species in mixed stands. Our analysis highlighted the potential of birch in the Western European forestry considering societal, ecological, and economic purposes in a changing climatic and socio-economic context and the need to (i) develop opportunities for industrial uses of birch wood, (ii) inform forest owners, managers, and industrial professionals about the potential value of birch, and (iii) define silvicultural guidelines.

AB  - Simple Summary The most important disturbances in European forests are windstorms and fire. In 2004, 12,000 ha of High Tatra Mts. (Slovakia) forests were seriously damaged by strong winds. Furthermore, in 2005 the area of 250 ha of not cleared forest from fallen wood biomass after windstorms was burned down. Our study brings an overview on the influences of irregular wind and fire disturbances and subsequently human activities upon the structure of thrips communities there, where eight study plots with different after-calamity management were chosen. There were two study plots that were affected by wind and subsequent management with the extraction of fallen wood biomass and influenced by fire that were characterized by low species richness. In comparison, not cleared habitats from fallen wood biomass with significantly higher species richness of thrips and higher values of diversity were characterized mainly by the presence of grass-living species Chirothrips manicatus and Limothrips denticornis. The meadow communities with longer development and higher values of diversity were inhabited by the species-rich community mainly with Thrips fuscipennis, T. brevicornis, T. flavus, and T. tabaci. Gradually, in the process of secondary succession these thrips assemblages will be probably replaced by the thrips of the shaded and long-term forests that are mainly composed of Oxythrips bicolor, O. ajugae, and Thrips pini. Strong winds, fire, and subsequent forest management impact arthropod communities. We monitored the diversity and changes in the community structure of forest thrips assemblages in the context of secondary succession and anthropogenic impact. There were eight study plots that were affected to varying degrees by the mentioned disturbances that were selected in the Central European spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests in Slovakia. The soil photoeclectors were used to obtain thrips in the study plots during two vegetation seasons. The thrips assemblages and their attributes were analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). The significant changes in community structure, composition, stratification, species richness, and diversity of thrips assemblages that were caused by natural- (wind) and human-induced disturbance (forestry and fire) were observed in our research. Our analyses revealed a clear relationship between different thrips assemblages and impacted environment. Moreover, our results indicate that silvicolous thrips species may be useful for indicating changes and disturbances in forest ecological systems.

AB  - Storms can turn a great proportion of forests' assimilation capacity into dead organic matter because of windthrow and thus its role as a carbon sink will be diminished for some time. However, little is known about the magnitude or extent to which storms affect carbon efflux. We compared soil CO2 fluxes in wind-thrown forest stands with different time periods since a storm event, and with different management practices (deadwood cleared or left on-site). This study examined changes in soil CO2 efflux in two windthrow areas in north-eastern Estonia and one area in north-western Latvia, which experienced severe wind storms in the summers of 2001, 2002 and 1967, respectively. We measured soil CO2 fluxes in stands formerly dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies L Karst.) with total and partial canopy destruction (all trees or roughly half of the trees in stand damaged by storm), in harvested areas (material removed after the wind storm) and in control areas (no damage by wind). Removal of wind-damaged material decreased instantaneous CO2 flux from the soil surface. The highest instantaneous fluxes were measured in areas with total and partial canopy destruction (0.67 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1) in both cases) compared with fluxes in the control areas (0.51 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)), in the new storm-damaged areas where the material was removed (0.57 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)) and in the old storm-damaged area where wood was left on site (0.55 g CO2 m(-2) h(-1)). The only factor affecting soil CO2 flux was location of the measuring collar (plastic collar with diameter 100 mm, height 50 mm) - either on undamaged forest ground or on the uprooted tree pit, where the mineral soil was exposed after disturbance. New wind-thrown stands where residues are left on site would most likely turn to sources of CO2 for several years until forest regeneration reaches to substantial assimilation rates. New wind-thrown stands where residues are left on site would most likely tend to have elevated CO2 fluxes for several years until forest regeneration reaches to substantial assimilation rates. However, forest managers might be concerned about the amounts of CO2 immediately released into the atmosphere if the harvested logs are burned. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs) are threatened habitats that host significant biodiversity and several ecosystem services, and depend on active management such as low-intensity grazing. The current study explores private landowners' decision-making on TRB management and abandonment within a social-ecological system framework. We provide insight into supporting resilience of TRB systems in the face of agricultural modernization. Using a mixed methods approach with content analysis and Q analysis, we demonstrate that TRB management fosters cultural, biological, aesthetic, and utilitarian values. These are reflected in different ways through conservationist's, profit-oriented farmer's, landscape manager's, and landscape admirer's discourses on TRB management. Overall, management reinforces landowners' place attachment, and reflects an approach to landscapes as spatial representations of cultural heritage and identity over multiple generations. Landowners consider TRB pasturage and its social-ecological outcomes motivating and rewarding. Giving up grazing cattle and perceived bureaucracy of national agri-environment scheme contribute to TRB abandonment. Landowners point out that current policies detach TRB management from what is seen as "regular agriculture", and the focus on monetary compensation bypasses the multiple values tied to TRB management. Based on our results, we suggest that promoting TRBs requires reconfiguring the current arrangement of remedial management payments and adopting a more participatory governance approach. Locally, resilience of TRB systems relies on the connections between landowners and landscapes that foster sense of place and landscape identity, which can be supported by knowledge sharing and collaborative grazing efforts among landowners.

AB  - Forest lands are used in increasingly plural ways and serve society with numerous benefits. This paper analyses the views of private forest owners and the general public in Sweden on the values of the forest. Two main dimensions were identified: preservation and recreation' values, reflecting ecological and social aspects; and production' values, reflecting economic aspects. While the general public emphasised the importance of forest uses which cater to ecological and social forest values more strongly compared to the forest owners, no significant difference was found concerning economic forest values. This suggests that while there is scope for contestation over forest land use, there is also some potential for common ground across stakeholder groups. These findings add to the body of knowledge of the views on the use of forest lands, and can inform forest related planning, management and policy development.

AB  - Life-cycle assessment is an established tool for industrial ecology. An analysis of the energy use in the chemical and other energy-intensive industries is still under discussion in this field. We argue that the concept of exergy can play a role in industrial ecology, using a recent Norwegian power production policy question as illustration. The question is whether to build a standard natural gas- or a hydrogen-fired gas-turbine combined-cycle power plant to meet increased needs for electricity in Norway. Several indicators are relevant for this discussion, and we calculate three based on exergy calculations, as proposed in the literature. The indicators are exergy renewability, exergy efficiency, and environmental compatibility. We show how these indicators can be used to evaluate paths for sustainable power production in two gas-fired combined-cycle power plants. We found that the two plants in question were equivalent, as judged by their exergy renewability and their environmental compatibility, but not by their exergy efficiency. This indicator favored the standard power plant, possibly in combination with carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in a depleted gas reservoir. The analysis suggested that the present situation for power production in gas-fired combined-cycle power plants is such that one may have to choose in general between power production with a high exergy efficiency, but low renewability indicator, or the opposite, low exergy efficiency and high renewability indicator. The general importance of exergy analysis was demonstrated by this example. It enables communication between different professional groups. The technological details, understood by the engineers, can be transposed to meaningful aggregated indicators for decision makers.

AB  - Northern ecosystems are experiencing rapid and large-scale changes driven by accelerated warming, which have profound effects on the terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity. A comprehensive understanding of the distribution of aquatic biodiversity of subarctic ecosystems is therefore needed to better predict future trajectories of their unique biodiversity. In this study, we examined the functional diversity of chironomid communities in subarctic lakes across a 1000 m-elevation gradient, reflecting gradual changes in temperature and landscape characteristics. Using fuzzy correspondence analyses, we investigated spatial variability in trait composition of chironomid communities from 100 lakes in northern Sweden, and tested the hypotheses that (1) climate directly and indirectly shapes chironomid trait composition across the studied gradient, and (2) that generalist taxa with smaller body size and broader food preferences are more able to persist in cold environments. Our results showed that complex interplays between direct (e.g. temperature) and indirect climate processes (e.g. elevation-driven changes in vegetation/habitats) affect the functional diversity of chironomid communities. Specifically, traits such as larval size, food preference and feeding habits were well separated along the gradient, and this pattern revealed that low elevation lakes with forested catchments tended to have more sediment-feeding taxa and larger larvae than those above the tree line. As expected, food resource availability in lakes is strongly linked to vegetation composition/cover, and traits related to resource exploitation in chironomid communities are therefore well constrained by landscape characteristics. Furthermore, our findings suggested that short life cycles could facilitate the development of viable population in northern and high-elevation lakes where the short ice-free period is a limiting factor, thus contradicting patterns showing smaller organisms in warmer environments reported for other invertebrates. As a consequence of climate warming, the highest elevation lakes in subarctic landscapes will likely lose their typical cold-adapted chironomid taxa along with their functional attributes leading to potential impacts on the food web structure and the overall functioning of northern lake ecosystems.

AB  - Introduction. This article reveals the research results of physical and chemical properties of the new filtering material, evaluation of its hydrophilic and oleophobic features as well as the efficiency of oil-in-water emulsions separation in laboratory conditions and in production. Methods and materials. As the base for creation of new filtering material a natural mixture of minerals with good prevalence of silicon earth also including some small amounts of fissile hydrous silicates (mica, clay) was chosen, which provide the durability of granulated end product at reservation of porosity and hydrophilic properties of the material surface. The research used spherical shape granules of various particle size obtained by drying, granulation and firing. Prior to filtration the granules are being impregnated with water aiming to obtain a water shell around each granule, which provides granules protection from oil and petrol products contamination as well as an easy filter cleaning by backwashing in fluidization mode.
   For the lab testing of oil-in-water emulsions separation parameters a test rig was built. In process a set of various tool methods of physical and chemical research was used. Results. The chemical and mineral composition of the developed filtering material and the results of its X-ray-structural analysis, photomicrography of ground substrate obtained with SEM are given as well as the porous structure data (pores size distribution and aggregate pores of granules material) obtained by the method of low-temperature nitrogen adsorption. The results of laboratory and pilot testing of separating and accumulating ability of the filtering material are presented. Interpretation. The obtained data prove the fact that the developed material possesses over the prominent hydrophilic properties, while after water shell creation also over the oleophobic properties. Upon exploration of the two liquid immiscible phases separation during the filtering through the granules obtained, a significant efficiency growth of the filter after attaining the special amount of oil and petrol products retained by the filter was detected. The efficiency increase of the filter is connected with formation of a prolonged structure, which was named by the authors a "fluid net", created by the oil and petrol products entrapped. The strings of that "fluid net" being formed in the gaps between the granules are decreasing the sizes of the passages which lets the entrapping efficiency of finer oil and petrol products droplets grow.
   Conclusion. The obtained nano-porous granules of the filtering material exhibit super- hydrophilic properties and based on the water shell created around them provide the following: protection of granules from contamination with oil and petrol products contained in water to be purified; effective and not decreasing over the course of time filter regeneration by means of backwashing in fluidization mode; quality of water purification from oil and petrol products at the level of the most expensive purification methods. Prospective fields of applications. The "OreFilter" technology developed has passed the pilot scale validation on the basis of more than fifty industrial objects of different industrial branches (mainly on those connected with oil production and oil refining) in Russia and abroad. The technology is now being tested on industrial objects in the Near East, Canada, US, Brazil and Australia. The industrial filtering units using "OreFilter" technology are already in operation on Russian enterprises as well as in Sweden and Germany. The experimental-industrial tests have proved the application efficiency of the technology developed: in food industry; at the detergents and soaps manufacturing plants; at mining and processing plants; at purification of ballast and bilge water at ports; at purification of polluted water after oil tankers washing; in fish farming; in seaquariums and dolphinariums.

AB  - A comprehensive European dataset on monthly atmospheric NH3, acid gases (HNO3, SO2, HCl), and aerosols (NHI, NO4+, SO42-, Cl-, Na+ Ca-2(+), Mg-2(+)) is presented and analysed. Speciated measurements were made with a low-volume denuder and filter pack method (DEnuder for Long-Term Atmospheric sampling, DELTA (R)) as part of the EU NitroEurope (NEU) integrated project. Altogether, there were 64 sites in 20 countries (2006-2010), coordinated between seven European laboratories. Bulk wet-deposition measurements were carried out at 16 co-located sites (2008-2010). Inter-comparisons of chemical analysis and DELTA (R) measurements allowed an assessment of comparability between laboratories.
   The form and concentrations of the different gas and aerosol components measured varied between individual sites and grouped sites according to country, European re- gions, and four main ecosystem types (crops, grassland, forests, and semi-natural). The smallest concentrations (with the exception of SO42- and Na+) were in northern Europe (Scandinavia), with broad elevations of all components across other regions. SO2 concentrations were highest in central and eastern Europe, with larger SO2 emissions, but particulate SO42- concentrations were more homogeneous between regions. Gas-phase NH3 was the most abundant single measured component at the majority of sites, with the largest variability in concentrations across the network. The largest concentrations of NH3, NH4+, and NO3- were at cropland sites in intensively managed agricultural areas (e.g. Borgo Cioffi in Italy), and the smallest were at remote semi-natural and forest sites (e.g. Lompolojankka, Finland), highlighting the potential for NH3 to drive the formation of both NH4+ and NO3- aerosol. In the aerosol phase, NH4+ was highly cone-lated with both NO3- and SO42-, with a near-1 : 1 relationship between the equivalent concentrations of NH4+ and sum (NO3-+ SO42-), of which around 60 % was as NH4NO3.
   Distinct seasonality was also observed in the data, influenced by changes in emissions, chemical interactions, and the influence of meteorology on partitioning between the main inorganic gases and aerosol species. Springtime maxima in NH3 were attributed to the main period of manure spreading, while the peak in summer and trough in winter were linked to the influence of temperature and rainfall on emissions, deposition, and gas-aerosol-phase equilibrium. Seasonality in SO2 was mainly driven by emissions (combustion), with concentrations peaking in winter, except in southern Europe, where the peak occurred in summer. Particulate SO42- showed large peaks in concentrations in summer in southern and eastern Europe, contrasting with much smaller peaks occurring in early spring in other regions. The peaks in particulate SO42- coincided with peaks in NH3 concentrations, attributed to the formation of the stable (NH4)(2)SO4. HNO3 concentrations were more complex, related to traffic and industrial emissions, photochemistry, and HNO3:NH4NO3 partitioning. While HNO3 concentrations were seen to peak in the summer in eastern and southern Europe (increased photochemistry), the absence of a spring peak in HNO3 in all regions may be explained by the depletion of HNO3 through reaction with surplus NH3 to form the semi-volatile aerosol NH4NO3. Cooler, wetter conditions in early spring favour the formation and persistence of NH4NO3 in the aerosol phase, consistent with the higher springtime concentrations of NH4+ and NO3-. The seasonal profile of NO3- was mirrored by NH4+, illustrating the influence of gas-aerosol partitioning of NH4NO3 in the seasonality of these components.
   Gas-phase NH3 and aerosol NH4NO3 were the dominant species in the total inorganic gas and aerosol species measured in the NEU network. With the current and projected trends in SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions, concentrations of NH3 and NH4NO3 can be expected to continue to dominate the inorganic pollution load over the next decades, especially NH3, which is linked to substantial exceedances of ecological thresholds across Europe. The shift from (NH4)(2)SO4 to an atmosphere more abundant in NH4NO3 is expected to maintain a larger fraction of reactive N in the gas phase by partitioning to NH3 and HNO3 in warm weather, while NH4NO3 continues to contribute to exceedances of air quality limits for PM2.5.

AB  - Preserving biodiversity and establishing healthy and thriving populations of predator animals are the expressed aims of many wildlife and ecosystem conservation projects and initiatives. However, such conservation strategies are often in conflict with the traditions, practices and land-use priorities of local communities. This article concentrates on the situation concerning the predation of reindeer (mainly by wolves) in Finland's southeast reindeer herding area and its immediate vicinity, but makes reference to the broader situation of predation and reindeer herding in Finland. Based on analysis of statistics and interviews with local stakeholders, the research findings refer to the intermingled contradictions related to conceptual, statistical and other management relevant knowledge and resulting problems, for example, in conservation hunting licensing. The article concludes that the wolf comprises a complex case for nature conservation initiatives and sustainable reindeer husbandry and that, in practice, it has particular implications compared to other policy approaches to dealing with the problem of animal predators. The article ends with some theoretical considerations as to whether we can improve our understanding of modern human-environment relations by deriving ideas from the actor-network theory debates.

AB  - Globally, boreal forests cover 33 percent of Earth's forested area, constitute the largest terrestrial carbon source, and house an important biodiversity of forest-dependent species, many of which are saproxylic taxa reliant on a wide variety of dead wood. This dead wood is most prevalent in old-growth forest, yet intensive management means that little old growth is left, and the remaining forests rarely attain the necessary age and structure to resemble these original forests. There is increasing recognition, however, that forests that have not been subjected to modern, stand-replacing harvest methods (like clear-cutting), and in which management activities are no longer occurring, may be able to provide habitat similar to old-growth forest for many species (older mean age, higher deadwood volumes, and more age-class heterogeneity). These are called 'near-natural' forests.
   We use linear mixed models and redundancy analysis (RDA) to compare beetle species richness and community composition using a large, mixed data set, containing more than one third of all beetle species known from Norway, from window trap records in three types of forest: intensively managed mature stands, recent clear-cuts, and 'near-natural forests'.
   Even though location, study substrate and other sampling details vary substantially between sites, the signal from management still comes out as a significant factor explaining the patterns on beetle diversity. We find that species richness of saproxylic, natural-forest indicator, and red-listed beetle species is higher in both near-natural forests and recent clear-cuts than in managed mature forests. Community composition also differs significantly between the three forest types, and these differences are correlated with forest age and volume at the landscape (1 km radius) level.
   These findings provide support for the idea that near-natural forests provide habitats that are distinct from those in managed forests and which are important for species of conservation concern. Clear-cuts briefly harbor some of these same species, probably due to the sun-exposed coarse woody debris (CWD) that is available immediately after felling, but this effect is transient. Conservation of existing near-natural forests, many of which are currently without legal protection, should therefore be prioritized.

AB  - CO2 mineral sequestration is one method of the CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation and storage) portfolio, and work on stepwise carbonation of serpentinites (serpentine-rich rock, 3MgO center dot 2SiO(2)center dot 2H(2)O) in Finland has resulted in what is known as "the angstrom A (angstrom bo Akademi) route". This involves extraction of magnesium from rock using ammonium sulphate salt, precipitation of magnesium hydroxide and finally carbonation in a high temperature pressurised fluidised bed. Besides magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) significant amounts of iron (hydr)oxides are produced. Disadvantages are the complexity and exergy consumption associated with alternating (hot/cold/hot) treatment conditions. Therefore, an alternative AA route has been developed that, like the conventional route, can operate directly on flue gas. Here, the final carbonation step is accomplished in an aqueous solution. Products are magnesium (hydrocarbonates), hydromagnesite (4MgCO(3)center dot Mg(OH)(2)), besides iron (hydr)oxides. Early results obtained with this route method are reported, along with a comparison (using process simulation) of the both routes, operating on flue gas from: 1) a lime kiln and 2) a natural gas fired power, addressing the external heat and power input requirements. It was found that conversion levels and rates are similar for the two routes, although excess NH3 may be needed to establish the working pH for hydromagnesite precipitation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding how drivers of change affect ecosystem services (ES) is of great importance. Indicators of ES can be developed based on biophysical measures and be used to investigate the service flow from ecosystems to socio-ecological systems. However, the ES concept is multivariate and the use of normalized composite indicators reduces complexity and facilitates communication between science and policy. The aim of this study is to analyze how land use change affects ES and species richness and how the effects are modified by environmental factors by using composite indicators based on biophysical indicators. Using multivariate and regression analyses, we analyze the effect of grazing management abandonment in semi-natural grasslands in Norway on six ES: nutrient cycling, pollination, forage quality, aesthetics and global and regional climate regulation in addition to species richness along soil and climate gradients. Nutrient cycling, forage quality, regional climate regulation, aesthetics and species richness are larger in managed compared to abandoned grasslands. There are trade-offs among ES as different management strategies provide various ES and these trade-offs vary along environmental gradients. Management policies that aim to conserve ES need to have conservation goals that are context dependent, should recognize ES trade-offs and be adapted to local conditions.

AB  - Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) have been suggested to harmonize biodiversity monitoring worldwide. Their aim is to provide a small but comprehensive set of monitoring variables that would give a balanced picture of the development of biodiversity and the reaching of international and national biodiversity targets. Globally, GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) has suggested 22 candidate EBVs to be monitored. In this article we regard EBVs as a conceptual tool that may help in making national scale biodiversity monitoring more robust by pointing out where to focus further development resources. We look at one country-Finland-with a relatively advanced biodiversity monitoring scheme and study how well Finland's current biodiversity state indicators correspond with EBVs. In particular, we look at how national biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using available remote sensing (RS) applications. Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution (VHR) open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring the state of biodiversity and ecosystems at low cost. In Finland, several RS applications already exist that could be expanded into national indicators. These include the monitoring of shore habitats and water quality parameters, among others. We hope that our analysis and examples help other countries with similar challenges. Along with RS opportunities, our analysis revealed also some needs to develop the EBV framework itself.

AB  - Quantification of fine root biomass is needed for estimating the role of roots as carbon (C) stores and sources of C input into the soil, as well as for modelling of forest nutrient cycling. Due to the laborious nature of root biomass determinations, there is a need to develop indirect methods that would allow fine root biomass to be estimated using data on easily measurable stand and site variables. We developed models for estimating tree fine root (diameter <= 2 mm) biomass of boreal forests by compiling data from 95 Finnish forest stands (55 on upland soils and 40 on drained peatlands). Stand basal area predicted fine root biomass (R-2-adj. = 0.35, p < 0.001) better than any other stand variable alone. A model that included stand basal area, dominant tree species group [birch/other], soil type [upland soil/drained peatland], temperature sum and the interaction of soil type and temperature sum accounted for 46% of the variation in fine root biomass. Stand basal area, the C:N ratio of the organic layer or upper 0-20 cm peat layer and the dominant tree species group together explained 45% of the variation in fine root biomass. Temperature sum correlated with fine root biomass in opposite ways in upland soils and in drained peatlands: fine root biomass increased with decreasing temperature sum in upland soil sites, whereas in peatlands fine root biomass decreased as the temperature sum decreased. Although the models were based on a large dataset representing well the variation in stand age, basal area, site fertility and climatic conditions in northern European boreal forests, half of the variation in fine root biomass remained unexplained. More comprehensive fine root biomass sampling in relation to spatial and temporal variation in the forthcoming studies, for example in connection with monitoring campaigns, and additional predictors such as soil texture, successional stage and the fine root biomass of ground vegetation might improve the predictive power of fine root biomass models.

AB  - Proposed European policy in the agricultural sector will place higher emphasis on soil organic carbon (SOC), both as an indicator of soil quality and as a means to offset CO2 emissions through soil carbon (C) sequestration. Despite detailed national SOC data sets in several European Union (EU) Member States, a consistent C stock estimation at EU scale remains problematic. Data are often not directly comparable, different methods have been used to obtain values (e.g. sampling, laboratory analysis) and access may be restricted. Therefore, any evolution of EU policies on C accounting and sequestration may be constrained by a lack of an accurate SOC estimation and the availability of tools to carry out scenario analysis, especially for agricultural soils. In this context, a comprehensive model platform was established at a pan-European scale (EU+Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) using the agro-ecosystem SOC model CENTURY. Almost 164000 combinations of soil-climate-land use were computed, including the main arable crops, orchards and pasture. The model was implemented with the main management practices (e.g. irrigation, mineral and organic fertilization, tillage) derived from official statistics. The model results were tested against inventories from the European Environment and Observation Network (EIONET) and approximately 20000 soil samples from the 2009 LUCAS survey, a monitoring project aiming at producing the first coherent, comprehensive and harmonized top-soil data set of the EU based on harmonized sampling and analytical methods. The CENTURY model estimation of the current 0-30cm SOC stock of agricultural soils was 17.63Gt; the model uncertainty estimation was below 36% in half of the NUTS2 regions considered. The model predicted an overall increase of this pool according to different climate-emission scenarios up to 2100, with C loss in the south and east of the area (involving 30% of the whole simulated agricultural land) compensated by a gain in central and northern regions. Generally, higher soil respiration was offset by higher C input as a consequence of increased CO2 atmospheric concentration and favourable crop growing conditions, especially in northern Europe. Considering the importance of SOC in future EU policies, this platform of simulation appears to be a very promising tool to orient future policymaking decisions.

AB  - Modeling pollination ecosystem services requires a spatially explicit, process-based approach because they depend on both the behavioral responses of pollinators to the amount and spatial arrangement of habitat and on the within- and between-season dynamics of pollinator populations in response to land use. We describe a novel pollinator model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops. Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models. Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as large-scale management intervention and policy assessment.

AB  - Habitat loss through land-use change is the most pressing threat to biodiversity worldwide. European semi-natural grasslands have suffered an ongoing decline since the early twentieth century, but we have limited knowledge of how grassland loss has affected biodiversity across large spatial scales. We quantify land-use change over 50-70 years across a 175,000 km(2) super-region in southern Sweden, identifying a widespread loss of open cover and a homogenisation of landscape structure, although these patterns vary considerably depending on the historical composition of the landscape. Analysing species inventories from 46,796 semi-natural grasslands, our results indicate that habitat loss and degradation have resulted in a decline in grassland specialist plant species. Local factors are the best predictors of specialist richness, but the historical landscape predicts present-day richness better than the contemporary landscape. This supports the widespread existence of time-lagged biodiversity responses, indicating that further species losses could occur in the future.

AB  - This paper presents an application of an indirect method, the alternative or replacement cost method to value a regulatory ecosystem service: the retention of river nutrient loads by floodplain wetlands. The paper presents a cost-minimisation model for nutrient abatement measures for the River Elbe. The model is applied to estimate the shadow price of phosphate and nitrogen nutrient retention services by restored floodplains. It is shown that the shadow price of restored floodplain area is a function of the nutrient load reduction target for the river basin. The scope of the floodplain restoration projects is shown to have a lesser impact on the estimated shadow price.
   In addition, this paper presents an empirical cost function for the costs of floodplain restoration measures in the Elbe Basin. In conjunction with the shadow prices, this allows for a rapid strategic assessment of the costs and benefits of 45 potential restoration sites along the Elbe trajectory. In spite of the large investment costs for dike realignments, the nutrient retention effects alone may in many cases generate sufficient benefits to generate an economic efficiency gain. Floodplain restoration may therefore, under advantageous circumstances, constitute a cost effective nutrient abatement measure. However the key thrust of the argument is that floodplain restoration projects have to be assessed as multifunctional projects, with the positive impacts on water quality being one of several benefit dimensions.

AB  - One-fourth of the global soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in the boreal region, where climate change is predicted to be faster than the global average. Planetary warming is accelerated if climate change promotes SOC release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. However, the soil carbon-climate feedbacks have been poorly confirmed by SOC measurements despite their importance on global climate. In this study, we used data collected as part of the Finnish arable soil monitoring program to study the influence of climate change, management practices, and historical land use on changes in SOC content using a Bayesian approach. Topsoil samples (n = 385) collected nationwide in 2009 and 2018 showed that SOC content has decreased at the rate of 0.35% year(-1) on average. Based on the Bayesian modeling of our data, we can say with a certainty of 79%-91% that increase in summertime (May-Sep) temperature has resulted in SOC loss while increased precipitation has resulted in SOC loss with a certainty of 90%-97%. The exact percentages depend on the climate dataset used. Historical land use was found to influence the SOC content for decades after conversion to cropland. Former organic soils with a high SOC-to-fine-fraction ratio were prone to high SOC loss. In fields with long cultivation history (>100 years), however, the SOC-to-fine-fraction ratio had stabilized to approximately 0.03-0.04 and the changes in SOC content leveled off. Our results showed that, although arable SOC sequestration can be promoted by diversifying crop rotations and by cultivating perennial grasses, it is unlikely that improved management practices are sufficient to counterbalance the climate change-induced SOC losses in boreal conditions. This underlines the importance of the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to avoid the acceleration of planetary warming.

AB  - The soil structure near the surface of agricultural soils changes with season mainly by land management together with climatic and biological factors. Quantitative analysis of post-tillage changes in soil structure and related hydraulic properties are necessary for evaluating and improving models of soil hydrological and transport processes. The objectives of this study were to quantify changes in soil seedbed structure induced by rainfall and drainage and to estimate the eff ;ects of soil texture and SOC on these changes. We collected samples from the harrowed layer of twenty-six fine to coarse textured Swedish mineral soils. Air-dried soil was placed in cylinders (5 cm high, diameter 5 cm) and exposed to simulated rainfall (5 mm h(-1) for 4 h) and drainage (-50 cm pressure potential) cycles in the laboratory. We used X-ray tomography to quantify changes in pore networks in a thin surface layer and in the whole cylinder. Infiltration rates at-5 cm pressure potential were measured using a mini disc tension infiltrometer on replicate air-dried samples and on the samples included in the consolidation experiments at the final state. Total imaged specific pore volumes generally decreased from initial to final state and pore size distributions were shifted towards larger proportions of below image resolution pores (< 80 mu m). There was a strong positive correlation between clay content and changes (i.e. final state-initial state) in the specific volume of pores <80 mu m. Soils with high clay content and soil organic carbon (SOC) content often have strong aggregates that resist changes. Nevertheless, both clay and SOC contents were negatively correlated with the changes in specific imaged pore volume. These results highlight the importance of swelling, which is largely controlled by clay content, for seedbed consolidation. In line with previous studies, when excluding coarse textured soil, the changes in surface porosity were negatively correlated with silt content. Changes in infiltration capacity were not significantly correlated with any basic soil properties. Our results suggest that shrinking swelling should be a central part in any model for seedbed consolidation.

AB  - Reindeer herding involves hard physical work carried out in a cold climate under variable weather conditions. In the fall and winter, herders' work in northern Finland includes collecting and moving reindeer herds to round-up sites, working in round-ups, slaughtering and processing meat as well as daily feeding and monitoring of the animals in the field. To study the experiences and perceptions of coping with cold among physically active herders in harsh winter conditions, we interviewed 22 herders from six herding districts of the central reindeer management area within the north boreal coniferous forest zone. We focused on behavioral and cultural strategies that accompany the physiological cold adaptations. Semi-structured interviews revealed that the main behavioral and cultural strategies used by herders to successfully carry out their duties while avoiding cold-related injury include clothing, physical activity, nutrition, and shelter as well as protecting vehicles and devices. Herders across sex, age, and herding district reported using modern layered clothing developed for extreme conditions, often combined with traditional footwear and clothes made of reindeer fur or woollen fabric. In addition, herders increase their physical activity; eat warm, energy-rich foods; make fires; stay overnight or take breaks in a house or a cabin, a car, or other protected places to reduce exposure to the harsh environment. Coping with extreme conditions not only requires flexibility, preparedness, and innovation from the herders but also thoughtful caution when approaching and managing unexpected situations. We conclude that modernization of reindeer husbandry, climate change, and rapidly increasing land use competition not only drive herders to modify their behavioral and cultural coping mechanisms for extreme weather conditions but may also create new, unexpected vulnerabilities.

AB  - Designing green infrastructure in cities requires vegetation that has multiple outcomes and functions, particularly using plants that have both attractive visual or aesthetic features and high biodiversity values. Plantings that have high visual appeal are more highly valued by people and increase their feeling of wellbeing. Increasing biodiversity in cities is one of the major challenges facing urban planning and design. However, balancing biodiversity and aesthetic outcomes in urban planting design is complex, and to date there are few methods that can be used to guide plant selection. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the use of a colour theory framework for planting arrangements to see if we could design vegetation that is highly aesthetic and has high biodiversity. We did this by configuring planting combinations for living walls in Malmo, Sweden, using principles based on Johannes Itten's colour theories. The plant combinations on each wall were graphically arranged using (1) colour analysis of each plant and (2) design of the plant species into two colour schemes: light-dark colour concept and a complementary colour concept. For each species used in the compositions we created a biodiversity classification, based on its pollination value, "nativeness" and conservation value as a cultivar; and a plant visual quality classification, based on the performance from living walls studies. The graphical colour composition and interlinked biodiversity value were then compared to designs created with randomly selected plant species. The results showed that it is possible to design a living wall based on colour theory without compromising with biodiversity outcomes, namely species richness, pollination and the nativeness of the species. The results also indicate the potential application of this design approach to deliver greater aesthetic appreciation and enjoyment from plantings. While more work is needed, this study has shown that a theoretical colour framework can be a useful tool in designing green infrastructure to improve delivery of both cultural and regulatory ecosystem services.

AB  - The species composition within communities is highly dependent on the rate of species immigration and whether immigrating species possess the functional traits required by the prevailing environmental conditions. Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals. Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However, disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46 communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation, that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift, that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential driver of community composition were compared with those expected under a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent. Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and interconnected communities have a higher probability of including regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare species.

AB  - Sustainable forest management increasingly favors mixtures, but effects on many ecosystem characteristics, such as biocontrol by predators and their biodiversity, are still not well understood. This knowledge gap can be particularly problematic when these mixtures include non-native tree species, such as Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), which are planted because of their high growth rates and climatic suitability but might have negative effects on forest biota. Available studies have mostly focused on epigeic communities, even though tree-associated predator communities can be assumed to make an important contribution to biocontrol that differs significantly from conditions on the forest floor.
   Here, we analyzed the responses of spiders, as generalist arboreal predators, along a tree species richness gradient in a young tree diversity experiment in Thuringia, Germany, utilizing four of the most economically important deciduous and coniferous tree species in Europe: European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), Douglas fir and sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.), planted in stands of 1-4 tree species. We tested for effects of tree species richness, tree identity and composition (tree species proportion and position of individual trees) on arboreal spider species richness, functional diversity, abundance, biomass and community structure at both the tree and plot level.
   Tree species richness promoted arboreal spider species richness and functional richness at the plot level and community-weighted mean spider biomass at the tree level. Tree identity and composition had a stronger influence than tree species richness on structuring spider communities, with arboreal spiders having higher numbers per tree on conifers, especially on Douglas fir. However, at the plot level spider species richness, abundance and biomass decreased with an increasing proportion of conifers due to lower species turnover among coniferous trees. The observed effects of tree species richness, tree identity and tree species proportions early in the establishment of forest stands might influence the strength of top-down control of herbivores in critical stages of development of forest stands. Tree species selection and the proportion in which these trees are mixed with other species should be determined with care in order to concomitantly promote biodiversity and biocontrol. In this context, an important finding of our analyses is that potentially negative effects of non-native Douglas fir on arboreal arthropods were not more severe than effects of native conifers that are planted outside of their natural habitats.

AB  - We analyze the role of urban green areas managed by local user groups in their potential for supporting biodiversity and ecosystem services in growing city-regions, with focus on allotment areas, domestic gardens, and golf courses. Using Stockholm, Sweden, as an example city-region, we compile GIS data of its spatial characteristics and relate these data to GIS data for protected areas and "green wedges" prioritized in biodiversity conservation. Results reveal that the three land uses cover 18% of the studied land area of metropolitan Stockholm, which corresponds to more than twice the land set aside as protected areas. We review the literature to identify ecosystem functions and services provided by the three green areas and discuss their potential in urban ecosystem management. We conclude that the incorporation of locally managed lands, and their stewards and institutions, into comanagement designs holds potential for improving conditions for urban biodiversity, reducing transaction costs in ecosystem management, and realizing local Agenda 21.

AB  - One of the most effective nature conservation measures is the creation of territories where human impact is limited, this is called specially protected natural areas. A significant contribution to increasing the area of the Russian Federation covered by protected areas was made by the creation of the State Nature Reserve in the Leningrad Region, known as the "East of the Gulf of Finland". Initially, the reserve was supposed to include the island of Gogland (but it is now not part of the protected area). The locked status of the island, its remoteness from the coast, and the harsh features of the Gulf of Finland have contributed to the transformation of Gogland into a kind of open-air "museum". The biological diversity of the island is closely connected with edaphic diversity, as soil is a natural habitat for a huge variety of living organisms. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to assess the edaphic potential of the island of Gogland, a territory that has existed for a long time with an extremely weak anthropogenic impact, in order to assess the ecosystem services of the island as one of the approaches to taking effective measures for nature protection. Data on chemical soil characteristics are discussed, as well as current soil pollution processes of these remote areas by trace elements. Edaphic studies carried out showed that the soil cover of the island of Gogland is characterized by sufficient diversity, the presence of soils at initial stages of development, soils with a fully developed differentiated profile with a pronounced eluvial process-eluvozems and various podzols, as well as the rarest, organogenic soils-bog, and bog-gley soils. The pH(H2O) of the studied soils on Gogland is characterized by a strongly acidic to weakly acidic reaction.

AB  - Loss of forest naturalness challenges the maintenance of green infrastructure (GI) for biodiversity conservation and delivery of diverse ecosystem services. Using the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi target #11 with its quantitative and qualitative criteria as a normative model, we aim at supporting landscape planning through a pioneering assessment of the extent to which existing amounts and spatial distributions of High Conservation Value Forests (HCVFs) meet these criteria. Highly forested and committed to both intensive wood production and evidence-based conservation targets of 17-20% protected areas, Sweden was chosen as a case study. Specifically, we estimated the amount, regional representation, and functional connectivity of HCVF patches using virtual bird species, validated the results using field surveys of focal bird species, and assessed conservation target fulfilment. Finally, we linked these results to the regional distribution of forest land ownership categories, and stress that these provide different opportunities for landscape planning. Even if 31% of forest land in Sweden is officially protected, voluntarily set-aside, or not used for wood production now and in the future, we show that applying the representation and connectivity criteria of Aichi target #11 reduces this figure to an effective GI of 12%. When disaggregating the five ecoregions the effective GI was 54% for the sub-alpine forest ecoregion, which hosts EU's last intact forest landscapes, but only 3-8% in the other four ecoregions where wood production is predominant. This results in an increasing need for forest habitat and landscape restoration from north to south. The large regional variation in the opportunity for landscape planning stresses the need for a portfolio of different approaches. We stress the need to secure funding mechanisms for compensating land owners' investments in GI, and to adapt both the approaches and spatial extents of landscape planning units to land ownership structure.

AB  - Tree growth resources and the efficiency of resource-use for biomass production determine the productivity of forest ecosystems. In nutrient-limited forests, nitrogen (N)-fertilization increases foliage [NI, which may increase photosynthetic rates, leaf area index (L), and thus light interception (I-C). The product of such changes is a higher gross primary production and higher net primary production (NPP). However, fertilization may also alter carbohydrate partitioning from below- to aboveground, increasing aboveground NPP (ANPP). We analyzed effects of long-term N-fertilization on NPP, and that of long-term carbon storing organs (NPPs) in a Pinus sylvestris forest on sandy soil, a wide-ranging forest type in the boreal region. We based our analyses on a combination of destructive harvesting, consecutive mensuration, and optical measurements of canopy openness. After eight-year fertilization with a total of 70 g N m(-2), ANPP was 27 +/- 7% higher in the fertilized (F) relative to the reference (R) stand, but although L increased relative to its pre-fertilization values, I-C was not greater than in R. On the seventh year after the treatment initiation, the increase of ANPP was matched by the decrease of belowground NPP (78 vs. 92 g C m(-2) yr(-1); similar to 17% of NPP) and, given the similarity of I-C, suggests that the main effect of N-fertilization was changed carbon partitioning rather than increased canopy photosynthesis. Annual NPPs increased linearly with growing season temperature (T) in both treatments, with an upward shift of 70.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1) by fertilization, which also caused greater amount of unexplained variation (r(2) = 0.53 in R, 0.21 in F). Residuals of the NPPs-T relationship of F were related to growing season precipitation (P, r(2) = 0.48), indicating that T constrains productivity at this site regardless of fertility, while P is important in determining productivity where N-limitation is alleviated. We estimated that, in a growing season average T (11.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C; 33-year-mean), NPPs response to N-fertilization will be nullified with P 31 mm less than the mean (325 +/- 85 mm), and would double with P '109 mm greater than the mean. These results suggest that inter-annual variation in climate, particularly in P, may help explaining the reported large variability in growth responses to fertilization of pine stands on sandy soils. Furthermore, forest management of long-rotation systems, such as those of boreal and northern temperate forests, must consider the efficiency of fertilization in terms of wood production in the context of changes in climate predicted for the region.

AB  - Background: Modern water management strategies aim to assess the impact of water regulation alternatives on all relevant ecosystem services, including white water (WW) recreation. Therefore it is important to estimate the optimum kayak flow range for river reaches that are potentially relevant for WW kayaking. Methods: We used the grade V run of the Teigdalselva River as an example and compared the results of three different approaches: (i) a hydro-morphological analysis of kayak runs using public data sources; (ii) a citizen science method that is based on photos and videos of kayak-activities on the web; and, (iii) interviews with elite kayakers. Results: For the hydro-morphological analysis, we found that some optimal flow ranges for WW kayak could be estimated based on empirical regional regression as a function of the natural mean flow and the geomorphic run type. The interviewed kayakers suggested a wider range of optimal flows, in particular, higher maxima. The test of the citizen science approach provided flows that ranged in the middle of the estimates made by the two other approaches for prescribing optimum kayak flow ranges. Conclusions: We recommend a combination of different methods for water management studies that are related to flow requirements for white water kayak. Estimations based on the empirical regression functions should be always complemented by at least one other approach.

AB  - Climate change will cause alterations in tree species ranges. Non-native tree species are likely to be increasingly used in production forests, due to their often better adaptation to a warmer climate and their lower susceptibility to pests and pathogens. Trees form an important habitat for numerous species, many of which are more or less specialised regarding tree species. Thus, the tree-associated flora and fauna may be heavily impacted if nonnative trees replace native ones. Risk assessments from the introduction of non-native trees must rest on a solid knowledge base, including insights into the potential of such trees to function as biodiversity substitutes, i. e. to host similar biodiversity as closely related native tree species. In a study in temperate Sweden, we inventoried epiphytic lichens and bryophytes on ten random trees in each of 28 stands (14 stands of North American red oak Quercus rubra and 14 stands of native oak Q. robur/petraea), to compare species richness and composition. Overall, 101 lichen taxa and 35 bryophyte taxa were identified, and we found a generally higher diversity for native oak. The regional species richness (gamma diversity) for both lichens and bryophytes was higher in native oak than in red oak, and the lichen species richness at stand level (alpha diversity) was nearly significantly higher. Lichen composition differed between the two oak species, while there was no difference for bryophytes. More lichens were strongly associated with native oak than red oak, while most bryophyte species were generalists with no specific preference for either oak taxa. Bark structure was an important explanatory variable separating the lichen epiphytes, with species preferring smooth bark largely confined to red oak. In conclusion, our study suggests that substituting native oak with red oak could have adverse consequences for epiphytic lichen populations associated with native oak, resulting in a decline of several species. However, certain lichen and bryophyte species were exclusively found on Q. rubra, implying that incorporating a proportion of red oak stands in southern Swedish landscapes may enhance diversity. Further research is needed to explore the overlap between species associated with Q. rubra and other deciduous tree species that possess similar smooth bark. Our findings indicate that red oak may not be an appropriate alternative host tree for epiphytic lichens typically found on native oak, while the implications for bryophytes remain less clear.

AB  - It is well known that both built and natural landscape features contribute to recreational values of forests. Insights on visual preferences and visitor behaviour are used to meet societal demands for outdoor recreation in forests. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the hierarchy of importance of landscape features that characterise the surroundings of recreational routes for explaining activity-specific use intensity. Furthermore, urban forest managers lack reliable spatial information on which areas are most intensively used for recreation. Therefore, using Public Participation GIS (PPGIS), we invited residents of three densely populated regions in Germany's Southwest to map their recreational routes in urban forests and report the respective type of activity. Overall, 1136 respondents participated in our study and mapped 2468 routes. We identified two main user groups - cyclists and pedestrians - and created maps that visualise their use intensity. We found recreational use intensity patterns differ for both the three study areas and type of activity. We used linear mixed effects models to identify the contribution of landscape features to overall, cyclists', and pedestrians' use intensity. Therefore, we measured area sizes of forest structural attributes, natural area features, and human-made infrastructure for each surrounding area of mapped routes (defined by a 50 m radius). For each mapped route, we calculated the total length of other routes that were within its surrounding area to operationalise recreational use intensity. Results showed that water bodies, broadleaved dominated stands, and unique structural compositions (represented by protected habitats) were among the most important landscape features that explained overall, cyclists', and pedestrians' use intensity. We found differences in the importance of landscape features for use intensities between cyclists and pedestrians. Our findings add to previous research since we present a hierarchy of importance of 14 landscape features for explaining residents' self-mapped recreational behaviour in urban forests. Urban forest managers can use these results to promote outdoor recreation. Furthermore, our hot route maps may help integrating economic, ecological, and social objectives into management plans.

AB  - Based on recognized gaps in adaptation research the article begins by identifying the need to empirically investigate the governance of adaptation'. Drawing on Kooiman's interactive governance framework, the study examines through collaborative methodology how adaptation agency and the space for adaptation is constructed and restricted in the case of an Indigenous reindeer herding community in Sweden. Findings demonstrate that climate change and variability is currently a matter of concern. The greatest problem, however, is the diminishing space for adaptation due to accumulated pressure of predation and competing land-uses in combination with herders' lack of direct and indirect power to influence the actors and institutional factors currently limiting adaptation options. This study carries relevance not only for reindeer herding communities in Sweden, but also for the general adaptation literature in demonstrating that limits and barriers to adaptation can be essentially political; requiring the making of hard choices and hence active governmental intervention. It also shows that marginalized groups, even in contexts where adaptive capacity is considered high, are likely to remain highly vulnerable with restricted adaptation opportunities unless deliberate structural and institutional transformation are initiated.

AB  - Norwegian fjord systems provide a host of ecosystem services and are important for recreational and industrial use. The biodiversity of Norwegian fjords has been and still is extensively studied since they are important for fishing and aquaculture industries. However, threats from plastic and microplastic pollution within the fjord systems are largely undocumented. Monitoring efforts of microplastic in Norway are limited to coastal biota monitoring, offshore sediments, and some investigations within Osloord. Here, we quantify anthropogenic micropartides in Norwegian fjord subsurface waters, including an analysis of distribution effects. Fifty-two samples were collected during repeated transits from Bergen to Masfjorden covering 250 km. Anthropogenic particles were identified in 89% of samples, with an average abundance within the fjord estimated to be 1.9 particles m(-3). This report shows the ubiquitous nature of anthropogenic particles in the subsurface waters of a Norwegian Fjord system. Additionally, methods were validated for opportunistic nondisruptive sampling on-board vessels where microplastics are seldom monitored, including research vessels, commercial freight and transport, and recreational vessels. Further development and implementation of these methods in terms of sampling, chemical characterisation, and long-term monitoring will allow for microplastic quantification and can be easily adapted for worldwide implementation.

AB  - Environmental changes and their consequences on biodiversity are known to have far-reaching effects on the resilience of animal populations and associated livelihoods around the world. To counteract negative demographic and economic effects on pastoralism, knowledge about the historical and current status of the environment is essential. In this study, we show how extractive industries, especially large-scale mining, induced a cascade of land conversions which are affecting animal populations and pastoralists' adaptive responses in northern Sweden. We examine social-ecological vulnerability in Arctic reindeer husbandry by integrating herders' knowledge, population statistics for semi-domesticated reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus, public data on socio-economic variables and geospatial tools. We determine that approximately 34% of Laevas reindeer herding community's grazing grounds are functionally unavailable to reindeer at present due to the accumulation of multiple competing land use pressures. Reindeer numbers currently only remain stable due to increased management efforts. Moreover, we identified current hotspots of high cumulative impact and mineral exploration as the spatially dominating land use factor in this area. Our approach and results provide new insights for scientifically robust cumulative impact assessments of anthropogenic stressors by creating a baseline of current developments via a combination of reindeer herder's knowledge with historical data of trends and extents of human activity over the last century.

AB  - This article applies the analytical concept of shadow field in relation to reindeer management, to explain why some herders and reindeer herding cooperatives do not adhere to government regulations on herd size. The underlying processes and structures related to reindeer numbers are exemplified through two case studies of two Finnish reindeer herding cooperatives, which for several years have exceeded the total allowable quota of reindeer. The case studies reveal a different reality of reindeer management, which functions according to a logic and agenda not always understood by the State authorities or incorporated into the management decisions. This reality is the outcome of anomalies in the official reindeer management system, including the system's disclosure of herders from the decision-making process, the system's provision of self-determination and self-monitoring regarding the organisation of reindeer herding to the cooperatives, the system's weak external control and a subsidy system which promotes reindeer ownership instead of production. Combined, these anomalies enable and encourage the formation of a shadow field of reindeer management. This paper uses as its theoretical framework Pierre Bourdieu's theory of practice, and focuses especially on the key notion of field and shadow field in addressing the Common Pool Resource discussion related to reindeer herding.

AB  - Soil microbes play a key role in controlling ecosystem functions and providing ecosystem services. Yet, microbial communities in urban green space soils remain poorly characterized. Here we compared soil microbial communities in 41 urban parks of (i) divergent plant functional types (evergreen trees, deciduous trees and lawn) and (ii) different ages (constructed 10, approximate to 50 and >100 years ago). These microbial communities were also compared to those in 5 control forests in southern Finland. Our results indicate that, despite frequent disturbances in urban parks, urban soil microbes still followed the classic patterns typical of plant-microbe associations in natural environments: both bacterial and fungal communities in urban parks responded to plant functional groups, but fungi were under tighter control of plants than bacteria. We show that park age shaped the composition of microbial communities, possibly because vegetation in old parks have had a longer time to modify soil properties and microbial communities than in young parks. Furthermore, control forests harboured distinct but less diverse soil microbial communities than urban parks that are under continuous anthropogenic disturbance. Our results highlight the importance of maintaining a diverse portfolio of urban green spaces and plant communities therein to facilitate complex microbial communities and functions in urban systems.

AB  - Genetic diversity and fine-scale population structure in the lichen-forming ascomycete Xanthoria parietina was investigated using sequence variation in part of the intergenic spacer (IGS) and the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Sampling included 213 and 225 individuals, respectively, from seven populations in two different habitats, bark and rock, on the island Storfosna off the central west coast of Norway. Both markers revealed significant variation and a total of 10 IGS and 16 ITS haplotypes were found. There were no signs of significant positive spatial autocorrelation at any spatial size class down to 10% of transect length, nor did we find significant deviations from neutrality or signs of historical population expansion. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that most of the genetic variance observed was within populations, but when populations were grouped according to habitat, more than a quarter of the variance was explained among groups. Pairwise comparisons of populations (F-ST, exact tests of population differentiation) revealed significant differentiation between populations in different habitats (on bark or rock), but not between populations in the same habitat. Haplotype networks show that internal and presumably old haplotypes are shared between habitats, whereas terminal haplotypes tend to be unique to a habitat, mostly bark. We interpret the observed pattern to mean that there is no evidence of restricted gene flow between populations in the same habitat at the present spatial scale (interpopulation distances one or a few kilometres). On the other hand, differentiation between habitats is considerable, which we attribute to restricted gene flow between habitats (habitat isolation). Evidence suggests that the observed differentiation did not evolve locally. Estimates of divergence time between populations in the respective habitats indicate that an ancestral population started to diverge at least 34 000 years ago but probably much further back in time.

AB  - The relevance of intercropping, where two or more crop species are simultaneously grown on the same land space, is growing due to its potential for improving resource use and maintaining stable yields under variable weather conditions. However, the actual growth of intercropped species may differ resulting from the idiosyncratic effect of crop diversity, and with this, the realized benefits from intercrops are found to depend critically on the cultivar, species, management and environmental conditions. This study aimed to apply a trait-based approach, in which ecological niche spaces are defined through n-dimensional hypervolumes, to identify the contribution of species/cultivar, cultivation design (sole crop or intercrop) and management (low or high fertilization) to the trait diversity of four crop species, pea-barley and faba bean-wheat, when grown as sole crops and intercrops. Four traits were used as trait axes for the trait space analysis: canopy height, shoot biomass, tiller/node number, and grain yield. We found that trait spaces differed with crop species and cultivars, and whether they were grown as intercrops or sole crops. Trait spaces differed between high and low fertilization only for the cereals grown in the more productive site (i.e. Denmark). Species grown as intercrops had larger volumes than when grown as sole crops, as a result of trait plasticity. This response to intercropping was apparent in almost all the species grown in Sweden and Denmark, except for wheat in Denmark. The study demonstrated that individual species responded to intercropping compared to sole cropping through the plasticity of traits, which influenced the shape of the hypervolumes to divide up the trait space between the species. The findings are important in illustrating the plastic responses of arable crops, which are relevant for understanding the productivity of species grown in intercrops as compared to sole crops.

AB  - Jamtland in Northern Sweden is one of the most tourism and event-intense regions in the country. The rise in volume of events in alpine and subarctic nature environments, and the subsequent increase in participants, requires closer scrutiny of the environmental impacts. The region is characterised by mountains, forests and a sensitive ecological environment, and shared by several land users. With this study, we aim to gain in-depth knowledge of how environmental impacts are understood and valued in the regional assessment process for nature-based events and organised outdoor recreation. We analyse permit documents from the County Administrative Board of Jamtland from 2011 to 2020. The results show that most events were approved, and none were rejected solely due to environmental concerns. Assessments were instead balanced against other considerations, such as local development and economic gains. We argue that these priorities make nature a commercial arena for events, visitors and recreationists. This paper sheds light on human use and the associated environmental effects that further increase the pressure on nature. We end with managerial implications and propose that the permit process can be improved and integrated into spatial planning.

AB  - This article explores Southern Saami reindeer herders' experiences and contestations over state consultation and corporate dialogue during a conflict over the oyfjellet wind energy project in Norway. Informed by a committed research approach and juxtaposition with findings from Indigenous peoples' territorial struggles in Latin-America, the article provides critical perspectives on governance practices in a Nordic-Saami green colonial context. The research draws on ethnography from a consultation meeting between Jillen Njaarke, the impacted reindeer herding community, and state authorities, as well as diverse written material. The study suggests that the state- and corporate-led "dialogues" displaced the root cause of the conflict, revealed epistemic miscommunication, and perpetuated relations of domination which limited emancipatory effects for Jillen Njaarke. The premises and discourses underpinning the "dialogues" further reproduced racist notions which devalue ancestral Saami reindeer herding knowledges, practices, and landscape relations. These findings challenge dialogue as prescription of good governance and conflict resolution in a context where democracy and compliance with Indigenous peoples' rights are perceived as high.

AB  - It has been recognized for a long time that the overstorey composition of a forest partly determines its biological and physical-chemical functioning. Here, we review evidence of the influence of evergreen gymnosperm (EG) tree species and deciduous angiosperm (DA) tree species on the water balance, physical-chemical soil properties and biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nutrients. We used scientific publications based on experimental designs where all species grew on the same parent material and initial soil, and were similar in stage of stand development, former land use and current management. We present the current state of the art, define knowledge gaps, and briefly discuss how selection of tree species can be used to mitigate pollution or enhance accumulation of stable organic carbon in the soil. The presence of EGs generally induces a lower rate of precipitation input into the soil than DAs, resulting in drier soil conditions and lower water discharge. Soil temperature is generally not different, or slightly lower, under an EG canopy compared to a DA canopy. Chemical properties, such as soil pH, can also be significantly modified by taxonomic groups of tree species. Biomass production is usually similar or lower in DA stands than in stands of EGs. Aboveground production of dead organic matter appears to be of the same order of magnitude between tree species groups growing on the same site. Some DAs induce more rapid decomposition of litter than EGs because of the chemical properties of their tissues, higher soil moisture and favourable conditions for earthworms. Forest floors consequently tend to be thicker in EG forests compared to DA forests. Many factors, such as litter lignin content, influence litter decomposition and it is difficult to identify specific litter-quality parameters that distinguish litter decomposition rates of EGs from DAs. Although it has been suggested that DAs can result in higher accumulation of soil carbon stocks, evidence from field studies does not show any obvious trend. Further research is required to clarify if accumulation of carbon in soils (i.e. forest floor + mineral soil) is different between the two types of trees. Production of belowground dead organic matter appears to be of similar magnitude in DA and EG forests, and root decomposition rate lower under EGs than DAs. However there are some discrepancies and still are insufficient data about belowground pools and processes that require further research. Relatively larger amounts of nutrients enter the soil-plant biogeochemical cycle under the influence of EGs than DAs, but recycling of nutrients appears to be slightly enhanced by DAs. Understanding the mechanisms underlying forest ecosystem functioning is essential to predicting the consequences of the expected tree species migration under global change. This knowledge can also be used as a mitigation tool regarding carbon sequestration or management of surface waters because the type of tree species affects forest growth, carbon, water and nutrient cycling.

AB  - In many managed landscapes, low-productivity land comprises most of the remaining relatively untouched areas, and is often over-represented within protected areas. The relationship between the productivity and conservational value of a site is poorly known; however, it has been hypothesized that biodiversity increases with productivity due to higher resource abundance or heterogeneity, and that the species communities of low-productivity land are a nested subset of communities from more productive land. We tested these hypotheses for dead-wood-dependent beetles by comparing their species richness and composition, as well as the amount and diversity of dead wood, between low-productivity (potential forest growth <1 m(3)center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) and high-productivity Scots pine-dominated stands in Sweden. We included four stand types: stands situated on (1) thin soils and (2) mires (both low-productivity), (3) managed stands, and (4) unmanaged stands set aside for conservation purposes (both high-productivity). Beetle species richness and number of red-listed species were highest in the high-productivity set-asides. Species richness was positively correlated with the volume and diversity of dead wood, but volume appeared to be a better predictor than diversity for the higher species richness in set-asides. Beetle species composition was similar among stand types, and the assemblages in low-productivity stands were largely subsets of those in high-productivity set-asides. However, 11% of all species and 40% of red-listed species only occurred in high-productivity stands, while no species were unique to low-productivity stands. We conclude that low-productivity forests are less valuable for conservation than high-productivity forest land. Given the generally similar species composition among stand types, a comparable conservational effect could be obtained by setting aside a larger area of low-productivity forest in comparison to the high-productivity. In terms of dead wood volumes, 1.8-3.6 ha of low-productivity forest has the same value as 1 ha of unmanaged high-productivity forest. This figure can be used to estimate the conservation value of low-productivity forests; however, as high-productivity forests harbored some unique species, they are not completely exchangeable.

AB  - Interdependence, that is, when the choice of one actor influences that of another, has relevance for the success of an institutional arrangement. Transaction cost theory can help to explain responses to governance solutions and problems associated with governance and policy of such arrangements. This paper focuses on the parallel use of the forest resources by the forestry industry and indigenous groups practising reindeer husbandry in Northern Sweden as an example of such interdependence. A theoretical model of governance of interdependence and the effect of transaction costs is developed in the paper to meet the needs of being able to evaluate the effect of interdependence in a multiple-use situation. The model is then tested on the empirical example of forestry and reindeer husbandry, using scenario and focus-group methods, to discuss the effect of transaction costs in the present hybrid institution system. This institution is intended to address the interdependence between the actors and manage conflicts, but currently fails to reduce conflict. Next, the model is used to evaluate possible changes; the results of the analysis show that modifying the institutional arrangement can bring about improvements that would have some redistributive effects in terms of transaction costs, lessening the impact of interdependence.

AB  - Although charcoal's density and porosity shape its environmental roles (e.g. controlling its landscape movement and determining the internal pore space available as microbial habitat), the rate of change of these properties in the environment remains largely unknown. With time, charcoal pores may fill or charcoal particles may shatter, altering the ecosystem services delivered. In this study we examined the effects of environmental exposure on the density and porosity of charcoals pyrolyzed at two different temperatures (350 and 520 degrees C). Fresh charcoal made from the dominant local tree (Pinus sylvestris) was returned in litter incubations to Norwegian boreal forest soils for 20 months in three different placements: (i) aboveground, (ii) in the humus layer, and (iii) under the humus layer in contact with the mineral subsoil. By varying soil horizon placement we were able to separate the effects of infill from the effects of environmental disturbance on charcoal density and porosity.
   Environmental exposure changed charcoal density and porosity, and the response varied with environmental placement. Charcoal placed in soil layers increased in porosity by similar to 1-2% after 20months incubation. This is likely because open indentations on the charcoal surface became partially occluded, creating more detectable pore space. In contrast, the porosity of charcoal incubated aboveground decreased slightly (similar to 1-2% over 20 months). Because there were no minerals or humic substances to infill the aboveground charcoal samples, this porosity reduction was likely caused by breakage of particles induced by weathering. When charcoal particles cleave through pores, internal pore space is destroyed.
   The small changes observed here indicate that environmental exposure did not trigger rapid shifts in charcoal density and porosity. In addition, these physical properties appear not to have reached equilibrium after 20 months incubation, suggesting that the effect of environmental exposure on charcoal's physical properties occurs on the timescale of years to decades.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study is to explore the interrelationships between island area, species number and habitat diversity in two archipelago areas.
   Location The study areas, Brunskar and Getskar, are located in an archipelago in south-western Finland.
   Methods The study areas, 82 islands in Brunskar and 78 in Getskar, were classified into nine habitat types based on land cover. In the Brunskar area, the flora (351 species) was surveyed separately for each individual habitat on the islands. In the Getskar area, the flora (302 species) was surveyed on a whole-island basis. We used standard techniques to analyse the species-area relationship on a whole-island and a habitat level. We also tested our data for the small island effect (SIE) using breakpoint and path analysis models.
   Results Species richness was significantly associated with both island area and habitat diversity. Vegetated area in particular, defined as island area with the rock habitat subtracted, proved to be a strong predictor of species richness. Species number had a greater association with island area multiplied by the number of habitats than with island area or habitat number separately. The tests for a SIE in the species-area relationship showed the existence of a SIE in one of the island groups. No SIE could be detected for the species-vegetated area relationship in either of the island groups. The strength of the species-area relationship differed considerably between the habitats.
   Main conclusions The general principles of island biogeography apply well to the 160 islands in this study. Vascular plant diversity for small islands is strongly influenced by physiographic factors. For the small islands with thin and varying soil cover, vegetated area was the most powerful predictor of species richness. The species-area curves of various habitats showed large variations, suggesting that the measurement of habitat areas and establishment of habitat-based species lists are needed to better understand species richness on islands. We found some evidence of a SIE, but it is debatable whether this is a 'true' SIE or a soil cover/habitat characteristics feature.

AB  - Organic farming has the potential to enhance ecosystem services such as crop pollination. However, it is not known if a similar effect can be generated on conventional farms, without reducing external inputs such as inorganic fertilizers and pesticides, by using more complex crop rotations including ley for animal fodder production. In two separate designs, both located in southern Sweden, we tested if local organic farming and the landscape proportion of conventionally managed leys, along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, affected the pollination success of field bean. The number of developed pods was higher on organic farms compared to conventional ones. Development of beans, which demands high pollination efficiency, increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity, but only on organic farms. Increasing proportion of ley on conventional farms did not significantly influence the development of beans. The number of developed pods was not affected by the proportion of ley in the landscape. Our results demonstrate that in order to maximize pollination success it is important to improve both field management and preserve semi-natural habitats in the agricultural landscape. Reducing farming intensity with conventionally managed leys does not seem to be as effective as organic farming for delivering crop pollination services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The global urban population is increasing and in many urban areas this, combined with densification, create a strain on urban water management and availability of urban green space. Simultaneously, climate change leads to increased frequency and intensity of cloudbursts and hot spells. To counteract experienced problems, cities are increasingly working to improve urban green space through actively including nature-based solutions (NBS) and their related ecosystem services (ES). From an urban sustainable development perspective, it is important to understand where and how to work with NBS and ES, to benefit the whole society. This task of urban ES governance is challenging, especially as the possibilities to work with green space depend on the amount of available space, which varies greatly in and between cities. The aim of the study was to assess how local stakeholders involved in urban development and regeneration processes in a neighbourhood perceive the physical/environmental and social structures, and their interactions in relation to ES provision. The study focuses on actors that directly or indirectly influence the wellbeing of local residents in the district Sofielund in Malmo, Sweden, and is based on semi-structured interviews with 16 stakeholders, including property owners or managers, businesses and local representatives from the Swedish Union of Tenants.
   The results show that local stakeholder involvement is a key to a just urban ES governance. Without acknowledging different stakeholder perspectives, there is a risk that those with more power and louder voices may steer the urban development in a certain direction, leaving the rest devoid of influence. Approaches to involve local residents exist in Sofielund, both within the local community, housing organizations, as well as a part of the ordinary planning process, but several barriers exist for a more structured participatory culture where the interest of local residents are taken into consideration. Particularly relevant for the interviewed stakeholders, is the identified lack of structure for participation and communication between property owners and the municipality. If the distribution of ES is unequal and participatory structures are lacking, stakeholders will perceive that their interests are not considered. In a short-term perspective, this will create unsatisfaction and decreased trust. In the longer perspective, it may create a degradation of the neighbourhood where economically stronger inhabitants move out. By ensuring, that local inhabitants perceive that their needs of green space are recognized and that a potential uneven distributions of ES provision is considered, it is possible to achieve a more just sustainable urban development. Based on these findings, we make four recommendations on how a just urban ES governance could be developed; social and physical development has to be seen as a whole, power structures have to be recognized, inclusive engagement structures have to be put in place, measurements of ES have to target relative ES provision, related to the needs of differet groups of residents groups.

AB  - It is often stated that plants remove air pollutants from the urban atmosphere with their large leaf area, thus providing benefits - i.e. ecosystem services - for citizens. However, empirical evidence showing that localscale air quality is uniformly improved by urban forests is scarce. We studied the influence of conifer-dominated peri-urban forests on the springtime levels of NO2 and particle pollution at different distances from roads, using passive samplers and high time resolution particle counters in a northern climate in Finland. Passive samplers provided average values over a one month period, while active particle counters provided real time measurements of air pollution to mimic human inhalation frequency. NO2 concentrations were slightly higher in forests than in adjacent open areas, while passive particle measurements showed the opposite trend. Active particle monitoring campaigns showed no systematic forest effect for PM2.5, but larger particles were reduced in the forest, corroborating the passive sampling result.
   Attenuation rates of the mean values of the studied pollutants did not differ between the forest and open habitats. However, high time resolution particle data revealed a distance effect that was apparent only in the forest transect: peak events at the forest edge were higher, while peaks furthest from the road were lower compared to the open transect. Furthermore, the magnitude of PM2.5 peak events was distinctly higher at forest edge than equivalent distance in the open area.
   Vegetation characteristics, such as canopy cover and tree density, did not explain differences in pollutant levels in majority of cases. Our results imply that evergreen-dominated forests near roads can slightly worsen local air quality regarding NO2 and PM2.5 in northern climates, but that coarser particle pollution can be reduced by such forest vegetation. It seems that the potential of roadside vegetation to mitigate air pollution is largely determined by the vegetation effects on airflow.

AB  - This study explored the question of whether a relationship exists between the Nordic cultural idea of friluftsliv and the psychological construct of environmental connectedness (EC). This quantitative study employed a correlational design with existing data from the Swedish Outdoor Recreation in Change national survey. Results indicate that there is a significant and meaningful relationship between friluftsliv, operationally defined as nature-based outdoor recreation participation, and EC even when controlling for other predictor variables. In addition, research findings indicate that age group moderates this relationship with one group exception. It was also found that activity participation by respondents shows a correlation with both EC and age group. Implications of this study support a cultural understanding of nature-based outdoor recreation and an awareness of the important role of access to nature as an essential component of nature-based outdoor recreation. Age group differences supported a variety of implications and recommendations for future research. A consideration of how the results may have implications for environmental education and sustainability efforts were explored.

AB  - Several infrastructure projects are under development or already operational across the Arctic region. Often the deployment of such projects creates benefits at the national, regional, or global scales. However, local communities can experience negative impacts due to the requirements for extensive land areas, which cause pressure on traditional land use. Public participation in environmental planning such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) enables local communities to provide feedback on the environmental, social, and economic challenges of infrastructure projects. Ideally, participation can improve the means of social learning for all involved parties and help to co-develop sustainable solutions. The subject of our research is reindeer herders' participation in EIA procedures of mines and wind farms in Finland because these types of projects affect reindeer husbandry. We study empirically how stakeholders involved in the EIAs perceive the participation of reindeer herders in the planning and implementation of infrastructure projects, and how these differ from the perceptions of the reindeer herders who are affected by the infrastructure projects. Our qualitative data is based on in-depth semi-structured interviews (N = 31) with members of the industry sector, consultants, governmental authorities, and representatives of local communities; in this study, the reindeer herders. The results show that herders' level of participation in the EIAs and the benefits and challenges of participation are perceived differently. Furthermore, the regulatory framework does not adequately ensure that the developer carries social and environmental responsibilities throughout the infrastructure project's lifetime, and that regular communication with herders will also be maintained after the EIAs. Herded expertise should be used throughout the project lifetime. For example, more attention should be paid to both negotiating possible options for compensation and monitoring mechanisms when the infrastructure projects are pre-screened for the EIAs, as well as to co-designing the different project alternatives with herders for the EIAs.

AB  - Bees constitute a key taxon of grassland ecosystems and are the main providers of the essential Ecosystem Service of pollina-tion. We studied bee assemblages of 17 grassland sites in Helsinki, Finland. Bees were sampled using coloured pan traps. The total catch comprised 353 individuals of 35 species. The most abundant species were Lasioglossum leucopus, Lasioglossum lucidulum and Bombus lucorum complex. We used NMDS ordination to depict habitat associations, and GLMM to model the responses of species and trophic groups to habitat type and level of urbanization. Polylectic ground-nesting species were the most abundant trait group. There were only few records of oligolectic species, which showed a significant preference for areas with the lowest level of urbanization. We recommend the provision and maintenance of a diverse range of grassland habitats, with particular attention to the conservation of late successional meadow habitats.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - We studied the role of human values in social innovations (SIs) in four forest-dependent communities (FDCs) in Europe. We draw on 71 semi-structured interviews with FDC members in Finland, Slovenia, the UK and Ukraine, and a survey of householders (n = 150) and focus group interviews with related stakeholders in Ukraine. The material collected was analyzed with mixed methods with respect to relational values as catalysts and consequences of SI. Relational values, which are derivative of the relationships between human and non-human world, and responsibilities towards these relationships, were divided into three categories: Doing, Belonging and Respecting. Doing encompasses the individual's perspective of the opportunities offered by nature to individuals. Belonging encompasses a communal dimension of values manifested as the experience of "being at home" in social collectives and landscapes. Respecting addresses environmental and social justice. Common cause for SI was the need of FDCs to sustain or enhance relational values linked to forests while, once emerged, SIs also have potential to become global game-changers. SI encompasses the reconfiguration of: i) forest management and use, ii) decision-making structures and processes, and iii) stakeholder's perceptions of sustainability. Examples include the co-management arrangement between a State forestry enterprise and the local community, buying woodland from the State by the FDCs to enable community forestry, reinvention of traditional forest management, and the active involvement of FDC members in halting illegal logging. As a conclusion, we developed a general value hierarchy accounting for value plurality in which relational, instrumental and intrinsic values can be interpreted from any perspective.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the effect of long-term contrasting cropping systems on the indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) spore populations in the soil of a field experiment located in western Finland. Conventional and low-input cropping systems were compared, each with two nutrient management regimes. The conventional cropping system with a non-leguminous 6-year crop rotation (barley-barley-rye-oat-potato-oat) was fertilized at either full (rotation A) or half (rotation B) the recommended rate. In the low-input cropping system, plant residues were returned to the plots either as such (rotation C) or composted (rotation D). In the rotation of this system, 1 year with barley was replaced by clover, and oat was cultivated mixed with pea. Thus, the 6-year rotation was barley-red clover-rye-oat + pea-potato-oat + pea. Each rotation was replicated three times, starting the 6-year rotation in three different years, these being designated point 1, point 2, and point 3, respectively. In the low-input system, biotite and rock phosphate were used to compensate for K and P in the harvested yield, while animal manure was applied at the start only. After 13 years, rotation points 1 and 3 were studied. Barley was the standing crop in all plots of rotation point 1, while oat and oat + pea were grown in rotations C and D, respectively. AMF spores were studied by direct extraction and by trapping, sampled on 15 June and 15 August. In addition, a special assay was designed for isolation of fast colonizing, dominating AMF. The cropping system did not significantly affect AMF spore densities, although the low-input cropping system with composted plant residues had the highest density with 44 spores on average and the conventional system with full fertilization 24 spores per 100 cm(3) soil in the autumn samples. Species richness was low in the experimental area. Five Glomus spp., one Acaulospora, and one Scutellospora were identified at the species level. In addition to these, three unidentified Glomus spp. were found. Species richness was not affected by cropping system, rotation point, or their interactions. The Shannon-Wiener index of AMF spore distributions was significantly higher in the fully fertilized than in the half-fertilized conventional plots. Glomus claroideum was the most commonly identified single species in the experimental area. It occurred in all the cropping systems and their various rotation points, representing about 30% of the total number of identified spores. In August, G. claroideum accounted for as much as 45-55% of the total numbers of spores identified in the conventional system with halved fertilization. In contrast, Glomus mosseae occurred more commonly in June (26%) than in August (9%). A bioassay using roots as inoculum for isolation and culture of dominating AMF was successfully developed and yielded only G. claroideum. This indicates a high probability of being able to more generally identify, isolate, and culture fast colonizing generalist AMF for use as inoculants in agriculture and horticulture.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is expected to play a key role to achieve deep emission cuts in the energy intensive industry sector. The implementation of carbon capture comes with a considerable investment cost and a significant effect on the plants operating cost, which both depend on site conditions, mainly due to differences in flue gas flow and composition and depending on the availability of excess heat that can be utilized to power the capture unit. In this study we map the costs required to install and operate amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture at all manufacturing plants in Sweden with annual emissions of 500 kt CO2 or more, of both fossil and of biogenic origin, of which there are 28 plants (including a petrochemical site, refineries, iron and steel plants, cement plants and pulp and paper mills). The work considers differences in the investment required as well as differences in potential for using excess heat to cover the steam demand of the capture process. We present the resulting total CO2 capture costs in the form of a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for the emission sources investigated. Cost estimations for a transport and storage system are also indicated. The MACC shows that CO2 capture applied to 28 industrial units capture CO2 emissions corresponding to more than 50% of Swedish total CO2 emissions (from all sectors) at a cost ranging from around 40 euro/t CO2 to 110 euro/t CO2, depending on emission source. Partial capture from the most suited sites may reduce capture cost and, thus, may serve as a low-cost option for introducing CCS. The cost for transport and storage will add some 25 to 40 euro/t CO2, depending on location and type of transportation infrastructure.

AB  - There is consensus that land-use change is a main driver behind the recent declines of many pollinator populations in Europe. However, it is still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom, suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey. Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late mass-flowering crops may be viable management measures to improve conditions for bumblebees in moderately intensified landscapes.

AB  - Implementing urban densification projects in planning practice while simultaneously providing sufficient green spaces has proven to be challenging. Consequently, there is an increasing need for practical approaches to urban green space management in the on-going densification of cities. Therefore, this study was designed to give a better understanding of current green space management practice in two municipalities in Stockholm, Sweden, undergoing densification. The challenges identified through interviews with municipal planners were related to site-specific conditions for densification projects, conflicting interests between involved and affected actors, green quality management issues, and limited use of impact assessment tools. In the municipalities, innovative approaches were adopted in efforts to minimize the above challenges, such as collaboration between the developers and planners, or participatory workshops with the local citizens. This paper explores these challenges and approaches, and makes further recommendations for improving green space management practice.

AB  - Declining populations of wild pollinators have increased the interest in the management of human-modified landscapes for pollinator conservation. Modified landscape features, such as power-line clearings, may provide valuable habitats with increased floral resources for insect pollinators and solitary bees in particular. However, whether the effects of costly habitat interventions on bee communities in power-line clearings are sustained over time, is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment in 19 sites in power-line clearings across southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was; 1) cut and left to decay, 2) cut and removed, or 3) uncut. We assessed the temporal effects of habitat interventions and environmental factors on species richness, abundance, functional groups of nesting preference, body size, tongue-length, and species composition. Species richness and abundance of solitary bees increased substantially with time in both the cleared treatments. But compared to leaving the woody debris to decay, woody debris removal more than doubled estimated bee richness and abundance in areas with a higher forb richness and increased the trait variation in areas with high functional trait variation of forbs, dead wood, and available source habitats. The positive effect of woody debris removal on the species and functional trait diversity of bees was sustained during three years post-treatment, but the effect was dependent on abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Over time the sites increasingly attracted bees from the regional species pool, showing how power-lines may benefit bee populations at a regional scale, through maintenance of temporary refugia in a forested landscape. The current routine practice (cut and left to decay) improves habitat quality for many bee species through alterations to early succession. However, our results indicate that the more costly woody debris removal is a more effective conservation measure for solitary bee communities over time and is to be recommended when funds are available. Removing the woody debris after routine maintenance clearing at specific sites may further enhance the diversity and persistence of bee populations over time, contributing to more diverse and stable bee communities.

AB  - Unprecedented global challenges demand wide-reaching societal modification to ensure life support functions and human well-being. In the absence of adequate international responses to climate change and the need for place-based adaptation, local governments have a pivotal role in fostering sustainability transitions. In this context, the importance of ecosystem-based adaptation is increasingly recognized as a multi-benefit approach that utilizes ecosystem services to harmonize human-environment systems. Although research advocates the mainstreaming of ecosystem-based adaptation to advance sustainable planning, the pathways for its systematic implementation are missing and it remains unclear how local authorities can best integrate this new approach into their core work. The purpose of this study is to increase knowledge of the potential ways to mainstream ecosystem-based adaptation into municipal planning. We investigate four coastal municipalities in southern Sweden (Malmo, Helsingborg, Lomma and Kristianstad) and examine, based on vertical and horizontal integration processes, the key characteristics of existing mainstreaming strategies. Results show that, although ecosystem service planning and climate change adaptation planning together establish the conceptual foundation for ecosystem-based adaptation, related activities are often implemented separately and are rarely comprehensive. We illustrate how combined mainstreaming strategies can reinforce and complement each other and how strong leadership in the integration of processes has the ability to compensate for a lack of guidance or supporting legislation from higher decision-making levels. Finally, we conclude that systemic mainstreaming of sustainability issues is a promising avenue for initiating and promoting sustainability transitions and has the potential to address the criticism that other mainstreaming topics have faced. On this basis, we specify the core characteristics necessary to ensure its effective and meaningful application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Allometric models based on limited sub-samples are widely used for predicting forest-scale information. Here, we develop allometric models for the branch surface area of the widespread conifer species Picea abies [L.] Karst. Branch surface area is a proxy for the capacity of tree branches to intercept and store water and air pollutants. Based on "probability proportional to size" sampling, we measured the surface area for 285 branches and then calculated the branch surface area of 30 trees (and their 3298 branches). We developed allometric models to estimate the total surface area of branches, as well as their number and diameters, for trees across a range of diameters (DBH), heights, and crown ratios (CR). We show that DBH and CR play significant roles in branch characteristics. The branch surface area was linearly related to the stand basal area. Reducing stand density will proportionally reduce interception capacity. The approach outlined here may help stimulate further studies (more species, regions, and management practices) required to optimize stand density for ecosystem services related to crown characteristics, such as hydrology, forage quality, and quantity or capacity for air pollutants.

AB  - We examine landowners' conservation motives, conservation costs and information rents in environmental bidding systems designed for forestry with the help of Faustmann and Hartman models and data from Finnish conservation program. We show that the Faustmann landowners receive information rents, on average 55% of the rental payments. For the Hartman landowners the high conservation costs of old stands result in low information rents; they are only 13% of the rental payments. This estimate omits amenity benefits the landowners derive from their forests; accounting for these benefits would increase information rents dramatically. Despite the high information rents, landowners' conservation motives decrease the rental payment required for participation in the conservation program. Hence, landowners' conservation motives give governments a great opportunity to allocate conservation contracts in a more cost effective way, thereby extracting larger benefits for scarce conservation funds.

AB  - The present paper deals with C and N storage in soil and vegetation, litter fall and CO2 efflux from the soil 32-33 years after early thinning in a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand in order to evaluate the effect of thinning regime on C sequestration. At 22 years old, the stand was reduced from 3190 to 2070, 1100 and 820 trees per hectare in four replicates. The N2070 treatment represents the recommended start density in practical forestry, while the other represent a moderate to large reduction in tree number at the present stand age. Aboveground biomass was estimated from single tree measurements of diameter and height based on allometric functions. Litter fall was collected during one and a half years and soil respiration was measured on five occasions during one summer. Ground vegetation was mapped and sampled for biomass, C and N determination. A significant decrease in aboveground tree (including stump-root system) C storage of 27% and 22% due to thinning was found in the N820 and N1100 treatments, respectively, compared to the N2070 treatment. Ground vegetation C storage was little affected by treatment, while litter fall C showed a non-significant decrease in the N820 and N1100 treatments compared to the N2070 treatment. Soil respiration was significantly lower in parts of the summer in the N2070 treatment compared to the N820 treatment. The reason for this is still unexplained since no differences in soil temperature, soil moisture or litter fall chemistry was found between the treatments. No significant treatment effects on humus and mineral soil C storage could be detected. With the present soil variability, the time period of 32 years is probably too short to detect soil C differences due to thinning. The N storage followed the same pattern as for C.

AB  - The biodiversity of agroecosystems may be enhanced by increasing species richness and structural diversity of vegetation by creating perennial strips. Aims of the study were (1) to describe the plant succession of perennial strips in northern conditions; (2) to clarify the difference in insect fauna between cereal fields and perennial strips; (3) to determine the effect of succession on leafhoppers in perennial strips; and (4) to compare the leafhopper fauna of perennial strips with that of other uncultivated biotopes. Three perennial grass strips (12 m wide, 420 m long) were sown in the middle of cereal fields (15 ha) in 1991 with a seed mixture of timothy (Phleum pratense), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis). red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium repens). The perennial strips were not mown or renewed after the establishment. In 1992 and 1993 barley and in 1993 spring wheat were grown in the surrounding fields.
   The composition of plant cover in the grass strips changed over four seasons. The total number of plant species decreased from 23 species in 1992 to 10 in 1995. The change resulted from the dramatic decrease of annual weeds after the first year. Furthermore, the total plant cover declined slightly. The cover of P. pratense increased, whereas that of T. pratense and T. repens decreased. The plant species typical of early succession were annual weeds including Tripleurospermum inodorum and Thlaspi arvense. In the last year, perennial weeds such as Cirsium arvense and Elymus repens became common.
   Leafhopper abundance and species number were higher in perennial grass strips than in cereal fields. Furthermore, the species composition varied between habitats. Year-to-year fluctuations in leafhopper catches were large. Leafhopper abundance and diversity (Shannon index) were highest in 1993 when 192 sweep net samples contained a total 4680 specimens belonging to 37 species. The plant species richness of the grass strips did not correlate with the abundance and species richness of leafhoppers, which seemed to be more dependent on other factors. Although the plant species number in grass strips decreased clearly during succession, changes in species richness of leafhoppers were not so great. Factors affecting the leafhopper community are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mires (bogs and fens) are nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems, the vegetation of which is especially sensitive to nitrogen deposition and climate change. The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that different processes in the north and south have produced similar vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased temperature on peatland vegetation.

AB  - Results from preference studies have been instrumental for including the general public's recreational preferences into forest policy, planning and management. Although recreational preferences have been studied intensively for approximately four decades, field layer characteristics have received very limited attention in Nordic countries and elsewhere. A representative experimental intemet survey was conducted among adults (aged + 18 years) in the nemoral and boreonemoral vegetation zone of the Scandinavian Peninsula, i.e. the coastal, most southern part of Norway, southern Sweden and all of Denmark. Survey participants (n = 4646) were asked to rank seven photographs that had been randomly selected from 30 digitally-edited photographs of oak and mixed hardwoods in three different stages of development and with five different field layer types. Young forests with the preferred field layer (anemone and litter) were ranked over mature and middle-aged forests with the disliked field layer (rough field layers or withered grass). In fact, anemone consistently increased the preference ranking of a stand compared to other stands, while rough field layer and withered grass reduced the preference. These findings challenge the general view among experts that field layer vegetation only makes a marginal contribution to the recreational value of forests compared to other structural attributes. The implications of this and questions for future research are discussed, as well as perspectives for forest management prompted by the results. The focus of this discussion is on urban and peri-urban forests, where recreational value is often the most highly valued ecosystem service.

AB  - Recent events around the world have revealed varying degrees of public support for climate change and environmental regulation. Applying a latent class logit model, this study investigates Norwegian and Scottish public's economic support for proposed deep sea management policies for novel attributes, identifying the presence of preference heterogeneity. Marine litter and health of fish stocks were the attributes with the highest values in absolute terms. This was followed by the size of the protected area coverage, whilst the creation of jobs was the least valued. The results highlight public support for the further collective action required by the EU in moving beyond the 2020 objective of achieving good environmental status of Europe's seas, despite the low WTP values of the minority classes in each country.

We aimed to explore how social distancing measures affected recreational use of urban green space during the partial lockdown in Oslo, Norway. Mobile tracking data from thousands of recreationists were used to analyze high resolution spatio-temporal changes in activity. We estimated that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291% during lockdown relative to a 3 yr average for the same days. This increase was significantly greater than expected after adjusting for the prevailing weather and time of year and equates to approx. 86 000 extra activities per day over the municipality (population of 690 000). Both pedestrians (walking, running, hiking) and cyclists appeared to intensify activity on trails with higher greenviews and tree canopy cover, but with differences in response modulated by trail accessibility and social distancing preferences. The magnitude of increase was positively associated with trail remoteness, suggesting that green spaces facilitated social distancing and indirectly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Finally, pedestrian activity increased in city parks, peri-urban forest, as well as protected areas, highlighting the importance of access to green open spaces that are interwoven within the built-up matrix. These findings shed new light on the value of urban nature as resilience infrastructure during a time of crisis. The current pandemic also reveals some important dilemmas we might face regarding green justice on the path towards urban planning for future sustainable cities.

AB  - 1. Green tree retention and prescribed burning are the practices used to mitigate negative effects of boreal forestry. Beside their effects on biodiversity, these practices should also promote non-timber forest products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea; (2) if there are synergies or trade-offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of forest-dwelling species.
   2. We used a long-term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three different harvesting treatments: clear-cut logging, logging with retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats within these treatments, while species richness data for five species groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic beetles, pollinators-here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the stand level.
   3. Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the effect was neutral.
   4. No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all values-NTFPs and richness-and trade-offs among values were common. Only bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed burning favoured many values when performed in combination with retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment combinations favoured different species groups.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade-offs among values, may be more appropriate than the stand-scale conservation practices commonly practiced today.

AB  - The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, Article 8(j) in particular, requires its parties to "respect, preserve and maintain knowledge, innovations and practices of Indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles." In Finland, these requirements are, to some extent, fulfilled through application of the Akwe: Kon Voluntary Guidelines, a protocol developed by the CBD for cultural, environmental, and social impact assessment to be applied in regions inhabited or used by Indigenous peoples. However, although the Akwe: Kon Guidelines have been in use for several years, studies addressing their practical application are scarce. We set out to examine the use of the Akwe: Kon Guidelines, inclusion of traditional and local knowledge (TLK), as well as the related improvements and challenges in land use planning in the Municipality of Eanodat in Finnish Sapmi. We conducted key-informant interviews with local Sami experts and local land use planning officials and examined recent land use and management plans for wilderness and conservation areas. Regarding the incorporation of TLK into land use planning, officials identified practical challenges, such as a mismatch between the oral narrative nature of TLK and the planning systems currently in use, and pointed to a need to make TLK more spatially explicit. The concerns of the Sami were deeply tied to the survival of their culture and traditional livelihoods, reindeer herding in particular. The Sami informants were unanimous about the need to amend the Reindeer Husbandry Act (848/1990), to better recognize the traditional Sami ways of herding and knowledge embedded in it. Having strengthened the opportunities of the Sami to participate in management planning, application of the Akwe: Kon Guidelines is a much welcome development. However, because of the voluntary nature of the Guidelines, their power may be limited in the current situation, where Sami herders' rights are not settled in national legislation governing reindeer husbandry.

AB  - Northern pine-lichen forests are generally regarded as natural ecosystems that, in the past, were repeatedly affected by wild fires. This paper presents and tests a new hypothesis that reindeer herders used recurrent fires to promote and sustain reindeer lichen-dominated ground vegetation, in order to maintain good winter-grazing grounds in Scots pine forests. We investigated vegetation and fire history in three pine-lichen forests along the Lulealven River in northernmost Sweden. Methods included analyses of pollen, spores, charcoal and soil nutrient capital, coupled with investigation of written historical sources and previous studies. Results suggest that recurrent, intermediate-interval fires started sometime between the 2nd and 8th centuries CE, i.e. at the same time that reindeer became semidomesticated in this region. Such fires continued until the 18th century, when introduction of active fire suppression reduced the occurrence of fire in the landscape. Repeated burning over this long period eventually depleted the soil-nutrient capital, especially nitrogen and phosphorous, thereby severely reducing productivity. In the early 20th century, foresters described such forests as degraded. Results of this study add a new dimension to understanding the genesis and history of many pine-lichen forests. They challenge the notion that reindeer herders have been reluctant, in the past, to use fire. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether a similar history can be ascribed to pine-lichen forests in other parts of northern Fennoscandia. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predicting the surface albedo of a forest of a given species composition or plant functional type is complicated by the wide range of structural attributes it may display. Accurate characterizations of forest structure are therefore essential to reducing the uncertainty of albedo predictions in forests, particularly in the presence of snow. At present, forest albedo parameterizations remain a nonnegligible source of uncertainty in climate models, and the magnitude attributable to insufficient characterization of forest structure remains unclear. Here we employ a forest classification scheme based on the assimilation of Fennoscandic (i.e., Norway, Sweden, and Finland) national forest inventory data to quantify the magnitude of the albedo prediction error attributable to poor characterizations of forest structure. For a spatial domain spanning similar to 611,000km(2) of boreal forest, we find a mean absolute wintertime (December-March) albedo prediction error of 0.02, corresponding to a mean absolute radiative forcing similar to 0.4W/m(2). Further, we evaluate the implication of excluding albedo trajectories linked to structural transitions in forests during transient simulations of anthropogenic land use/land cover change. We find that, for an intensively managed forestry region in southeastern Norway, neglecting structural transitions over the next quarter century results in a foregone (undetected) radiatively equivalent impact of similar to 178Mt-CO2-eq.year(-1) on average during this perioda magnitude that is roughly comparable to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of a country such as The Netherlands. Our results affirm the importance of improving the characterization of forest structure when simulating surface albedo and associated climate effects.
   Plain Language Summary Surface albedoor the ratio of reflected to incoming sunlightis an important physical property of the climate system and, as such, requires skillful prediction by climate models. Predicting the surface albedo in a forest during months with snow is complicated by many factors, among which is the sufficiency by which a forest's physical properties are represented in the model. This study makes use of detailed national forest inventory information to estimate the contribution to albedo prediction error that may be wholly attributed to insufficient characterizations of forest structure in a climate model, which we find to be nonnegligible. This study also investigates the consequence of ignoring structural transitions in forests when predicting future surface albedo impacts of forest management activities in climate modeling studies. For a case study region in southeast Norway, we find that not accounting for differences in surface albedo between forests in various development states can result in substantial climate effects going undetected, with magnitudes on the order of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of some European countries such as The Netherlands, or approximately 2days of current global CO2 emissions.

AB  - Preventing dangerous climate change requires actions on several sectors. Mitigation strategies have focused primarily on energy, because fossil fuels are the main source of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Another important sector recently gaining more attention is the forest sector. Deforestation is responsible for approximately one fifth of the global emissions, while growing forests sequester and store significant amounts of carbon. Because energy and forest sectors and climate change are highly interlinked, their interactions need to be analysed in an integrated framework in order to better understand the consequences of different actions and policies, and find the most effective means to reduce emissions. This paper presents a model, which integrates energy use, forests and greenhouse gas emissions and describes the most important linkages between them. The model is applied for the case of Finland, where integrated analyses are of particular importance due to the abundant forest resources, major forest carbon sink and strong linkage with the energy sector. However, the results and their implications are discussed in a broader perspective. The results demonstrate how full integration of all net emissions into climate policy could increase the economic efficiency of climate change mitigation. Our numerical scenarios showed that enhancing forest carbon sinks would be a more cost-efficient mitigation strategy than using forests for bioenergy production, which would imply a lower sink. However, as forest carbon stock projections involve large uncertainties, their full integration to emission targets can introduce new and notable risks for mitigation strategies.

AB  - In collaborative urban planning, one of the key questions is how the input from residents' participation can be integrated into planning and decision-making. In the planning of the urban green infrastructure, this input is necessary for understanding how residents experience and value their living environment. Use of this input is particularly challenging, however, because of the prominent role of ecological expert information. In this study, we investigate how public officials, decision-makers and stakeholders see the role of the input produced by residents' participation in informing the planning of the urban green infrastructure. We consider (1) how these actors see the role of residents' experiences, as compared to ecological information, in informing planning and (2) what kind of roles residents' input can play in informing and thereby improving the planning processes. In the Helsinki metropolitan region, Finland, data were obtained using 33 semi-structured expert interviews conducted with officials, decision-makers and stakeholders, including as representatives of residents members of resident or nature associations and landowners. We present a typology of ways of thinking concerning the role of residents' experiences and ecological issues in planning and a typology of the roles of resident's input in improving planning. The use of residents' input has the potential to improve planning in many ways, but its use remains case-dependent. Our findings could generate further discussion on (1) the implications of diverse conceptions of relevant knowledge in planning and (2) the design of collaborative processes in which residents' input is an integral part of urban planning.

AB  - Policies on economic use of natural resources require considerations to social and cultural values. In order to make those concrete in a planning context, this paper aims to interpret social and cultural criteria, identify indicators, match these with verifier variables and visualize them on maps. Indicators were selected from a review of scholarly work and natural resource policies, and then matched with verifier variables available for Sweden's 290 municipalities. Maps of the spatial distribution of four social and four cultural verifier variables were then produced. Consideration of social and cultural values in the studied natural resource use sectors was limited. The spatial distribution of the verifier variables exhibited a general divide between northwest and south Sweden, and regional rural and urban areas. We conclude that it is possible to identify indicators and match them with verifier variables to support inclusion of social and cultural values in planning.

AB  - Background and aims Afforestation on croplands can help sequester atmospheric CO2 through increased carbon (C) storage in the soil and vegetation. However, the dynamics of soil organic C (SOC) and root C stocks, particularly those in the deeper soil layers, following afforestation are not well documented for semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to investigate the dynamics of soil and root C stocks to 1 m depth following afforestation with poplar (Populus x xiaozhuanica W. Y. Hsu & Liang) on croplands at the Keerqin Sandy Lands in northeast China.
   Methods Forest floor, root and mineral soil samples were collected from 23 paired plots of poplar plantations with different stand basal areas (SBA, ranging from 0.2 m(2)ha(-1) to 32.6 m(2)ha(-1)) and reference croplands using a paired-site design. Changes of SOC concentration and content, and root C content were analyzed using paired t tests, and the relationships between forest floor C content, soil and root Delta(C) (Delta(C) refers to the difference in C stocks between a poplar plantation and the paired cropland) and SBA were tested with a polynomial regression analysis.
   Results Afforestation resulted in linear increases of Delta C in the forest floor and 0-10 cm mineral soil with SBA (R-2= 0.67, p< 0.001 and R-2= 0.34, p= 0.003, respectively), but there were no clear relationships between SOC stocks in the soil deeper than 10 cm and SBA. The fine root C stock increased by afforestation across all the soil layers (p< 0.05), and root Delta C had a quadratic curve (the first two mineral soil layers) or linear (the other mineral soil layers) relationship with SBA. About 73 % of the variance of Delta C in the top soil was explained by changes in the forest floor C stock, but changes in plant derived C stocks did not explain the variance of soil Delta C in the deeper layers very well.
   Conclusions Our study suggest that afforestation increased C sequestration in the forest floor and surface mineral soil, and C stocks in the forest floor and surface mineral soil and roots were strongly controlled by the SBA, which changes with stand development, in the studied semiarid region in northeast China.

AB  - Street trees are an important part of urban vegetation due to their provisioning of different types of ecosystem services such as local climate regulation and contribution to aesthetical and recreational values. In order to provide these services, urban trees need to endure many stress factors not present in natural environments, such as the widespread use of impervious surfaces in the vicinity of street trees. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this potential stress factor on urban tree growth. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate how ground surface permeability affects stem and current-year shoot growth of linden (Tilia europaea) street trees in Gothenburg, Sweden. We found that a small fraction of permeable ground surface in the vertically projected tree crown area caused lower stem growth and strongly suppressed current-year shoot growth. This finding can guide future city planning, demonstrating that the vitality of street trees is compromised when the permeable surface area in the vicinity of the tree is small.

AB  - Wild geese are increasing in agricultural and urban settings across Europe, leading to widespread human - geese interactions. This study examined how the public's acceptance of geese (attitude and acceptance capacity) varied depending on place dimensions, interactions with geese in different settings (place-based experience), and psychological factors, including wildlife value orientations, beliefs about the ecosystem services and disservices geese provide, and emotions. A survey was conducted in two municipalities with large goose populations in Sweden; Kristianstad and orebro (n = 898). Results revealed a favorable view of the occurrence of geese, although a substantial share believed the number of geese was too high. Place-based experiences of geese were correlated with acceptance (e.g., more experience on beaches was associated with a negative attitude) and the importance of psychological factors for acceptance was confirmed. The study highlights the need to consider the public's experiences of geese for sustainable goose management.

AB  - Increasing occurrence of natural and human-caused disturbances threatens sustainability of forest ecosystems, their ability to regenerate and maintain biological diversity. Simultaneously, forest tree species penetrate into abandoned agricultural lands, the areas of which have noticeably increased during the last decades. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the development of regenerating forest tree communities in terms of their growth, competition and species composition in ecosystems affected by various environmental stressors such as windthrows, insect pests, fungal diseases, traditional clearcuttings and agricultural land-use legacy. Lithuania, being located in the transition between the boreal and continental biogeographical regions of Europe, has been considered a favourable research area as both conifer and broadleaved tree stands as well as mixed ones are common here. Research methods used included inventory of vegetation and assessment of quantitative characteristics and sanitary condition of six regenerating forest tree species - Scots pine, Norway spruce, silver birch, pedunculate oak, common ash and black alder - in 7-8 circular research plots (50.24 m(2) each) per study site with total 17 study sites. Results of the study demonstrated that forest regeneration takes place in all disturbed ecosystems, although high variation in space and time was present. Species composition of the regenerating forest ecosystems depends on those prevailing before disturbance, although, pioneer species out-compete the others. The most intensive forest regeneration takes place in those forest ecosystems which were subjected to direct human impact, i.e., clear cuttings, and less intensive regeneration, particularly, that with the target species, takes place on sites cleared of windthrows and where sanitary fellings were applied. Although non-target species depending on habitat type usually prevail on cutting sites, numbers of saplings of target species are sufficient for the regeneration of high productivity forest ecosystems and development of the new ones given the competing species will be controlled by silvicultural measures. The pioneer herbaceous species established on areas affected by disturbances affect regeneration and species composition of the future forest communities.

AB  - Human activities have drastically increased nitrogen (N) inputs into natural and near-natural terrestrial ecosystems such that critical loads are now being exceeded in many regions of the world. This implies that these ecosystems are shifting from natural N limitation to eutrophication or even N saturation. This process is expected to modify the growth of forests and thus, along with management, to affect their carbon (C) sequestration. However, knowledge of the physiological mechanisms underlying tree response to N inputs, especially in the long term, is still lacking. In this study, we used tree-ring patterns and a dual stable isotope approach (delta C-13 and delta O-18) to investigate tree growth responses and the underlying physiological reactions in a long-term, low-dose N addition experiment (+23 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)). This experiment has been conducted for 14 years in a mountain Picea abies (L.) Karst. forest in Alptal, Switzerland, using a paired-catchment design. Tree stem C sequestration increased by similar to 22%, with an N use efficiency (NUE) of ca. 8 kg additional C in tree stems per kg of N added. Neither earlywood nor latewood delta C-13 values changed significantly compared with the control, indicating that the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) (A/g(s)) did not change due to N addition. Further, the isotopic signal of delta O-18 in early- and latewood showed no significant response to the treatment, indicating that neither stomatal conductance nor leaf-level photosynthesis changed significantly. Foliar analyses showed that needle N concentration significantly increased in the fourth to seventh treatment year, accompanied by increased dry mass and area per needle, and by increased tree height growth. Later, N concentration and height growth returned to nearly background values, while dry mass and area per needle remained high. Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced stem growth caused by N addition is mainly due to an increased leaf area index (LAI). Higher LAI implies that more photosynthetically active radiation is absorbed and therefore canopy-level photosynthesis is increased. We conclude that models assuming that N deposition increases tree growth through higher leaf-level photosynthesis may be mechanistically inaccurate, at least in forest canopies that are not (yet) completely closed.

AB  - Better integration of knowledge from ecological, social and economic science is necessary to advance the understanding and modelling of socio-ecological systems. To model ecosystem integrity (El) and ecosystem services (ES) at the landscape scale, assessment matrices are commonly used. These matrices assign capacities to provide different services to different land cover types. We revised such an existing matrix and examined the regional heterogeneity in El and ES provision in Europe and searched for spatial gradients in their provision to elucidate their suitability for large-scale El and ES mapping in Europe. Overall, 28 sites belonging to the Long-Term Ecological Research network in Europe participated in this study, covering a longitudinal gradient from Spain to Bulgaria and a latitudinal gradient from Italy to Sweden. As a primary outcome, an improved and consolidated El and ES matrix was achieved with 17.5% of all matrix fields updated. For the first time, this new matrix also contains measures of uncertainty for each entry. El and ES provision assessments were more variable for natural and semi-natural than for more anthropogenically dominated land cover classes. Among the main types of El and ES, cultural service provision was rated most heterogeneously in Europe, while abiotic provisioning services were more constant. Longitudinal and latitudinal El and ES gradients were mostly detected in natural and semi-natural land cover types where temperature and precipitation are major drivers. In anthropogenically determined systems in which cultural services play a dominant role, temperature and precipitation gradients were less important. Our results suggest that this matrix approach to assess El and ES provision principally works on broad spatial scales; however, local assessments for natural systems seem to be less generalizable than assessments from anthropogenically determined systems. Provisioning and regulating services are more generalizable than cultural services. Particularly in natural and semi-natural systems, spatial gradients need to be considered. We discuss uncertainties associated with this matrix-based El and ES assessment approach and suggest that future large-scale studies should include additional land cover information and ecosystem disservices and may determine ES fluxes by differentiating between ES provision and consumption.

AB  - BackgroundThe effects of climate change, loss of pastureland to other land usage and presence of large carnivores are the main reasons for the increase in supplementary feeding of semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Fennoscandia over the last decades. Feeding might expose reindeer to stress and increased animal-to-animal contact, leading to an increased risk of infectious disease transmission, such as infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC). As it can develop rapidly and be very painful, IKC is described as an important animal welfare concern and a potential source of economic loss. The aim of this study was to investigate the current presence of IKC and potential associations between IKC and supplementary feeding through an online questionnaire survey, distributed among reindeer herders in Norway and Sweden in 2021.ResultsSeventy-six reindeer herders (33 from Norway and 43 from Sweden) responded to the questionnaire, representing 6% and 4% of the registered reindeer herding groups in Norway and Sweden, respectively. Infectious keratoconjunctivitis was common, with 54 (71%) of the 76 herders that responded having observed clinical signs during the past 10 years. These signs were mainly observed as increased lacrimation, causing "wet cheeks", but also as keratitis and conjunctivitis. Autumn and winter were the seasons in which IKC was observed most. The herders reported several measures, such as slaughter and isolation of affected reindeer, to counteract the spread of disease. The herding year 2019/2020 was associated with reports of outbreaks of IKC in herds as well as being the herding year where most herders (80%) had performed supplementary feeding. A significant association was found between IKC and feeding performed in an enclosure (odds ratio = 15.20), while feeding on free-range areas had a non-significant, negative, relationship with the appearance of IKC outbreaks (odds ratio = 0.29). Finally, there was a trend in the data suggesting that IKC affected calves especially.ConclusionsInfectious keratoconjunctivitis is a common disease, mainly observed in winter and autumn. It usually has mild to moderately severe clinical signs. Our results imply that IKC is associated with stress and feeding situations and that calves might be more susceptible than adults, however, this needs to be confirmed with further studies, preferably at an individual animal level.

AB  - The theory of livestock as a buffer stock predicts that agropastoralists facing substantial risks will typically use liquid assets such as livestock for self-insurance to smooth consumption. This paper examines this hypothesis for reindeer herders in Norway where the herders, in contrast to pastoralists in, say, sub-Saharan Africa, face well-functioning credit markets. Using survey data including slaughter responses to a hypothetical meat price increase, we test whether keeping reindeer as insurance against risks affects the slaughter response. Furthermore, we examine whether status motives for keeping large herds affect the harvest response to a changing slaughter price. As a background to the empirical analysis, a stochastic bioeconomic model describing Saami reindeer herding is formulated.

AB  - Land use change is the main driver of nature and biodiversity loss worldwide, and tourism developments contribute to this loss. The combination of Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and Stated Preference (SP) methods can help inform tourism management by translating the environmental and economic impacts of developments into welfare impacts in monetary terms. We perform a CBA at both the local and regional levels for small (S), medium (M), and large (L) developments in a certified sustainable mountain destination in Norway. The L-development is the preferred tourism management locally as local economic benefits outweigh the local environmental costs. However, when we also include the economic and environmental impacts outside of the destination, we find the S-development to provide higher total welfare at the regional level. This shows that local governments' dual role as regulators and promoters of tourism is problematic since sustainable management should also account for the nonmarket environmental welfare impacts outside of the destination.

AB  - Against a background of intensifying climate-induced disturbances, the need to enhance the resilience of forests and forest management is gaining urgency. In forest management, multiple trade-offs exist between different demands as well as across and within temporal and spatial scales. However, methods to assess resilience that consider these trade-offs are presently lacking. Here we propose a hierarchical framework of principles, criteria, and indicators to assess the resilience of a social-ecological system by focusing on the mechanisms behind resilience. This hierarchical framework balances trade-offs between mechanisms, different parts of the social-ecological system, ecosystem services, and spatial as well as temporal scales. The framework was developed to be used in a participatory manner in forest management planning. It accounts for the major parts of the forest-related social-ecological system and considers the multiple trade-offs involved. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to a landscape dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Central Europe, managed for three different management goals. The framework highlights how forest resilience varies with the pursued management goals and related management strategies. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various forest management contexts as part of a participatory process with stakeholders. It thus is an important step towards operationalizing social-ecological resilience in forest management systems.

AB  - There are limited studies of decomposition of coarse woody debris (CWD) in natural conditions of multi-species mesic broad-leaved forests. We investigated 49 lying logs of 7 angiosperm and 1 gymnosperm species 14 and 15 years after a mass windthrow in an old-growth broad-leaved forest. We observed high heterogeneity of logs in terms of decomposition stages: up to 4 stages in one transverse disk and up to 5 stages in longitudinal fragments of one log. Due to the high heterogeneity of logs, we investigated traits of wood samples rather than individual logs. Bulk density, carbon and nitrogen concentrations, and pH values were examined for 188 CWD samples of 8 species at 5 decomposition stages (from stage 1 least to stage 5 most decayed wood) and 24 control samples of live trees (3 replicates for each species; zero stage of decay). Changes of deadwood volume, carbon and nitrogen stocks over 14 and 15 years after the windthrow were estimated by re-surveying transects established in 2010. From the first to the fifth decay stage, the mean CWD density decreased for all species and averaged 54 & PLUSMN; 16 kg m  3 (SD) at the 5th stage of decay. Regarding decomposition rates, the tree species were arranged in descending rate from diffuse-porous (Populus tremula, Betula pendula, Tilia cordata, and Acer platanoides) to ring-porous (Ulmus glabra, Fraxinus excelsior, and Quercus robur) angiosperms and the coniferous Picea abies was after the diffuse-porous species series and before the ring-porous species. Carbon concentration ranged from 39 to 54 %, but did not change significantly during decomposition (mean value for all species in all decay stages was 45.8 & PLUSMN; 2.5 %). Nitrogen concentration (percentage of dry mass) increased with increasing decay stage and the mean value was 0.2 & PLUSMN; 0.1 % at the zero stage and 0.9 & PLUSMN; 0.5 % at the last decay stage. Despite the increase in N concentration, the mass N per volume decreased during decomposition for all samples considered together due to a significant decrease in wood density. The change in C/N values during deadwood decay reflected the transition of organic matter from the CWD to the SOM (soil organic matter) in forest ecosystems: the ratio C/N varied from 829 (Picea, zero stage) to 16 (Ulmus, last stage) with the mean values 286 & PLUSMN; 149 and 75 & PLUSMN; 45 at the zero and the last stages, respectively. We observed a quadratic trend in the variation of wood pH values by stages: pH mainly decreased from the initial values to the minimum in the middle stages of decay, and then increased in the advanced stages. The mean deadwood volume in the surveyed plots decreased 1.4-fold in the 14-15 years after the windthrow, but the mean stocks of carbon and nitrogen decreased 3 and 2-fold, respectively. Over time, the different decomposition rate of fallen logs leads to a decrease in the proportion of C and N stored in diffuseporous species at the expense of an increase in this proportion in ring-porous species. This result is worth considering in a carbon management strategy: planting, maintaining stands, and retaining deadwood of ringporous species, such as Quercus, Ulmus and Fraxinus, promote relatively long-term carbon storage.

AB  - Tree species composition is a key driver of forest biodiversity, influencing structural components of the environment from soil and litter to vegetation layers and the canopy, and ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling. Single species stands, particularly intensively managed monoculture plantations, are typically more homogenous in habitat structure and the biotic communities supported, than mixed stands. Thus, international forest policy increasingly promotes the establishment of mixed stands as an alternative to enhance biodiversity in plantations. Forests represent around 10% of the land area of Ireland, with most being monocultures of non-native conifers. By contrast, natural forest cover, primarily comprised of deciduous species, is just 1%. In recent years there has been an increase in mixed plantations; however, optimum tree species combinations, which aim to promote biodiversity under sustainable forest management, have yet to be established. Arthropods (ground-dwelling spiders and Carabid beetles, and night-flying macrolepidoptera) were examined in twenty mixed and monoculture plantations in Ireland (Norway spruce-oak mix, Norway spruce-Scots pine mix. Norway spruce monoculture). Both oak and Scots pine were secondary mix components, comprising between 15% and 40% of stems. Spiders and Carabid beetles were sampled using pitfall traps during summer 2008 and moths using light traps during summer and autumn 2008 and spring 2009.
   There was no evidence for an influence of oak or Scots pine on the arthropod fauna when they were a secondary component in a mix. Overall, arthropod communities were similar in species richness, assemblage structure and habitat specialists among the forest types. Furthermore, the mixed stands exhibited similar environmental conditions to monocultures in terms of stand structure, vegetation and litter cover. This suggests that there is limited biodiversity value from an additional canopy species comprising 15-40% of the mix, at least for the taxa and tree species studied here. This has implications for forest policy, where recommendations are often based on the proportion of each mix component, at least in terms of the potential biodiversity value of additional canopy species. Further research is required to determine the proportion at which oak or Scots pine begin to influence the arthropod fauna. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In contrast to situations in most other countries, Indigenous land rights in Sweden are tied to a specific livelihood-reindeer husbandry. Consequently, Sami culture is intimately connected to it. Currently, Sami who are not involved in reindeer husbandry use genealogy and attachment to place to signal Sami belonging and claim Sami identity. This paper explores the relationship between Sami genealogy and attachment to place before the reindeer grazing laws of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I show that within local Sami communities the land representing home was part of family history and identity while using historical archive material, narratives, and storytelling. State projects in the late 19th century challenged the links between family and land by confining Sami land title to reindeer husbandry, thereby constructing a notion of Sami as reindeer herders. The idea has restricted families and individuals from developing their culture and livelihoods as Sami. The construct continues to cause conflicts between Sami and between Sami and other members of local communities. Nevertheless, Sami today continue to evoke their connections to kinship and place, regardless of livelihood.

AB  - Interest in the utilization of forest biomass for energy is growing. A search into existing forest biomass harvesting and regeneration guidelines was carried out to identify how biomass energy can be environmentally sustainable. Findings have shown that there are only a few guidelines that specifically address harvesting and regenerating biomass for bioenergy or other bio-based products. Of these few, there are guidelines developed for dedicated energy plantations such as the Scottish Agricultural College guidelines, as well as some Finnish and Swedish guidelines recommending management practices for both timber and biomass extraction. Most of the existing small woody material guidelines emphasize the retention, disposal, redistribution, burning and mulching of biomass material on-site in a more detailed manner than forest and timber management guidelines. This study synthesizes and classifies existing biomass-related guidelines based on an in-depth literature review of existing guidelines in Europe and North America involved with biomass energy harvesting. Biomass guidelines are classified according to those applicable to systems producing biomass commercially for energy versus those that are applicable to systems managing this material for non-commercial purposes. Biomass guidelines are analyzed with respect to how they address issues of sustainability related to soil, water and habitat. Recommendations are offered for developing guidelines for biomass harvesting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Landscapes consisting of several elements, such as wetlands and forests, are multifunctional in nature and produce both market and non-market goods. The need for policies arises from the existence of non-market ecosystem services that are not traded and thereby generally not subject to economic trade-offs in landowner decision making. An efficient incentive scheme for producing both types of goods would require policy designed for each non-market good. However, this may result in high transaction costs, possibly giving second-best solutions a comparative advantage when only one non-market good is regulated. This paper demonstrates that in the Hovran catchment area in mid Sweden, which produces the non-market goods water quality, biodiversity, and scenic beauty, compensation payments for biodiversity production alone provide almost maximum total net value of all market and non-market goods. On the other hand, payments for providing scenic beauty in the form of open landscape may result in lower total net value than no compensation payment at all, due to a negative impact on water quality.

AB  - Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament on the geological storage of carbon dioxide, entered into force on June 25th 2009. By the end 2013 the CCS Directive has been fully transposed into national law to the satisfaction of the EC in 20 out of 28 EU Member States, while six EU countries (Austria, Cyprus, Hungary, Ireland, Sweden and Slovenia) had to complete transposing measures. In July 2014 the European Commission closed infringement procedures against Cyprus, Hungary and Ireland, which have notified the EC that they have taken measures to incorporate the CCS Directive into national law. Among other three countries Sweden has updated its legislation and published a new law in their country in March 2014, permitting CO2 storage offshore. The evaluation of the national laws in Poland, which were accepted at national level in November 2013, and Croatia, which entered the EU on 7 July 2013 and simultaneously transposed the CCS directive, is still ongoing in 2014. The first storage permit under the Directive (for the ROAD Project in the offshore Netherlands) has been approved by the EC.
   While CO2 storage is permitted in a number of European countries, temporary restrictions were applied in Czech Republic, Denmark and Poland. CO2 storage is prohibited except for research and development in Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, two regions in Belgium and Slovenia due to their geological conditions, but also forbidden in Austraia, Ireland and Latvia. The size of exploration areas for CO2 storage sites is limited in Bulgaria and Hungary. In Germany, only limited CO2 storage will be permitted until 2018 (up to 4 Mt CO2 annually).
   Several challenges still remain for the large-scale implementation of CCS projects in Europe. These include high investment costs and lack of public and consequently political support for onshore storage (particularly in Denmark, Germany, and The Netherlands). An European atlas matching all storage sites and capacities is still required. Among six projects supported by European Energy Programme for Recovery only Spanish project Compostilla was active and only UK submitted their application for CCS project to the NER300 second call in 2013 receiving support in 2014.
   The most active countries in pilot and demonstration projects research and development activities in Europe were Norway and the largest CO2 emitters in EU (Germany, UK, Italy, France, Spain and The Netherlands). The most promising driving force for CCS implementation is to combine it with CO2 use, including EOR-CCS, mineral carbonation options and geothermal-CCS, which will cause more trust among Green NGOs and general public. Research on CCUS has started in many countries, including Geothermal-CCS project in France, Norway and Germany. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use and land use change affect deadwood amount, quality and associated biodiversity in forest ecosystems. Old growth or virgin forests, which are exceptionally rare in temperate Europe harbor more deadwood and associated fungal species than managed forests. Whether and how more recent abandonment of management, to reestablish more natural forests, affects deadwood amount and fungal diversity on deadwood is unknown. Our main aim was to compare deadwood amount, characteristics and deadwood inhabiting fungi in differently managed forest types typical for large areas of Central Europe. We sampled deadwood inhabiting fungi on 27 forest plots of 400 m(2) each in three geographically distant regions in Germany. Three forest management types, namely managed coniferous, managed deciduous and unmanaged deciduous forests, were represented by nine plots each. In autumn 2008 we collected all fungal fruiting bodies on deadwood >7 cm of diameter. We found deadwood amounts and fungal species numbers in unmanaged forests to be lower than in managed forests, which we attributed to the lack of natural tree death during the short time since management abandonment of usually 10-30 years. However, rarefaction analysis among deadwood items in forest plots indicated a slightly higher species density in unmanaged forests, which may be the first signal of a positive effect on fungal species richness on deadwood after management was abandoned. Although the three study regions span a large geographical gradient, we did not detect differences in the fungal species composition or in deadwood amounts and patterns, which reflects the wide distribution of this group of organisms and points to consistent management procedures among study regions. A very clear composition difference however occurred between deciduous and coniferous wood showing species substrate specialization. We conclude that the amount of deadwood is the main driver of deadwood fungal species richness, and substrate diversity in terms of various decay degrees, deadwood tree species and deadwood size are also important. Thus, to promote species richness of deadwood fungi it is vital to enhance deadwood amounts and diversity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given the hypothesized effects on soil organic matter (SOM) of polyphenols in plant tissues, differences among tree species in their biochemical composition could influence the turnover and accrual of SOM in various ways. The extent to which the biochemical composition of leaf and fine-root tissues differ among tropical tree species, and the effects on soil dynamics, are largely undocumented, however. We used cupric oxide analyses of plant tissues and soil in long-term, replicated, mono-dominant 15-year-old plantations at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, to test for differences among six tree species. We related these results to companion studies in this experimental site to evaluate relationships between interspecific differences in tissue biochemistry and SOM dynamics. Newly senesced leaves and fine roots of the six species differed in their concentrations of three lignin-derived families of phenols, the cinnamyls, syringyls and vanillyls (p < 0.0001 for all tests). Cinnamyl and syringyl phenols in soil differed significantly among species (p = 0.0408, 0.0071, respectively), whereas vanillyl phenols did not (p = 0.83). The degree of decomposition of syringyl and vanillyl phenols in soil also differed (p = 0.0015, 0.0027, respectively), as evidenced by the ratio of carboxylic acid to aldehyde compounds, based on the concept that carboxylic acids are a common by-product of oxidative decomposition of lignin by microorganisms. In our study in a single site, i.e., the same soil type, climate, and growth form of vegetation, total phenols in soil ranged from 5 to 21 mg g(-1) organic carbon (OC) across the 20 plots, and the endpoints were both broad-leaved evergreen species; even the means across species, 7-12 mg g(-1) OC, covered half the range of values reported in another study across a broad latitudinal range of sites. This study's tree species differed in traits that influenced at least four factors that explained their differential effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) pools: (1) Fine-root detrital inputs; (2) Fine-root syringyl concentrations; (3) Soil pH; and (4) Macroaggregate structure. This trait-based approach provides a process-based understanding of how trees species influence SOC dynamics, and the consequences for ecosystem properties, under land-use change that involves shifts in species composition.

AB  - Vegetated roofs, often called "green roofs", are popular and necessary in urban greening in densely populated areas. Well-functioning vegetated roofs can provide various ecosystem services to urban residents (e.g., stormwater management, air pollution mitigation, and aesthetic value). Plants essentially determine the actualization of the ecosystem services, thus finding effective ways to establish and maintain the roof plants is important. While greenhouse experiments can be better controlled than field experiments, it is critical to test whether results gained in the greenhouse hold in actual roof conditions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of microbial inoculant, plant species, planting method, and their interactions on plant growth and the beneficial microbes in the roof substrate at the initial establishment of vegetated roofs. The selected plants (i.e., Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Fragaria vesca, Geranium sanguineum, Lotus corniculatus, Thymus serpyllum, Trifolium repens, and Viola tricolor) were established using pre-grown vegetation mats, plug plants, and seeds, each with and without the co-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, two plant growth-promoting microbial species. Eventually, only F. vesca, T. serpyllum, T. repens, and V. tricolor were found successfully settled in either of the three planting methods. Dry aboveground plant biomass was measured to assess the effects of co-inoculation on plant growth. R. irregularis colonization level and B. amyloliquefaciens bacterial density were detected from root and substrate samples, respectively. The results indicated that co-inoculation with R. irregularis and B. amyloliquefaciens successfully colonized target plant species and significantly increased the initial growth of the vegetated roof plants by 18-292%. Additionally, the abundance of R. irregularis was affected by plant species (F. vesca > T. serpyllum > T. repens) and planting methods (seed > plug > mat), while the bacterial density of B. amyloliquefaciens was higher in T. repens roots than the other plant species, and was not affected by planning methods.
   The results suggest that co-inoculating R. irregularis and B. amyloliquefaciens at the installation phase of vegetated roofs could improve microbial settlement and colonization in the substrate, and consequently achieve synergistic effect on plant growth. The study also provides basis and reference for future vegetated roofs research.

AB  - Soil fungi are strongly affected by plant species or genotypes since plants modify their surrounding environment, but the effects of plant genotype diversity on fungal diversity and function have not been extensively studied. The interactive responses of fungal community composition to plant genotypic diversity and environmental drivers were investigated in Salix biomass systems, posing questions about: (1) How fungal diversity varies as a function of plant genotype diversity; (2) If plant genotype identity is a strong driver of fungal community composition also in plant mixtures; (3) How the fungal communities change through time (seasonally and interannually)?; and (4) Will the proportion of ECM fungi increase over the rotation? Soil samples were collected over 4 years, starting preplanting from two Salix field trials, including four genotypes with contrasting phenology and functional traits, and genotypes were grown in all possible combinations (four genotypes in Uppsala, Sweden, two in Rostock, Germany). Fungal communities were identified, using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. We found some site-dependent relationships between fungal community composition and genotype or diversity level, and site accounted for the largest part of the variation in fungal community composition. Rostock had a more homogenous community structure, with significant effects of genotype, diversity level, and the presence of one genotype ("Loden") on fungal community composition. Soil properties and plant and litter traits contributed to explaining the variation in fungal species composition. The within-season variation in composition was of a similar magnitude to the year-to-year variation. The proportion of ECM fungi increased over time irrespective of plant genotype diversity, and, in Uppsala, the 4-mixture showed a weaker response than other combinations. Species richness was generally higher in Uppsala compared with that in Rostock and increased over time, but did not increase with plant genotype diversity. This significant site-specificity underlines the need for consideration of diverse sites to draw general conclusions of temporal variations and functioning of fungal communities. A significant increase in ECM colonization of soil under the pioneer tree Salix on agricultural soils was evident and points to changed litter decomposition and soil carbon dynamics during Salix growth.

AB  - Human actions have led to loss and degradation of wetlands, impairing their suitability as habitat especially for waterbirds. Such negative effects may be mitigated through habitat management. To date scientific evidence regarding the impacts of these actions remains scarce. We studied guild specific abundances of breeding and staging birds in response to habitat management on 15 Finnish wetlands. In this study management actions comprised several means of vegetation removal to thwart overgrowth. Management cost efficiency was assessed by examining the association between site-specific costs and bird abundances. Several bird guilds exhibited positive connections with both habitat management as well as with invested funds. Most importantly, however, red-listed species and species with special conservation concern as outlined by the EU showed positive correlations with management actions, underlining the conservation value of wetland management. The results suggest that grazing was especially efficient in restoring overgrown wetlands. As a whole this study makes it clear that wetland habitat management constitutes a feasible conservation tool. The marked association between invested funds and bird abundance may prove to be a valuable tool for decision makers when balancing costs and impact of conservation measures against one another.

AB  - The recent loss of pollinating insects and out-crossing plants in agricultural landscapes has raised concern for the maintenance of ecosystem services. Wild bees have been shown to benefit from garden habitats in urban and suburban areas. We investigated the effects of distance from garden habitats on wild bees and seed set of a native out-crossing plant Campanula persicifolia, in intensively managed agricultural landscapes in Southern Sweden. Bee abundance and species richness, as well as plant seed set, were higher closer to gardens (<15 m) than further away (>140 m). This highlights private gardens as a landscape wide resource for pollinators but also the lack of sufficient pollination of wild plants in contemporary agricultural landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems are traditional components of the landscape in the Swiss Jura Mountains, and are promising approaches for the sustainable management of mountain areas worldwide. Due to complex vegetation dynamics, pasture-woodlands are very vulnerable to the currently occurring land use and climate changes. Therefore, management requires integrative long-term predictions of successional trends. We present a refined version of the spatially explicit, dynamic simulation model WoodPaM with improved climate sensitivity of simulated vegetation. We investigate pasture-woodland dynamics by applying an innovative combination of retrospective simulations starting in the Middle Ages with prospective simulations following two climate change scenarios. The retrospective simulations demonstrate the strong dependency of the landscape mosaic on both climate and management. In high elevation mountain pastures, climate cooling during the Little Ice Age hindered simulated tree regeneration and reduced forage production of grasslands. Both led to an increase in open grassland and to a structural simplification of the landscape. In turn, climate warming afterwards showed the opposite effect. At lower elevations, high cattle stocking rates generally dominate simulated succession, leading to a slow development of quite homogenous landscapes whose structures are hardly affected by historical climate variability. Aerial photographs suggest that logging and windstorms critically shaped the current landscape, both homogenizing mosaic structures that emerge from selective grazing. Simulations of climate change scenarios suggest delayed but inevitable structural changes in the landscape mosaic and a temporary breakdown of the ecosystem service wood production. The population of currently dominating Norway spruce collapses due to simulated drought. Spruce is only slowly replaced either by beech under moderate warming or by Scots pine under extreme warming. In general, the shift in tree species dominance results in landscapes of less structural richness than today. In order to maintain the mosaic structure of pasture-woodlands, we recommend a future increase in cattle stocking on mountain pastures. The (re-) introduction of mixed herds (cattle with horses, sheep, and goats) could mitigate the simulated trend towards structural homogenization of the forest-grassland mosaic because diverse browsing effects selectively control tree regeneration and would counteract simulated forest encroachment. This could prevent the loss of species-rich open grasslands and forest-grassland ecotones. Forest management should respect forest-grassland mosaics and ecotones by following the traditional selective felling of single trees instead of large clear-cutting. Additionally, beech regeneration should be promoted from now on in order to smoothen tree species replacement with warming and to ensure the continuous provision of forest ecosystem services.

AB  - The Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) Directive was ratified (2014/89/EU) along the Strategy of the European Union (EU) on the Blue Economy to contribute to the effective management of maritime activities and resources and incorporate the principal elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) (2002/413/EC) into planning at the land-sea interface. There is a need to develop the ICZM approach throughout Europe to realise the potential for both socio-economic and environmental targets set by the EU and national legislations. In this study, we co-developed different approaches for land-sea interactions in four case areas in Estonia and Finland based on the defined characteristics and key interests derived from local or regional challenges by integrating spatial data on human activities and ecology. Furthermore, four ICZM drafts were co-evaluated by stakeholders and the public using online map-based assessment tools (public participatory GIS). The ICZM approaches of the Estonian cases ranged from the diversification of land use to the enhancement of community-based entrepreneurship. The Finnish cases aimed to define the trends for sustainable marine and coastal tourism and introduce the ecosystem service concept in land use planning. During the project activities, we found that increased communication and exchange of local and regional views and values on the prevailing land-sea interactions were important for the entire process. Thereafter, the ICZM plans were applied to the MSP processes nationally, and they support the sustainable development of coastal areas in Estonia and Finland.

AB  - Simple Summary Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) has become a commodity worldwide. The culture of Atlantic salmon is by far the most well-developed branch of marine finfish aquaculture, with this species ranking among the top ten most highly produced in global aquaculture. While Atlantic salmon has been commonly farmed in sea cages located in colder waters (e.g., in Norway, Chile and Tasmania), these regions can experience the negative impacts of heat waves that push seawater temperature above values tolerated by this species. These climate-change-driven shifts in water temperature can be associated with mass mortality events and urgent actions are needed to cope with a changing ocean. This paper reviews the thermal limits of adult Atlantic salmon and lists the negative effects driven by heat stress. We highlight how biotechnology and the genetic diversity of wild populations may help producers to tackle this challenge. Selective breeding programs and other more advanced biotechnological solutions (e.g., gene editing) may play a key role in this quest to produce new strains of Atlantic salmon that more readily tolerate higher water temperatures, without compromising productivity and profitability. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) cage farming has traditionally been located at higher latitudes where cold seawater temperatures favor this practice. However, these regions can be impacted by ocean warming and heat waves that push seawater temperature beyond the thermo-tolerance limits of this species. As more mass mortality events are reported every year due to abnormal sea temperatures, the Atlantic salmon cage aquaculture industry acknowledges the need to adapt to a changing ocean. This paper reviews adult Atlantic salmon thermal tolerance limits, as well as the deleterious eco-physiological consequences of heat stress, with emphasis on how it negatively affects sea cage aquaculture production cycles. Biotechnological solutions targeting the phenotypic plasticity of Atlantic salmon and its genetic diversity, particularly that of its southernmost populations at the limit of its natural zoogeographic distribution, are discussed. Some of these solutions include selective breeding programs, which may play a key role in this quest for a more thermo-tolerant strain of Atlantic salmon that may help the cage aquaculture industry to adapt to climate uncertainties more rapidly, without compromising profitability. Omics technologies and precision breeding, along with cryopreservation breakthroughs, are also part of the available toolbox that includes other solutions that can allow cage farmers to continue to produce Atlantic salmon in the warmer waters of the oceans of tomorrow.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of whether local selling of farm products improves on-farm biodiversity in rural areas. In contrast to the main agricultural trend of farms specializing and increasing in size in response to national and global markets, increasing numbers of Swedish farmers are diverting their efforts towards selling at local markets. Based on case studies of six farms selling their products locally, this paper explores the nature of the diversity on these farms and identifies qualities in the interaction between the farmers and their consumers that are supporting this diversity. The study showed that farmers who interacted with consumers were encouraged to diversify their production. Marketing a large diversity of products at a local market led to better income for participating farmers. Animal farms maintained important biodiversity associated with their extensive way of rearing animals on semi-natural pastures. Access to local markets promoted this.

AB  - Mississippi landowners were found to diversify incomes from their lands through fee-access outdoor recreation, including hunting, angling, wildlife watching, and other nature-based activities. In 1998, fee-access hunting revenues ranged from US$2,964-$5,254 on average/landowner or $7.50-$14.28/ha (1). During 2005-2008, outdoor recreation increased Mississippi rural property values by 52% or $1,615/ha and those tracts that were leased for hunting collected over $61/ha on average (2). Additionally, outdoor recreation in Mississippi, including hunting, angling, and wildlife viewing generated $2.7 billion in economic impact to the state in 2008 (Jones unpublished data). The Natural Resource Enterprises Program at Mississippi State University educates private landowners, resource agencies, and local communities about recreational enterprises, conservation management practices, and integration of these activities with sustainable forestry and agriculture through outreach programming and demonstrations. Since 2005, we have conducted 45 landowner workshops in 8 US states and Sweden and recruited an estimated 3,000 participants. Participants owned on average 505 ha comprised of 50% forests, 29% agriculture, 13% uncultivated or fallow lands, and 8% wetlands and impoundments. Seventy-five percent of participants reported intentions to implement recreational operations, conservation, and sustainable land-use practices on their lands (1.0 million ha) and estimated that they would average an additional $25,208 annually from these activities. Outreach programming promoting fee-access recreation and conservation on privately-owned lands can benefit landowners and local communities through sustainable economic development, environmental conservation, and land stewardship and retention.

AB  - Traffic environment, like roadsides and central reservations, when considering their total area and netlike structure, provide a good opportunity to increase ecosystem services by green infrastructure. This potential is unexploited because of limited plant species selection. We tested low-growing herbaceous perennials, ornamental grasses and shrubs in a city center traffic area to attain visually good, diverse urban greenspace with low maintenance needs. We also tested local growing media containing composted digestate of sewage sludge and biochar made of deciduous wood. The test site was in the central reservation of a busy highway in the city of Turku, southern Finland. The selected plant species were 16 perennial herbaceous species, 6 grass species and 7 shrubs. Some of the species were native, others garden varieties. The perennials and ornamental grasses were planted as pre-grown mats (total area 450 m(2)) and the shrubs were planted as container plants (total area 385 m(2)). During two growing seasons, the growth, health, overwintering, ornamental value and tolerance of plants to the stress factors caused by the traffic were observed. The results gave indications about the success of some species and vulnerability of others in traffic environment. During the two first growing seasons, biochar did not affect the growth of the shrubs.

AB  - Cyanobacteria may limit recreational use of waters and have negative impacts on ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to determine phosphorus (P) thresholds for cyanobacterial taxa, which form toxin-producing blooms (mass occurrences) in boreal lakes. These thresholds help to set robust P reduction targets for restoration measures. We used long-term (> 40 years) June-August data from > 2000 Finnish lakes to evaluate the total P (TP) thresholds for the most important bloom-forming cyanobacterial genera and selected Microcystis and Dolichospermum species. The analyses were carried out separately for oligohumic, mesohumic and polyhumic lakes. TP threshold values varied between 10 and 61 mu g l(-1). The values were lower in oligohumic (water colour < 30 mg Pt l(-1)) than mesohumic (water colour 30-90 mg Pt l(-1)) lakes. The highest TP threshold (50 mu g l(-1)) was observed for Microcystis in polyhumic lakes, and the lowest (10 mu g l(-1)) for Planktothrix in oligohumic lakes.

AB  - Freshwater lakes are dynamic ecosystems and provide multiple ecosystem services to humans. Sudden changes in lake environmental conditions such as cyanobacterial blooms can negatively impact lake usage. Automated high frequency monitoring (AHFM) systems allow the detection of short-lived extreme and unpredictable events and enable lake managers to take mitigation actions earlier than if basing decisions on conventional monitoring programmes. In this study a cost-benefit approach was used to compare the costs of implementing and running an AHFM system with its potential benefits for three case study lakes. It was shown that AHFM can help avoid human health impacts, lost recreation opportunities, and revenue losses for livestock, aquaculture and agriculture as well as reputational damages for drinking water treatment. Our results showed that the largest benefits of AHFM can be expected in prevention of human health impacts and reputational damages. The potential benefits of AHFM, however, do not always outweigh installation and operation costs. While for Lake Kinneret (Israel) over a 10-year period, the depreciated total benefits are higher than the depreciated total costs, this is not the case for Lough Gara (Ireland). For Lake Ma?laren in Sweden it would depend on the configuration of the AHFM system, as well as on how the benefits are calculated. In general, the higher the frequency and severity of changes in lake environmental conditions associated with detrimental consequences for humans and the higher the number of lake users, the more likely it is that the application of an AHFM system is financially viable.

AB  - The aim was to investigate effects of urban greenery (high vs. low naturalness) on place identity and wellbeing, and the links between place identity and wellbeing. It was shown that participants (Gothenburg, Sweden, N = 1347) estimated a stronger attachment/closeness/belonging (emotional component of place-identity), and more remembrance and thinking about and mental travel (cognitive component of placeidentity) in relation to high vs. low perceived naturalness. High naturalness was also reported to generate higher wellbeing in participants than low naturalness. Furthermore, place identity was shown to predict participants' wellbeing in urban greenery, accounting for 35% of variance explained by the regression. However, there was a stronger relationship between the emotional vs. the cognitive component of place identity and wellbeing. Finally, a significant role of place identity in mediating the naturalnesswellbeing relationship was shown, indicating that the naturalness-wellbeing connection can be partly accounted for by the psychological mechanisms of people-place bonding.

AB  - The term 'bioeconomy' stands for an economy that primarily relies on renewable biotic resources and thus supports the vision of a low carbon society. The respective 'bioeconomy strategies' bear high conflict potential as they, sometimes unintentionally, rely on forest-land or wood as a resource, which are already appropriated also in other policies. We first outline the resulting governance challenges in terms of coherence of policy goals, consistency of instruments and the congruence between the two and identify trade-offs between forest ecosystem services that exhibit a high conflict potential regarding the bioeconomy. We then provide a comparative analysis of the extent to which bioeconomy strategies tackle the related governance challenges for two pairs of countries from the temperate (Germany and Switzerland) and the boreal (Sweden and Norway) forest zone. We find that the strategies do not mention conflicts related to wood mobilization. Coherence and consistency tend to be addressed for non-extractive forest utilizations that are perceived as a market opportunity rather than solely a restriction on wood mobilization. The latter seems more common in countries with a multi-functional forestry paradigm. Consequences for the prevailing forest management paradigm, however, are not explored in the strategies and thus policy congruence is neglected.

AB  - Sweden has the largest forest cover in the European Union, and for decades, Sweden's forest industry has pursued intensive forest management through tree plantations and clear-cutting in order to maximize wood production. The Swedish forestry sector is increasingly under pressure to transition away from intensive clear-cut forest management, but other forest management models are still a niche in Sweden's forest management and face barriers in their wider uptake. We use transition theory and the multi-level perspective framework to analyse the dynamics within the Swedish forestry sector, and investigate the barriers that actors practicing and promoting Continuous Cover Forestry in Sweden face. We identify culture, forestry education, industrial networks and timber markets as domains where there is a mismatch between Continuous Cover Forestry and the current clear-cut forest management. Our analysis shows that the limited uptake of Continuous Cover Forestry in Sweden has explanations that go far beyond the lack of knowledge and ecological limitations that it is often associated with. Thus, we conclude that research and policy-making need to account for these diverse explanations and address the power and social dimensions associated with competing forest management models for building multi-functional forest ecosystems in the future.

AB  - Old veteran trees function as biodiversity hotspots in both forests and open landscapes, and protecting such trees is an important measure to halt loss of biodiversity. Nevertheless, the number of veteran trees continues to decline worldwide, although estimates of this decline mainly stem from geographically restricted case studies. In Norway, veteran oak trees have received special protection since 2011 through the Norwegian Biodiversity Act, however, there is a lack of knowledge on status and trends for these trees. A national monitoring program was started in 2012, using a random, stratified sampling procedure. We use the data from the baseline survey and the first monitoring revisit to estimate the total number as well as mortality trends of veteran oaks in Norway. Further, we assess recruitment potential (in the baseline survey) and changes in variables describing ecological state such as regrowth.The monitoring area covered the geographical distribution of oaks in Norway and was divided into > 200 000 plots of 500 x 500 m. A set of 500 monitoring plots were randomly selected from two strata: High probability plots (n = 100; plots with high probability of occurrence of veteran oaks), and Low probability plots (n = 400), using existing knowledge and databases. Plots were surveyed over a five year-period (2012-2016), with 20 HighProb-plots and 80 LowProb-plots each year. All veteran oaks that were observed during the baseline survey were revisited in 2019, three to seven years after they were initially registered. Tree absence and cause of death/ change of ecological status was recorded. We estimated a total of 138 100 veteran oaks in Norway based on the baseline survey, of which 25 000 could be denoted "top quality oaks". Based on the revisit, we estimated a loss of 7 600 veteran trees, i.e., an annual mortality rate of 1.2%. Recruitment oaks were present in most plots with veteran oaks, but recruitment into the veteran oak category is slow and unlikely to balance out the mortality rate. More precise estimates of recruitment should be prioritized in future monitoring. The estimate of 138 000 vet-eran oaks far exceeds the appr. 10 000 trees registered in the national database, and clearly demonstrates the need for continued mapping and monitoring to improve the foundation for a knowledge-based land manage-ment. Further, this short-term monitoring demonstrates the decline of this biodiversity hotspot and pivotal source of ecosystem functions, despite increased protection in recent years. Our results and conclusions are relevant also for veteran trees of other species than oak.

AB  - Intensively managed agricultural landscapes have degraded the provisioning of diverse and continuous forage and shelter habitats for arthropods and weakened the delivery of ecosystem services such as insect crop pollination and biological pest control. In response, farmers are incentivised to sow flower strips along field margins to counteract resource bottlenecks. Yet, it is poorly understood how effective this diversification practice is when combined with the supplementation of honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) hives, which is commonly used to boost insect pollination in flowering crops. Honeybees share floral resources with wild pollinators and natural enemies of pests, which could lead to competition for food resources. We sampled pollinators, natural enemies and their pests as well as estimated the benefit of insect pollination in 17 organic faba bean (Vicia faba minor L.) fields in southern Sweden either with or without sown annual flower strips and with or without added honeybee hives. In fields with flower strips, bumblebee (Bombus spp.) densities were redistributed from field edges to interiors but without affecting their overall densities. Flower strips enhanced silver Y moth (Autographa gamma L.) densities and carabid beetle Shannon diversity along the field edge, and overall spider activity density. The supplementation of honeybee hives enhanced honeybee densities, overall ladybird beetle densities, black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) densities along field edges, but deterred silver Y moths and pushed bumblebees towards the field interior. Bean mass per plant was higher in insect pollinated plants compared with bagged, self-pollinated plants. This insect pollination benefit was independent of honeybee hive supplementation and the flower strip treatment suggesting that faba bean fields were not deficient in pollinator visits. We conclude that flower strips did not provide sufficient floral resources to increase overall wild pollinator densities in faba bean fields. Yet, annual flower strips attracted and facilitated ground-dwelling predators, especially spiders, to faba bean fields, likely by providing beneficial shelter habitats. It is worth noting that 2018, in which we collected our data, was characterised by late frosts in spring followed by an unusually hot and dry summer. While these unforeseen weather conditions together with a relatively small sample size might limit the generalisation of our results, we argue that conducting experiments under such conditions provide insights into the effectiveness of agri-environmental schemes under climate change, especially considering that such weather conditions are becoming increasingly more frequent.

AB  - Worldwide conservation goals to protect biodiversity emphasize the need to rethink which objectives are most suitable for different landscapes. Comparing two different Swedish farming landscapes, we used survey data on birds and vascular plants to test whether landscapes with large, intensively managed farms had lower richness and diversity of the two taxa than landscapes with less intensively managed small farms, and if they differed in species composition. Landscapes with large intensively managed farms did not have lower richness than smaller low intensively managed farms. The landscape types were also similar in that they had few red listed species, normally targeted in conservation. Differences in species composition demonstrate that by having both types of agricultural landscapes regional diversity is increased, which is seldom captured in the objectives for agro-environmental policies. Thus we argue that focus on species richness or red listed species would miss the actual diversity found in the two landscape types. Biodiversity conservation, especially in production landscapes, would therefore benefit from a hierarchy of local to regional objectives with explicit targets in terms of which aspects of biodiversity to focus on.

AB  - Living trees are the main source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in forest ecosystems, but substantial emissions originate from leaf and wood litter, the rhizosphere and from microorganisms. This review focuses on temperate and boreal forest ecosystems and the roles of BVOCs in ecosystem function, from the leaf to the forest canopy and from the forest soil to the atmosphere level. Moreover, emphasis is given to the question of how BVOCs will help forests adapt to environmental stress, particularly biotic stress related to climate change. Trees use their vascular system and emissions of BVOCs in internal communication, but emitted BVOCs have extended the communication to tree population and whole community levels and beyond. Future forestry practices should consider the importance of BVOCs in attraction and repulsion of attacking bark beetles, but also take an advantage of herbivore-induced BVOCs to improve the efficiency of natural enemies of herbivores. BVOCs are extensively involved in ecosystem services provided by forests including the positive effects on human health. BVOCs have a key role in ozone formation but also in ozone quenching. Oxidation products form secondary organic aerosols that disperse sunlight deeper into the forest canopy, and affect cloud formation and ultimately the climate. We also discuss the technical side of reliable BVOC sampling of forest trees for future interdisciplinary studies that should bridge the gaps between the forest sciences, health sciences, chemical ecology, conservation biology, tree physiology and atmospheric science.

AB  - In line with research indicating positive associations between well-being and personal and collective people-place bonding, and that collectivistic compared to individualistic commitment may have stronger associations with pro-environmental behavior, we investigated relationships between identity, well-being, and willingness to sacrifice (type of pro-environmental behavior) in personal and collective favorite places. A total of 884 respondents, living in three Swedish municipalities, participated in this study. In line with the hypotheses, we showed congruent positive relationships between place-related: (1) personal identity and personal well-being; (2) collective identity and collective well-being, (3) collective identity and collective willingness to sacrifice; and (4) an incongruent positive association between collective identity and personal willingness to sacrifice. Additionally, a significant role of well-being in mediating the identity -> willingness to sacrifice relationship was reported, suggesting that our willingness to pay higher taxes and prices and to accept cuts in standard of living in order to protect our personal and collective favorite places might be accounted for partly by how we feel visiting these places.

AB  - Indigenous-state collaboration in the governance of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is often hampered not only by legacies of colonialism and inequality but also disagreement on what the 'CEA governance problem' is in the first place. In this paper, we draw on critical theories on dialogue and collaboration to present a novel approach to joint problem analysis between Sami reindeer herders and civil servants in Swedish permitting authorities on mining, wind energy and forestry. We discuss process design choices, insights on CEA governance and ways to tackle these barriers in practice. We argue that indigenous-state collaboration may play a constructive role in improving CEA governance, including the recognition of indigenous peoples' rights. However, this requires a process that carves out new spaces for exploring divergent problem definitions and supports the participants in challenging institutionalized inequalities within their positioned realities.

AB  - Management practices, geographical gradients and climatic factors are factors explaining weed species composition and richness in cereal fields from Northern and Central Europe. In the Mediterranean area, the precise factors responsible for weed distribution are less known due to the lack of data and surveys. The existence of weed survey data of year 1976 in the Zaragoza province of the Aragn region, Spain, offered us the opportunity to compare present weed species with weed species growing 30 years ago. No detailed comparison of changes in weed species composition in cereal fields in that period of time has been conducted in the Mediterranean area. Here a survey was conducted in the Aragn region from 2005 to 2007. Weeds were surveyed in 138 winter cereal fields in ten survey areas where winter cereals are the main crops, using the same methodology applied 30 years ago. In the Zaragoza province, 36 fields were chosen in the same municipalities than in the previous survey. Several management, geographic and climatic variables of each field were recorded and related to weed species with multivariate analysis. Diversity index were calculated and related to survey area and altitude. Our results show that out of the 175 species only 26 species were found in more than 10% of the surveyed fields. The main species were Papaver rhoeas, Lolium rigidum, Avena sterilis and Convolvulus arvensis found in more than half of the surveyed fields. L. rigidum was related to dryland, while the other species were found overall. Furthermore, we found that management, geographical and climatic factors were significantly related to weed species distribution. In particular altitude, survey areas, irrigation and herbicide use in post-emergence were the most driving factors explaining weed species distribution. Species richness was higher in survey areas with extensive management practices and increased with altitude excepting a very productive area with intensive management practices at high altitude where richness was as low as in the irrigated lowlands. The main differences found between the 1976 and the 2005-2007 surveys were (1) the striking increase of grass weeds, (2) the high decrease of mean weed species number found in each field declining from 9 to 3 and (3) the frequency decrease of many weed species probably caused by agriculture intensification in that period of time. The growing importance of other weed species is probably related to their adaptation to minimum tillage, which is a widespread technique nowadays.

AB  - Lichens are a bottleneck resource for circumpolar populations of reindeer, and as such, for reindeer husbandry as an indigenous Sami land-use tradition in northern Sweden. This study uses ground lichen data and forest information collected within the Swedish National Forest Inventory since 1953, on the scale of northern Sweden. We found a 71 % decline in the area of lichen-abundant forests over the last 60 years. A decline was observed in all regions and age classes and especially coincided with a decrease of > 60 year old, open pine forests, which was the primary explanatory factor in our model. The effects of reindeer numbers were inconclusive in explaining the decrease in lichen-abundant forest. The role that forestry has played in causing this decline can be debated, but forestry can have a significant role in reversing the trend and improving ground lichen conditions.

AB  - Larch in the Apuseni mountains can be found in compositions with predominately common beech and sparce with resinous species, mainly in mixtures on average and upper slope, peaking at approximately 1200m but concentrated on the average altitude of 650m, situated on corrugated lands and occupying only 1497.5ha out of 310538ha total forested area managed by the state in Apuseni mountains. The main objectives of the paper were to analyze the distribution and stand characteristics of Larch (Larix decidua Mill.) in the Apuseni mountains. Regarded as a fast-growing tree with high quality wood, it is mainly used for producing superior timber quality, its ecological value being overseen, only 20% of area occupied by larch used for protection purposes. Predominantly in mixtures, provides shelter, acting as a support tree for other species, improving biodiversity. Larches genetic diversity provides big challenges for forest managers, a proper growth model is required to satisfy all ecosystem services.

AB  - The Swedish government accepts in principle that agriculture needs to move from being an activity that contributes to humankind's excess demand on the planet to become an activity that regenerates ecosystem services. The major tool for development of European agriculture is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU implemented in the member rural development programs (RDP). Swedish farmers are dependent on the subsidies and payments of the RDP yet many are very critical of the program, especially those with animals and semi-natural pastures. A study based on semi-structured interviews with farmers in three districts in Sweden reveals the main reasons for their criticism to be: they feel trapped by regulations, powerless with respect to the controlling agency and lacking control of their finances. The study also identifies factors in the program that hinder the implementation of the sustainability goals of the CAP and RDP. The article recommends the adoption of guiding principles for facilitating transitions toward sustainable agriculture and emerging solutions to the challenges farmers experience.

T2  - FORESTRY
LA  - English
CP  - Conference on Forest Management in Designated Conservation/Recreation Areas
AB  - This paper focuses on changes in the relationship of the Swedish public with the forest. By repeating a postal survey after 20 years, changes in the recreational use of forests, and preferences according to suitability of forest sites for outdoor recreation, are measured. The main result is that the changes are generally small. The visiting frequency remains unaltered and the typical Swede visits a forest fur recreational purposes once a week in summer and once a fortnight during the winter. A few differences between the studies in 1977 and in 1997 were observed. The amount of wild berries picked for home consumption had decreased in 1997 to about one-third of the volume picked in 1977. A black and white photo of a virgin forest was considered a more suitable image for outdoor recreation in 1997. A Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) shelterwood was considered less suitable for outdoor recreation. It is concluded that the relationship with the forest is still close, but that public use is changing from harvesting towards purely recreational. Further conclusions are that new recommendations for silvicultural actions will be needed due to these changing preferences and that the conflict between recreational and biodiversity goals in forestry has slightly decreased.

AB  - The National Urban Park (NUP) is a planning instrument used by the state to preserve cities' green infrastructure (GI). This article compares a top-down approach to the designation of NUP, as it has been applied in Sweden, with a bottom-up approach, as it has been applied in Finland. The application that has taken place in Sweden has contributed to the Royal National Urban Park in Stockholm being the only one in the country so far, partly due to a hesitation among municipalities to implement a tool which limits their future development opportunities. In Finland, on the other hand, where the initiative is driven by municipalities, the NUP has become so demanded that the municipalities compete over approval. In both cases, the study shows that NUP is a strong instrument for protecting green areas, but the implementation approach by the public authorities is crucial for its success.

AB  - This study presents a Public Participation Geographic Information System (PPGIS) method for spatially identifying and assessing multiple elements of environmental justice in urban blue space. We used this method in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, to examine: (1) the diversity and spatial distribution of clusters based on the activities undertaken in urban blue space; (2) the diversity of users in each cluster, representing a composite measure of income, age and family income, and; (3) the extent of perceived problems and unpleasant experiences (PPUE) in each cluster. Proportionately more high activity and high user diversity areas were found in Helsinki than Espoo and Vantaa municipalities. Contrasting combinations of activity and user diversity (high-low, low-high) show very different spatial distributions, dominant activities and PPUE. The method enables landscape and urban planning strategies to be tailored to different types of activities and users, and to be responsive to the PPUE found in urban blue spaces. We encourage future landscape and urban planning research to further develop and apply this PPGIS method for assessing multiple elements of environmental justice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Road verges could provide habitats for threatened grassland species, but current verge management is suboptimal for achieving this. Altering verge management to favor grassland species is possible but depends on stakeholder attitudes and valuation. We describe the attitudes of 373 Finnish road verge stakeholders toward grassland-friendly verge management and investigate the drivers underlying these attitudes. We also assess the perceived feasibility of different grassland-friendly management alterations and identify barriers facing their implementation. Gathered with online questionnaires, the data for the study comprises open-ended and Likert scale questions and was analyzed with multivariate methods and linear mixed models. According to the results, valued verge attributes, such as perceived species-richness and safety, and personal familiarity with biodiversity and semi-natural grasslands structure stakeholder attitudes toward grassland-friendly management. Specific management alterations, such as readjusted mowing schedules, are viewed with varying positivity, but insufficient resources and compromised traffic safety are perceived to hinder their implementation.

AB  - Agricultural systems can be seen as nested social-ecological systems. European Union (EU) Member States vary considerably in terms of their agricultural, socio-economic and environmental circumstances. Yet, as participants in the common agricultural market, they are subject to a uniform Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). An important question is whether there is enough room for flexibility to sustain diverse agricultural systems and facilitate national targeting of sustainability-promoting measures. This article analyses the institutional arrangements concerning cross-scale interactions and interdependencies at national and regional (EU) levels, focusing on how Poland and Sweden implement CAP funds in relation to sustainable agriculture, in particular the agri-environmental schemes, for the period 2007-2013. What room is there in practice for accommodating national differences and sustainability priorities offered by the EU agricultural policy, and how are the existing opportunities used by the two countries? It is shown that agri-environmental funds are too small to prevent transition towards large-scale farming in new Member States and CAP does not effectively promote transformation towards sustainable practices in the EU.

AB  - During past decades, the amounts of infrastructure and human activity have increased in northern latitudes. Although the effects of human development on wild reindeer and caribou have been widely examined, its effects on semi-domesticated reindeer and the reindeer herding environment are still poorly understood. We studied how seven different human activities (population centres, buildings, main roads, forest roads, snowmobile tracks, skiing trails, and gold digging areas) affect the range selection by semi-domesticated reindeer in northern Finnish Lapland using GPS tracking data on 29 female reindeer. Data were analyzed using compositional analysis on two spatial scales (home range selection and within-home-range selection) and in three seasonal periods (early winter, late winter, and summer-autumn). Results showed that during winter, reindeer strongly avoided almost all studied human activities when selecting home range areas (for forest roads, the direction of the effect was unclear), but in summer and autumn, only some of those activities were important. Within the selected home range areas, pasture use by reindeer appears to be less sensitive to infrastructure and human activity, probably because reindeer were able to avoid these anthropogenic disturbances at the upper level of habitat selection. The size of the potential cumulative area affected by infrastructure varied seasonally between 27.5% and 39.0% of the study area when calculated on the basis of home range selection, and between 7.2% and 20.3% when calculated from within-home-range selection. The strongest avoidance of infrastructure was found in late winter on both scales of range selection, but weakest avoidance was in early winter for home range selection and in summer for within-home-range selection. Cumulative impacts of different human activities on the usability value of reindeer ranges should be taken into account when planning new land-use operations in the areas important for the reindeer herding.

AB  - Reindeer is a semi-domesticated species that mostly lives free in nature and utilises the natural grazing area in northern marginal regions. Traditional herding originated from hunting and developed in Finland into an organised way of life with a special social structure of herder co-operatives (herding units). The Reindeer Herders' Association is an umbrella organisation for the co-operatives to promote common policies in reindeer husbandry. In Finland there are now about 4,600 reindeer owners. The number has recently decreased while the mean herd size has increased. Reindeer feed on a wide range of plants. In summer they eat wild plants. In the autumn they eat mushrooms and in winter lichens are an important source of feed. The winter pastures have degraded because of overgrazing and competing land uses (such as mining, forestry, peat harvesting, and tourism). Consequently, supplemental winter feeding is a common practice guaranteeing better survival. The main product from reindeer is meat. Reindeer meat is healthy, lean, and tasty, and the small amount produced ensures a prestige image. Marketing and direct sales yield higher prices, although with some fluctuations. The economic condition of the herders has room for improvement, although high monetary return is not the primary driving force keeping herders in this traditional system. The reindeer herders receive relatively small subsidies (18%) compared to the gross return of Finnish agricultural production. The herders like their work and consider it as an independent, traditional and nature-based occupation that supports their cultural heritage. The reindeer are gathered together twice a year, for ear-marking the new born calves and for culling the animals for slaughter. Despite the traditions of the special livelihood, the herders are willing to adopt new technology to ease the work. The herders know the importance of selective breeding and have decades ago changed the focus in the slaughter regime of calves to have lower grazing pressure in the winter and to improve the meat quality. Predation is considered among the single most serious threat to this livelihood. The predation pressure is highest in the eastern part of the reindeer herding area and hinders the possibilities for efficient management.

AB  - Coastal eutrophication by nutrient fluxes from agricultural land to marine recipients is presently combated by measures such as the implementation of watershed-scale wetland creation programs aimed at nitrogen removal. Such created agricultural wetlands - termed 'nitrogen farming wetlands' (NFWs) - receive nitrogen (N) loads predominantly as nitrate, facilitating N removal by denitrification. However, the conversion of agricultural soils into waterlogged wetland area is likely to increase climate gas emissions, particularly methane (CH4). There is thus a need to evaluate the benefits and risks of wetland creation at a large, watershed-scale.
   Here we investigate N retention and CH4 emission originating from watershed-scale wetland creation in South Sweden. the relation between both processes, and how CH4 emission depends on individual wetland parameters. We combine data from intensively studied reference wetlands with an extensive wetland survey to predict N retention and CH4 emission with simple models, to estimate the overall process rates (large-scale effects) as well as spatial variation among individual NFWs.
   We show that watershed-scale wetland creation serves targeted environmental objectives (N retention), and that CH4 emission is comparably low. Environmental benefit and risk of individual wetlands were not correlated, and may thus be managed independently. High cover of aquatic plants was the most important wetland property that suppressed CH4 net production, potentially facilitating N retention simultaneously. Further, differences between wetlands in water temperature and wetland age seemed to contribute to differences in CH4 net production. The nationally planned wetland creation (12,000 ha) could make a significant contribution to the targeted reduction of N fluxes (up to 27% of the Swedish environmental objective), at an environmental risk equaling 0.04% of the national anthropogenic climate gas emission.

AB  - The paper demonstrates the use of Bayesian networks in multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) of environmental design alternatives for environmental flows (eflows) and physical habitat remediation measures in the Mandalselva River in Norway. We demonstrate how MCDA using multi-attribute value functions can be implemented in a Bayesian network with decision and utility nodes. An object-oriented Bayesian network is used to integrate impacts computed in quantitative sub-models of hydropower revenues and Atlantic salmon smolt production and qualitative judgement models of mesohabitat fishability and riverscape aesthetics. We show how conditional probability tables are useful for modelling uncertainty in value scaling functions, and variance in criteria weights due to different stakeholder preferences. While the paper demonstrates the technical feasibility of MCDA in a BN, we also discuss the challenges of providing decision-support to a real-world habitat remediation process.

AB  - Humans describe the natural environment on the basis of their local experience and their interactions with nature in terms of its relevance to their daily lives. These descriptions are incorporated into local languages and form a specialized terminology that is unique and specifically applicable to needs and practices. In Guovdageaidnu (Kautokeino), Northern Norway, snow covers the ground more than seven months of the year in winter. Therefore, snow defines most of the conditions which must be met to support Sami reindeer pastoralism. Snow is a prerequisite for mobility, tracking, visibility and availability of pasture plants. The terms used to describe the snow on the ground include characteristics needed to communicate snow properties relevant to reindeer herding. In this paper, traditional Sami snow terms and their definitions are compared with the scientific and physical classification of snow on the ground. The study of traditional Sami snow terms was carried out through historical documentation and interviews with reindeer herders. The results showed that many traditional Sami terms describe snow conditions as they are defined by the international standard; whereas, other traditional terms describe the physical processes leading up to certain snow conditions. A group of snow terms have as their main purpose the clear communication of the snow conditions for reindeer herding to serve as a tool for internal communication within the herding community. A major finding was the herders' snow knowledge which was more holistic and integrated into the ecology of the herd and pastures than the international standard snow terms. The richness and relevance to reindeer herders of Sami traditional snow terms show a distinctly different view of snow compared to the purely physically-based international classifications. This paper gives an overview of the most important traditional terms, their definitions, and the physical processes associated with those terms. Application of the terms was compared to local weather conditions and the physical processes that created the different snow conditions. The analysis underscores the richness and accuracy of Sami snow terminology. In addition, this study illustrates the importance of using traditional Sami terminology when developing adaptation strategies to future climate change for Sami reindeer herding emphasizing the importance of two ways of knowing.

AB  - Spatial planning of Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) should ideally be based on well-evaluated and context specific solutions. One important obstacle to reach this goal relates to adequate provisioning of data to ensure good governance of BGI, i.e., appropriate planning, design, construction, and maintenance. This study explores the gap between data availability and implementation of BGI in urban planning authorities in Sweden. A multi method approach including brainstorming, semi-structured interviews with urban planners and experts on BGI and Geographical Information System (GIS), and validating workshops were performed to develop a framework for structured and user-friendly data collection and use. Identified challenges concern data availability, data management, and GIS knowledge. There is a need to improve the organisation of data management and the skills of trans-disciplinary cooperation to better understand and interpret different types of data. Moreover, different strategic goals require different data to ensure efficient planning of BGI. This calls for closer interactions between development of strategic political goals and data collection. The data management framework consists of three parts: A) Ideal structure of data management in relation to planning process, data infrastructure and organisational structure, and B) A generic list of data needed, and C) The development of structures for data gathering and access. We conclude that it is essential to develop pan-municipal data management systems that bridge sectors and disciplines to ensure efficient management of the urban environment, and which is able to support the involvement of citizens to collect and access relevant data. The framework can assist in such development.

TI  - FROM MICROHABITAT ECOHYDRAULICS TO AN IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF RIVER CATCHMENTS: BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN SCALES
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS

KW  - ECOLOGY
KW  - FLOW
AB  - Ecohydraulic studies in rivers range from local-scale studies, which target a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying biological responses to microhabitat hydraulics, to large-scale studies, which address the influence of hydro-morphological management on catchment biodiversity. A major challenge in the field is to bridge the gap between local- and large-scale studies, in order to base the large-scale physical management of rivers on general and transferable ecohydraulic processes. This Special Issue includes ten articles that illustrate progresses and difficulties to bridge this gap. It gathers microhabitat-scale studies focused on the identification of major ecohydraulic mechanisms, reach-scale studies that typically target generality and transferability across reaches, and examples of catchment-scale management based on general ecohydrological knowledge. The Special Issue illustrates how ecohydraulics have evolved to better integrate dynamic physical processes, ecological concepts and the consideration of ecosystem services. Although this remains challenging in practice, the Special Issue shows the need to integrate dynamic hydraulic descriptors of the environment for improving the cost-effectiveness of large-scale rivermanagement and restoration. These articles were presented at the 10th International Symposium on Ecohydraulics in Trondheim, Norway (2014), where the first symposium on ecohydraulics was organised 20 years before. The 10th issue of the symposium celebrated 20 years of ecohydraulic research and had about 300 delegates, giving 194 talks and presenting 86 posters.

AB  - A collective understanding of economic impacts and in particular of monetary costs of biological invasions is lacking for the Nordic region. This paper synthesizes findings from the literature on costs of invasions in the Nordic countries together with expert elicitation. The analysis of cost data has been made possible through the InvaCost database, a globally open repository of monetary costs that allows for the use of temporal, spatial, and taxonomic descriptors facilitating a better understanding of how costs are distributed. The total reported costs of invasive species across the Nordic countries were estimated at $8.35 billion (in 2017 US$ values) with damage costs significantly outweighing management costs. Norway incurred the highest costs ($3.23 billion), followed by Denmark ($2.20 billion), Sweden ($1.45 billion), Finland ($1.11 billion) and Iceland ($25.45 million). Costs from invasions in the Nordics appear to be largely underestimated. We conclude by highlighting such knowledge gaps, including gaps in policies and regulation stemming from expert judgment as well as avenues for an improved understanding of invasion costs and needs for future research.

AB  - Mapping spatiotemporal land cover changes offers opportunities to better understand trends and drivers of environmental change and helps to identify more sustainable land management strategies. This study investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in land covers, forest harvest areas and soil erosion rates in Nordic countries, namely Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. This region is highly sensitive to environmental changes, as it is experiencing high levels of human pressure and among the highest rates of global warming. An analysis that uses consistent land cover dataset to quantify and compares the recent spatiotemporal changes in land cover in the Nordic countries is missing. The recent products issued by the European Space Agency and the Copernicus Climate Change Service framework provide the possibility to investigate the historical land cover changes from 1992 to 2018 at 300 m resolution. These maps are then integrated with time series of forest harvest areas between 2004 and 2018 to study if and how forest management is represented in land cover products, and with soil erosion data to explore status and recent trends in agricultural land. Land cover changes typically involved from 4% to 9% of the total area in each country. Wetland showed the strongest reduction (11,003 km(2), 11% of the wetland area in 1992), followed by forest (8,607 km(2), 1%) and sparse vegetation (5,695 km(2), 7%), while agriculture (15,884 km(2), 16%) and settlement (3,582 km(2), 84%) showed net increases. Wetland shrinkage dominated land cover changes in Norway (5,870 km(2), 18%), followed by forest and grassland with a net gain of 3,441 km(2) (3%) and 3, 435 km(2) (10%), respectively. In Sweden, forest areas decreased 13,008 km(2) (4%), mainly due to agriculture expansion (9,211 km(2), 29%). In Finland, agricultural areas increased by 5,982 km(2) (24%), and wetland decreased by 6,698 km(2) (22%). Settlement had the largest net growth in Denmark (717 km(2), 70%), mainly from conversion of agriculture land. Soil erosion rates in Nordic countries are lower than the global average, but they are exacerbating in several locations (especially western Norway). The integration of the land cover datasets with maps of forest harvest areas shows that the majority of the losses in forest cover due to forestry operations are largely undetected, but a non-negligible share of the forest-to-agriculture (up to 19%) or forest-to-grassland (up to 51%) transitions overlap with the harvested sites. Forestry activity in the study region primarily involves small-scale harvest events that are difficult to be detected at the 300 m resolution of the land cover dataset. An accurate representation of forest management remains a challenge for global datasets of land cover time series, and more interdisciplinary international efforts are needed to address this gap. Overall, this analysis provides a detailed overview of recent changes in land cover and forest management in Nordic countries as represented by state-of-the-art global datasets, and offers insights to future studies aiming to improve these data or apply them in land surface models, climate models, landscape ecology, or other applications.

AB  - Joint research between economists and hydrologists increasingly contributes to optimising the economic value gained from water, while safeguarding its social and environmental values. The application of hydro-economic analysis to mining regions, however, is limited. This paper examines why this is the case and how to confront it. The paper focuses on identifying and describing features of large-scale mines and mine regions that are challenging to analyse such as: magnitude of capital involved, time-scale and remoteness of projects, inherent environmental risks, and strong negative perceptions about mining's impacts on water. These characteristics may limit the applicability of established hydro-economic concepts and methods, thus risk-based metrics are discussed as complementary tools. We also contend that further research and development in water-related ecosystem services should be a priority, in order to better quantify trade-offs between the economic benefits of water use by mining and competing users, including environmental flows. Case studies of mining regions in Chile, Madagascar and Sweden are summarised to illustrate some of the issues raised. While data limitations are an obstacle, new and extended case studies are required to explore how the challenges may be addressed.

AB  - Conservation initiatives to support declining water-related biodiversity through wetland creation have increased during the last decades. Multiple studies have evaluated the suitability of created wetlands for birds and amphibians, but only a few have considered the species associations that might also affect the outcome. Using joint species distribution models, we explored species associations of birds, amphibians and fish in 52 created biodiversity wetlands in Sweden. As most of these wetlands were primarily created for increasing bird diversity, we asked whether the occurrence of fish and amphibians relates to bird species richness, pair abundance and chick abundance (as a measure of reproductive success) and whether conservation conflicts or synergies between birds, amphibians and fish can be observed. In general, we found positive bird-amphibian association patterns and negative bird-fish association patterns, although the uncertainties were high for these estimates. In line with previous research, the generally negative bird-fish co-variance indicates potential conservation conflicts between wetland creation for birds and fish, where fish might be introduced for recreational fishing or other ecosystem services. Therefore, our results suggest that it can be hard to benefit bird and fish communities with the same wetland, and separate wetland creation with different goals may be needed. The generally positive birdamphibian species-species associations and the lack of previous studies revealing conflicts indicate synergies between wetland creation for birds and amphibians. However, research needs to further consolidate such synergies, including amphibian reproductive output from bird-rich wetlands.

AB  - Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) has been recognized for the production of multiple ecosystem services, and is seen as an alternative to clear-cut forestry (CF). Despite the increasing interest, it is still not well described how CCF would affect the carbon balance and the resulting climate benefit from the forest in relation to CF. This study compares carbon balances of CF and CCF, applied as two alternative land-use strategies for a heterogeneous Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand. We use a set of models to analyze the long-term effects of different forest management and wood use strategies in Sweden on carbon dioxide emissions and carbon stock changes. The results show that biomass growth and yield is more important than the choice of silvicultural system per se. When comparing CF and CCF assuming similar growth, extraction and product use, only minor differences in long-term climate benefit were found between the two principally different silvicultural systems.

AB  - The multi-scale approach to conserving forest biodiversity has been used in Sweden since the 1980s, a period defined by increased reserve area and conservation actions within production forests. However, two thousand forest-associated species remain on Sweden's red-list, and Sweden's 2020 goals for sustainable forests are not being met. We argue that ongoing changes in the production forest matrix require more consideration, and that multi-scale conservation must be adapted to, and integrated with, production forest development. To make this case, we summarize trends in habitat provision by Sweden's protected and production forests, and the variety of ways silviculture can affect biodiversity. We discuss how different forestry trajectories affect the type and extent of conservation approaches needed to secure biodiversity, and suggest leverage points for aiding the adoption of diversified silviculture. Sweden's long-term experience with multi-scale conservation and intensive forestry provides insights for other countries trying to conserve species within production landscapes.

AB  - Constructed stormwater ponds mitigate runoff volumes and pollution, and provide other ecosystem services, such as supporting biodiversity, but these services attracted relatively less attention. The impacts of the pollution levels in the water column and sediments, the physical characteristics of ponds, and the presence of amphibians on the macroinvertebrate community composition and biodiversity were explored in twelve stormwater ponds in Norway. Also, the similarities between macroinvertebrate, zooplankton and plant communities were explored. Most of the taxa displayed in the ordination diagram were positively correlated with the pond size and the number of neighbouring ponds, and negatively correlated with the pollution levels in the water column and sediments. However, no statistically significant impacts on the number of taxa and Shannon index were observed. There were low similarities between the macroinvertebrate and zooplankton community compositions as well as between the plant and macroinvertebrate community compositions in the stormwater ponds. We observed a significant positive correlation between the number of plant and of zooplankton taxa, and a weak non-significant positive correlation between the number of plant and of macroinvertebrate taxa. Overall, the explanatory variables had a significant impact on the community composition, but not on the number of taxa nor Shannon index.

AB  - The aim was to investigate relationships between emotion and cognition components of place-identity and wellbeing, before and after a natural disaster. A total of 656 respondents, living near the area of the largest forest and landscape fire in modern times in Sweden, participated in this study. Before the disaster, a positive association was found between place-identity and wellbeing, indicating that the stronger emotions participants evolved to the place, as well as remembered more and thought about the place, the stronger wellbeing they experienced at the site. After the disaster, the strength of this relationship decreased more than twice, accounted for by the weakening of the emotion-wellbeing link. Accordingly, participants almost lost their emotional bond to the area but maintained their memories and thoughts about the site intact and, by that, their positive wellbeing associations with the location. This indicates tentatively the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth, type of resilience involving operations of cognitive appraisal. (C)2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological intensification provides opportunity to increase agricultural productivity while minimizing negative environmental impacts, by supporting ecosystem services such as crop pollination and biological pest control. For this we need to develop targeted management solutions that provide critical resources to service-providing organisms at the right time and place. We tested whether annual strips of early flowering phacelia Phacelia tanacetifolia support pollinators and natural enemies of seed weevils Protapion spp., by attracting and offering nectar and pollen before the crop flowers. This was expected to increase yield of red clover Trifolium pratense seed. We monitored insect pollinators, pests, natural enemies and seed yields in a total of 50 clover fields along a landscape heterogeneity gradient, over 2years and across two regions in southern Sweden. About half of the fields were sown with flower strips of 125-2,000m(2). The clover fields were pollinated by 60% bumble bees Bombus spp. and 40% honey bees Apis mellifera. The clover seed yield was negatively associated with weevil density, but was unrelated to bee species richness and density. Flower strips enhanced bumble bees species richness in the clover fields, with the strongest influence in heterogeneous landscapes. There were few detectable differences between crop fields with and without flower strips. However, long-tongued bumble bees were redistributed toward field interiors and during phacelia bloom honey bees toward field edges. Clover seed yield also increased with increasing size of the flower strip. We conclude that annual flower strips of early flower resources can support bumble bee species richness and, if sufficiently large, possibly also increase crop yields. However, clover seed yield was mainly limited by weevil infestation, which was not influenced by the annual flower strips. A future goal should be to design targeted measures for pest control.

AB  - Agriculture is currently dominated by annual crops. A shift from annual to perennial cereals has been suggested as a way to improve the sustainability of agriculture. Such a shift may have impacts at multiple levels, from the field, to the farm, and the landscape. With a focus on Swedish farm production systems, farmers' views on the potential risks and possibilities of cultivating perennial cereals are discussed in light of the available knowledge regarding plant traits and ecological implications of perennial systems. Farmer interviews showed that potential changes in agricultural sustainability, if perennial cereals were to be introduced, are highly complex, and context specific. Perennial cereals could be part of a transition toward a more sustainable agriculture depending on how they are used in the local farming system and in the larger landscape. Efforts to increase the use of perennial crops require linking specific plant traits of the perennial crop to the properties of the farming systems where these crops would be employed.

AB  - Spatial planning using a landscape approach has been recognized as being essential for reconciling ecological, cultural and socio-economic dimensions in sustainable development (SuD). Although embraced as a concept, there is a lack of planning tools capable of incorporating multi-level, multifunctional and multi-sectoral perspectives, especially in a rural context. The departure point in this paper is the legal requirements for municipal comprehensive planning (MCP) in Sweden and an e-mail survey about incentives, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation in MCP in all 15 Swedish mountain municipalities. The purpose of this explorative study is to examine whether MCP could be a tool in planning for SuD. Results indicate a general lack of resources and a low status of MCP that affect, and even limit, stakeholder involvement, policy integration and implementation. However, legal requirements for MCP are targeted at SuD, and municipal personnel responsible for planning appreciate the potential of MCP. Therefore, there is potential to develop the MCP into an effective landscape planning tool. To accomplish this, the status of an active planning process has to be raised, the mandate of the local planning agency has to be secured, and residents and land users have to be involved throughout the planning process.

AB  - Clean water is not only the product of expensive treatment technology, but also of upstream ecosystems. Yet, the effect of land use on downstream water quality is poorly understood. We investigate the value of ecosystem water purification as an input to the production of drinking water in Sweden. We employ a recently modified empirical approach, complementing ex-ante modelling. We capture plant operator behaviour, rather than assuming rational individuals that value ecosystem services as a factor in the drinking water production function. The GMM technique is applied to estimate the marginal contributions of different land uses to water quality and chemical costs of treatment plants. The analysis is based on upstream land-use data, raw water quality, and chemical costs for a large share of Sweden's municipal surface water treatment plants, for the period 2000 to 2012. Our results show that upstream forests lead to lower levels of E. coli (a pathogen associated with disease outbreaks) in downstream water and indicate the same effect on turbidity (not significant). We also find that turbidity increases treatment costs, but the effect of E. coli remains unclear. Consequently, in addition to water treatment equipment, decision-makers should consider investment in upstream ecosystems.

AB  - Within organic crop production, weed interference remains one of the main constraints on productivity, yet diverse weed vegetation supports the ecosystem services of arable fields. The use of crop diversification could alter weed communities and increase diversity, preventing the dominance of single detrimental weed species. This study investigated the type of crop diversification implemented in organic cropping systems in northern Europe and whether this affects the arable weed vegetation. A weed survey was conducted in 207 organic springsown cereal fields in five northern European regions (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia and Sweden). Weed density data were combined with management and crop diversification data collected on the farms. The data set was analysed using linear mixed models and multivariate ordinations. The 197 weed species recorded were representative for the type of organic arable farming conducted in the regions. The management and crop diversification variables studied differed considerably among the regions. Management, such as the type of spring-sown cereal and crop mixture during monitoring, the preceding crop and weed harrowing, primarily influenced weed densities, while weed diversity increased with the duration of organic management and use of winter cover crops. The weed species communities were altered by the crop diversification applied. This study reflects the impact of regionally varied crop diversity and reinforces the importance of regionally adapted crop and weed management.

AB  - While the potential of plants to uptake polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is widely acknowledged, empirical evidence of the effects of this process on local atmospheric PAH concentrations and human health is tenuous. We measured gaseous PAH concentrations using passive samplers in urban tree-covered areas and adjacent open, treeless areas in a near-road environment in Finland to gain information on the ability of urban vegetation to improve air quality. The ability of urban, mostly deciduous, vegetation to affect PAHs was season dependent: during summer, concentrations were significantly higher in tree-covered areas, while in the fall, concentrations in open areas exceeded those in tree-covered areas. During winter, concentrations in tree-covered areas were either lower or did not differ from those in open areas. Results of this study imply that the commonly believed notion that trees unequivocally improve air quality does not apply to PAHs studied here. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance of considering spatial dimensions in welfare analysis is increasingly acknowledged, but there are still knowledge gaps. For this purpose, we turn to environmental psychology and use place attachment, the functional and emotional bond people have to a defined place. We conduct a stated preference study of new recreational mountain homes in southeast Norway and investigate the concept of place attachment to explain spatial preference heterogeneity towards reducing recreational home developments and preserving the mountain landscape and biodiversity. Using structural equation modelling, we find that place attachment is spatially determined and helps explain spatial variations in pro-environmental preferences and distance decay in nonmarket values. In contrast to most previous studies, place attachment reduces pro-environmental behaviour across the entire sample. However, among respondents preferring the smallest development plan, we find that place attachment explains a substantial part of an identified distance decay effect in willingness-to-pay (WTP). About 55 per cent of the negative impact of travel time on WTP indirectly channels through reduced place attachment. Place attachment also substantially improves the fit of our econometric model. Place attachment may provide valuable information on the affected populations when evaluating land-use policies.

AB  - Afforestation can improve the delivery of ecosystem services from reclaimed landfill sites. Tree health is a key determinant of ecosystem service delivery, and is directly impacted by soil quality; which is driven by biological processes in the soil, reliant on leaf litter inputs to function. Different tree species have different litter quality, affecting the degree to which they support biological processes in soils and the development of abundant and diverse soil faunal communities. In recognition of their key role in improving soil structure and fertility-key attributes of soil quality, earthworms have often been the subject of research as a part of land reclamation, and these organisms have displayed preferences for specific types of leaf litter. This work utilised a choice chamber design to measure the foliar material palatability of two tree species used in land restoration (Alnus cordata and Acer platanoides) as a food source for two common European earthworm species (Aporrectodea longa and Allolobophora chlorotica), and the effect of a reclaimed soil quality on earthworm growth, survival and feeding preferences. The research revealed that both earthworm species initially preferred the foliar material of A. cordata over A. platanoides, with the leaves of the latter requiring higher degradation to become palatable to earthworms. The consumption of fresh leaves showed these are a suitable food source for earthworms in choice chamber experiments, which historically have instead relied on senescent leaf litter. Finally, high survival rates of both A. longa and A. chlorotica in the reclaimed soil treatment, in addition to consumption of leaf material of two tree species now widely used on reclaimed landfill sites, demonstrated that these earthworm species are suitable candidates for inoculation to reclaimed land.

AB  - Neighbourhood green space is an important asset for the urban population, providing valuable ecosystem services such as supporting human health. Distance or access to urban green areas is well established as being important for the potential use of the area but how different demographic groups move within greenspace is still somewhat unknown.
   Previous studies have shown that there are gender as well as age differences in visual perception, audio experience and recreational activities as well as estimated well-being experienced from use of urban green space. Here we explored people's movement within their local green space in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. The results showed that movement took place over large parts of the green spaces studied, not only along paths. The data further showed that the movement pattern differed significantly between men and women as well as between young adults and old adults. Movement patterns of demographic groups could provide support to planning for sustainable urban green areas, help avoid conflict, identify areas for solitude and ensure equal access for people of different gender and age.

AB  - Forest landowners are interested in management alternatives which do not involve clearfelling and planting. Also many citizens that do not own forest are against clear-felling do to its harmful effects on amenity values and ecosystem services. Most studies on continuous cover forest management (CCF) deal with regular, steady state uneven-aged forests (Plenterwald), or with the conversion of stands into steady-state structure. However, people who want CCF management seldom want Plenterwald in particular; continuous tree cover would in most cases be sufficient. This type of management corresponds to the German Dauerwald concept This study compared the profitability of Plenterwald, Dauerwald and clear-cutting schedules in Finnish spruce forests. As expected, Dauerwald was more profitable than cutting schedules that converted the stand into steady-state Plenterwald structure. The difference in net present value decreased with increasing number of conversion cuttings. Clear-cutting and planting was more profitable than optimal CCF only in a mature initial stand when the planted spruces were assumed to grow 20% faster in dbh and height, compared to naturally regenerated spruces. In young, medium-aged and uneven-aged initial' stands, CCF was more profitable even when 20% tree breeding benefit was assumed in the plantation that was established in the clear-felling site.

AB  - The indigenous Riddu Riddu Festival, organized yearly in the village of Olmaivaggi/ Manndalen (Sapmi/Norway), presents the cultures of Sami people and indigenous peoples across the world. A study of the activities offered at Riddu Riddu over an eleven-year period (2009-2019) carried out. Through fieldwork (forty-six in-depth interviews, participant observations and document analysis), I contemplated how sports, physical and outdoor activities included in the festival create indigenous people's identities and cultural understanding. Sami sports and other indigenous sports and outdoor life are crucial parts of the festival, especially at the Children's Festival: Manaidfestivala. The activities represent different ethnicities and seem to create sustained ties between persons, networks and organizations and to build identities and bridges between participants. Taking part in festival activities claimed to be crucial symbolic capital, or poly cultural capital, in expressing indigeneity or in the creation of 'indigenous hearts' by participants, staff and volunteers at the festival.

AB  - Private land often encompasses biodiversity features of high conservation value, but its protection is not straightforward. Commonly, landowners' perspectives are rightfully allowed to influence conservation actions. This unlikely comes without consequences on biodiversity or other aspects such as economic considerations, but these consequences are rarely quantitatively considered in decision-making. In the context of boreal mire protection in Finland, we report how acknowledging landowners' resistance to protection changes the combination of mires selected to conservation compared to ignoring landowners' opinions. Using spatial prioritization, we quantify trade-offs arising between the amount of landowners' resistance, protected biodiversity, and financial costs in different conservation scenarios. Results show that the trade-offs cannot be fully avoided. Nevertheless, we show that the systematic examination of the trade-offs opens up options to alleviate them. This can promote the evaluation of different conservation policy outcomes, enabling better-informed conservation decisions and more effective and socially sustainable allocation of conservation resources.

AB  - The forestry and reindeer herding sectors utilize the same land in northern Sweden, and adversely affect each other's productivity. The common pool resource character of this situation has made it difficult to find ways to resolve conflicts that could threaten the two sectors' continued co-existence. A consultation procedure that was introduced to reduce conflicts does not appear to be effective, since conflicts between the two actors still occur. One reason for this failure might be found in the power distribution between forestry and reindeer herding. Earlier research has shown that a co-management system in which the allocation of power between the stakeholders is uneven is difficult to maintain in the long term. However, it is unclear just how uneven the power distribution is between the two actors in this case, and the consequences the disparity might have for the viability and stability of the management system. Focusing on the power relations within the consultation procedures, this paper explores the potential of the present institutional system to take the different interests of the stakeholders into account and to use the consultation procedures as tools for co-managing the forest resources in northern Sweden.

AB  - To achieve a more sustainable food sector, a supply chain approach is needed. In this study, experts in different areas along supply chains co-operated in an interactive process to define future environmentally sustainable supply chains of milk and beef. The basis was to use existing techniques, to have production performance corresponding to the best quartile of today and to consider other sustainability aspects, such as economics. The work resulted in concrete descriptions of alternative product chains for delivered milk and beef. To also permit concrete descriptions of the latter part of the product chains, two consumer-packed end products were selected for monitoring, namely fresh milk and sirloin steak. The production systems investigated comprised cropping, livestock production, industrial processing and production, logistics, packaging and wastage and distribution, but not retailers or consumers. The study area was a Swedish county and the reference level was its production of milk and beef in 2012. The future product chains were assumed, to deliver the same amounts of commodities as in 2012, but with reduced environmental impact. Primary production was required to be at least as profitable as today. Beside description of the current situation, three alternative scenarios were created, focusing on delivery of ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation and minimising climate impact, respectively. Life cycle assessments were performed for these four scenarios (reference plus three alternative scenarios) for single-product chains and county-wide. Furthermore, production costs in primary production were calculated for the four scenarios. The results revealed great potential to reduce the negative environmental impact of Swedish dairy and beef production at current volumes, irrespective of whether ecosystem services, plant nutrient circulation or climate impact is in focus. The single most important factor for decreased environmental impact for livestock production was increased production efficiency. Measures in agriculture, especially concerning feeds, were critical, but actions in processing and distribution also contributed. All alternative scenarios resulted in lower production costs than at present. It was obvious that as dairy and beef systems are connected, the potential for their environmental improvement must be analysed together. In conclusion, increased efficiency can decrease the negative environmental impact of Swedish cattle production and also reduce costs to the farmer.

AB  - Thinning operations that occur in managed red pine (Pinus resinosa) stands, create tree stumps that can serve as a habitat for fungi, especially Heterobasidion irregulare, the cause of a serious root disease. Different fungi can colonize stumps early and the community of fungi can change over time as initial fungal species become replaced. Samples were collected from both the native and non-native range of red pine from stumps that were cut at different time periods. Stumps that were harvested at 0-1, 2-3, 5-6, and 10-12 years before sampling were used to provide data on the diversity of fungi that colonize tree stumps and how these communities can change over time as well as how they influence colonization of H. irregulare. Traditional culturing methods and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were used to identify the fungi in the samples. Of particular interest was Phlebiopsis gigantea, which can colonize cut stumps and prevent H. irregulare from becoming established. Overall, P. gigantea was the most abundant fungus isolated and sequenced via Illumina MiSeq. Results show that Phlebiopsis gigantea was isolated from 90% of all stumps sampled for sites harvested within 3 years of sampling in the native range of red pine compared to 33% in the non-native range. For Illumina MiSeq, 5,940 total amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were detected. P. gigantea represented 14% of the total reads and composed 19% of the reads in the native range and 8% in non-native range of red pine. Furthermore, P. gigantea represented 38% of the reads for stumps that were harvested within 3 years of sampling in the native range of red pine compared to 14% in the non-native range. These results help demonstrate that a higher amount of P. gigantea is present in the native range of red pine and could be acting as a native biological control agent. Additional fungi, including Resinicium bicolor, Hypochnicium cremicolor, Leptographium spp., and others identified at different cutting times are also discussed. Finally, different diversity indices revealed similar, but slightly higher diversity for southern sites via Shannon and Simpson Diversity indices. Beta diversity demonstrated a similar species composition in stumps harvested at different times with these stumps being grouped together based on harvesting years.

AB  - A dramatic increase in bark-beetle (Ips typographus) damage in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests occured in the provinces Upper and Lower Austria in the past decade with the beetle outbreak likely driven by climate change. Water shortage in the early growing season appears to weaken the forests. The high supply of beetle-infested timber is reducing wood prices and forests are not meeting policy expectations for a viable bioeconomy. The sink strength of forests has diminished from 12% to 6% of the national greenhouse gas emission budget and may even turn into a source when the disturbance dynamics continue. Consequences cascade through the forest sector. The regional market price for bark-beetle affected timber declined to 30% of the previous level. Small-forest owners who obtain a marginal income from wood products are losing motivation for active forest management. The operational difficulties of cutting affected trees combined with the organization of timber transport to saw-mills are being met by excessive inventories of unprocessed logs at mills. Large forest enterprises can only intermittently absorb higher costs for forest management than be met currently from sales of products. The long-term consequence is lasting reduction of forest productivity and an uncertain future for forestry in Central Europe that may increasingly depend on technological breakthroughs in processing timber from deciduous trees and eventually payments for ecosystem services.

AB  - Improving our understanding of how different tree species function in urban stormwater management systems is important, as tree pits may provide a temporary reservoir for stormwater and as trees have the potential to actively reduce stormwater runoff by transpiration. While urban tree planting pits are increasingly used for shortterm water storage during stormwater runoff events, this storage can have negative effects on both tree vitality and water removal capacity, since stress from waterlogging result in stomatal closure. However, sensitivity to water stress varies by species. It is therefore important to determine which tree species can maintain long-term vitality and continued transpiration even under water stress, and thus are suitable for such locations. Here, we studied how nine different tree species, varying in expected tolerance to water stress, were affected by short-term and seasonal waterlogging, in a greenhouse experiment. The seedlings (Magnolia x loebneri, Tilia tomentosa, and Sorbus torminalis - low water logging tolerance; Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Rhamnus cathartica, and Fraxinus ornus - medium water logging tolerance; Quercus palustris, Acer saccharinum, and Fraxinus pennsylvanica - high water logging tolerance) were exposed to two days, five days and seasonal waterlogging. The treatments reflected best practice (optimal), suboptimal and total lack of tree pit drainage, using Swedish standards. Stomatal conductance and leaf water potential were determined regularly over a period of 71 days, and morphological adjustments were registered. Four of the species were affected already after two days of waterlogging, with reduced stomatal conductance either during the waterlogging or immediately after, and only the most waterlogging tolerant species were unaffected by the five-day treatment. However, all plants survived waterlogging for almost 30 days before the estimated permanent wilting was reached in some plants. We suggest that tree species selection for stormwater management systems should consider the species' capacity to maintain high stomatal conductance during waterlogging, as there were clear differences between species. The effectiveness of the selected species could have an important impact on the stormwater management capacity of cities, as well as on other aspects of ecosystem service delivery from urban trees.

AB  - The bio-economically optimal stock size of the alien invasive red king crab in the Barents Sea, representing a commercial value as well as a threat to the ecosystem and its services, is explored assuming linear as well as non-linear relationships between crab stock size and ecosystem damage. The results show that the management goal of harvesting the crab at maximum sustainable yield cannot be reconciled with the overall objective of the Barents Sea management plan of securing ecosystem structure. The importance of identifying the correct damage relationship is demonstrated by large differences in optimal stock sizes and altered sensitivity of the models to input parameters. The analysis also shows the importance of knowing the carrying capacity of the crab stock as well as the carrying capacity of the natural ecosystem with respect to the crab.

TI  - Outdoor life, nature experience, and sports in Norway: tensions and dilemmas in the preservation and use of urban forest
T2  - SPORT IN SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - How should contemporary societies promote physical activity in nature and preservation of the natural environment? Outdoor life occupies a central and contested position on this question in the Nordic countries. In Norway, a 1957 Act of Parliament took a major step by guaranteeing free public access to both public and private uncultivated land. This article explores the media debate that raged in 2008-2009, when the national government proposed new legislation intended to promote outdoor life, sport, nature experience and urban forest preservation around Oslo, Norway's capital. Applying narrative and discourse methodologies, this case study reveals how the media debate evolved from an initial cacophony of voices into a schism between advocates of nature preservation and advocates of sport. The controversy explored here is increasingly relevant throughout all of Europe: how to encourage urban active living, sustainable recreation and democratic citizenship that embody distinct social practices, identities, emotional bonds and symbolic meaning.

AB  - This paper investigates the development of the electricity-supply systems in Northern Europe (Germany, UK, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Norway) until the year 2050. The focus is on the response to an assumed common stringent CO(2)-reduction target and on the role of carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS). Special emphasis is put on turn-over in capital stock, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large-scale introduction of CCS. The analysis is carried out through scenario analysis with the aid of a techno-economic model, in which a case including CCS is compared to a case excluding this option. The phase out of the present capital stock (power plants) is included from the Chalmers energy infrastructure databases, which gives information on present and planned power plants down to block level for plants exceeding 10 MW net electric power. Assuming technical lifetimes for these plants yield residual capacities in each year, here referred to as the phase-out pattern. CCS technologies are assumed to become commercially available in 2020.
   The age structure of the power plants indicate that full turn-over in capital stock will take several decades with the present generation capacities accounting for around 50% of generated electricity in 2020. The results show that CO(2) emission reductions of 20% and 60% by the years 2020 and 2050, respectively, relative to 1990, can be met at a marginal cost of abatement of about 25-40 (sic)/ton CO(2) over the period studied if CCS is included as an option from 2020. At the same time the marginal cost of generating electricity lies in the range 45-60 (sic)/MWh. Excluding CCS raises the marginal cost of abatement with about 10 (sic)/ton CO(2), whereas the marginal cost of electricity generation increases with roughly 5-10 (sic)/MWh. The CO(2) target by the year 2020 is met by implementation of renewable electricity and fuel shifting from coal to gas. After 2020 CCS technologies constitute an attractive way for cost efficient and almost CO(2)-free base load. However, wide-spread application of CCS is an infrastructural challenge with respect to implementing capture plants as well as building up a corresponding CO(2) infrastructure for transportation and storage as well as in coal supply systems. Given the price assumptions applied, gas may not be competitive once CCS enters the system causing early retirements of such units or possibly stranded assets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Changes in the genetic structure of the lettuce crop (Lactuca sativa ) and populations of the lettuce downy mildew pathogen (Bremia lactucae ) in Germany from 1974 to 1997 were studied and the genetic and population genetic results of race surveys of B. lactucae were reinterpreted. Data on 176 B. lactucae isolates collected from L. sativa cultivars at 48 sites in 11 German federal states were analysed. The host population contained 12 well-defined race-specific resistance genes (Dm1, Dm2, Dm3, Dm4, Dm5/8, Dm6, Dm7, Dm11, R12, Dm13, Dm16 and R18). However, only some of these genes (e.g. Dm3, Dm7, Dm11, Dm16 and R18) played an important role in management of resistance in the host crop. Substantial changes in the frequencies of these R-genes were recorded over the period as a reaction to the occurrence of new virulent phenotypes in the pathogen population. Generally, the durability of resistance was very short. However, distinct regional patterns were observed for the frequencies of different virulence (v) factors. The data on changes in the virulence of B. lactucae population exemplified well the process of host-pathogen coevolution. During the period studied, there was a considerable increase in the frequency of some v-factors (v2, v3, v5/8, v6, v7, v11 and v16) and in the complexity of v-phenotypes, while the diversity in the pathogen population in general decreased. In 1996/97, 12 of the 14 v-factors evaluated reached frequencies higher than 0.90 in the pathogen population. Relatively low frequencies were observed only for factors v14 (0.17) and v18 (0.24). The presence of 23 v-factors was studied in six German isolates virulent on lettuce cultivar Titan, possessing the resistance gene R36 derived from Lactuca saligna and introduced in German lettuce crops during the mid-1990s. Isolate DEG2 showed the highest complexity of v-phenotype; it overcame the resistance in cv. Mariska (R18) and line CS-RL (R18+?), but some sporulation occurred also on cv. Titan (Dm6 + R36). Conversely, the isolates SR2 and SAW1 overcame resistance based on R36, but were avirulent to R18. Future utilization of R-genes in commercial lettuce cultivars is proposed; R-genes R18 and R36 could be considered most efficient for this purpose. However, they may be effective only in certain regions.

AB  - The planning, implementation, and everyday use of the built environment interweave the green and grey components of urban fabric tightly together. Runoff from grey and impermeable surfaces causes stormwater that is managed in permeable surfaces that simultaneously act as habitats for vegetation. Green infrastructure (GI) is one of the concepts that is used to perceive, manage, and guide the components of urban green spaces. Furthermore, GI pays special attention to stormwater management and urban vegetation at several scales at the same time. This study concentrated on scalable GI in domestic private gardens. A set of garden designs in Vuores, Finland were analyzed and developed by Research by Design. The aim was to study how garden scale choices and designs can enhance GI at the block and neighbourhood scales to rethink design practices to better integrate water and vegetation throughout the scales. As a result, we propose a checklist for designers and urban planners that ensures vegetation-integrated stormwater management to enhance habitat diversity in block scale and possibility to use blocks of private plots for ecological networks. The prerequisite for garden designers is to be capable to balance between water, vegetation, and soil, and their processes and flows in detail the scale.

AB  - The quantification of post-disturbance root reinforcement (RR) recovery dynamics is of paramount importance for the optimisation of forest ecosystem services and natural hazards risk management in mountain regions. In this work we analyse the long-term root reinforcement dynamic of spruce forests combining data of the Swiss National Forest Inventory with data on root distribution and root mechanical properties. The results show that root reinforcement recovery depends primarily on stand altitude and slope inclination. The maximum root reinforcement recovery rate is reached at circa 100 years. RR increases continuously with different rates for stand ages over 200 years. These results shows that RR in spruce stands varies considerably depending on the local conditions and that its recovery after disturbances requires decades. The new method applied in this study allowed for the first time to quantify the long term dynamics of RR in spruce stands supporting new quantitative approaches for the analysis of shallow landslides disposition in different disturbance regimes of forests.

AB  - The current, dominating strategy of nature conservation within urban landscapes is to formally protect remaining patches of unexploited nature in nature reserves. However, integration of nature conservation frameworks into urban planning requires reconsideration of key issues, such as why, where, and how to protect nature in a purposeful way. As part of that process I statistically evaluate current nature conservation in 209 municipalities in southern Sweden by analysing the number, size, age, and land cover patterns of 1869 nature reserves in relation to the degree of urbanisation. The analyses reveal that in urban municipalities the nature reserves are fewer, but larger, and have a higher diversity of land covers. Having large nature reserves may be especially important in urban landscapes, since it is often highly fragmented. The land cover compositions show no differences between urban and rural nature reserves. However, urban nature reserves differ more from their surroundings compared with rural nature reserves, according to the identified changes in representation of land cover types with an increasing degree of urbanisation. The most urgent future challenge identified is to develop urban nature conservation strategies that are integrated into the urban context including other green areas and built-up areas, the land-use history, and the requirements for local ecosystem services across the landscape.

AB  - Soil moisture influences and is influenced by water, climate, and ecosystem conditions, affecting associated ecosystem services in the landscape. This paper couples snow storage-melting dynamics with an analytical modeling approach to screening basin-scale, long-term soil moisture variability and change in a changing climate. This coupling enables assessment of both spatial differences and temporal changes across a wide range of hydro-climatic conditions. Model application is exemplified for two major Swedish hydrological basins, Norrstrom and Pitealven. These are located along a steep temperature gradient and have experienced different hydro-climatic changes over the time period of study, 1950-2009. Spatially, average intra-annual variability of soil moisture differs considerably between the basins due to their temperature-related differences in snow dynamics. With regard to temporal change, the long-term average state and intra-annual variability of soil moisture have not changed much, while inter-annual variability has changed considerably in response to hydro-climatic changes experienced so far in each basin.

AB  - The societal demands on forest management are becoming increasingly diverse, which will be reflected in decisions made by forest owners. We examined the willingness of private forest owners in Austria, Finland, Germany, Slovenia, and Sweden to participate in a contract-based payment scheme in which they were asked to apply a specific management strategy to promote either timber production or environmental goals. The preferences for the contract-based management and associated consequences in terms of profitability, biodiversity, carbon stock, and climate change-induced damages were addressed within a choice experiment. A majority of respondents across all countries agreed to participate in a payment scheme to promote environmental goals, while schemes purely targeted to increase wood production were found less attractive. Forest owners liked improvements in profitability and environmental attributes and disliked deterioration of these attributes. Differences among countries were found in the level of expected contract payments, and commonalities were found with respect to preferences towards environmental goals, including biodiversity and carbon stocks. Hence, new policies to target European forest subsidy to promote the provision of environmental goals would likely be acceptable.

AB  - Swedish policies aim at conserving biological production, biodiversity, cultural heritage and recreational assets. This requires compositionally and structurally functional networks of representative habitats, the processes that maintain them, and resilient ecosystems. The term green infrastructure (GI) captures this. We review (1) policy concerning forest biodiversity conservation from the 1990s; (2) the implementation outputs, including the formulation of short-term and evidence-based long-term goals for protected areas, education, and the development of hierarchical spatial planning; (3) the consequences in terms of formally protected and voluntarily set-aside forest stands, as well as conservation management and habitat restoration. We assess the successes and failures regarding policy, outputs and consequences, discuss challenges to be addressed, and suggest solutions. Policies capture evidence-based knowledge about biodiversity, and evidence-based conservation planning as an output. However, the desired consequences are not met on the ground. Thus, the amount of formally protected and voluntary set-aside forests are presently too low, and have limited quality and poor functional connectivity. GI functionality is even declining because of forestry intensification, and insufficient conservation. Challenges include limited collaborative learning among forest and conservation planners, poor funding to conserve forest habitats with sufficient size, quality and connectivity, and national politics that ignores evidence-based knowledge. As solutions, we highlight the need for diversification of forest management systems with a landscape perspective that matches forest owner objectives and regional social-ecological contexts. This requires integrative approaches to knowledge production, learning and spatial planning.

AB  - Community-based conservation, where local decision makers are responsible for balancing conservation and development, is often preferred to exclusionary conservation that prioritizes use-limitation through strict regulation. Unraveling the evidence for conservation impact of different governance regimes is challenging. Focusing on conservation practices before and after a reform can provide an early indication of behavioral changes acting as a precursor to changes in social and ecological outcomes, which generally need more time to materialize. A recent reform in Norway provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of local empowerment on conservation practices in protected areas. We analyzed 1,466 decisions in 31 protected areas before and after the reform while accounting for differences between private and public property ownership. We found that the conservation practices were liberal both before and after the reform. The impact of local empowerment on conservation practices was contingent on land tenure: more use was allowed after the reform on private land. We conclude that conservation impact evaluations could benefit from a before-and-after spatial approach taking into account land tenure for analyzing the impacts of local decision making.

AB  - Host and habitat selection in flight by conifer bark beetles is governed by inhibition of attraction by non-host volatiles (NHV), in addition to the well-known attraction to kairomones from host plants and to aggregation pheromones from conspecifics. Antennally-active NHV from angiosperm birch and aspen trees were field tested on the European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus (L.), by pheromone baited traps in Sweden using release rates of NHV comparable to those from a non-host tree. Trap catches were significantly reduced by 50-70% by individual NHV: trans-conophthorin, 3-octanol and 1-octen-3-ol from non-host bark, 1-hexanol and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol from both leaves and bark and (E)-2-hexen-1-ol from leaves. Combined NHV signals in binary and ternary blends with the same overall release rates (ca 5 mg/day) showed both redundancy and synergism in their inhibitory effects. The redundancy occurred among individual green leaf alcohols (GLV-alcohols or C-6-alcohols), C-8-alcohols, and between these two groups, while trans-conophthorin and verbenone (Vn, from unsuitable host trees) showed significant synergistic effects between each other and with GLV-alcohols or C-8-alcohols. The coexistence of redundancy and synergism in non-host chemical signals may indicate different functional levels (non-host habitats, species, and unsuitable host trees) of these negative volatile signals in the host selection process of conifer bark beetles. We showed an active inhibitory range (AIR) of a NHV-blend plus Vn on a standard pheromone bait to be at least 2 m, by using a central pheromone trap and surrounding concentric barrier trap rings with radii of 1, 2, and 4 m. The influx of bark beetles flying across concentric rings within the AIR was reduced by 55-99%, depending on the distance to the central pipe trap. Our findings support the hypothesis that as mixed forests have greater semiochemical diversity than pure host stands; they disturb olfactory guided host choice, and may reduce the possibility of outbreaks of conifer-infesting bark beetles. The synergistic effects as well as the active inhibitory range found in this study also suggest that optimal combinations of these NHV and verbenone may have potential in protecting forests against L typographus by reducing or stopping attacks on suitable host trees. Mixed stands with higher semio-chemical diversity disturb olfactory guided host choice and reduce the risk for outbreaks of specialist herbivores. This 'semiochemical-diversity hypothesis' provides new support to the general 'stability-diversity hypothesis'.

AB  - Intensification of arable crop production degrades soil health and production potential through loss of soil organic carbon. This, potentially, reduces agriculture's resilience to climate change and thus food security. Furthermore, the expected increase in frequency of adverse and extreme weather events due to climate change are likely to affect crop yields differently, depending on when in the growing season they occur. We show that soil carbon provides farmers with a natural insurance against climate change through a gain in yield stability and more resilient production. To do this, we combined yield observations from 12 sites and 54 years of Swedish long-term agricultural experiments with historical weather data. To account for heterogenous climate effects, we partitioned the growing season into four representative phases for two major cereal crops. Thereby, we provide evidence that higher soil carbon increases yield gains from favourable conditions and reduces yield losses due to adverse weather events and how this occurs over different stages of the growing season. However, agricultural management practices that restore the soil carbon stock, thus contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, usually come at the cost of foregone yield for the farmer in the short term. To halt soil degradation and make arable crop production more resilient to climate change, we need agricultural policies that address the public benefits of soil conservation and restoration.

AB  - Forest management, characterized in many northern countries by the predominance of clear cutting and growing even-aged and -sized trees, has simplified the structure of boreal forests. Consequences include alterations in cultural ecosystem services such as forest attractiveness, i.e., combined aesthetic and recreational values. Continuous-cover forestry might mitigate these effects through the use of selection and gap cutting, but these methods have been little studied, particularly from the attractiveness viewpoint. We used photo surveys to assess Finnish citizens' perceptions of attractiveness of in-stand scenery of Scots pine (Finns sylvestris L.) forests logged using different methods. (i) The attractiveness scores, given by respondents, declined steadily from unharvested forest through continuous-cover methods to seed-tree and clear-cut methods. (ii) Respondents with a negative attitude to forest management gave lower scores than respondents with a positive attitude, but the declining slopes of attractiveness against logging intensity were similar. (iii) In unharvested and less intensively managed stands, summer photos received higher scores than corresponding winter photos. (iv) Background variables (gender, education, living environment, memberships in recreational or nature NGOs, forestry profession, and forest ownership) had negligible effects on the scores. We recommend the use of continuous-cover logging methods in settlement and recreational areas.

AB  - Long-term livestock grazing has shaped landscapes, biodiversity, societies, cultures, and economies in the North Atlantic over time. However, overgrazing has become a major environmental sustainability challenge for this region, covering the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, and Scotland. The objective of this study was to elicit narratives and spatial patterns of local people's management preferences for sheep grazing in the Faroe Islands through a socio-cultural lens. We collected data via a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) survey with an open question about hopes and concerns for sheep management in the Faroe Islands and a mapping exercise for expressing spatial preferences for sheep management. Four distinct narratives emerged from a qualitative analysis of responses to the open question (n = 184): (1) Sustainable sheep management, (2) Nature without sheep, (3) Sheep as part of Faroese culture, and (4) Sheep as nuisance. Visual inspection of narrative-specific maps with locations where either no or fewer sheep were preferred indicated that sheep management is not simply a 'sheep vs. no sheep' issue but embedded in a more nuanced consideration of the place of sheep in the landscape and society. For example, for some residents sheep-farming is not a commercial enterprise but a social activity and local source of food. Our combined methodological approach using qualitative and spatial data can help researchers in other fields identify the interplay between place-specific areas of grazing management concern and socio-cultural values, enabling more targeted land-use management policies or plans.

AB  - Boreal forests are warming faster than the rest of the planet. Do the benefits of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons for forest productivity exceed the negative effects of more frequent dry spells and heat waves, shifting precipitation patterns, and higher evaporative demands? And are the effects uniformly distributed geographically? To answer to these questions, the relationship between climatic variables and NDVI-a proxy of forest productivity at regional scale-was explored via Partial Least Square (PLS) regression analyses. We focused on Northern Europe, where contrasting findings on the effects of warming have been reported and that has so far been overlooked by systematic large-scale explorations of the linkages between boreal forest productivity and climatic conditions. The results show that the effects of warmer temperatures on boreal forest productivity are not uniformly positive and that water stress is already negatively affecting these forests. Indeed, increased temperatures appear beneficial in northern and wetter regions, while warmer temperatures mostly reduce forest productivity in southern and drier areas. These results are suggestive of already existing limitations due to water availability and warm temperatures, even in mesic regions like Northern Europe. These conditions are expected to become more frequent and intense in the future, potentially reducing the ability of boreal forests to provide their essential ecosystem services unless forest management practices are adapted to the new conditions.

AB  - Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic have for millennia relied on freshwaters for drinking water and freshwater species that comprise important subsistence harvests, which promotes a strong connection to the land and unique understanding of organisms and ecosystem processes and changes. Despite the importance of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services to Arctic Indigenous communities, there have been limited attempts to summarise available Indigenous Knowledge (IK) regarding Arctic freshwater systems and to understand how conservation can benefit from this knowledge base. This paper presents a systematic review of literature documenting circumpolar Arctic IK with a focus on freshwater biodiversity in Canada, Greenland, Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), Russia, and the U.S.A. (Alaska). Standardised search terms and methodologies were used to locate relevant documents using Google Scholar and Google Advanced search engines. Thematic coding was used to identify freshwater biodiversity themes within the identified documents. Documented IK of freshwater biodiversity was found from all five geographic regions and included data on both species presence and habitat changes with potential to affect biodiversity. Canada had the highest number of relevant documents (n = 127), followed by the U.S.A. (Alaska;n = 116), Fennoscandia (n = 38), Russia (n = 27), and Greenland (n = 5). The number of relevant documents with IK published per year was highest in most recent years, from 2010 onwards, in all geographic regions. Fish represented the highest number of faunal observations with 59 species observed, approximately half of which were Salmonidae (29 species). Local-scale assessment of fish diversity found observations of the highest number of species (11-25) in Alaska, and individual observations of 6-10 species were found throughout Alaska, mainland areas of Canada, and the Kola Peninsula in Russia. Documented IK also contributed new information on historical fish diversity and indicated local-scale loss or gain of species. Such information is of vital importance to provide long-term records of fish composition and abundance, especially when this information does not exist in other knowledge bases such as western science datasets. Indigenous Knowledge included observations of changes in freshwater and terrestrial habitat associated with a warming climate, such as: decreasing water levels and more draining/drying of lakes and rivers, a shorter period of ice cover (late freeze and early break-up), decreasing ice thickness, and increasing occurrence of permafrost thaw and eroding banks. Such observations by those who actively rely on Arctic freshwater ecosystem services are important because they signify that change is occurring and that action is needed to mitigate the impacts on freshwater habitats and the biodiversity therein. This study demonstrates that previously documented IK provides valuable information towards determining freshwater biodiversity baselines and patterns of change in the circumpolar Arctic. However, these results do not sufficiently cover the depth and breadth of IK on freshwater biodiversity and ecology held by Indigenous communities. Further work incorporating Indigenous worldviews around freshwater ecology would provide context to the knowledge collected and a deeper understanding of Arctic circumpolar freshwater environments.

AB  - A century and a half ago, in the European part of Russia (Moscow), forest scientists established the first long-term observations of forests, many of which are under observation to the present day. In the twentieth century, climate changes and, due to industrial development, forest areas were under air pollution. Based on observations from 157 sites, this study shows that the growth and density of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) have decreased by the end of the twentieth century. The environment has changed, and the growth and development of plantations has slowed. Pine yields (- 34% stand volume) and their life expectancy (on average 50 years) have decreased. These changes are critical for forestry and for the management of forests in urban centers. Due to the decline in growth, ecosystem functions by urban forests has decreased. In order to increase the sustainability of urban forests and the provision of ecosystem services, it is preferable to create multi-species stands with a complex structure.

TI  - Mining and indigenous rights in Sweden: what is at stake and the role for legislation

KW  - Sweden
KW  - CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ASSESSMENT
AB  - Mining and the permitting process for mineral projects in Sweden has been criticised as inadequately safeguarding the rights of Indigenous reindeer herding Sami, who hold usufruct rights to more than half the country's territory. There have been calls for Sweden to ratify the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (ILO 169) and to change its Mineral Law. This paper evaluates the extent of protection of Sami rights - and not only those engaged in reindeer herding - in Sweden's minerals permitting process. It also considers the implications if changes were made to align this process with the Indigenous-rights framework. The paper demonstrates that reindeer herding Sami are, broadly, treated similar to landowners in the mineral projects permitting process. However, there is discrimination when it comes to being able to have a share in the benefits of a project: impacted reindeer herders have no such option whereas landowners do. Also, the permitting processes do not consider social and cultural impacts, nor are there obligations for the state to be sufficiently involved in consultation processes. Addressing the identified shortcomings would require only small changes to the Mineral Law and/or to its application and would be possible with only limited impacts on mining because the sector is not a significant user of land whilst it creates large economic values. However, extending those changes (to give parity between landowners and Sami rights holders) in other important economic sectors which use more extensive land areas, would entail a considerable transfer of resources and associated power. Furthermore, changing the Mineral Law specifically would mean little in terms of safeguarding the rights of the majority of Sami who do not engage in reindeer herding. This suggests that calls for changes to mineral-related legislation to resolve indigenous land right issues are mis-directed or at least insufficient, and that other type of legislative change is required, fundamentally including resolving how extensive and strong the Sami's rights to land should be.

AB  - The introduction of a non-native, habitat-forming macroalga may have impacts on the seaweed-associated faunal community. Codium fragile subsp. fragile is a well-known and widespread algal invader that may compete with native habitat-forming macroalgae and affect ecosystem services. This alga can be abundant at semi-exposed/sheltered sites on the south-west coast of Norway, where its vertical distribution range overlaps with another canopy-forming alga, the native Fucus serratus. Whether these seaweeds support similar or dissimilar associated communities will influence the ecological impact of C. fragile subsp. fragile. Therefore, the richness and composition of fauna associated with these species was assessed by sampling at three localities. While the majority of taxa occurred on both F. serratus and C. fragile subsp. fragile, there were clear differences in community composition between them. Fauna taxa richness and community composition were also related to macroalgal epiphyte abundance, and there were a number of taxa associated to high epiphyte samples. The results suggest that shared macroalgal epiphytes lead to higher similarity between the invertebrate communities associated with C. fragile subsp. fragile and F. serratus, providing correlative evidence that epiphytic macroalgae play a role in shaping the impact of this macroalga on associated fauna.

AB  - For the first time, a geoeconomic concept is developed for generation, disposal and minimization of waste in the Arctic and other high-risk environmental management areas based on the ecological rent regulation, which is highly relevant and has regional, federal and international significance. On the basis of the recycling experience gained by industrial plants in the Onega, Usiyansky and other districts of the Arkhangelsk Region, recommendations are made for the marketable production using waste of the timber industry. The mining waste optimization model is considered within the framework of optimized reduction of overburden dumping. The model uses laser monitoring, slope optimization and reinforcement of pitwall rock mass in the Lomonosov diamond deposit, Severalmaz. The theoretical significance of the concept and its novelty are defined by the developed classification of ecological rent. The estimation methodology of ecological rent systematically combines standardization, analysis, comparison as well as economic and mathematical modeling. The practical significance is determined by the possibility of forming a regional strategy of waste and environmental impact minimization. The strategy is based on the noospheric scientific vision, rental approach, as well as on classification and estimation methodology of the ecological rent. Management of the rent, as well as socio-economic and environmental processes is proposed to implement using the experience of the Alaska Permanent hind of the United States and the Government Pension hind of Norway.

AB  - In northern Finland, reindeer-herd management has experienced two major transitions: extensification of intensive herding, and development of supplementary/corral feeding in winter. The transitions were studied in six herding associations in different parts of the Finnish reindeer management area. It was suggested that intensive herding turns into more extensive forms as the reasons for intensive herding (predation, reindeer disappearing to foreign areas, protection of agricultural fields) gradually ceased to exist. The results of the study, based on interviews of elderly reindeer herders, were variable. In the three southern areas intensive herding changed to the free ranging system at the latest during WWII, whilst in the northern areas intensive herding was replaced by extensive herding with the aid of snowmobiles in the 1960s. In the southern herding associations, especially, supplementary/corral feeding in winter was considered necessary, from the 1970s onwards, to compensate for the loss of arboreal lichens associated with forest regeneration.

AB  - Perturbations caused by windstorms usually lead to the harvesting and clearcutting of fallen trees and wood debris, especially in the areas of managed forest ecosystems. Induced shifts in soils due to management practices play a crucial role in the restoration and maintaining of key ecosystem services. This paper focuses on topsoil chemical properties in relation to vegetation type (trees, shrubs and herbs) evolving at windstorm damaged (in 2004) areas with former Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests in the Tatra Mts. region (Slovakia). We assessed the content of topsoil organic matter fractions (extractives, holocellulose (HC) and lignin (Lig)), carbon in microbial biomass (C-mic), soil organic matter (SOM) and the content of elements N, C, H and S. The study plots represent different types of post-windthrow disturbance history/regime: wooden debris extraction (EXT), wooden debris not extracted (NEX), wooden debris extraction followed by wildfire (FIR), affected by the windstorm in 2014 with the subsequent wooden debris extraction (REX) and unaffected (REF). Our results revealed significant differences among sites in the content of dichloromethane extractives (EXT vs. REX and FIR), acetone extractives (NEX vs. EXT, FIR and REF), ethanol extractives (FIR vs. EXT, NEX and REF), water extractives (FIR vs. REX, NEX) and C-mic (EXT vs. NEX, FIR and REF). The topsoil of Vaccinium myrtillus and Picea abies showed a higher ratio of C/N, N/Lig, and Lig/HC compared to Rubus idaeus, Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis villosa, and Larix decidua. The content of N, C, H and S varied between topsoil with shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus, Rubus idaeus) and grasses (Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis villosa). A positive correlation between soil organic matter (SOM) and polar extractives (r=0.81) and a negative correlation between SOM and HC (r=-0.83) was revealed. The carbon content in microbial biomass (C-mic) is positively correlated with acid soluble lignin (ASL) (r=0.85). We also identified a strong correlation between Klason lignin (KL) and the Lig/HC ratio (r=0.97).

AB  - Integrated buffer zones (IBZs) have recently been introduced in the Northwestern Europe temperate zone to improve delivery of ecosystem services compared with the services associated with long-established vegetated buffer zones. A common feature of all the studied IBZ sites is that tile drainage, which previously discharged directly into the streams, is now intercepted within the IBZ. Specifically, the design of IBZs combines a pond, where soil particles present in drain water or surface runoff can be deposited, and a planted subsurface flow infiltration zone. Together, these two components should provide an optimum environment for microbial processes and plant uptake of nutrients. Nutrient reduction capacities, biodiversity enhancement, and biomass production functions were assessed with different emphasis across 11 IBZ sites located in Denmark, Great Britain, and Sweden. Despite the small size of the buffer zones (250-800 m(2)) and thus the small proportion of the drained catchment (mostly <1%), these studies cumulatively suggest that IBZs are effective enhancements to traditional buffer zones, as they (i) reduce total N and P loads to small streams and rivers, (ii) act as valuable improved habitats for aquatic and amphibian species, and (iii) offer economic benefits by producing fastgrowing wetland plant biomass. Based on our assessment of the pilot sites, guidance is provided on the implementation and management of IBZs within agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The Longyearbyen CO2 Lab is a joint project between the University Centre in Svalbard and a consortium of partners. The project aims to investigate the possibilities of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in the vicinity of Longyearbyen (Svalbard, Norway). In this contribution, seismic data from the Adventdalen area of Central Spitsbergen are combined with drillhole and outcrop data to give a thorough picture of the subsurface structural geometry close to the planned injection site of the Longyearbyen CO2 Lab. So far, 12 km of seismic data and one vertical seismic profile have been recorded, and four wells have been drilled, logged and cored to a maximum depth of 980 in. Several clear regional reflectors revealed from the snow-streamer seismic data correlate with boundaries within the lithological succession in drillcores retrieved from the boreholes. This link between seismics and drillcore units allows the construction of a general velocity model for the Cretaceous to Upper Triassic succession, covering a 1000 in vertical section. Velocities in the bedrock succession are noticeably high, spanning from around 3500 m s(-1) in the upper 200 m, to c. 4000 m s(-1) between 200 and 650 in depth, and to 4200-4500 m s(-1) below 650 in total depth. Geometrically, the open 21) seismic coverage shows no local physical closures/structures influencing the succession. Therefore, the potential reservoir rocks of the Upper Triassic De Geerdalen Formation, located at a depth of 672-980 m in drillhole Dh4 of Adventdalen, seem to follow the regional trend in that the constructed formation top surface dips gently to the southwest. Around 20 km to the northeast, this unit crops out in mountain sides. The seismic data also show one or more, laterally extensive, dolerite intrusions that are highly reflective, masking underlying reflectors. Thin (0.5 to 2.5 m) intrusions encountered in the basal part of the De Geerdalen Formation in drillhole 4 (Dh4) are, on the other hand, below seismic resolution. Locally, the intrusions could have an inverse saucer geometry, as possibly seen in outcrops. One of these reflective intrusions has its highest point some 50-100 ni below the De Geerdalen Formation in Adventdalen.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an inevitable action to achieve CO2 emission reduction targets including becoming net-zero by 2050. Increased efforts are therefore required to identify suitable locations for large-scale CO2 storage. In addition to large aquifers, shut down oil and gas fields in the North Sea are logical candidates for offshore large-scale CO2 storage because of their proven storage capacity, reliable caprock integrity, established infrastructure, and public acceptance. However, in some cases, old and legacy wells are subject to high uncertainties in their integrity, and they can compromise CO2 containment in such reservoirs. On the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS), such wells are numerous even outside of oil and gas production areas, i.e., legacy wells affecting aquifers. Therefore, there is a clear need for reliable and cost-effective technologies for well integrity evaluation and remediation. This paper discusses a workflow for screening, monitoring, and remediation of legacy wells. In a first stage, the screening of the Horda Platform areas suggested the need for integrity investigation for the exploration well 32/4-1 T2, drilled into the Alpha structure of the Smeaheia fault block if CO2 is stored in the structure. Our initial well screening of drilling documentation indicates that the well is not suitable to be reused for CO2 injection and geophysical monitoring is recommended. In a second stage, a numerical representation of the well architecture is built including realistic geological setting. We evaluate the sensitivity of non-invasive low-frequency electromagnetic monitoring to corrosion levels in the casing. Numerical end-member simulations of assuming casing corrosion of different degrees by changing material conductivity are performed. Results comparing different corrosion scenarios with a base case (no corrosion) give an above noise signal at receiver locations enabling to separate the different cases. Comparison of the gained electrical fields at seafloor suggests that well casing corrosion monitoring should be possible. Finally, the electrochemical deposition potential of the Sognefjord Formation water is analyzed, revealing depositional potential for portlandite, which might be useful for cement remediation. We recommend such an analysis for all legacy wells penetrating candidate reservoirs for future CO2 or hydrogen storage.

AB  - The increasing availability of wall-to-wall remote sensing datasets in combination with accurate field data enables the mapping of different ecosystem services more accurately and over larger areas than before. The provision of wild berries is an essential ecosystem service, and berries are the most used non-wood forest products in Nordic countries. The aim of the study was to 1) develop general prediction models for bilberry and cowberry yield based on metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and other existing wall-to-wall data and 2) to identify laser-based structural features of forests that can be linked to locations of the highest berry yields. We used the indirect approach where the correlation between forest structure described by the ALS data and the berry yields are utilized. Berry data collected in the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI) 2007-2016 were used for training the models and ALS data from 2009 to 2014 from the national ALS campaign of Sweden. Berry yields were modelled using generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs), and forest structural differences were demonstrated in histograms of presence/absence data. The ALS-based canopy cover was an important variable both in bilberry and cowberry models. Other significant variables were ALS-based height variance, shrub cover, height above sea level, slope, soil wetness and terrain ruggedness, satellite-based species-specific volume and percentage, seasonality of temperature and precipitation and annual precipitation, inventory year, soil type and land use class. In addition, the time difference between the inventory day and the Julian day when berries were expected to be ripe showed a 1.5% decrease for bilberry and a 1.1% decrease for cowberry yield per day during the season. The highest bilberry yield was identified in forests with a canopy cover of 50% and the highest cowberry yield in forests with a canopy cover close to zero. The canopy height of 15 m reflected the highest bilberry yield, whereas a canopy height close to 0 m resulted in the highest cowberry yield. The shrub cover was close to zero both with highest bilberry and cowberry yields. This is the first study combining ALS metrics with other wall-to-wall variables and NFI field data to model bilberry and cowberry yields. Prediction models can be used to produce maps showing the most potential locations for berry picking. Further, the models may, in the future, be imported into forest planning systems to obtain stand-level prognoses of berry yield development under different forest management strategies.

AB  - Understorey vegetation constitutes a remarkable part of the total biodiversity of boreal forests. Mixing broadleaved trees in coniferous forests has been shown to enhance vascular plant abundance and species richness, while high stand density has a counteracting effect. However, more information is needed on how environmental factors modify these biodiversity responses.
   We investigated how the proportion of broadleaved trees of total basal area, tree species richness, stand density, and shrub cover were reflected in the number of vascular plant species and percentage cover of herbs and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). We also studied the response of site fertility indicators, i.e. C:N ratio and extractable calcium concentration in the soil organic layer, to broadleaved species in mixed-forests.
   The study was based on the data of understorey vegetation, soil, and stand properties in forests on mineral soil, inventoried on a systematic sample plot network in Finland in 2006. We used a subset of 307 plots in the hemi-southern and middle boreal zones and divided the plots either to xeric or mesic types. We used generalized additive models in analysing the data.
   Birches (Betula sp.) were the main broadleaved species. Vascular species richness and herb cover generally increased with increasing proportions of broadleaved trees and tree species number both on mesic and xeric sites but decreased with increasing stand density on mesic sites. An increase in proportion of broadleaved trees and stand density resulted in decreased bilberry cover in the southern boreal zone, probably due to stand shading, but in increased cover in the middle boreal zone. Vegetation responses to increasing shrub cover often showed unimodal shape. As increase of proportion of broadleaved trees correlated positively with calcium and negatively with C:N of the organic layer, we suggest that nutrient input from easily decomposable birch leaf litter promotes species richness and herb cover via improved nutrient availability in the soil.
   Our results indicate that many stand characteristics determining understorey biodiversity can be directed by forest management regimes. Generally, slight increase of broadleaved trees benefitted the understory plant richness, given that stand density is not too high. Because site type and zone controlled many responses, we suggest that it would be beneficial to have habitat and zone-specific instructions in forest management practices that conserve understorey vegetation and its multi-purpose ecosystem services.

AB  - Transhumant pastoralism remains a prevalent form of land use across Europe, especially in mountain areas. Besides generating food and other products, it provides a range of public goods and services that are often highly valued by broader society. But transhumance faces structural challenges associated with life in remote mountain areas, including economic pressures, lack of services, low prestige, and ageing populations. These threaten its future. The decline of transhumant systems leads to ecological, economic, and socio-cultural losses, e.g. the loss of biodiversity, of shared cultural heritage based on pastoral practices, and of common property institutions. There are a number of activities that will help to ensure the future of European transhumance, including: i) raising awareness of the public services it provides, better integrating pastoral issues into national agricultural policies, and iii) increasing support for so-called high nature value (HNV) farmlands, which often feature extensive grazing.

AB  - Protected area management can be highly contentious. Information about the acceptability of conservation actions can help environmental authorities design policies that are accepted locally, and identify potential areas of conflict between land users and conservation objectives. In this study, we implemented a spatially-explicit method for eliciting public preferences for land use and conservation policy (web-based public participation GIS; PPGIS). We invited randomly selected local residents in two mountainous regions in Norway to map their preferences for consumptive resource use, motorized use, land development and predator-control. We assessed whether local communities favored or opposed these human activities in nearby protected areas using mixed-effects logistic regression and controlling for landscape characteristics, accessibility and demographics. Local residents strongly favored consumptive resource use and predator control regardless of protected area status, and were more likely to oppose than favor land development inside protected areas. These preferences are largely consistent with the present protected area policy in Norway and Europe that promotes traditional consumptive use and the maintenance of cultural landscapes, but restricts land development. Our results suggest that use-based framing of conservation is more likely to resonate with these communities than narratives tied to the preservation of pristine nature and emerging conservation ideas of the rewilding of nature. Mapped community preferences can be a valuable tool for policy makers and stakeholders representing community interests in participatory processes, and for assessing the local acceptance of alternative management actions within protected areas.

AB  - Urban green infrastructure can provide important habitats for pollinators and support urban ecosystem services. Therefore, these areas must be managed to maximize biodiversity and density of pollinating insects. We used DNA metabarcoding to study honeybee pollen resource use over time and space in the city of Oslo, Norway, and to assess the role of green infrastructure as a resource for pollinators and the services they generate. Urban honeybees used diverse pollen resources throughout their active season. There was considerable seasonal turnover in pollen resource use that reflected flowering phenology. Non-native plants (including invasive species) were an important resource early in the season but were replaced by native plants later in the season. Hive location was not strongly correlated with resource use, likely indicating effective long-distance foraging in the fragmented urban landscape. However, flower visitation rates and floral resource density in public urban green spaces were coupled to pollen use. Honeybees collected pollen from a small number of preferred species but also visited other species, likely for nectar. To preserve pollinator services, urban planning should consider flower resource management, with particular focus on planting native species that can act as early season resources for bees. Public campaigns and other incentive mechanisms to promote the cultivation of native plants that are resources for pollinators and the protection of urban semi-natural habitats have the potential to enhance the value of green infrastructure to support urban pollinators and pollination services.

AB  - Animal-mediated pollination is a vital ecosystem service to crops and wild plants, and long-term stability of plant-pollinator interactions is therefore crucial for maintaining plant biodiversity and food security. However, it is unknown how the composition of pollinators and the structure of pollinator interactions have changed across longer time spans relevant to examining responses to human activities such as climate change. We resampled an historical dataset of plant-pollinator interactions across several orders of pollinating insects in a subarctic location in Finland that has already experienced substantial climate warming but little land use change. Our results reveal a dramatic turnover in pollinator species and rewiring of plant-pollinator interactions, with only 7% of the interactions shared across time points. The relative abundance of moth and hoverfly pollinators declined between time points, whereas muscoid flies, a group for which little is known regarding conservation status and responses to climate, became more common. Specialist pollinators disproportionately declined, leading to a decrease in network-level specialization, which could have harmful consequences for pollination services. Our results exemplify the changes in plant-pollinator networks that might be expected in other regions as climate change progresses.

AB  - Selecting reserves for forest biodiversity maintenance is often done by setting criteria for components of structural elements of biodiversity, such as a volume of decaying wood. we tested how the different threshold values for the components of structural elements affect the cost-effective site selection. Using Finnish National Forest Inventory information and remote sensing data, we determined a habitat quality index and economic value for each site in Satakunta region in Finland. Moreover, we defined several sets of potential conservation targets using alternative criteria for the habitat quality index developed for the Finnish case study. These figures were used in the site selection model in order to maximize the sum of habitat index of selected areas under a given budget constraint. We found that the production possibility frontier for the outputs of timber and biodiversity is only slightly concave when using the given threshold values. Thus, the optimal combination of the outputs is sensitive to the relative values of these goods. Our results suggest that an integrated approach in forest conservation could provide to environmental managers considerable cost savings compared with current management practices. Environmental managers could also reduce conservation costs by loosening the criteria for potential conservation targets. This would not lower considerably the quality of conserved forests.

AB  - Public perceptions and expectations towards ecosystems are an important part of environmental management and planning. This article focuses on the media representations that disseminate information, create framings and influence public attitudes. More specifically, the focus is on print media representations of ecosystem disservices. Ecosystem disservices are functions or properties of ecosystems that cause negative effects on human well-being or that are perceived as harmful, unpleasant or unwanted. Results from a case study focusing on the Finnish newspaper coverage of ecosystem disservices are presented. The results show that a wide variety of harms and nuisances related to ecosystems are brought up and discussed by the media. Implications for environmental management are discussed. The key claim is that taking into account the full repertoire of media representations of ecosystem functions is vital for preventing, anticipating and solving controversies related to environmental management and planning.

AB  - Locally produced bioenergy can decrease the dependency on imported fossil fuels in a region, while also being valuable for climate change mitigation. Short-rotation coppice willow is a potentially high-yielding energy crop that can be grown to supply a local energy facility. This study assessed the energy performance and climate impacts when establishing willow on current fallow land in a Swedish region with the purpose of supplying a bio-based combined heat and power plant. Time-dependent life cycle assessment (LCA) was combined with geographic information system (GIS) mapping to include spatial variation in terms of transport distance, initial soil organic carbon content, soil texture and yield. Two climate metrics were used [global warming potential (GWP) and absolute global temperature change potential (AGTP)], and the energy performance was determined by calculating the energy ratio (energy produced per unit of energy used). The results showed that when current fallow land in a Swedish region was used for willow energy, an average energy ratio of 30 MJ MJ(-1) (including heat, power and flue gas condensation) was obtained and on average 84.3 Mg carbon per ha was sequestered in the soil during a 100-year time frame (compared with the reference land use). The processes contributing most to the energy use during one willow rotation were the production and application of fertilizers (similar to 40%), followed by harvest (similar to 35%) and transport (similar to 20%). The temperature response after 100 years of willow cultivation was -6.10(-1)6 K MJ(-1) heat, which is much lower compared with fossil coal and natural gas (70.10(-16) K MJ(-1) heat and 35.10(-16) K MJ heat, respectively). The combined GIS and time-dependent LCA approach developed here can be a useful tool in systematic analysis of bioenergy production systems and related land use effects.

AB  - The article examines key actors' perceptions on why Norwegian policy objectives aimed at securing sustainable reindeer husbandry through participation have failed in West Finnmark. Based on government documents, media debates, and interviews with the actors, the authors identify two competing narratives on why there are too many reindeer' despite continued state efforts at destocking. The dominant narrative claims that participation is unsuccessful because herders do not accept expert advice, but increase their herds for personal gain. The Sami pastoralists' counter-narrative claims that lack of transparency hinders participation and policy implementation. Inspired by political ecology and perspectives on governance within development studies, the authors examine why the government's narrative dominates public debates, while the counter-narrative remains marginalized. They find that the dominant narrative frames destocking as an apolitical and objective measure based on unequivocal scientific advice, while the pastoralists' rejection of such advice is presented as ignorant and irrational. The dominant narrative's authority is further increased by numerous press reports (repeated in social media) of overstocking threatening biodiversity and economic development. The authors conclude that due to the persistence of the dominant narrative, it has become an undisputed truth in Norwegian debates that Sami pastoralists are overstocking to maximize their benefits.

AB  - As a part of the greening of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy in 2013, Ecological Focus Areas (EFA) became mandatory for many European farmers, with the aim to enhance on-farm biodiversity. However, their effects on biodiversity have been disputed. In this interdisciplinary effort, we assessed the effects of current and alternative formulations of EFA regulations in Sweden. By complementing economic and ecological modelling with interviews with persons at administrative and advisory bodies and a narrative decision game with farmers, we were able to demonstrate key shortcomings of mandatory EFAs as a policy instrument. In particular, we evaluated if requirements to increase the quality of EFAs and regulations allowing their collective implementation, have the potential to increase their effectiveness in benefitting functional biodiversity. We focused on how biodiversity underpinning crop pollination and natural pest control would be affected by alternative regulations. First, we show that several of the possible EFA measures have no or minimal actual effect on biodiversity. Second, we demonstrate the need for appropriate incentives for farmers to choose and place agri-environmental measures in an environmentally desirable way. The EFA regulation is experienced as complicated and without any clear environmental benefits for the participants in this study. As a result, the confidence in the policy is undermined. Third, we demonstrate the challenge of devising compulsory measures to improve biodiversity that also need to fulfil demands on being flexible and easy to administrate. Our results indicate that the latter goal has taken precedence over the former, and thus providing an explanation of the poor design of the EFA regulation from a biodiversity perspective. We argue that to enhance biodiversity in farmland through general agri-environmental measures, only measures with clear benefits for biodiversity can be on the menu. Further, better information as well as incentives for optimizing EFA placement for biodiversity on farms are needed and combined with stricter rules on quality and placement where appropriate.

AB  - BackgroundDrainage activities have caused widespread wetland loss, groundwater drawdown and impairment of ecosystem services. There are now several national programs for wetland restoration, primarily focused on reintroducing ecosystem services such as habitats and nutrient retention. In Sweden, recent dry summers have also reinforced interest in hydrological functions such as the potential for enhanced groundwater storage, both in and around the wetland. However, there are several knowledge gaps regarding groundwater storage effects of restoration, including if they extend beyond the wetland and how they vary with local conditions. Therefore, we have systematically reviewed groundwater storage effects from the interventions of restoring, constructing or draining boreo-temperate wetlands. Drainage was included primarily to evaluate to what degree restoration can reverse drainage effects. MethodsWe searched 8 databases for scientific journal publications in English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, French, German and Polish. Gray literature was searched in English and Swedish. Articles were included based on their relevance for Swedish conditions, i.e., in previously glaciated areas with boreal or temperate climate. Extracted outcome data were groundwater level changes, along with other variables including type of wetland and intervention and, when reported, distance between sampling point and intervention. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for studies that reported groundwater levels at different distances and studies that reported overall effects. Included studies were subject to critical appraisal to evaluate their susceptibility to bias, primarily selection bias, performance bias, and detection bias. Critical appraisal results were used in sensitivity analysis. Review findingsOut of 11,288 screened records, 224 articles fulfilled the criteria, and from these, 146 studies were included in meta-analysis. Most studies (89%) investigated peatlands, primarily from Finland, the UK and Canada. Restoration and drainage studies were equally common. Only nine studies reported measurements beyond the wetland area. Our synthesis is therefore primarily focused on effects within wetlands. In peatland restoration, the observed groundwater level rise decreased exponentially with distance from the restored ditch and was reduced to 50% after 9 [95% confidence interval: 5, 26] m. Drainage reached somewhat farther, with 50% of the groundwater drawdown remaining at 21 [11, 64] m. On average, restoration increased groundwater levels by 22 [16, 28] cm near the intervention, whereas drainage caused a drawdown of 19 [10, 27] cm. Assuming that sampling was unbiased, effects were similar for bogs, fens and mires. Restricting the meta-analysis to the 58% of studies that were of high validity did not alter conclusions. ConclusionsEffects of peatland restoration and drainage were of similar magnitudes but opposite directions. This indicates that, on average, rewetting of drained peatlands can be expected to restore groundwater levels near the ditch. However, restoration may not reach all the area affected by drainage, and there was a strong dependence on local context. For managers of wetland projects, it is thus important to follow up and monitor restoration effects and reinforce the intervention if necessary. Our results also point to a need for better impact evaluation if increased storage beyond the restored wetland area is desired.

AB  - The paper presents an exploratory assessment of ecosystem accounting's potential to support marine and coastal governance. Norwegian kelp forest management and restoration, and a series of nested case studies are used as examples. By analysing a series of institutional experiments where ecosystem accounting (EA) can potentially be applied, and by including the theoretical lens of evolutionary governance, EA is found potentially valuable. It can enhance transparency in governance, elucidate material dependencies, and link stocks and flows of natural resources with a broad spectrum of ecosystem services and values. EA nevertheless has to be considered as one tool among many others. Its use in a particular context can be best assessed when it is understood as being embedded in governance configurations which are in continuous transmutation. Different governance configurations will also shape the effectiveness of the tools. The linkages between EA, policy articulation and implementation should be considered in their complexity. It is argued that pure transparency does not exist, that neutrality of accounting tools is a fiction, and that the potential of EA is shaped by the governance context. At the same time, FA enables the discerning of new narratives about environmental and social risks, and the conservation potentials. It is argued that when assumptions and goals of EA are already shared within the governance context, the potential use of EA is even greater.

AB  - The global temperature has increased over 1 degree since the pre-industrial period. Within the Barents Region, the increase has been ca. 2 degrees, and warming is expected to continue over the next century. Based on energy system analysis with the TIMES-VTT model on the one hand, and a literature review on the other, this study identifies how different economic sectors in the Barents Region are affected by changes in climate, and by the climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in the region. According to the results, the Barents region is likely to be strongly affected by the impacts of climate change despite high spatial variation in the impacts across the Barents region. Changing climate will have severe impacts especially on the more vulnerable sectors, societies, and local environments that have less possibility for adaptation. Political action is needed on national, regional, and municipal levels, but these levels should work together and complement each other. As adaptation is unavoidably required, it is important to highlight and suggest priority areas to national adaptation plans from the Barents region's perspective. Moreover, collection and utilization of local knowledge in adaptation is crucial.

AB  - The drive to expand renewable energies is often in direct conflict with sustainable development goals. Thus, it is important that energy policies account for potential trade-offs. We assess the interlinkages between energy, food, water and land, for two case studies, Okinawa and Sogn og Fjordane. We apply a range of assessment methods and study their usefulness as tools to identify trade-offs and to compare the sustainability performance. We calculate cross-sectoral footprints, self-sufficiency ratios and perform a simplified Energy-Water-Food nexus analysis. We use the latter for assessing scenarios to increase energy and food self-sufficiency in Okinawa, while we use ecosystem service (ESS) accounting for Sogn og Fjordane. For Okinawa, we find that constraints on the energy, food and water sectors urgently call for integrated approaches to energy policy; for Sogn og Fjordane, the further expansion of renewables comes at the expense of cultural and supporting ESS, which could outweigh gains from increased energy exports. We recommend a general upgrade to indicators and visualization methods that look beyond averages and a fostering of infrastructure for data on sustainable development based on harmonized international protocols. We warn against rankings of countries or regions based on benchmarks that are neither theory-driven nor location-specific.

AB  - Old-growth boreal forests display high within-stand structural variation, with large variation in tree sizes and age structure, a heterogeneous horizontal spatial pattern with gaps of different sizes and multi layered canopies. Old managed forests, on the other hand, are characterized by more homogeneous structural patterns. In many parts of Europe, no true 'virgin forests' remains. Still, in many places forests previously influenced by selective logging have been abandoned, and is now developing towards a more natural forest structure. Such near-natural forest areas can be of special importance for forest biodiversity and related ecosystem services, and it is therefore important to map and monitor such forests. Recently, airborne laser scanning (ALE) has been applied to provide ecologically relevant information on forest structure. The advantage of ALS is that it can characterize three-dimensional forest structure in fine detail across broad areas, replacing more labour-intensive field-based measurements.
   In this study, we use ALS to compare the structural characteristics of 89 near-natural and 280 managed old forest stands in a 17,000 ha boreal forest study site in southeastern Norway. For the study area, both maps of logging history separating old near-natural and old managed forests, and high-resolution ALS data was available.
   Our aim was to investigate if ALS data could be used to separate vertical and horizontal forest structure in old near natural versus old managed forests. We also wanted to compare different methods for classification, and to describe the potential for use of ALS in classification of forest naturalness for future mapping and monitoring purposes.
   We found that ALS data had a strong potential in separating stands of old near-natural forests from old managed stands. The most important metrics for classification were those reflecting canopy height, canopy density, variation in canopy height, number of trees per area and gap patterns. This fits well with ecological knowledge of relevant structural differences between forests of different degree of naturalness. Both vertical and horizontal metrics provided useful input to the classification, but the horizontal metrics performed slightly better on accuracy and were easier to interpret. Although the method has a good potential for wider use in boreal forest landscapes, the need for local reference data for calibration as well as the importance of ALS pulse density for precision of classification should be further investigated.
   Large-scale spatial information on remaining source areas of natural and near-natural forests will be essential in order to manage forests in a way that safeguards biodiversity and ecosystem services. We suggest that classification of forest naturalness based on ALS data can be a helpful tool in future forest mapping and monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Estimation of the opportunity cost is necessary for the economic assessment of environmental conservation policies. This paper considers the case where an environmental good is negatively affected in the process of the production of marketable goods. In the presence of externalities, conservation implies the undertaking of abatement measures by polluters. A relevant measure of opportunity cost in these settings is the abatement cost required to preserve or restore a unit of the environmental good in question. Current economic literature lacks an established methodology for deriving such measures, as it commonly focuses on pricing pollutants rather than the natural stocks affected by them. This paper uses a non-optimal valuation approach suggested by Fenichel and Abbott (JAERE 1(1/2):1-27, 2014) as a point of departure and develops a framework for deriving the opportunity cost of conservation as the cost of externality abatement per unit of environmental good. An empirical illustration is provided for the case of the farmed and wild salmon trade-off in Norway in light of the current pollution control regulations.

AB  - Purpose of Review Resilience is a key concept to deal with an uncertain future in forestry. In recent years, it has received increasing attention from both research and practice. However, a common understanding of what resilience means in a forestry context and how to operationalise it is lacking. Here, we conducted a systematic review of the recent forest science literature on resilience in the forestry context, synthesizing how resilience is defined and assessed. Recent Findings Based on a detailed review of 255 studies, we analysed how the concepts of engineering resilience, ecological resilience and social-ecological resilience are used in forest sciences. A clear majority of the studies applied the concept of engineering resilience, quantifying resilience as the recovery time after a disturbance. The two most used indicators for engineering resilience were basal area increment and vegetation cover, whereas ecological resilience studies frequently focus on vegetation cover and tree density. In contrast, important social-ecological resilience indicators used in the literature are socio-economic diversity and stock of natural resources. In the context of global change, we expected an increase in studies adopting the more holistic social-ecological resilience concept, but this was not the observed trend. Our analysis points to the nestedness of these three resilience concepts, suggesting that they are complementary rather than contradictory. It also means that the variety of resilience approaches does not need to be an obstacle for operationalisation of the concept. We provide guidance for choosing the most suitable resilience concept and indicators based on the management, disturbance and application context.

AB  - Urban flooding has become a key issue for many cities around the world. The project INnovations for eXtreme Climatic EventS' (INXCES) developed new innovative technological methods for risk assessment and mitigation of extreme hydroclimatic events and optimization of urban water-dependent ecosystem services at the catchment level. DEMs (digital elevation maps) have been used for more than a decade now as quick scan models to indicate locations that are vulnerable to urban flooding. In the last years the datasets are getting bigger and multidisciplinary stakeholders are becoming more demanding and require faster and more visual results. In this paper, the development and practical use of DEMs is exemplified by the case study of Bergen (Norway), where flood modelling using DEM is carried out in 2017 and in 2009. We can observe that the technology behind tools using DEMs is becoming more common and improved, both with a higher accuracy and a higher resolution. Visualization tools are developed to raise awareness and understanding among different stakeholders in Bergen and around the world. We can conclude that the evolution of DEMS is successful in handling bigger datasets and better (3D) visualization of results with a higher accuracy and a higher resolution. With flood maps the flow patterns of stormwater are analysed and locations are selected to implement (sub)surface measures as SuDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage systems) that store and infiltrate stormwater. In the casestudy Bergen the following (sub-)surface SuDS have been recently implemented with the insights of DEMS: settlement storage tank, rainwater garden, swales, permeable pavement and UT-drainage. The research results from the case study Bergen will be shared by tools to stimulate international knowledge exchange. New improved DEMs and connected (visualization) tools will continue to play an important role in (sub-)surface flood management and climate resilient urban planning strategies around the world.

AB  - The performance of post-combustion CO2 capture processes depends on the applied solvent as well as on the chosen process configuration and the integration concept with the power plant. Siemens bases its development efforts on an amino-acid salt solution as solvent, which has a negligible environmental impact and provides favourable properties for a low-energy capture process. The solvent features a high chemical and thermal stability and is easy to handle. The capture process is characterized by near-zero emissions.
   As a first step for validation of the determined solvent and process features on an industrial scale, the implementation of the capture process in a pilot plant is required. For this purpose, Siemens has installed a pilot plant at E. ON's coal-fired power plant Staudinger in Germany and started the operation in August 2009.
   The measured pilot plant process data are used to validate the computational process model, which refines the model accuracy and improves the reliability in terms of plant performance. The findings from pilot plant operation confirmed that an overall net plant efficiency penalty of less than six percentage points (without CO2 compression) for a state-of-the-art coal-fired steam power plant can be achieved.
   The paper also presents experiences from pilot plant measuring campaigns with regard to the impact of trace components such as SOx and NOx. Solvent losses due to related degradation effects can be minimized by an intelligent reclaiming concept. Loss due to oxygen degradation can be estimated to be less than one percent of hold-up per year. Suitable construction materials have been qualified. The results of the pilot plant operation will serve as basis for the implementation of a demonstration plant, which will be the final step before a full-scale commercial carbon capture plant project. Siemens has been selected as technology provider for the Meri-Pori Carbon Capture and Storage project in Finland, which is a potential funding candidate of the European Flagship Programme. The Meri-Pori power plant has an installed capacity of 565 MW and the capture demonstration project is supposed to treat half of the power plant's flue gas and to capture 90 % CO2 from the treated flue gas. In addition to the Siemens capture process, the demonstration project will include ship transportation and geological storage. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forests used for timber production provide essential ecosystem services to society, as well as potential breeding habitat for bird communities. In southern Sweden, 90% of productive forest land is used for timber production and stands dominated by Norway spruce (Picea abies) constitute approximately 40% of the forested area. Due to their homogeneous structure, these spruce production forests are often regarded as depauperate. Despite this perception, knowledge about the biodiversity found in these stands is scarce. Here we synthesize the results of four separate bird surveys conducted within 35 spruce production stands of southern Sweden. The results are compared to recent population trends within the general study area. In total 49 bird species were recorded, with a strong difference in species composition between newly planted clear-cuts (forest age <15 years) and forests older than 15 years. The majority of species encountered in the older forest category were common forest birds, with a single red-listed species among the regularly occurring species. In contrast, three red-listed "farmland species" were frequently encountered in the newly planted forests, revealing the capacity of those birds preferring open and recently disturbed habitats to utilize clear-cuts. A higher diversity of tree sizes and the inclusion of even relatively small proportions (<15%) of broadleaved tree species had a positive effect on bird species richness. Several species encountered in spruce production forests are declining in numbers, but it is not clear whether these stands are acting as source or sink environments for their populations. However, our results indicate that relatively small adjustments to spruce forest management should improve the quality of this widespread habitat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Improved knowledge on the risk in ecologically important habitats on a regional scale from multiple stressors is critical for managing functioning and resilient ecosystems. This risk assessment aimed to identify seagrass ecosystems in southern Sweden that will be exposed to a high degree of change from multiple global change stressors in mid- and end-of-century climate change conditions. Risk scores were calculated from the expected overlap of three stressors: sea surface temperature increases, ocean acidification and wind driven turbid conditions. Three high-risk regions were identified as areas likely to be exposed to a particularly high level of pressure from the global stressors by the end of the century. In these areas it can be expected that there will be a large degree of stressor change from the current conditions. Given the ecological importance of seagrass meadows for maintaining high biodiversity and a range of other ecosystem services, these risk zones should be given high priority for incorporation into management strategies, which can attempt to reduce controllable stressors in order to mitigate the consequences of some of the impending pressures and manage for maintained ecosystem resilience.

AB  - Decaying wood plays an important role in forest biodiversity, nutrient cycling and carbon balance. Community structure of wood-inhabiting fungi changes with mass loss of wood, but the relationship between substrate quality and decomposers is poorly understood. This limits the extent to which these ecosystem services can be effectively managed. We studied the fungal community and physico-chemical quality (stage of decay, dimensions, density, moisture, C similar to:similar to N ratio, lignin and water or ethanol extractives) of 543 Norway spruce logs in five unmanaged boreal forest sites of southern Finland. Fungi were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing of DNA extracted directly from wood samples. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were also recorded. Results showed a fungal community succession with decreasing wood density and C similar to:similar to N ratio, and increasing moisture and lignin content. Fungal diversity peaked in the most decayed substrates. Ascomycetes typically colonized recently fallen wood. Brown-rot fungi preferred the intermediate decay stages. White-rot fungi represented approximately one-fifth of sequenced species in all decay phases excluding the final phase, where ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi became dominant. Lignin content of logs with white-rot fungi was low, and ECM fungi were associated with substrates containing abundant nitrogen. Macroscopic fruiting bodies were observed for only a small number of species detected with molecular techniques.

AB  - Currently, habitat connectivity is poorly integrated in forest-planning calculations related to decision-making in commercial boreal forests. This study developed a method that utilizes graph theory and minimum spanning tree (MST) to improve the connectivity of broadleaf-rich habitats in such forests. The location of created habitat corridors could change over time, and the method did not require adjacency between the stands that constituted the MST. Losses in net present value (NPV) due to improved connectivity were also examined. The planning area was located in southern Finland and included 1040 forest stands. Treatment schedules for the stands were created using simulation software, and heuristic optimization methods were used to find optimal treatments for the stands to meet the specified objectives. Incorporating even-flow harvest removals and NPV in an objective function provided real-world conditions in the optimization framework. The developed method clearly improved the connectivity of broadleaf-rich patches. The monetary losses of improved connectivity were moderate compared with the ecological-based connectivity benefits gained with the method. The developed MST method can be applied to any desired forest feature and modified to work in various situations related to connectivity problems.

AB  - This paper examines Sami women's responses to healthy living advice for health risk reduction, including how they think their health capital is administered within their way of life. Data was gathered from interviews with a group of Sami women from reindeer herding families in northern Norway. Healthy living advice for health risk reduction provides medical discourses about how to live to reduce the risk of widespread diseases. Such discourses intervene into peoples' everyday lives, and become moral discourses. According to these interviews, the women responded to epidemiological risk assessments and guidelines by legitimating their attitudes and behaviours, but also by legitimating a distance between their practical risk assessments and the attitudes and behaviours the medical authorities promote. The study demonstrates that the women are creative users of health information. Their response to health information is shaped within their local material, cultural and social context, personal needs, and a need for cultural security on a collective level. The women experience responsibility for their own and their families' health capital.

AB  - The ecosystem approach has been adopted as the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and is recommended to be used widely in the integrated management of land, water and living resources, to promote conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way, also in corporations. The forest industry is a resource-intensive branch with various impacts on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Our aims in this study were to examine (i) how the ecosystem approach is implemented in the Finnish forest industry; and (ii) to outline the mental models of environmental experts of corporations, and their conceptualization of some key terms of ecosystem thinking. We interviewed 12 experts about their opinions on the main future challenges, the risks, the mistakes of the past, the possibilities and the successes confronting the forest industry. The results were analyzed using the DPSIR (Driving forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses) framework model. Finally, we give several recommendations as to how the ecosystem approach can be integrated into corporate environmental management. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to shed new light on urban common property systems. We deal with urban commons in relation to urban green-space management, referring to them as urban green commons. Applying a property-rights analytic perspective, we synthesize information on urban green commons from three case-study regions in Sweden, Germany, and South Africa, and elaborate on their role for biodiversity conservation in urban settings, with a focus on business sites. Cases cover both formally established types of urban green commons and bottom-up emerged community-managed habitats. As our review demonstrates, the right to actively manage urban green space is a key characteristic of urban green commons whether ownership to land is in the private, public, the club realm domain, or constitutes a hybrid of these. We discuss the important linkages among urban common property systems, social-ecological learning, and management of ecosystem services and biodiversity. Several benefits can be associated with urban green commons, such as a reduction of costs for ecosystem management and as designs for reconnecting city-inhabitants to the biosphere. The emergence of urban green commons appears closely linked to dealing with societal crises and for reorganizing cities: hence, they play a key role in transforming cities toward more socially and ecologically benign environments. While a range of political questions circumscribe the feasibility of urban green commons, we discuss their usefulness in management of different types of urban habitats, their political justification and limitation, their potential for improved biodiversity conservation, and conditions for their emergence. We conclude by postulating some general policy advice. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Detailed research into the virgin forest of Smrceve Doline, situated in Northern Velebit National Park, was undertaken in the vegetation period of 2010 (Fig. 1). The virgin forest covers an area of 488 ha, of which spruce forests account for 300 ha, beech forests for 125 ha, while the rest is without any forest vegetation. The altitude ranges between 1,279 vi and 1,607 m. The virgin forest mainly extends in the north-south direction. Over half of the spruce stands are distributed in sinkholes, as well as on northern and northwestern slopes ascending towards the tops. In the geomorphological sense, this is an exceptionally richly developed Dinaric karst relief, where the parent material is made of limestone breccias and limestone-dolomite blocks, which often resurface. The soil is organogenic and organomineral calcomelanosol in a mosaic with calcocambisol. The average annual temperature is 3.5 degrees C and the amount of the average annual precipitation is 1,898 mm (meteorological station Vucjak,1954 m above sea level, period 1961-1990, data of the DHMZ).
   Phytocoenological research based on the standard Central European method of the Zurich-Montpellier School has shown that stands of Norway spruce are distributed in two forest communities (Table 1): spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum abietis Vukelic, Alegro et Segota 2010) and spruce forest with Hypericum richerii grisebachii (Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum abietis /Bertovic 1975/ Vukelic, Alegro, Segota et Sapic 2010). The floral composition with their differences justifies their classification into independent associations in relation to other sub-alpine phytocoenoses of the Dinaric region. Compared with them, spruce forests of the sub-alpine belt of northern Velebit are differentiated by the presence and the higher cover of species Campanula velebitica, Melampyrum velebiticum, Hypericum richeri grisebachii, Laserpitium krapfii, Valeriana montana, Euphorbia carniolica, Geranium sylvaticum, Adenostyles alliariae and other, as well as the absence of the species of the Alpine-boreal and the south Balkan region (Vukelic et al. 2010a, Vukelic et al. 2010b). These results are of exceptional importance because, in combination with other research, they will be indispensable for defining forest communities of spruce in the Gorski Kotar area, which, according to preliminary comparisons, show more similarities with the communities of the Dinaric and pre-alpine area of Slovenia.
   The structural features of the stands were established in two sample plots situated in the most representative part of the virgin forest. In addition to basic site parameters, some possible anthropogenic impacts were also analyzed in square plots of 50 x 50 m. These impacts are relevant for the assessment of the natural status of the stands. To quantify structural parameters in the sample plots, circumferences and heights were measured 1 cm above the diameter at breast height in all the trees, and their life status was determined using the methodology of Maser et al. 1979 (Tables 2 and 3). Standing trees (live and dead) were divided into 9 degradation categories. The quantity and decomposition rates of dead standing and fallen timber were recorded. The decomposition stage of dead fallen timber was classified into 5 decomposition categories.
   In terms of assessing the natural status of forests, we assumed that it was a primary virgin forest stand, which shows no traces of direct anthropogenic impacts, and as such can be used for all comparative research of spruce ecosystems. The criteria for the assessment of the status are based on similar research of Central European authors, primarily that of Geburek et al. (2010), who systematically constructed biodiversity indices for Austrian forests.
   Measurements of structural parameters in the two sample plots revealed a very high amount of growing stock, resulting from the absence of management and the presence of exclusively natural factors. In terms of tree number distribution by diameter classes (Fig. 3 and 4), this research indicates bimodal distribution that deviates significantly from the balanced de Liocourt curve (selective form of distribution). This was also confirmed by past research into Central European virgin forests (Lorimer et al. 2001, Westhpall et al. 2006, Diaci et al. 2009). It is expected that the distribution of diameters at breast height of spruce stands in Smrceva Dolina will gradually assume a reverse sigmoid curve form (reverse S shape). The reason lies in the continuous regeneration process that takes place in newly created canopy gaps and on dead lying timber. The newly-established young generation slowly penetrates into the upper stand layers and fills in the canopy gaps. With canopy gaps occurring continuously over the entire virgin forest area, the development of young generation achieves a specific form of the reverse S shape of tree number distribution.
   The growing stock in the sample plots is relatively high for these altitudes. It is primarily the result of favorable micro-site conditions, which are conducive to the biological-ecological requirements of spruce. Differences in the two plots emerge from different ecological and particularly from edaphic parameters. The first plot (association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum abietis) is situated in the sinkhole itself and on its lower slope, where the soil is very deep and suitable (colluvium), while the second is about 200 m higher, immediately under the top of the slope, where the soil is considerably shallower and rockiness is more distinct (association Hyperico grisebachii-Piceetum abietis).
   With reference to the measured parameters of live trees, the quantity and decomposition rate of dead standing and fallen timber, the complete absence of stumps of anthropogenic origin, the distance from roads and mountain trails, the geographic position, inaccessibility and other factors, Smrceve Doline can be considered a virgin forest with the highest degree of naturalness.

AB  - Although it is commonly believed that trees can improve air quality, recent studies have shown that such pollution mitigation can be negligible - or that tree canopies can even increase pollutant concentrations near their sources compared to adjacent treeless areas. We explored the impacts of urban roadside forest patches on the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in summer and winter in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, and especially investigated if canopy cover can result in increased concentrations of NO2 below the canopy. Our results, however, did not show significantly higher - or lower - NO2 concentrations underneath tree canopies compared to levels above canopies. Neither did NO2 levels at the below-canopy sampling height differ significantly between forest patches and adjacent open, treeless areas. The lack of a canopy effect may derive from the rather small size of the forest patches, and - compared to previous studies with similar design - divergent tree species composition forming a dense canopy structure. Our results corroborate previous studies that the potential ecosystem services offered by urban near-road forests are more likely due to benefits other than those related to the removal of air pollutants.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is increasingly being recognised as containing strong elements of social conflict. The extent to which stakeholders regard a management system as being just and fair is a key social dimension of conflict. This paper investigates the perceptions of justice regarding the carnivore conflict in Norway among sheep farmers, environmentalists and indigenous reindeer herders using Qmethodology. Three significant perspectives on environmental justice were identified, which we labelled the Carnivore Advocates (containing most environmentalists), the Carnivore Sceptics (containing most of the sheep farmers and reindeer herders) and the Bureaucratic Carnivore Sceptics (containing the remaining sheep farmers and a reindeer herder). The widest disagreement was over what constitutes environmental harm and environmental goods and how the costs and benefits should be distributed, indicating that fundamental differences in values and perceptions underlie the intractability of this conflict. However, the results of this study suggest that the widespread conceptualisation of justice as strictly a matter of equitable distribution of costs and benefits is incomplete. Recognition justice, in the form of acknowledging group identity, lifestyle, knowledge and viewpoints, and seeking mutual respect for differences constituted a good in itself for all stakeholders. It cannot therefore just be viewed as a means to establish equitable distribution of goods and harms. Issues related to participatory justice were also identified, but were not attributed great importance. These results confirm the common assumption that the carnivore conflict in Norway is highly polarised. Because the two poles differ fundamentally in their value perceptions regarding carnivores and how that relates to their sense of identity, we characterise the human-wildlife conflict in Norway as a "wicked problem" where decisions regarding the management of carnivores is going to entail political prioritisation of one viewpoint over the other.

AB  - This study introduces a prototype model for evaluating measures to abate agricultural nutrients in the Baltic Sea from a Finnish national perspective. The stochastic simulation model integrates nutrient dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in the sea basins adjoining the Finnish coast, nutrient loads from land and other sources, benefits from nutrient abatement (in the form of recreation and other ecosystem services) and the costs of agricultural abatement activities. The aim of the study is to present the overall structure of the model and to demonstrate its potential using preliminary parameters. The model is made flexible for further improvements in all of its ecological and economic components. The results of a sensitivity analysis suggest that investments in reducing the nutrient load from arable land in Finland would become profitable only if the neighboring countries in the northern Baltic committed themselves to similar reductions. Environmental investments for improving water quality yield the highest returns for the Bothnian Bay and the Gulf of Finland, with smaller returns for the Bothnian Sea. Somewhat surprisingly, in the Bothnian Bay the abatement activities become profitable from the national viewpoint, because the riverine loads from Finland represent a high proportion of the total nutrient loads. In the Gulf of Finland, this proportion is low, but the size of the coastal population benefiting from improved water quality is high.

AB  - Planning sustainable and liveable communities requires considering residents' perceptions and preferences. However, practitioners' values and preferences can also determine the development of neighbourhoods, which has rarely been recognized. Thus, we compared if residents' and practitioners' perceptions match regarding 1) factors they considered valuable for neighbourhoods and 2) the development needs of specific neighbourhoods. We studied three Finnish suburbs using practitioner workshops and residential surveys. In general, the practitioners' and residents' values matched well. Both groups rated cleanliness, non-traffic related safety, essential services, and green spaces as the most important factors. However, residents valued traffic safety and lighting of routes more than practitioners. The practitioners and residents mostly agreed on how to develop the neighbourhoods in the future. The resident views not fully considered in the practitioners' development objectives were noise disturbances, and infill development as a threat to green spaces. This study underlined the importance of considering safety and access to green spaces in planning and developing suburbs. The study also revealed the complexity of integrating different aspects of liveability on an individual and neighbourhood/city scale. The integration of different dimensions of liveability in planning may require the use of participatory planning-support tools.

AB  - Tourism entrepreneurship is frequently promoted as a livelihood strategy for Sami indigenous people living in northern Sweden. At the same time, tourism's ability to fully take over struggling primary sectors has been brought into question, due perhaps to a mismatch of skills or to tourism's seasonality and low pay. In spite of that, the role of tourism development might relate less to financial autonomy but could best be characterized as being supplementary and complementary to other occupations. Additionally, the motivations behind tourism involvement among Sami tourist entrepreneurs remain largely unknown. This interview-based study therefore aims to uncover why Sami indigenous tourist entrepreneurs living in northern Sweden get involved in tourism and to what extent tourism is part of a livelihood diversification strategy. The findings show that a combination of factors such as lifestyle choices, existing touristic demand and readily available forms of capital lead people to become tourist entrepreneurs. At the same time, for some respondents, tourism is part of a livelihood diversification strategy where its development is not sought for replacing a struggling traditional occupation, namely reindeer herding, but for complementing it.

AB  - While urban indoor farming is a fairly new phenomenon, there is a growing interest from producers, authorities and consumers alike. However, many assumptions are made, and expectations held, about urban indoor farming from a sustainability, food production and food provisioning point of view. These assumptions and expectations need to be tested and assessed. This study assessed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a number of social aspects of a newly established indoor urban farm in Stockholm. The farm was the result of a project created by commercial, civil society and municipal actors with the aim to make use of unused urban space, create jobs and produce food. While lettuce grown on the indoor farm emitted more GHG than lettuce cultivated outdoors in Sweden, it was more climate friendly than imported lettuce in our comparison. Furthermore, the indoor farm created value for the actors involved and for the city district, albeit on a small scale. Many of the positive environmental and social features owed to the small scale of the indoor farm and the context in which it developed. Thus, when evaluating production systems like this one, we need to be cautious and refrain from extrapolating the results.

AB  - Droughts can affect a multitude of public and private sectors, with impacts developing slowly over time. While droughts are traditionally quantified in relation to the hydrological components of the water cycle that they affect, this manuscript demonstrates a novel approach to assess future drought conditions through the lens of the water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) nexus concept. To this end, a set of standardized drought indices specifically designed to represent different nexus sectors across 50 catchments in Sweden was computed based on an ensemble of past and future climate model simulations. Different patterns in the response of the four nexus sectors water, energy, food and ecosystem services to future climate change emerged, with different response times and drought durations across the sectors. These results offer new insights into the propagation of drought through the WEFE nexus in cold climates. They further suggest that future drought projections can be better geared towards decision makers by basing them on standardized drought indices that were specifically tailored to represent particular nexus sectors.

AB  - Retention forestry (RF) is a modified form of clear-cutting that has been introduced recently in several countries. It is intended to integrate the conservation of biodiversity with timber production and to maintain the provision of other ecosystem services by retaining important forest qualities, habitats and structures. In this study we seek to identify forces driving the conceptual development, acceptance and implementation of RF in Sweden by describing and investigating the RF debate among foresters and environmental NGOs from 1968 to 2003. Specifically, we seek to elucidate when RF was first proposed, the arguments for and against it, and pivotal trends in the debate. Our study is based on thorough systematic analysis of articles published in journals issued by two non-profit associations. Our data show that the development of RF in Sweden was driven by several interacting factors and we distinguish critical time periods, from strong debates and conflicts during the 1970s until the breakthrough of forestry certification at the turn of the millennium. We argue that historical analysis of the forces driving changes in forestry management is important for elucidating why changes occur and the dynamic nature of perceptions and uses of forest ecosystems in modern societies.

AB  - The 2012 European Bioeconomy Strategy has been adopted in some European countries' national policies. However, it has not been officially included in the Czech Republic's national policy. In Sweden, the Bioeconomy Strategy has been adopted in the national policy and the National Forest Programme (NFP). The paper reviews the current forest policy in the Czech Republic in meeting the purposes of the forest-based bioeconomy by performing a comparative study between the Czech Republic and Sweden. As bioeconomy principles are core values in the Swedish NFP it aims not only to deliver sustainable forest products and ecosystem services to support forest enterprises but also to achieve a fossil-fuel-free Sweden. Although the Czech Forest Policy denotes the European Bioeconomy Strategy as one of the reference documents, it does not directly relate to shifting from fossil fuels to bioenergy. The implementation of the Czech document is limited to the forest-based sector. Bioeconomy principles are expected to be included in inter-ministerial committees at the government level in the Czech Republic. The challenges faced by the country include fulfilling the provision of sustainable forest biomass and high added-value products while harmonising forest policies and regulations.

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes continues to be a key challenge in the European Union (EU). However, to date the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is central for addressing this issue, has proven ineffective in improving biodiversity outcomes. In contrast to solutions that focus on individual policies or measures, we take a holistic approach to explore changes in the broader governance system for biodiversity conservation. For this purpose, we draw on a set of four theoretical, ideal-typical scenarios which represent alternative governance approaches and used them to stimulate discussion about the acceptability of contrasting governance approaches among a broad range of actors in three case study areas in Germany and Sweden. Our results highlight that acceptability of alternative governance approaches is shaped by a large variety of factors. Additionally, despite differences between the views and interests of different stakeholder groups, our findings show universal support for governance approaches that fundamentally differ from the status quo approaches. Thus, evaluating and addressing acceptability of alternative governance approaches needs to consider the preferences of many different stakeholders and requires a more holistic perspective. We therefore argue that designing a potentially widely acceptable alternative governance solution for biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes requires a blend of different governance approaches. We outline principles that can guide the design of such a blended governance approach and discuss key challenges arising from the suggested changes for both practitioners and future research.

AB  - Environmental justice sheds light on the distributive and procedural aspects of planning and decision-making. We examined the challenges arising from the perspective of environmental justice on multi-level and participatory environmental governance by exploring the governance of aquatic environments in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. We found three main challenges and potential responses to them. First, even though most of Helsinki's shoreline is free and/or accessible by road and accordingly used actively by people for recreational purposes, many parts of the shoreline are perceived as inaccessible, reflecting a need to combine factual and perceived accessibility of aquatic environments in detail during the planning processes and to discuss reasons for possible discrepancies between these two. Second, there was a remarkable seasonal variation in the use of aquatic environments, so more attention should be paid to social-demographic factors explaining the distribution of the use of urban nature. Third, it seems to be difficult to capture the variety of perceptions of people and to integrate them into planning and decision-making processes even on a local scale, and this challenge is likely even more pronounced on higher levels of planning and governance. Thus, better integration of regional and local-scale planning procedures should be encouraged. Building on these observations, we conclude that integration of procedural and distributive environmental justice into the practices of the governance of aquatic environments could remarkably decrease unwanted trade-offs and potential conflicts in their use and management.

AB  - Seafloor multiparametric fibre-optic-cabled video observatories are emerging tools for standardized monitoring programmes, dedicated to the production of real-time fishery-independent stock assessment data. Here, we propose that a network of cabled cameras can be set up and optimized to ensure representative long-term monitoring of target commercial species and their surrounding habitats. We highlight the importance of adding the spatial dimension to fixed-point-cabled monitoring networks, and the need for close integration with Artificial Intelligence pipelines, that are necessary for fast and reliable biological data processing. We then describe two pilot studies, exemplary of using video imagery and environmental monitoring to derive robust data as a foundation for future ecosystem-based fish-stock and biodiversity management. The first example is from the NE Pacific Ocean where the deep-water sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) has been monitored since 2010 by the NEPTUNE cabled observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada. The second example is from the NE Atlantic Ocean where the Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) is being monitored using the SmartBay observatory developed for the European Multidisciplinary Seafloor and water column Observatories. Drawing from these two examples, we provide insights into the technological challenges and future steps required to develop full-scale fishery-independent stock assessments.

AB  - Ecological compensation (EC) has been proposed as an important tool for stopping the loss of biodiversity and natural values. However, there are few studies on its actual operationalisation and there is high uncertainty about how it should be designed and implemented to be an effective way of performing nature conservation. In this study we focus on ecological compensation in Sweden, a country where it is in the process of being implemented more broadly. Using interviews and a workshop we investigate how the work with the implementation is carried out and what challenges exist. The results show that implementation of EC is at an early stage of development and there are many practical obstacles, linked to both legislation and routines in the planning processes. There is a lack of holistic perspective and large-scale thinking, a quite strong focus on a small number of individual species, and an overall attitude that anything is better than nothing, all of which can have negative consequences for biodiversity conservation overall. Based on the results we discuss the need for better integration of EC into the entire decision-making process and for a holistic approach to preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, by increasing the focus on landscape perspective and considering delays in compensation outcomes. There is also a need for a national level standard for EC, making good and worse examples of compensation measures available and systematic monitoring of EC projects. Finally, a spatially explicit database to document all EC areas should be introduced both to ensure consistency in protection from future development plans and to enable long-term monitoring of EC outcomes.

AB  - Restoration projects might be easier to accomplish, and the projects and their results better supported by local communities if the beneficiaries could be more intensely involved in the projects. The aim of this study was to determine how the setting and cognitive or attitudinal factors explain pro-environmental behavior in the context of small water restoration in an urban-rural setting. We compared the results from three primary contingent valuation (CV) surveys in Finland conducted in different geographical locations: the urban capital region of Helsinki, the peri-urban Kalimenjoki river basin area, and the rural Koillismaa area of northeastern Finland. According to the results, it appears that instead of an urban-rural dichotomy, the willingness to participate in pro-environmental actions by donating money or carrying out voluntary work might be determined by place related local factors that either motivate or discourage participation in environmental work. Awareness of the local obstacles and drivers for the restoration of watercourses might make it easier to accomplish projects in the future and help in allocating budget funding to the areas where public willingness to participate is limited.

AB  - The Government of Finland is targeting carbon neutrality by 2035. Increasing electrification emphasizes the need for significant emission reductions in power generation. As reduction in power generation emissions is partly realized by increase in intermittent energy sources, electricity storage may become an important part of a carbon neutral power system. This study investigates the behavior of electrical storages as a part of a large-scale national carbon-free power system model. As a case study, a three-year model of a carbon-free Finnish power system set in 2050 with the aim to identify various factors affecting electricity storage, and the results are compared with literature. The proposed case study features various scenarios with a national power system with very high amounts of renewables and a significant hydro capacity, while amount of combustion-based energy production is minimal. In addition, hydrological stress scenarios representing historically severe drought years were introduced. The amount of electricity storage needed was found to be most affected by nuclear and electricity trading capacities, which is consistent with literature findings. The data period used as basis for modeling also affected the need for electricity storage, as interannual variations in renewable production were found to have a large effect on modeled results. The needed electricity storage capacities increased significantly in the stress scenarios. The electricity storage need was found to be seasonal in nature, but this may be partly due to missing demand flexibility within the modeled power system, which caused very large individual storage discharge peaks. The results emphasize the need to take several years of historical data into account to ensure system availability in different conditions. Highlights Nuclear energy was found to decrease system costs in a 100% carbon-free power system. Multi-year modeling is essential to secure system availability due to the important role of hydropower and seasonal wind variability. Electricity storages were found to be seasonal in nature. The main reason was exceptionally low windiness during individual periods, which resulted in large but temporarily short power deficits due to insufficient flexibility obtained from hydropower and power imports. This was especially evident in stress scenarios and mainly contributed to the higher costs in low-nuclear scenarios. Detailed hydropower modelling of historically exceptional dry seasons in Finland was utilized as one stress scenario. Exceptionally, dry long-term period increased the need for electricity storages significantly due to the lost flexibility offered by hydro and reduced electricity import capacities.

AB  - Urban trees are an essential component of urban ecosystems, and management of this resource constitutes an essential element of urban open space management. However, municipal tree inventories in Sweden and elsewhere have received limited attention. It is unknown how common municipal tree inventories are in Sweden, factors governing whether a municipality has an inventory and what the inventories are used for. This study therefore sought to: Create an overview of the state of Swedish municipal tree inventories and determine how municipality size, green space budget and management organisation affect the presence and scope of municipal tree inventories. The research questions examined were: What is the current state of Swedish municipal tree inventories? and what affects the status of these municipal tree inventories? A survey with questions related to strategic and operational perspectives of municipal tree inventories, e.g. how they are conducted and used, together with questions relating to budget and potential use of consultants, was sent to all 290 Swedish municipalities. The response rate was 55.5%. The main findings were that municipality size affects whether a municipality has an urban tree inventory and that the municipal organisation form affects how inventories are used. The existence of an inventory also increased the probability of the municipality having a tree management plan. Based on these results we recommend further research related to strategic management perspectives of tree inventories.

AB  - Climate change is currently perceived as the most important challenge faced globally by ecosystems and human society. The predicted changes of temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to alter the environmental conditions to which forest trees in Europe are adapted, and expose them to new pests and pathogens.This would unavoidably lead to a huge loss of ecosystem services provided to society, and at the local scale may potentially endanger the very existence of forests. In this study, we reviewed biological background and limits of mechanisms by which tree populations may cope with climate change: adaptation by natural selection, gene flow, epigenetic phenomena and phenotypic plasticity, as well as forest management strategies, which rely on these mechanisms. We argue that maintaining genetic diversity is important in the long-term view but natural selection cannot ensure sufficiently rapid response to environmental change. On the other hand, epigenetic memory effects may change adaptively relevant traits within a single generation, while close-to-nature forestry practices are the basic requirement to make use of epigenetics. Assisted migration, as a frequently suggested mitigation option, relies primarily on the knowledge gained from provenance research; the review analyses potential pitfalls of this strategy. We suggest that all approaches, i.e., leaving a part of forests without management, close-to-nature forestry, and transfer of forest reproductive materials from sources presumably adapted to future climates are combined across the landscape in an integrative manner.

AB  - Landscape multifunctionality, a widely accepted challenge for boreal forests, aims to simultaneously provide timber, non-timber ecosystem services, and shelter for biodiversity. However, multifunctionality requires the use of novel forest management regimes optimally combined over the landscape, and an increased share of sets asides. It remains unclear how this combination will shape stand vulnerability to wind disturbances and exposed timber volume. We combined forest growth simulations and multi-objective optimization to create alternative landscape level forest management scenarios. Management choices were restricted to 1) rotation forestry, 2) continuous cover forestry, and 3) all regimes allowed over a harvest intensity gradient from completely set aside landscapes to maximal economic gain. Estimates for the stands' structural and environmental characteristics were used to predict the stand level wind damage probability. We evaluated averaged wind-exposed standing timber volume and changing forest structure under management scenarios. Intensive rotation forestry reduced tree heights and wind damage risk, but also reduced landscape multifunctionality. Conversely, continuous cover forestry maintained multifunctionality but increased wind damage probability due to taller trees and higher thinning frequency. Overall, continuous cover forestry lowers the total volume of wind exposed timber at any given time compared with rotation forestry. Nevertheless, a selective application of rotation forestry contributes to high economic gains and increases landscape heterogeneity. A combination of management approaches across landscapes provides an efficient way to reduce the amount of wind-exposed timber volume while also increasing habitat for vertebrate and non-vertebrate species and satisfying high timber demands.

AB  - Herding can be characterized as a coordination game with two strategies for minimising risk: increase herd size (livestock quantity) or increase livestock body mass (livestock quality). In this paper I demonstrate that the selection of herd maximisation as a risk management strategy in the Northern parts of Norway has been influenced by a history of intra-group competition exacerbating herder conflict and lack of trust. In the South herder-farmer conflicts have increased herder coordination and trust, resulting in the selection of increasing livestock quality as the dominant risk management strategy.

AB  - Renewable energy technologies are expanding in rural landscapes, where they are changing the character and meaning of place. This study explores the experience of living and recreating in proximity to landscapes undergoing this development, namely in a Swedish municipality where a major wind park is located. Using place attachment, it addresses how people construct meaning around places of everyday life through stories of their experience of place. Results show that individuals form coherent narratives of the past, present and future of places undergoing transformation. Stories of experiences of renewable energy technology and their impact on landscape relate to persisting feelings of rootedness, changing land-use activities and hope for a sustainable future. Place attachments are a form of social action as their formulation enables people to deal with change and embrace discourses of sustainability. Results highlight the discourses and practices that rural dwellers adopt in the wake of renewable energy transitions.

AB  - Weeds constitute major constraints for farmers by reducing crop yield and quality. However, weeds are managed effectively using herbicides, but this may cause harmful effects on human health and the environment. In an experiment on weed seed predation, we tested the biological control potential of carabid beetles to combat weeds in the absence of herbicides. Seeds from three common weed species were placed in cereal fields on conventional and organic farms located along a landscape complexity gradient (area annual crops within 1 km) in two distinct regions in Sweden. Carabid beetles were sampled in the same fields using pitfall traps. Neither carabid species richness nor seed removal was related to organic farming. Seed removal was significantly related to carabid species richness and both carabid species richness and seed removal was higher in landscapes with large total area of annual crops, although the evenness of the carabid communities was lower. The carabid genera with strongest positive relationship to seed removal differed between regions (Trechus in Uppland and Pterostichus in Scania), as did the preference for the different weed seed species. This study concludes that carabid species richness contributes to weed seed predation and that large scale landscape context explains more variation in the carabids' responses than local farming practices.

AB  - Two of the main motives for people to be engaged in the Mexican Payment for Environmental Services (PES) programme are forest conservation and the income received from the programme. We explore the socioeconomic conditions that support choosing these motives. We used data from a 2012 nationwide survey, processed through logit models. Significant factors influencing the desire to conserve as a motive were family welfare improvement, land use change intention, and training. Those affecting income as a motive were formal education, indigenous people participation and training. Finally, factors related to both conservation and income, as a motive, were formal education, training, PES influence in water management, and land boundary conflicts. Income and conservation are not mutually exclusive motives for engagement in the programme, given that in developing countries income from PES may reduce the socioeconomic pressures triggering land use change, and has a role in conservation efforts, already present in many rural communities.

AB  - Private residential areas represent a large portion of urban tree canopy and provide a significant amount of ecosystem services for mitigation of negative environmental impacts. With densification, construction of impermeable surfaces, loss of plantable space and urban tree canopy loss, communities are facing a potential degradation of urban environment and loss of living quality. Monitoring urban tree canopy change with repeated assessments over time is key for supplying information for management decisions.
   We examined how remote sensing has been used in the past assessments of urban tree canopy area, the public availability and quality of geodata sources and grey literature examples. Field measurements of tree canopy area were collected in private residential properties in Malmo, Sweden and compared to estimates of canopy area using remote sensing data collected by the public mapping agency Lantmateriet. The remote sensing model was derived using normalized difference in vegetation (NDVI) and LiDAR.
   Most Swedish municipalities conduct urban tree monitoring schemes only on street and park trees. Our results show a correlation in remotely sensed tree canopy area and field measurements, suggesting that monitoring of private residential areas can be conducted frequently and non-invasively where remote sensing information of similar quality is available.

AB  - Although hardly noticed or formally recognised, urban foraging by humans probably occurs in all urban settings around the world. We draw from research in India, South Africa, Sweden, and the United States to demonstrate the ubiquity and varied nature of urban foraging in different contexts. Across these different contexts, we distil seven themes that characterise and thereby advance thinking about research and the understanding of urban foraging. We show that it is widespread and occurs across a variety of urban spaces and places. The species used and the local practices vary between contexts, and are in constant flux as urban ecological and social settings change. This requires that urban foragers are knowledgeable about diverse species, harvest locations, and rights of access, and that their practices are adaptable to changing contexts. Despite its ubiquity, most cities have some forms of regulations that prohibit or discourage urban foraging. We highlight a few important exceptions that can provide prototypes and lessons for other cities regarding supportive policy frameworks and initiatives. The formulation of dynamic policy, design, and management strategies in support of urban foraging will benefit from understanding the common characteristics of foraging in cities worldwide, but also will require comprehension of the specific and dynamic contexts in which they would be implemented.

AB  - In post-disturbance areas, salvage logging is a common management practice that can negatively affect ecosystem services and alter successional pathways of natural regeneration. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of salvage logging in post-fire areas on the regeneration and height of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestrisL.) on dry-poor, wet-poor, and peat soils. We used the Poisson generalised linear mixed-effects model and linear mixed-effect model to assess the effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine. In all forest types in post-fire areas, Scots pine and birch (Betula pendulaRoth andBetula pubescensEhrh.) were the most common tree species, accounting for 70-100% of the total regeneration abundance. Salvage logging resulted in significantly higher abundance of Scots pine only on mesic-peat soil. Mean height of Scots pine was significantly lower in stands with larger abundance of remnant living trees. In our study, we did not find conclusive evidence of negative effects of salvage logging on the abundance and height of Scots pine.

AB  - Trees and large shrubs in urban environments provide a wide array of ecosystem services, enhancing the wellbeing of urban residents. Public trees in Sweden are managed by local governments, but private-owned urban trees, which represent a large proportion of the total urban tree population, are managed by residential property owners. Residential urban trees are generally not included in urban forest management plans at local government level. This study examined property-level characteristics that could lead to better management decisions by property owners on residential trees in Malmo center dot, Sweden. Using spatial sampling, 99 properties were inventoried to determine tree basal area (m2/ha), as a measure of woody plant abundance. In parallel, residents were surveyed about their attitudes to trees, and information on background variables on their properties was collected using through publicly available spatial data. Statistical modelling was used to determine relationships between key socio-ecological variables and tree abundance as well as reasons for planting and removal of trees. The results showed that positively perceived benefits of trees to property owners did not necessarily result in greater tree and shrub abundance on individual properties. Instead, house age and potential plantable space were the variables positively correlated with tree and shrub abundance. Years of residence had a negative correlation with probability of planting. The primary reason for tree removal was improper growing site, which indicates that providing practical information on appropriate site/species selection could reduce the risk of healthy urban tree removal.

AB  - Environmental impact assessment allows for compensation of environmental injuries in the form of resource-based restoration projects. Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a nonmonetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Smola windpower plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-year metric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual white-tailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smola ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site.

AB  - Recent actions to mitigate biodiversity loss in agricultural environments appear insufficient despite the considerable efforts channeled via the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy. One likely reason for this failure is the limited attention paid to the regional and landscape level ecological characteristics in farmland conservation planning. We demonstrate how to obtain conservation prioritization solutions that would address simultaneously three goals, including two landscape level targets: minimizing local habitat quality loss, maximizing habitat connectivity, and incorporating landscape heterogeneity. As these goals may be contradictory, we investigate the potential trade-offs between them. We used the Zonation prioritization tool to examine how our three goals could be implemented in the agricultural landscapes of southwest Finland. We used measures of (i) biodiversity value of grasslands, (ii) connectivity between grasslands, and (iii) landscape heterogeneity which comprised of (land cover type based) compositional heterogeneity and (field margin based) configurational heterogeneity. Integration of landscape heterogeneity measures and habitat connectivity resulted in some trade-offs with local habitat quality, the most prominent observation being that landscape heterogeneity co-varied with grassland connectivity. Among the two landscape heterogeneity parameters, inclusion of compositional heterogeneity resulted in more clustered prioritization solutions than configurational heterogeneity, which had a spatially more balanced impact. Concordance among landscape scale factors implies high potential for reconstruction of a functioning network of semi-natural grasslands in areas under intensive agricultural use. Broader scale multi-objective planning approaches can thus importantly support targeting biodiversity conservation planning and mediating the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy objectives.

AB  - Riparian forest buffers have multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services in both freshwater and terrestrial habitats but are rarely implemented in water ecosystem management, partly reflecting the lack of information on the effectiveness of this measure. In this context, social learning is valuable to inform stakeholders of the efficacy of riparian vegetation in mitigating stream degradation. We aim to develop a Bayesian belief network (BBN) model for application as a learning tool to simulate and assess the reach-and segment-scale effects of riparian vegetation properties and land use on instream invertebrates. We surveyed reach-scale riparian conditions, extracted segment-scale riparian and subcatchment land use information from geographic information system data, and collected macroinvertebrate samples from four catchments in Europe (Belgium, Norway, Romania, and Sweden). We modelled the ecological condition based on the Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT) index, a macroinvertebrate-based index widely used in European bioassessment, as a function of different riparian variables using the BBN modelling approach. The results of the model simulations provided insights into the usefulness of riparian vegetation attributes in enhancing the ecological condition, with reach-scale riparian vegetation quality associated with the strongest improvements in ecological status. Specifically, reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 3 (i.e. moderate quality) generally results in the highest probability of a good ASPT score (99-100%). In contrast, a site with a narrow width of riparian trees and a small area of trees with reach-scale buffer vegetation of score 1 (i.e. low quality) predicts a high probability of a bad ASPT score (74%). The strengths of the BBN model are the ease of interpretation, fast simulation, ability to explicitly indicate uncertainty in model outcomes, and interactivity. These merits point to the potential use of the BBN model in workshop activities to stimulate key learning processes that help inform the management of riparian zones.

AB  - Forests are considered crucial assets for sustainable rural development, and contemporary forestry is an industry where production, environmental and social goals can-and should-be handled simultaneously. Swedish family forest owners (FFOs) are expected to both manage and conserve their forests for the benefit of the whole country, but there are contradictions between development and conservation and between traditional and alternative forms of utilization representing dilemmas in rural areas. Tensions between urban and rural areas, between demands on what to produce and protect, are often linked to the FFOs' views on opportunities for forest management. The aim of this study is to identify and analyse the extent to which FFOs perceive that social values have the ability to generate "new" goods and services as a supplement or alternative to traditional forestry, and to suggest how the forests might be managed to render high social values. Fifty-seven interviews were conducted with FFOs (both resident and non-resident). The results indicate that regardless of where they reside, FFOs have a multifunctional view of their forests and forest management, that the social values attached to forests can play an important role in development of local recreation- and forest-based tourism activities, and in this respect they can enhance sustainable rural development. It is, however, not obvious who might start and develop these businesses, since there seems to be a lack of interest among the FFOs themselves.

AB  - Land-use conflicts can be costly and time-consuming and cause social burden to all parties. In this study, we developed an approach for mapping synergy and conflict potential between land uses and tested it on nature protection, nature-based tourism, forestry and mining. First, we calculated the ecological and socio-cultural values for the study area, and further the economic values related to forestry and mining. Second, we conducted an integrated spatial assessment of these values and used it jointly with a variant of a value compatibility analysis to locate areas with possible synergistic and conflicting land uses. This study was carried out in Finnish Lapland where land use conflicts have occurred due to the need to develop forestry and mining in areas that are also important for nature-based tourism. The method operated well as it identified sites with ongoing land-use disputes. Synergy potential between biodiversity and socio-cultural values was identified in protected areas and other sites of natural beauty, and conflict potential concerning forestry near tourist resorts and concerning mining at proposed mining project sites. The developed framework can assist in locating sites that may need proactive measurements to avoid conflicts, and sites that would benefit from multi-purpose management thereby supporting sustainable and adaptive land-use planning.

AB  - There is a current industrial and societal interest in Europe to further intensify the yield of wood for the forest industry and biomass. At the same time, green infrastructures for ecological and sociocultural values in forest landscapes should be functional. Municipalities have exclusive responsibility for comprehensive planning in Sweden. We modelled the spatial distribution of green infrastructures in terms of three forest types with high ecological values, and three sociotopes with high sociocultural values in 119 municipalities in a ruralurban gradient in Sweden. Forest land without such values should be available for intensive forestry with lower conflict risk. We also estimated the municipalities' potential for physical planning in terms of financial and social capital, and ownership category structure. The area of functional green infrastructures varied considerably among municipalities. Municipalities with a high proportion of functional green infrastructure, thus less available for intensive forestry, were characterised by a stronger tax base, higher population density and lower demographic dependency ratio, and lower proportions of industrial and state forest ownership. We discuss the need for and opportunities of introducing collaborative physical planning to accommodate multiple demands on forest landscapes. We conclude that to accommodate both functional green infrastructures and intensive forestry, a landscape approach including knowledge-based collaboration is needed at multiple-levels of governance and management.

AB  - In Washington State, small forest landowners (SFLO) play an important role in maintaining forest cover on the landscape as well as associated ecosystem services. This paper examines landowner preferences for the attributes of working forest conservation contracts (WFCC) using a choice experiment. The attributes examined are contract duration (from 10 years to perpetuity), forest management requirements, and the extent of forestland covered under the contract. We find that contract attributes are valued very differently depending on landowner objectives and harvesting behavior. Landowner characteristics and forestland spatial characteristics including distances to development and large public forestlands were found to significantly influence the likelihood of contract acceptance. While a significant portion of preference heterogeneity remains unobserved, we identify several key sources of landowner preference heterogeneity which allows for a better understanding of which landowners are likely to enroll in voluntary forest conservation contracts and may have implications for improved targeting of contracts.

AB  - This paper focuses on the availability of economic indicators and metrics to assess effects of marine aquaculture production in the North Atlantic area (the EU, Norway, Canada and USA), including also social and environmental effects. We consider how aquaculture planning and management is organised in the different countries and the usefulness of economic information to address different aquaculture-related policies. We find that the most relevant economic data for aquaculture management should be at the local and regional levels rather than nationally. The availability of such economic data is mapped for national, regional and local level. The focus is on data that are publicly available from authorities or research institutions. The availability of data is generally fairly good for national and regional data on the direct economic effects of aquaculture. Data on how aquaculture-related products or input markets are affected are however poorly available, as are economic data on external effects from aquaculture. Countries with a larger aquaculture sector tend to have better availability of aquaculture-related economic data than those with a smaller sector. An index is developed and calculated to show more specifically where the countries have relatively good or poor data availability compared to their needs. While it will not always be cost-effective or meaningful to collect economic data on the effects of aquaculture, our study indicates that several countries could benefit from expanding such data collection. It can make trade-off decisions more consistent and easier to perform, and aquaculture policies and measures can be better tailored to specific contexts.

AB  - The biodiversity of meadow vegetation can be preserved in several ways, ranging from the conservation of historical traditionally managed meadows to the establishment of new meadow biotopes managed with modern machinery. Municipal plans often state that the value of natural habitats and the quality or functionality of green infrastructure should be improved. This requires scientific knowledge on the creation of new habitats with distinctive ecosystem services in the urban and peri-urban landscape. This paper presents a re-analysis of the results of research on methods of establishing species-rich grassland vegetation in the urban setting carried out in Sweden during the 1980s. It was found that hay or straw, used as mulch to protect meadow plant seeds, improved the success of establishment (higher number of individuals per m(2)) compared to establishment on bare soil. The use of rye (Secale cereale L.) as a nursery plant also improved the establishment compared to bare soil, whereas using ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a nursery plant had no effect on the establishment of meadow species. The stripping method used to break up an existing sward did not affect the success of sown meadow plant species establishment, whereas broader strips improved the longer-term establishment (four years after sowing). The gapping method used to open up a closed grass sward was, however, important; sward removal resulted in successful establishment of meadow plant species, while burning did not. Gap size was found to be important for the establishment success rate of sown meadow plant species in the longer term (three years after sowing). Generally, the number of individuals per m(2) was higher in the first year than the second year after sowing and Leucanthemum vulgare and Rumex acetosa showed the highest number of individuals per m2 among the species included in the experiments. Planting plug plants directly in a closed grass lawn sward was found to be very successful, and the rate of survival was high. Further research is required on methods of establishing meadow plant species or meadow biotopes in an urban context, including the investigation of conflicting views on land use and residents' needs in urban and peri-urban areas. The ways in which constructed meadow biotopes contribute to the fulfilment of environmental goals and provide ecological functions and ecosystem service should also be assessed.

AB  - More than 50% of eelgrass habitats have disappeared from the Swedish NW coast in the last 30 years. Restoration is being proposed to assist recovery but little is known regarding methods suitable under Scandinavian conditions; e.g. short growing seasons and scouring by ice. In the present study we evaluated different restoration methods using shoots and seeds in a Swedish fjord and assessed if eelgrass could be successfully transplanted between sites with different depth and exposure. The study demonstrates that both shoot- and seed methods can be successfully used to restore eelgrass at this latitude. Survival and growth of unanchored single shoots, transplanted without sediment in shallow habitats (1.0-1.5 m) was very high (>500% increase in shoot density after 14 months). This restoration method showed 2-3.5 times higher growth rate and was 2-2.5 times faster compared with shoots anchored in the sediment and shoots transplanted in sediment cores, respectively, and is recommended for shallow habitats in Sweden. Growth within deeper habitats (3.0-4.5 m) was substantially tower (40% loss to 50% increase) due to light limitations and high winter mortality. Restoration using seeds distributed from mesh-bags showed very low seedling establishment rates (approximately 1%) making this method less cost-effective than transplanting single shoots in shallow habitats. However, growth of seedlings was high and this method is recommended for deep habitats with soft sediment where shoot transplantation is difficult. Despite dramatic differences in eelgrass morphology between habitats with different depth and exposure, all shoots within a planting site had the same morphology at the end of the study, independent of origin. A baseline genetic survey supported that the observed changes in morphology of transplants were due to a plastic response, suggesting that donor populations do not have to exactly match the morphology of the plants targeted for restoration.

AB  - Debates on future resource policy in northern regions raises the question of who are the legitimate stakeholders to include in policy deliberations? The Lofoten archipelago in Northern Norway is a world-class nature tourism destination, the key spawning ground for North Atlantic cod as well as a reservoir of large unexploited off-shore oil and gas deposits. We surveyed the resident Lofoten population and the larger Norwegian public to ascertain to what extent local and national perceptions of the value of selected environmental attributes and the importance of drivers of environmental change align across geographic scales. Lofoten residents and the national public both assign high value to environmental attributes, but local residents place more emphasis on harvesting marine and agricultural resources than the national public, which is more concerned with the status of individual species and conservation symbols. Our results show that the national public expresses so much interest in Lofoten that they should be considered a legitimate stakeholder in discussions about its future development paths, and while they relate to the area in a broadly similar way, there may be some specific areas of conflict that need to be considered.

AB  - The increasing global warming and the loss of biodiversity should concern us all. Some feel that outdoor activities, which take place in natural surroundings, should have a special obligation to change. In this article I present an example of what an outdoor life practice that responds to the ecological crisis could look like. I use the simple Norwegian outdoor life called friluftsliv, and the deep ecological version suggested by philosopher and climber Arne Naess (1912-2009) as an example and case. Naessian friluftsliv is interesting and relevant in three ways. First, Naess gave a philosophical basis for friluftsliv, building on deep ecology and Spinozism. Second, he presented content, norms and guidelines for a deep ecological friluftsliv. And third, he gave examples of such friluftsliv through his own practice of simple life in nature. Naess thus presents a radical alternative to present-day resource-consuming and specialized outdoor activities and nature sports. Finally, Naess's version of deep ecological friluftsliv is discussed in relation to alternative theoretical approaches and to critical questions concerning friluftsliv as practice.

AB  - This article illustrates the interconnectedness of science and politics through a case study of old-growth forest conflict in Finnish Upper Lapland. It demonstrates the ways in which "traditional science" has failed to settle the decades-long conflict between state forestry and traditional Sami reindeer herding, and discusses the potential of democratization of science through more inclusive forms of knowledge production. The analysis, which is based on qualitative interview data, shows that a traditional science focus on biological indicators and mathematical modeling has provided only a partial account of the reindeer herding-forestry interactions by ignoring the local, place-specific practices that are equally important in understanding the overall quality of pasture conditions in Upper Lapland. It concludes that an inclusive inquiry, structured according to the principles of joint fact-finding, could create a more policy-relevant, and also more scientifically robust, knowledge basis for future forest management and policy decisions.

AB  - In 2018, tourism was the fastest growing sector in the world, accounting for 10% of all jobs worldwide and 10.4% of the world's gross domestic product. Tourism is often cited as a strategy for future development at national, regional, and local levels. This paper takes a closer look at the Lofoten Islands in northern Norway, where the increase in nature-based tourism over the last two decades has occurred in parallel with the restructuring of the traditional fisheries. Nature-based tourism in rural regions relies heavily on a broad range of ecosystem services (ES). This paper will present how stakeholders in nature-based tourism assess the influence of climate change on ES crucial for their activities and for the destination and will outline and explain how the practitioners perceive their ability to withstand or adapt to these changes. With the aid of models depicting potential future climate scenarios, we initiated discussions with stakeholders and found that tourism actors have only to a minor degree sought to develop strategies to increase adaptive capacity and therefore resilience to climate change. Based on our findings, we discuss how the adaptive capacity of individual actors in nature-based tourism forms the basis for the system's resilience, and that a general resilience focus also forms the basis for transformational capacity, a capacity needed for future resilience. In light of our findings and analyses, we will conclude by reflecting on overarching systemic transformative tendencies in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and obligations contained in the Paris Agreement on reducing global emissions.

AB  - Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing food industry globally, and proposed expansion plans include substantial in-creases in production over the next decades. While this will improve global food security, contribute to the blue economy and create jobs locally, the potential negative impacts on the marine environment could be massive. The existing literature suggests that further research needs to be conducted into the dynamic nature of the social-ecological systems which host aquaculture. This paper presents the results of a choice experiment survey of Norwegian households' trade-offs between salmon production and job creation, and the detrimental impacts on the marine environment. Most respondents were at the outset neutral or supportive of plans for a substantial increase in aquaculture production. However, when informed about potential environmental impacts in terms of marine plastics and salmon lice affecting wild salmon stocks, and asked to trade these off against the positive effects, the majority opposed the plans and expressed a positive willingness -to-pay to avoid the planned expansion. Applying a hybrid mixed multinomial logit model we find that income, education and to some extent age, along with environmental attitudes, explain most of the variation in people's preferences. Support for large aquaculture expansion is higher among people who consume farmed salmon frequently and those living in areas with a high density of aquaculture farms. Hence, we do not find the so-called "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) effect. These results, which arguably contrast with previous studies of environmental impacts from aquaculture, can be useful for public planners globally as they consider expanding the blue economy.

AB  - Wetland creation is a common conservation practice to mitigate biodiversity loss, caused by global wetland destruction. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale evaluations of how created wetland characteristics and landscape context relate to bird diversity and reproductive success. We inventoried 89 created wetlands (0.2-20 ha) in central Sweden to investigate which local and landscape components were associated with breeding wetland bird species richness, pair abundance and reproductive success. Wetland size was positively associated with species richness, pair abundance and chick abundance. However, several small (1 ha) wetlands taken together were similar to or exceeded individual large wetlands of similar total wetland area, in terms of species richness, pair abundance, and chicks produced. While species richness showed a clear negative relationship with the proportion of the adjacent 50 m buffer composed of forest, pair abundance was positively related to the proportion of flooded grassland area and negatively related to the proportion of emergent water vegetation. Reproductive success measures showed no clear relationships to local habitat characteristics but tended to increase with a decreasing forest at the landscape scale. Our results suggest that breeding wetland bird populations could benefit from creating wetlands with a high flooded area, continuous management to minimise both the area of emergent water vegetation and the establishment of shrubs and trees in the immediate surroundings. We also suggest a practice of creating mainly small wetlands with a few larger ones to facilitate breeding wetland bird communities at the regional scale (gamma diversity).

AB  - Positive and negative effects on ecosystem services from plantation forestry in Europe have led to conflicts regarding non-native tree species. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) is the most common plantation species in northwest Europe, covering 1.3 Mha. In costal Norway, Sitka spruce was intentionally introduced and is currently occupying about 50,000 ha. Sitka spruce was blacklisted in Norway in 2012, mainly based on the risk for invasive spreading, but little quantitative documentation exists on spread. Here we quantify spread from plantations into abandoned heathland and pastures in thirteen sites where natural regeneration occurs. Spread distances and zero-square distributions related to the nearest edge of the parent stand were fitted by use of Weibull. The median expansion rate was 0.8 m.year(-1) in north Norway and 4.4 m.year(-1) in west Norway. The maximum establishment distance measured was 996 m. A peak in sapling density occurred within 50 m from the edge, and there was a general decrease in saplings with increasing distance. Conversely, increase in zero-squares percentages occurred with increasing distance. We argue that inclusion of abundance in assessing spread is necessary to define invasiveness. Based on spread models and prevailing forestry practices we recommend that the establishment of new Sitka spruce plantations within 200 m of protected areas should be avoided.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a framework that includes measures, criteria and document-based arguments for ecological sustainability of Finnish local food. Our framework consists on several aspects of ecological sustainability: nutritional value of food, use of local resources in food production, eutrophication, ecotoxic and toxic impacts of used hazardous substances in food production, impacts of food production on biodiversity and ecosystem services and climate impact of food production. The arguments found in the project to support ecological sustainability of local food were aggregated into so-called argument bank.
   The local food sector enterprises can use the arguments to increase ecological sustainability in their functions concerning local food and to communication and marketing. In addition to the production side, consumer-focused versions of arguments were used for local food consumers in order to help them specify their demands for food sustainability. Arguments can be found in various chain actions in food production chain (e.g. agricultural production, processing, transportation), where they increase ecological sustainability. Communication and collaboration among stakeholders should be enhanced. It is important to produce knowledge and communicate it within and among local consumer groups.

AB  - We use spatially explicit indicators for biodiversity conservation status and opportunity costs of conservation to evaluate the role of voluntary forest conservation in a mix of policy instruments distributed across a landscape. We define a spatially explicit evaluation of a policy mix as a policyscape analysis. A policyscape analysis includes a comparison of (1) actual spatial overlap of instruments, (2) functional overlap of instruments in a cost-effectiveness space, and (3) complementary spatial targeting of instruments as computed by reserve site selection models. To illustrate, we evaluate the actual spatial coverage in cost-effectiveness space of Norway's public protected areas and private voluntary forest conservation. We use proxies for conservation value and opportunity costa national Nature Index for forests and forest productivity classes. We conclude by discussing the empirical challenges of our policyscape analysis. These have bearing on future return-on-investment analysis and reserve site selection modeling in Norway.

AB  - Auctions appeal to analysts and policy designers because of their potential efficiency in recruiting new areas for nature conservation. The failure to develop genuine auctions and competitive tender processes is typically blamed on the design and the attractiveness of the instrument. However, the institutional constraints that a new competitive mechanism faces when placed in a real-world ecological-institutional setting are only partly anticipated by the theoretical and analytical approaches. This paper explores the theory-based principles of cost-effectiveness against a real-world auction instrument designed for forest biodiversity conservation in Finland. The instrument, called "Natural Values Trading", specified that the tenders should be invited and compared on an annual basis but the competitive procedure was not operationalized. Instead, sites were evaluated on a first come - first serve basis, applying ecological criteria and pricing based on opportunity costs. The institutional constraints of the auction mechanism centred on the difficulty that public authorities geared toward implementing law and treating citizens equally faced with a competitive arrangement. The pressure to generate instant impact overrode experimenting with new mechanisms and exiting an administrative comfort zone. The findings conform to the institutional theories that identify challenges with matching organizational mandate, reallocating and developing organizational competencies as well as changing informal organizational and professional practices. The design of biodiversity conservation mechanisms will not go far by focusing solely on cost-effectiveness; instead, the institutional friction should be taken seriously and organizational mandates, competencies and practices should be addressed explicitly.

AB  - Indigenous peoples live their modernity alongside majority populations and global change processes. This is the case with indigenous Saami who descend from a long lineage of nomadic reindeer-herding families and who now live and herd reindeer in and around the small tourism town of Kilpisjarvi (Gilbbesjavri), Finland. Saami reindeer nomadism was a highly mobile way of life at the turn of the twentieth century. However, as many Saami now live a more settled life, their culture is in constant danger of becoming engulfed by various developments, including tourism and the various forms of land use. This essay focuses on longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork in the region and on its dynamic changes. The essay illustrates the Saami struggle, not just with holding their ground with respect to other interest groups, but also with how their actions aim to maintain local visibility of their culture, while also ensuring a respect towards a right to agency and to culture change on their own terms. The essay's methodological findings emphasise the importance of both long-term research partnerships and of participant observation in ethnographic work, stressing how attentive "loitering around" may lay the groundwork for other forms of research methodologies and auxiliary research materials.

AB  - Total is committed to reducing the impact of its activities on the environment, especially its greenhouse gas emissions. The group's priorities are to improve the energy efficiency of its industrial facilities, to reduce the flaring of associated gas, to invest in the development of complementary energy sources (biomass, solar, clean coal) and to participate in many operational and R&D programs on CO2 capture, transport and geological storage. It has been involved in CO2 injection and geological storage for over 15 years, in Canada (Weyburn oil field) for EOR and Norway (Sleipner, Snohvit) for aquifer storage. In 2006, the company decided to invest 60 million euros to experiment CO2 capture, transportation and injection in a depleted gas reservoir. The pilot in the Lacq basin, SW France. 800 km from Paris. has been on stream since January 2010.
   The experimental plant is unique in several respects: by its size (unprecedented worldwide), capturing carbon through a 30-MWth oxy-combustion gas boiler, by the choice of a depleted deep onshore gas reservoir (unprecedented in Europe) located onshore 5 kilometers south of the agglomeration of Pau (around 140,000 inhabitants) and by its scope, operating a fully integrated industrial chain (comprising extraction, treatment, combustion of natural gas, High-pressure steam production. CO2 capture, transport and injection) on the SEVESO-classified Lacq industrial complex.
   The pilot installations were designed by the Total E&P Research and Development team and are operated by Total Exploration Production France. The project reflects Total's commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
   A dedicated plan was devised with the French authorities to monitor the integrity of the injection site and confirm that the CO2 remains trapped in its host reservoir. Its main objectives arc to check that no CO2 is leaking upward out of the reservoir though either the injection well or the cap rock, so as to avoid any impact on the groundwater and surface water resources, the biosphere (Fauna and Flora) or human health.
   This paper details the main technical features of the pilot and the monitoring program spanning subsurface and surface aspects, together with the operational feedback after more than two and half years of operation.
   Based on the pilot's performance to date, Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) appears to hold promise for use on an industrial scale. This industrial operation will capture and trap up to 90,000 tonnes of Carbon dioxide over a three and half year period. This quantity is equivalent to the exhaust emissions of 30,000 cars over a 2-year period.

AB  - Forests provide a range of vital services to society and are critical habitats for biodiversity, holding inherent multifunctionality. While traditionally viewed as a byproduct of production-focused forestry, today's forest ecosystem services and biodiversity (FESB) play an essential role in several sectoral policies' needs. Achieving policy objectives requires careful management considering the interplay of services, influenced by regional aspects and climate. Here, we examined the multifunctionality gap caused by these factors through simulation of forest management and multi-objective optimization methods across different regions - Finland, Norway, Sweden and Germany (Bavaria). To accomplish this, we tested diverse management regimes (productivity-oriented silviculture, several continuous cover forestry regimes and set asides), two climate scenarios (current and RCP 4.5) and three policy strategies (National Forest, Biodiversity and Bioeconomy Strategies). For each combination we calculated a multifunctionality metric at the landscape scale based on 5 FESB classes (biodiversity conservation, bioenergy, climate regulation, wood, water and recreation). In Germany and Norway, maximum multifunctionality was achieved by increasing the proportion of set-asides and proportionally decreasing the rest of management regimes. In Finland, maximum MF would instead require that policies address greater diversity in management, while in Sweden, the pattern was slightly different but similar to Finland. Regarding the climate scenarios, we observed that only for Sweden the difference in the provision of FESB was significant. Finally, the highest overall potential multifunctionality was observed for Sweden (National Forest scenario, with a value of 0.94 for the normalized multifunctionality metric), followed by Germany (National Forest scenario, 0.83), Finland (Bioeconomy scenario, 0.81) and Norway (National Forest scenario, 0.71). The results highlight the challenges of maximizing multifunctionality and underscore the significant influence of country-specific policies and climate change on forest management. To achieve the highest multifunctionality, strategies must be tailored to specific national landscapes, acknowledging both synergistic and conflicting FESB.

AB  - Timber use in central Europe is expected to increase in the future, in line with forest policy goals to strengthen local wood supply for CO2-neutral energy production, construction and other uses. Growing stocks in low-elevation forests in Switzerland are currently high as exemplified by the Swiss canton of Aargau, for which an average volume of 346 +/- 16 m(3) ha(-1) was measured in the 3rd Swiss National forest inventory (NFI) in 2004-2006. While this may justify a reduction of growing stocks through increased timber harvesting, we asked whether such a strategy may conflict with the sustainability of timber production and conservation goals. We evaluated a range of operationally relevant forest management scenarios that varied with respect to rotation length, growing stock targets and the promotion of conifers in the regeneration. The scenarios aimed at increased production of softwood, energy wood, the retention of potential habitat trees (PHTs) and the conversion to a continuous cover management system. They were used to drive the inventory-based forest simulator MASSIMO for 100 years starting in 2007 using the NFI sampling plots in Aargau. We analyzed model outputs with respect to projected future growing stock, growth, timber and energy yield and harvesting costs. We found growing stock to drop to 192 m(3) ha(-1) in 2106 if business-as-usual (BAU as observed between the 2nd and 3rd NFI) timber volumes were set as harvesting targets for the whole simulation period. The promotion of conifers and a reduction of rotation lengths in a softwood scenario yielded 25% more timber over the whole simulation period than BAU. An energy wood scenario that reduced growing stock to 200 m(3) ha(-1) by 2056 and promoted the natural broadleaved regeneration yielded 9% more timber than BAU before 2056 and 30% less thereafter due to decreasing increments. The softwood scenario resulted in higher energy yield than the energy wood scenario despite the lower energy content of softwood. Retaining PHT resulted in a reduction of timber harvest (0.055 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) per habitat tree) and higher harvesting costs. Continuous cover management yielded moderate timber amounts throughout the simulation period, yet sustainably. Considering climate change, we discuss the risks associated with favoring drought- and disturbance-susceptible conifers at low elevations and emphasize that continuous cover management must allow for the regeneration of drought-adapted tree species. In conclusion, our simulations show potential for short-term increases in timber mobilization but also that such increases need to be carefully balanced with future forest productivity and other forest ecosystem services.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the use of forests both by Sami reindeer herders and for commercial forestry has been a source of increasing conflict in northern Sweden. Forestry disturbs forest ecosystems and thus damages reindeer pastures, especially those rich in ground lichen, for which reindeer forage during the wintertime by digging through the snow. Despite increased communication between the two groups, the Sami still feel that their interests are not adequately considered by the commercial forestry sector. This paper presents the results of an interdisciplinary study that comprised semi-directed interviews and participant observations. The objective was to understand the Sami reindeer herders' extensive ecological knowledge of winter forest pastures, and the characteristics they observe when managing this resource. The study also analysed specific terminology used by the Sami herders, to describe, analyse and communicate these properties. These terms, as well as Sami herder knowledge in general, emphasize the importance of snow cover for reindeer grazing in forest pastures, as well as the effects of forest structure and ground vegetation on variations in snow cover during the winter. Whereas the Western use of the word 'pasture' is often associated with a specific plant community, the Sami herders' understanding of the word also includes the effect of snow on grazing and for this they use a culturally specific word in their language guohtun. This term conveys the additional notion of whether it is possible for reindeer to access the pasture under the snow. Sami herder knowledge and know-how allow them to use the mosaic of forest ecosystems to accommodate variability in snow cover during the wintertime, using different forest areas in response to different grazing conditions. Finally, the authors argue that, in order to promote the balanced, multiple use of boreal forest ecosystems, it is necessary to acknowledge and understand Sami reindeer herders knowledge and thus to fully integrate their needs and aspirations.

AB  - In freshwater habitats, invasive species and the increase of cyanobacterial blooms have been identified as a major cause of biodiversity loss. The invasive cyanobacteria Raphidiopsis raciborskii a toxin-producing and bloom-forming species affecting local biodiversity and ecosystem services is currently expanding its range across Europe. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and regional bioclimatic environmental variables, such as temperature and precipitation, to identify suitable areas for the colonization and survival of R. raciborskii, with special focus on the geographic extent of potential habitats in Northern Europe. SDMs predictions uncovered areas of high occurrence probability of R. raciborskii in locations where it has not been recorded yet, e.g. some areas in Central and Northern Europe. In the southeastern part of Sweden, areas of suitable climate for R. raciborskii corresponded with lakes of high concentrations of total phosphorus, increasing the risk of the species to thrive. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict areas at high risk of R. raciborskii colonization in Europe. The results from this study suggest several areas across Europe that would need monitoring programs to determine if the species is present or not, to be able to prevent its potential colonization and population growth. Regarding an undesirable microorganism like R. raciborskii, authorities may need to start information campaigns to avoid or minimize the spread.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, deadwood is an important component that provides habitat and contributes to nutrient cycles, as well as to carbon and water storage. The change of wood constituents, nutrients and microbial species richness in the field over the whole time of decomposition has only rarely been studied, in particular not in relation to oxidative enzyme activities (mediating lignin degradation) and different forest management regimes.
   To describe wood decomposition, we selected coarse woody debris (CWD) in form of 197 logs of Fagus sylvatica, Picea dies and Pinus sylvestris in forests with different management regimes across three regions in Germany. They were sampled and analyzed for wood density, water content, wood constituents (Klason and acid-soluble lignin, organic extractives, water-soluble lignin fragments), carbon, nitrogen and metals (Al, Ca, Cu, K, Mg, Mn and Zn). Furthermore, the activities of oxidative enzymes like laccase, manganese peroxidase, and general peroxidase were measured. Since filamentous fungi (Basidiomycota, Ascomycota) are the major biological agents of wood decomposition, fungal species richness based on sporocarps and molecular fingerprints was recorded.
   Higher forest management intensity had a negative effect on deadwood volume and in consequence on fungal species richness (sporocarps), but hardly to other analyzed variables. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the tree species for the concentrations of wood constituents and most nutrients as well as the activities of oxidative enzymes, although their course during decomposition was mostly similar among the tree species. We found that molecular species richness increased with the period of decomposition in contrast to the number of fruiting species, which was highest in the intermediate stage of decomposition. Both types of species richness increased with increasing volume of the CWD logs. Regarding the entire period of decomposition, white-rot fungi (WRF), based on identification of sporocarps, were the most abundant group of wood-decaying fungi in all three tree species. This corresponds well with the overall presence of laccase and peroxidases and the concomitant substantial loss of lignin, which points to the importance of these enzymes in deadwood decomposition. We found a continuous decomposition and decline of volume-related concentrations in wood constituents and nutrients with time of decomposition. Contrary to volume-related concentrations, the concentrations related to dry mass frequently increased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climatic warming may lead to increased or decreased future forest productivity. However, more frequent heat waves, droughts and storms and accompanying pathogen attacks are also expected for Europe and are considered to be increasingly important abiotic and biotic stress factors for forests. Adaptive forestry can help forest ecosystems to adapt to these new conditions in order to achieve management goals, maintain desired forest ecosystem services and reduce the risks of forest degradation. With a focus on central Europe, this paper presents the following management strategies: (1) conservation of forest structures, (2) active adaptation, and (3) passive adaptation. The feasibility and criteria for application of the different strategies are discussed. Forest adaptation may entail the establishment of oneonativeo forests, including the use and intermixing of native and non-native tree species as well as non-local tree provenances that may adapt better to future climate conditions. An integrative adaptive management concept is proposed that combines (1) species suitability tests and modelling activities at the international scale, (2) priority mapping of adaptation strategies at the national to regional scale, and (3) implementation at the local scale. To achieve this, an international experimental trial system is required to test suitable adaptive measures throughout Europe and worldwide.

AB  - The wind energy being a freely available and low-carbon energy source has got the focus of decision makers around the world, because wind energy systems can reduce the dependence of a nation on fossil fuels and can contribute to a sustainable development of both climate and energy. However, wind power comes with certain environmental impacts and land use constraints that should be taken into account, in order to reach main sustainability goals concerning biodiversity and ecosystem services. The Swedish national goal regarding wind energy development has been set to 30 TWh by the year 2020, of which 20 TWh should come from the on-shore wind energy resource. Therefore, wind energy development in Sweden could play an important role in achieving the future energy and environmental targets. In this regard, we assessed the wind energy potential available in Sweden using a GIS-based approach. We aimed to estimate the technical onshore wind energy potential available in Sweden by considering system performance, topographic limitations, environmental, and land use constraints in the form of two restriction scenarios. The results of this paper can draw the attention of decision makers to reach a sustainable wind energy development in Sweden. The results achieved in this paper suggest that Sweden possesses sufficient wind energy potential and land area available for wind energy installations, which can be used to meet the future renewable energy targets in Sweden.

AB  - Picking wild berries, which has long been the most popular consumptive outdoor recreation activity in the Nordic countries, has shown indications of declining. In Finland, over half of the population still participates in berry picking, and picking wild berries is generally considered to have cultural and economic importance. Recreational berry picking is based on the Nordic everyman's right, which is the right of open access to all forests for purposes such as picking wild berries and mushrooms, regardless of land ownership. Using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, this study analyzes those characteristics of a representative Finnish sample that affect not only berry picking in general but also frequency of berry picking. The results of this analysis indicate that the activity of picking wild berries is linked to a rural lifestyle, particularly to the lifestyle of older generations and the use of summer cottage.

AB  - According to protection targets of EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, 30% of EU's land and sea area should be legally protected by 2030. While the actual targets and even terms are still to be defined, the strategy's possible impacts can be simulated for policy support purposes. The strategy aims to increase protection by setting aside forests and extending closer-to-nature forest management practices. We simulated Finland's forest resources with the European Forestry Dynamics Model (EFDM) considering the protection targets. According to our simulations, the total growing stock and net present value will be lower with the additional protection than by carrying on the business-as-usual management. The additional protection resulted in intensified harvesting in the remaining forest area available for wood supply with the current harvest level. This may weaken the positive ecological impacts of protection. Reducing the harvest level from the current level is not a likely alternative either, because the demand for biomass is predicted to increase in the future, while the supply is insufficient, and EU policies aim to avoid shifting the negative impacts of resource extraction outside the EU. The feasibility of the additional protection depends on the actual implementation and definitions.

AB  - We investigated and compared management practices for dealing with uncertainty in agroecosystem dynamics in two cases of smallholder farming in different parts of the world: northeast Tanzania and east-central Sweden. Qualitative research methods were applied to map farmers' practices related to agroecosystem management. The practices are clustered according to a framework of ecosystem services relevant for agricultural production and discussed using a theoretical model of ecosystem dynamics. Almost half of the identified practices were found to be similar in both cases, with similar approaches for adjusting to and dealing with local variability and disturbance. Practices that embraced the ecological roles of wild as well as domesticated flora and fauna and the use of qualitative biological indicators are identified as tools that built insurance capital for change and enhanced the capacity to respond to changing agroecosystem dynamics. Diversification in time and space, as well as more specific practices for mitigating pest outbreaks and temporary droughts, can limit the effects of disturbance. In both Sweden and Tanzania, we identified social mechanisms for the protection of species that served important functions in the agroecosystem. We also found examples of how old practices served as a source of adaptations for dealing with new conditions and that new knowledge was adjusted to local conditions. The study shows that comparing management practices across scales and in different cultural settings can reveal insights into the capacity of farmers to adjust, respond to, and shape ecosystem dynamics. We emphasize the importance of continuous learning for developing the sustainable management of complex agroecosystems and securing agricultural production for the future.

AB  - The climate impact of bioenergy is debated, especially due to potential land use change effects and biogenic carbon fluxes. This study assessed the climate impact and energy efficiency of conventional long-rotation forest residues (branches, tops and stumps) and short-rotation forestry (willow) from a landscape perspective. A time-dependent life cycle assessment method, which considers the timing of biogenic carbon fluxes and the impact on global temperature over time, was combined with GIS mapping to assess the impact for a specific Swedish region (Uppsala County), i.e. a 'real' landscape. The results showed that harvesting forest residues decreased the forest carbon stocks over the landscape, while growing willow on previous fallow land increased the total carbon stocks. On average, energy ratios of 49 MJ MJ(-1) for branches and tops, and 30 MJ MJ(-1) for stumps and willow was found. Harvesting forest residues from the studied landscape resulted in climate impacts of around 0.8.10(-15) K MJ(-1) heat for branches and tops, and 1.3.10(-15) K MJ(-1) heat for stumps. Willow energy gave the lowest climate impact of about -0.6,10(-15) K MJ(-1) heat. The landscape analysis showed that spatial variations in the region had an effect on energy efficiency and climate impact, but that this effect was relatively small. A more important factor was the time frame chosen for the analysis, especially for long-rotation forest systems. Methodological choices such as spatial scale (stand or landscape perspective), allocation method and functional unit also influenced the results.

AB  - Coastal protection has evolved from focusing on hard solutions such as breakwaters and groynes to include soft or nature-based solutions (NbS). NbS have been proposed as cost-effective means to offer long-term coastal protection and at the same time strengthen coastal resilience and biodiversity. However, projects utilizing NbS for coastal protection have often focused on a single solution and the evidence of improved biodiversity remain equivocal.
   In this paper, we review solutions traditionally used for disparate purposes - namely beach nourishment and the establishment of vascular plants such as seagrass and dune grass. The main incentives behind large-scale beach nourishment projects are often the cost-effectiveness, multifunctionality and dynamic shoreline protection whereas the focus of vegetation restoration has typically been on recreating important habitats and not specifically as a coastal protection measure. Based on previous studies and an on-going large-scale coastal adaptation project in southern Sweden, we investigate the feasibility of combining these seemingly dichotomous management strategies to yield a viable physical defense and at the same time strengthen coastal biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality. Given the urgency in combatting biodiversity loss and adapting to a changing climate, management interventions for coastal protection should explicitly incorporate ecological values into every coastal protection measure and seek innovative, integrated approaches that consider both geomorphological and ecological values and the possible complementarity between the two.

AB  - We studied the interannual variation of late summer snow covered area (SCA), i.e. snowbeds and permanent snow patches, in northern Finland and analyzed the role of topographical factors and climatic conditions on the recent and future occurrence of summer snow. SCA for the years 2000, 2004, 2006 and 2009 was derived from Landsat images using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI). Late summer SCA varied notably between the years (1.5-23.0 km(2)). A major part of the late summer snow was located above 900-1000 m and on northern and eastern slopes. A generalized additive model (GAM) showed that the number of years with snow present in 1 km grid squares was strongly positively related to altitude and terrain ruggedness. Parallel examination of interannual variation of SCA and climatic conditions showed that snow cover declines were linked to relatively low snowfall-to-rainfall ratios. Annual mean air temperatures, particularly spring and early winter temperatures, showed increasing trends during the study period. Projected increases in air temperatures and rainfall suggest earlier and more efficient snow melt in the future. This may threaten the occurrence of species and communities related to snowbeds and decrease the beta-diversity of the landscape, and could also affect ecosystem services of the region.

AB  - Modelling walking distance enables the observation of non-linearities in hedonic property pricing of accessibility to greenspace. We test a penalized spline spatial error model (PS-SEM), which has two distinctive features. First, the PS-SEM controls for the presence of a spatially autocorrelated error term. Second, the PS-SEM allows for continuous non-linear distance decay of the property price premium as a function of walking distance to greenspaces. As a result, compared with traditional spatial econometric methods, the PS-SEM has the advantage that data determines the functional form of the distance decay of the implicit price for greenspace accessibility. Our PS-SEM results from Oslo, Norway, suggest that the implicit price for greenspace access is highly non-linear in walking distance, with the functional form varying for different types of greenspaces. Our results caution against using simple linear distances and assumptions of log or stepwise buffer-based distance decay in property prices relative to pedestrian network distance to urban amenities. The observed heterogeneity in the implicit property prices for walking distance to greenspace also provides a general caution against using non-spatial hedonic pricing models when aggregating values of greenspace amenities for policy analysis or urban ecosystem accounting purposes.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry and commercial forestry seek to co-exist in the forests of Northern Sweden. As interwoven as the two industries are, conflicts have arisen. Forest practices have reduced the distribution of lichen, the main winter diet for reindeer. Forest practices have also increased forest density, compromising the animals' ability to pass through forested areas on their migration routes. In an attempt to reduce impacts on reindeer husbandry, we present a spatially explicit harvest scheduling model that includes reindeer corridors with user-defined spatial characteristics. We illustrate the model in a case study and explore the relationship between timber revenues and the selection and maintenance of reindeer corridors. The corridors are not only to include sufficient lichen habitat, but they are also supposed to ensure access for reindeer by connecting lichen areas with linkages that allow unobstructed travel. Since harvest scheduling occurs over a planning horizon, the spatial configuration of corridors can change from one time period to the next in order to accommodate harvesting activities. Our results suggest that maintaining reindeer corridors in harvest scheduling can be done at minimal cost. Also, we conclude that including corridor constraints in the harvest scheduling model is critical to guarantee connectivity of reindeer pastures.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to define and describe typical beef production systems in Denmark and Sweden and estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions including contribution from soil carbon changes and land use change (LUC) in a life cycle perspective (LCA). Five typical Danish (DK) and four typical Swedish (SE) systems were identified; hereof three systems with beef from beef breed cattle and six systems with beef from bull calves derived from dairy production system (including steers). The beef breed systems include an extensive system (DK) and two intensive systems (SE, DK). In the systems with beef from dairy bull calves, the bull calves were slaughtered at different ages; 9.0 months (SE), 9.4 months (DK), 11.5 months (DK), 19.0 months (SE) and at 25.0 months in the two systems with steers (DK, SE). Feed use and carbon footprint (CF) per kg meat were positively correlated. Beef from dairy bull calves slaughtered between 9.0 and 19.0 months had the lowest CF (8.9-11.5 kg CO2/kg carcass) and feed use (7.3-11.1 kg DM/kg carcass). The steer systems had a CF of 16.6-17.0 kg CO2/kg carcass and feed use of 13.2-15.5 kg DM/kg carcass. The highest CF and feed use were seen for beef breed systems at 23.1-29.7 kg CO2/kg carcass and 20.9-29.8 kg DM/kg carcass, respectively.
   The GHG contribution from LUC was positively correlated to the use of arable land. Beef from dairy bull calves had the lowest LUC contribution (13-1.6 kg CO2/kg carcass) from a land use of 9.4-11.5 m(2)/kg carcass. The highest LUC contribution (2.5-3.5 kg CO2/kg carcass) and land use of 17.3-24.7 m(2)/kg carcass was seen for beef from beef breed systems, the Swedish dairy bull calf slaughtered at 19 month, and the Danish steer. Besides arable land, the beef breed systems also used permanent pastures that were assumed not to contribute to LUC. Carbon (C) sequestration from crop residues and use of manure had a mitigating effect on GHG emission in all beef systems. The lowest C sequestration was seen for systems with beef from dairy bull calves slaughtered between 9 and 19 months, making up 0.2-0.9 kg CO2/kg carcass, and the highest C sequestration was for the steer production and the beef breed systems, contributing between 23 and 4.8 kg CO2/kg carcass.
   The present study supports the hypothesis that feed use per kg carcass weight is a main driver for variation in greenhouse gas emission, land use change and soil carbon changes for beef meat sourced from different beef production systems. For the carbon footprint per kg carcass there was a positive correlation with feed use and therefore also the lowest carbon footprint per kg carcass in systems with the lowest feed intake, such as bull calves from dairy production.

AB  - Global climate change is affecting carbon cycling by driving changes in primary productivity and rates of carbon fixation, release and storage within Earth's vegetated systems. There is, however, limited understanding of how carbon flow between donor and recipient habitats will respond to climatic changes. Macroalgal-dominated habitats, such as kelp forests, are gaining recognition as important carbon donors within coastal carbon cycles, yet rates of carbon assimilation and transfer through these habitats are poorly resolved. Here, we investigated the likely impacts of ocean warming on coastal carbon cycling by quantifying rates of carbon assimilation and transfer in Laminaria hyperborea kelp forestsone of the most extensive coastal vegetated habitat types in the NE Atlanticalong a latitudinal temperature gradient. Kelp forests within warm climatic regimes assimilated, on average, more than three times less carbon and donated less than half the amount of particulate carbon compared to those from cold regimes. These patterns were not related to variability in other environmental parameters. Across their wider geographical distribution, plants exhibited reduced sizes toward their warm-water equatorward range edge, further suggesting that carbon flow is reduced under warmer climates. Overall, we estimated that Laminaria hyperborea forests stored similar to a11.49TgC in living biomass and released particulate carbon at a rate of similar to 5.71TgCyear(-1). This estimted flow of carbon was markedly higher than reported values for most other marine and terrestrial vegetated habitat types in Europe. Together, our observations suggest that continued warming will diminish the amount of carbon that is assimilated and transported through temperate kelp forests in NE Atlantic, with potential consequences for the coastal carbon cycle. Our findings underline the need to consider climate-driven changes in the capacity of ecosystems to fix and donate carbon when assessing the impacts of climate change on carbon cycling.

AB  - Forest biomass is an important energy source in Sweden and some other European countries. In this paper we estimate the physically available (i.e., total potential) forest biomass for energy from annual forest harvesting (1970-2008) or in the total standing stock (2008) in Sweden. To place Sweden's forest resources into perspective we relate this to an estimated need for renewable energy sources in Europe. As Swedish forests supply a range of goods and ecosystem services, and as forest biomass is often bulky and expensive to procure, we also discuss issues that affect the amount of forest biomass that is actually available for energy production. We conclude that forests will contribute to Sweden's renewable energy potential, but to a limited extent and expectations must be realistic and take techno-economical and environmental issues into consideration. To meet future energy needs in Sweden and Europe, a full suite of renewable energy resources will be needed, along with efficient conversion systems. A long-term sustainable supply of forest resources for energy and other uses can be obtained if future harvest levels are increased until they are equal to the annual growth increment. Delivering more than this would require increasing forest productivity through more intensive management. The new management regimes would have to begin now because it takes a long time to change annual production in temperate and boreal forests.

AB  - Recreational activity is the single most valuable ecosystem service in many developed countries with a range of benefits for public health. Crowdsourced recreational activity data is increasingly being adopted in management and monitoring of urban landscapes, however inherent biases in the data make it difficult to generalize patterns to the total population. We used in-situ observations and questionnaires to quantify accuracy in Strava data - a widely used outdoor activity monitoring app - in Oslo, Norway. The precision with which Strava data captured the spatial (R2 = 0.9) and temporal variation (R2 = 0.51) in observed recreational activity (cyclist and pedestrian) was relatively high for monthly time series during summer, although precision degraded at weekly and daily resolutions and during winter. Despite the precision, Strava exhibits significant biases relative to the total recreationist population. Strava activities represented 2.5 % of total recreationist activity in 2016, a proportion that increased steadily to 5.7 % in 2020 due to a growing usership. Strava users are biased toward cyclists (8 % higher than observed), males (15.7 % higher) and middle-aged people (20.4 % higher for ages 35-54). Strava pedestrians that were able to complete a questionnaire survey (>19 years) were biased to higher income brackets and education levels. Future studies using Strava data need to consider these biases - particularly the underrepresentation of vulnerable age (children/elderly) and socio-economic (poor/uneducated) groups. The implementation of Strava data in urban planning processes will depend on accuracy requirements of the application purpose and the extent to which biases can be corrected for.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate how processes of rescaling biodiversity governance downwards, upwards and outwards are interlinked with the increased global and European trends toward the neoliberalization of nature conservation. We furthermore explore who wins and who loses from this interrelationship. We focus on the European Union and specifically on England, Finland, Greece, and Poland, and we pay particular attention to the effects of the ongoing economic crisis. We draw on Marxist-influenced political ecology and geography literatures and use primary empirical data obtained through focus groups and interviews as well as analysis of legal and policy documents. Our analysis shows that EU states have mobilized a range of political strategies intended to expand and intensify the alignment of conservation with capitalist interests within a distinctively neoliberal framework. However, the variation in governmental strategies in the case study countries reveals that variegated neoliberalizations are intertwined with variegated rescaling processes. Thus despite the increasing homogenization of conservation, the historical evolution of governance forms and their legacy as well as differing socioeconomic and political contexts play a pivotal role in current dynamics. We argue that unraveling the different roles of the rescaling of biodiversity governance is crucial in exposing the contradictions inherent in the relationship between conservation and capitalism and in showing that the consensus-driven neoliberal rhetoric is increasingly lapsing into authoritarian governance in the era of one of the most severe capitalist crises.

AB  - The digital revolution is profoundly challenging to Indigenous societies in their relationships with non-humans. To guide research that involves Indigenous communities and digital technology, we analysed the impacts of such technologies on Indigenous knowledge systems from the perspective of environmental ethics and anthropology. Using the example of S ' ami reindeer husbandry in Sweden, we found that digital technologies, rather than relying on sensitive ways of understanding and experiencing nature, potentially reinforce a Western worldview of reindeer husbandry, instead of valuing a S ' ami ontology. Therefore, they have the potential to compete with Indigenous ways of interacting with humans and non-humans. Our analysis also underlines that research with Indigenous people using digital technology in participatory research projects may contribute to this competition rather than empower the Indigenous knowledge system. Based on these findings, we distinguish two ethical directions - co-construction and strong epistemological pluralism - that can be followed to address concerns about the effects of the development of digital technologies on the diversity of knowledge systems in the Arctic, and elsewhere.

AB  - In temperate Europe, oak-dominated forests are widespread, supporting high biodiversity and providing important ecosystem services. Insufficient natural regeneration has, however, been a concern for over a century. The objective of this study was to gain insights into differences in regeneration success using artificial and natural regeneration techniques for reforestation of oak (Quercus robur L.) stands. We monitored seedlings following planting, direct seeding and natural regeneration over five years in a randomized block experiment in southern Sweden with fenced and non-fenced plots. Fencing had a strong positive effect on height growth, especially for planted seedlings that were taller than the other seedlings and more frequently browsed in non-fenced plots. In contrast, there was little effect of fencing on survival, establishment rate and recruitment rate of seedlings. Due to aboveground damage on seedlings from voles, protection of acorns did not improve establishment rate following direct seeding. Under current circumstances at the site with a sparse shelterwood of old oaks, we conclude that natural regeneration was the most cost-efficient regeneration method. It resulted in the most seedlings at the lowest cost. However, regeneration success was heavily influenced by interference from herbaceous vegetation. With a small additional investment in vegetation control, the results might have been improved for planting and direct seeding.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has led to structurally simplified landscapes with reduced and fragmented resources for farmland insects. However, studies on the effects of landscape composition on farmland insects have mainly been performed in areas dominated by open arable land and semi-natural grasslands, while studies from forest-dominated landscapes are scarce. This research examined the effects of landscape composition on hoverfly species richness and abundance in arable land in boreal forest-dominated landscapes. Hoverflies were sampled in 22 mass-flowering caraway (Carum carvi) fields in Central Finland using pan traps. The effects of landscape composition on species richness and abundance were examined for all hoverflies, and for species groups with different adult habitat preferences. Landscape composition was measured as proportions of land cover classes within two different radii. Species richness and abundances of all hoverflies, forest species and open-habitat species increased with decreasing arable land cover and/or increasing forest cover within a 500 m radius (the two land cover classes strongly negatively correlated). Wetland species were most abundant in landscapes with an intermediate cover of arable land and forest, and most species-rich in landscapes with intermediate (10%) water cover. The species richness and abundance of mixed-habitat species increased with increasing cover of transitional woodland. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that most hoverfies in arable land benefit from increasing surrounding forest cover even in relatively heterogeneous, forest-dominated landscapes. Preserving or increasing the area of forests and other non-arable habitats is needed to safeguard a diversity of resources for hoverflies, and associated ecosystem services in farmland.

AB  - This paper presents an economic assessment of two different policies - both implying an increased demand for forest ecosystem services - and how these could affect the competition for forest raw materials. A forest sector trade model is updated to a new base year (2016), and then employed to analyze the consequences of a more intense use of bioenergy and increased forest conservation in Sweden. These scenarios are assessed individually and in combination. A particularly interesting market impact is that bioenergy promotion and forest conservation tend to have opposite effects on forest industry by-product prices. Moreover, combining the two policies mitigates the forest industry by-product price increase compared to the case where only the bioenergy-promoting policy is implemented. Namely, the energy using sector (heat and power) is less negatively affected in terms of increased feedstock prices if bioenergy demand targets are accompanied by increased forest conservation. This effect is due to increasing pulpwood prices, which reduces pulp, paper and board production, and in turn mitigates the competition for the associated by-products. Overall, the paper illustrates the complexity of the forest raw material market, and the importance of considering demand and supply responses within and between sectors in energy and forest policy decision-making.

AB  - The deep ocean hosts a large diversity of azooxanthellate cold-water corals whose associated microbiomes remain to be described. While the bacterial genus Endozoicomonas has been widely identified as a dominant associate of tropical and temperate corals, it has rarely been detected in deepsea corals. Determining microbial baselines for these cold-water corals is a critical first step to understanding the ecosystem services their microbiomes contribute, while providing a benchmark against which to measure responses to environmental change or anthropogenic effects. Samples of Acanthogorgia aspera, A. spissa, Desmophyllum dianthus, and D. pertusum (Lophelia pertusa) were collected from western Atlantic sites off the US east coast and from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Microbiomes were characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon surveys. Although D. dianthus and D. pertusum have recently been combined into a single genus due to their genetic similarity, their microbiomes were significantly different. The Acanthogorgia spp. were collected from submarine canyons in different regions, but their microbiomes were extremely similar and dominated by Endozoicomonas. This is the first report of coral microbiomes dominated by Endozoicomonas occurring below 1000 m, at temperatures near 4 degrees C. D. pertusum from 2 Atlantic sites were also dominated by distinct Endozoicomonas, unlike D. pertusum from other sites described in previous studies, including the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean Sea and a Norwegian fjord.

AB  - Landscape transition drives environmental change across the globe. However, landscape and its change are complex with high spatial heterogeneity, which challenges strategic decision-making.
   This paper aims to derive management meaningful units based on landscape status and change analysis and the generalization of landscape spatial heterogeneity.
   Based on contrasting cases from Finland (Vanajavesi) and China (Baota District), this paper analyzed the landscape attributes and change since 2000. A k-means clustering approach was used to generalize the landscape types based on indicators of landscape composition and its change, spatial pattern, population, and income.
   Most significant change in land covers was the expansion of artificial surfaces, and the bi-directional transitions between agricultural areas and forests and semi-natural areas in Vanajavesi, while the expansion of artificial land and shrinkage of cropland were most significant in Baota District. Larger changes in landscape metrics were also observed in Baota District. Finally, three landscape clusters were generalized in both of the case areas. For each cluster, the landscapes and their change characteristics were interpreted as pertinent to the average land cover pattern and its change and socioeconomic conditions. Brief landscape management recommendations were also given for the resulting clusters.
   This paper contributes to enriching the understanding of the analysis and management of landscape spatial heterogeneity based on the information from both landscape status and change. The contrasting case analyses from an international perspective indicate the usefulness of clustering approach in accommodating spatial heterogeneity, which imply a regionalized need for landscape monitoring, assessment, and management.

AB  - Introgression and admixture from domestic or foreign conspecifics into wild populations are of great concern in wildlife conservation. The issue is of particular interest in ungulates where translocations and re-introductions have been common practice. In Europe, the only large remaining wild populations of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) are found in the mountainous habitats of southern Norway. These populations have during the last centuries been exposed to extensive habitat modifications and periods of contact with domestic reindeer. Through analyses of ancient and extant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) we document extensive intra- and inter-population genetic changes during the last millennium. Our data indicate population reduction within a short time interval during the 11th-12th century during a period when mass trapping of reindeer was common. Significant differentiation between the ancient herds suggests an ancient genetic structuring of the reindeer herds in southern Norway, although not as strong as between modern herds. Two different mtDNA lineages characterized the ancient herds. A Bayesian approach to reconstruct the recent evolutionary history suggests that the reindeer herds in southern Norway originate from two populations separated in different refugia during the last glacial period. The presence of two additional extant lineages, characteristic of domestic herds, suggests substantial introgression into the native wild reindeer. The putatively different refugial origins of the lineages represented by the extant herds in Rondane/Dovre, Hardangervidda and those with a mainly domestic origin may well reflect different adaptations to environmental conditions, including degree of human interference. Further research on this issue would provide important insights for conservation priorities and a sustainable and flexible management strategy for the remaining wild reindeer herds in the Scandinavian mountains.

AB  - Public participation geographic information system (PPGIS) is a facilitated Volunteered Geographic Information approach and data collection method that aims to capture the spatial experiences of individuals. Although we experience the space around us three-dimensionally, altitude, as the third dimension, has been often absent from PPGIS research and practice. This is largely because of the complexity of implementing surveys in 3D but can also be attributed to a lack of analytical preparedness for using such data. This study complements 3D PPGIS data collected from a pilot study of the Aninkainen block in Turku, Finland with synthetic, i.e. artificially manufactured, data to propose an analytical framework for the study of 3D PPGIS data. The analytical framework divides methods based on the geographical scale into two groups: micro- and macro-scale analysis. In this framework, we propose the use of geospatial metrics to analyze 3D PPGIS data. We argue that while this multidisciplinary area of research is in its infancy, use of intuitive 3D adapted geometric and landscape metrics can help overcome some of complexities associated with use of this emerging participatory data. We conclude by outlining the limitations and envisioning areas for future research.

AB  - Permafrost peatlands store large amounts of carbon potentially vulnerable to decomposition. However, the fate of that carbon in a changing climate remains uncertain in models due to complex interactions among hydrological, biogeochemical, microbial, and plant processes. In this study, we estimated effects of climate forcing biases present in global climate reanalysis products on carbon cycle predictions at a thawing permafrost peatland in subarctic Sweden. The analysis was conducted with a comprehensive biogeochemical model (ecosys) across a permafrost thaw gradient encompassing intact permafrost palsa with an ice core and a shallow active layer, partly thawed bog with a deeper active layer and a variable water table, and fen with a water table close to the surface, each with distinct vegetation and microbiota. Using in situ observations to correct local cold and wet biases found in the Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3 (GSWP3) climate reanalysis forcing, we demonstrate good model performance by comparing predicted and observed carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchanges, thaw depth, and water table depth. The simulations driven by the bias-corrected climate suggest that the three peatland types currently accumulate carbon from the atmosphere, although the bog and fen sites can have annual positive radiative forcing impacts due to their higher CH4 emissions. Our simulations indicate that projected precipitation increases could accelerate CH4 emissions from the palsa area, even without further degradation of palsa permafrost. The GSWP3 cold and wet biases for this site significantly alter simulation results and lead to erroneous active layer depth (ALD) and carbon budget estimates. Biases in simulated CO2 and CH4 exchanges from biased climate forcing are as large as those among the thaw stages themselves at a landscape scale across the examined permafrost thaw gradient. Future studies should thus not only focus on changes in carbon budget associated with morphological changes in thawing permafrost, but also recognize the effects of climate forcing uncertainty on carbon cycling.

A plantation management enhancing favorable environmental impacts that are conducive to maintaining ecosystem services is a main challenge in establishing sustainable biomass production systems. There is evidence supporting the hypothesis that biomass production and nutrient cycling can be increased by supporting ecosystem niche differentiation (complementarity) through enhancing the number of plant species or varieties grown in the stand. However, the specific trait values of the individual components (e.g., varieties) in a mixed community could also be more important than the community diversity per se. We assessed, at community level, the plant trait profiles related to growth and nitrogen (N) use for four different Salix varieties that were taxonomically distinct at species or genotype level ('Bjorn', 'Jorr', 'Loden', 'Tora') and field-grown in unfertilized plots of pure and mixed commu-nities during one cutting cycle in Central Sweden. The aims were to use elements of functional growth analysis for exploring the mechanistic relationships between various traits related to growth and N use at stand level in our pure and mixed willow communities; and to address two hypotheses related to (i) the effect of diversity level on above-ground traits linked to growth, N uptake efficiency, N productivity and N conservation; and (ii) the influence of individual variety identities on the growth and N use traits observed in a mixture. Diversity level had no significant effect on the traits assessed here, and we thus found no evidence in support of our hypothesis that traits linked to growth, N uptake and use are significantly affected by the diversity level per se. In most but not all cases, the admixing effects on trait values were explained by the effects of the individual variety characteristics assessed in monocultures in combination with their relative share in the respective mixtures. The absence or presence of individual varieties strongly affected community-averaged (stand level) trait values. Therefore, the design of desirable variety mixtures is suggested that combine, for example, the high nutrient conversion efficiency that certain varieties achieve in mixed stands with the specific nutrient acquisition characteristics of other varieties.

AB  - Today's societies face significant ecological and societal challenges, including climate change and economic crises. In this context, forests can be a useful resource for new innovations and products. However, increased outtake of forest resources can raise the pressure on common forest resources and increase already existing conflicts between e.g. forestry and production versus conservation. Herein, the objective of this paper was to explore a collaborative process, namely landscape resource analysis (LRA), as a tool to identify a variety of values and sometimes conflicting interests and to improve communication about these among different stakeholders by using maps and GIS. The method was applied to a small forest area, Norra Klara center dot lvsdalen, in Va center dot rmland County, Sweden. The area hosts a variety of forest owners, firms and companies in different sectors and several voluntary organisations with interest in the local forest. The study showed that LRA in combination with GIS has the potential to add value to collaborative processes in local planning and forest decision making processes. Even though it is difficult to guarantee broad representation in collaborative processes, the LRA served to identify a wide range of values and conflicting interests among the local participants including as well immaterial, e.g. cultural ecosystem services, as material and monetary values in the forest area. It also served as a tool for social learning and put focus on local citizens perspectives and experiences in addition to 'experts' of forest landscapes.

AB  - Patch cutting is beneficial for many ecosystem services, but the effects of the management system on operations have not been analyzed. A two-machine system with harvester and forwarder is often used in mechanized cut-to-length operations. The aim of this study was to analyze differences in harvester and forwarder productivity in final felling and patch cutting, and estimate their effects on net revenues per harvested m3. Harvester time consumption was studied using automatic data collection from the machine computer. The data set comprised approximately 18,150 trees harvested during 48 shifts. Analyzes were based on shift level averages. In the observed interval of 0.30-0.60 m3 average tree volume, patch cutting productivity was 20-15% lower compared to final felling. Forwarding was analyzed in three steps. First, a GIS analysis of terrain transport distance found that patch cutting increased forwarding distance by 29%. Secondly, a time study found that loading and unloading times were 16% greater in patch cutting than in final felling. Thirdly, a theoretical analysis found that total forwarder time consumption was 16% higher in patch cuts than in final felling areas. Operational costs in patch cutting were 18% higher than in final felling, thereby reducing net revenues from harvesting operations by 4%. While operational costs were found to be higher in patch cutting than final felling, they are lower than the costs expected for other continuous cover forest management systems. Investigations of later stages of patch cutting are needed before full conclusions regarding the management system can be drawn.

AB  - Examining changes in evapotranspiration with forest management is one starting point for comprehensively understanding the impacts of forest management on water resources and forest resilience. This study builds on our previous work and develops a practical model that predicts changes in evapotranspiration with the management of Japanese cedar and cypress plantations. The model has distinct features that it requires only stem density, mean diameter at breast height, and basic meteorological data as inputs. This study first confirms that the model predicts annual evapotranspiration for cedar and cypress with relatively small errors (approximately 60 mm at the maximum). Next, this study shows that the model predicts changes in annual evapotranspiration with thinning and clearcutting of cedar and cypress with small errors (the mean absolute error of 86 mm). This study then demonstrates that coupling the model and yield tables enables prediction of annual evapotranspiration for different management scenarios and then the assessment of policy recommendations. Indeed, our model prediction suggests that the decrease in annual evapotranspiration with cedar and cypress aging is seemingly much smaller than that assumed in existing policy recommendations. Our model also suggests that the decrease in annual evapotranspiration with aging can more than triple by thinning at a rate of 50%, although this suggestion should be tested by future observation studies. The model is applicable only to Japanese cedar and cypress plantations under Japan's meteorological conditions, but similar models for other mono-specific plantations can be developed. This study will thus inspire forest scientists to develop models that assist policymaking for other species in other areas.

AB  - Bats and birds are key providers of ecosystem services in forests. How climate and habitat jointly shape their communities is well studied, but whether biotic predictors from other trophic levels may improve bird and bat diversity models is less known, especially across large bioclimatic gradients. Here, we achieved multi-taxa surveys in 209 mature forests replicated in six European countries from Spain to Finland, to investigate the importance of biotic predictors (i.e. the abundance or activity of defoliating insects, spiders, earthworms and wild ungulates) for bat and bird taxonomic and functional diversity. We found that nine out of 12 bird and bat diversity metrics were best explained when biotic factors were added to models including climate and habitat variables, with a mean gain in explained variance of 38% for birds and 15% for bats. Tree functional diversity was the most important habitat predictor for birds, while bats responded more to understorey structure. The best biotic predictors for birds were spider abundance and defoliating insect activity, while only bat functional evenness responded positively to insect herbivory. Accounting for potential biotic interactions between bats, birds and other taxa of lower trophic levels will help to understand how environmental changes along large biogeographical gradients affect higher-level predator diversity in forest ecosystems.

AB  - A considerable number of lakes in Sweden have high phosphorus internal loading from the sediments which cause cyanobacterial blooms every summer. Due to potential risks with such blooms for human health, drinking water supply, and ecosystem services, measures need to be taken to control the phosphorus content. Measures to control the phosphorus input from the surrounding land has been in focus. However, the measures have not been sufficient. This is because phosphorus deposited at the bottom of the lakes for many years are finally starting to leak to the water phase when the decomposition of sediments leads to anoxic conditions. In order to determine effective and efficient lake restoration measures, methods for lake restoration decision support by a multi-criteria analysis and the application of a decision analysis are developed. The multi-criteria analysis includes the determination of costs, longevity, and efficacy of six common lake restoration measures to reduce internal phosphorous loads in two lakes selected as a case study. The results show that aluminum treatment combines a highest efficacy with a high-cost efficiency being thus the optimal identified measure. The method involves adding an aluminum solution to the lakes' sediment, which binds phosphorus, preventing it to be released to the water column. The multi-criteria model is integrated to a decision analytical model. The decision analytical model is used to identify the monetary socio-economic and environmental boundaries for the implementation of the optimal lake restoration measure.

AB  - The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 sets out a framework of commitments and actions to tackle the main drivers of biodiversity loss. Such framework needs to be built on a whole-of-society approach to biodiversity protection, mobilizing private and public funding. In this context, our goal was estimating societal support and preferences about some basic wildlife management principles, which may be useful to inform EU decision-makers about societal priorities and other additional funding sources for wildlife conservation. A discrete choice experiment was conducted by 2415 inhabitants in six European countries (Spain, France, Italy, UK, Germany, Sweden), including residents in both rural (47% of respondents) and urban areas. Our findings reveal a clear pattern across western Europe with similar trends along the studied countries, and even between rural and urban citizens, on some basic wildlife management principles. According to our survey, payments for environ-mental services contribute to achieving a higher well-being from European citizens in any of the prospective wildlife programs considered, which suggests it is an acceptable tool to share out funds for biodiversity con-servation. In addition, managing scarce species is preferred over managing too abundant species; management in forest, agricultural and aquatic habitats is prioritized over that in urban landscapes; and management in pro-tected areas is preferred over management in non-protected ones. These findings suggest that there is a common culture in Europe related to the management of wildlife even when considering citizens with contrasted ways of life: rural vs urban citizens from northern to southwestern Europe. Overall, this study may help in the design of wildlife management policies that maximize societal acceptability and gather higher support.

AB  - Traditional timber production may have negative effects on other ecosystem services. Therefore, new forest management guidelines have been developed in order to enhance a habitat suitable for wildlife. In Finland, a recent example of this is grouse-friendly forest management (GFFM) which emphasises the preservation of grouse species (Tetronidae) habitats. This study aimed to analyse the economic effects of these guidelines. An analysis was made on how the application of GFFM affected the Net Present Value (NPV) in a 3U year simulation of forest management of four large forest holdings located from south to north in Finland. In the simulations, traditional forest management practices were compared to two levels of GFFM. Five levels of interest rate were used. namely 1, 2, 3, 4. and 5%. In most of the simulations, the NPV was reduced by about 1% or less due to the application of GFFM in comparison to the traditional reference forest management. Only in one case with more intensive GFFM, was the reduction of NPV more than 5%. The interest rates had an impact on the differences between the management approaches. For example, a low interest rate resulted in a higher thinning intensity in GFFM in comparison to traditional forest management, which lead to a higher NPV in GFFM. To sum up, it seems that it would be possible to manage forest holdings in a grouse-friendly manner with minor effects on the economics.

AB  - Grasslands play a significant role in livestock fodder production and thus, contribute to food security worldwide while providing numerous additional ecosystem services. However, how agroclimatic conditions and adverse weather events relevant for grasslands will change across the European grassland areas has not been examined to date. Using a single reference setup for soil and management over 476 European sites defined by climate stations, we show the probability of eight selected adverse weather events with the potential to significantly affect grassland productivity under climate change and how these events vary regionally across Europe. Changes in these eight key agroclimatic indicators create markedly specific spatial patterns. We found that by 2050, the exposure of the south and west European grasslands to heat and drought may double in comparison with today and that the area with frequent occurrences of heat and drought will expand northwards. However, across Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic countries to southern Finland and Sweden, the likelihood of these events is likely to decrease. While changing cultivars and management strategies are unavoidable, shifting grassland production to other regions to reduce the risk may not be possible as the risk of adverse events beyond the key grassland-growing areas increases even further. Moreover, we found marked changes in the overall thermal and water regimes across European regions. The effect of adverse weather events in the future could be different in other regions of the world compared to regions in Europe, emphasizing the importance of conducting similar analyses for other major grassland producing regions. To mitigate the impact of climate change, new ways of maintaining grassland productivity need to be developed. These methods include more efficient selection of species mixtures for specific regions, including increased use of legumes and forbs; incorporation of new genetic resources, including the development of hybrid cultivars, such as Festulolium hybrids; and incorporation of state-of-the-art technologies in breeding programs and new grazing management.

AB  - There is increasing pressure to manage forests for multiple objectives, including ecosystem services and biodiversity, alongside timber production. However, few forests are currently co-managed for timber and wildlife, despite potential economic and conservation benefits. We present empirical data from a commercial Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) production system in southern Norway in which moose (Alces alces) are an important secondary product. Combining long-term hunting and forestry records, we identified temporal variation in clear-felling over the past five decades, peaking in the 1970s. Herbicide treatment of regenerating stands and a fivefold increase in moose harvest has lead to a reduction in availability of successional forest per moose of > 90 % since the 1960s. Field estimates showed that spraying with the herbicide glyphosate reduced forage availability by 60 and 96 % in summer and winter, respectively, 4 years after treatment. It also reduced moose use and habitat selection of young spruce stands compared with unsprayed stands. Together these lines of evidence suggest that forest management led to an increase in moose carrying capacity during the 1970s and a subsequent decline thereafter. This is likely to have contributed to observed reductions in moose population productivity in southern Norway and is counter to sustainable resource management. We therefore call for better integration and long-term planning between forestry and wildlife management to minimise forest damage and the development of large fluctuations in ungulate populations.

AB  - Crowdsourced data can provide spatially explicit data on the contribution of nature to people. Spatial information is essential for effectively managing the diverse relationships that people have with nature, but the potential and limits of using crowdsourcing data to generate maps for conservation purposes need further research. Passive crowdsourcing tools include social media platforms where photos and user-generated tags are shared among users, whereas active crowdsourcing, such as public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS), provides an online platform for mapping place attributes such as values, experiences and preferences. In this study, we assess the spatial information gained through using Flickr (a photo sharing platform) and PPGIS (an online mapping platform) platforms for conservation planning to understand differences and similarities on the spatial distribution of values captured by the two platforms, and to identify what environmental and infrastructure variables correlate best with the distribution of values. We test these tools in Southern Norway including protected areas and the surrounding zones. We analysed non-spatial (using chi-square and Spearman rank correlation) and spatial (using clustering, Maxent and distribution overlap) data to identify differences between the two datasets and the values represented therein. We found large differences in spatial distribution using these two datasets, with Flickr data concentrated outside the protected areas and near roads, whereas PPGIS provided more fine-scale data on diverse values in locations inaccessible by roads within the protected areas. Flickr can be used for generating regional scale data of scenic landscapes or routes, but PPGIS performs better for management of nature qualities appreciated by different user groups within protected areas. We discuss the pros and cons of using each data source and when each dataset is more suitable to be used in protected area management.

AB  - Purpose of Review Climate change is modifying the dynamics of forests and threatens the supply of ecosystem services from managed forests. In response, managers are developing climate-adapted strategies, mostly focusing on changes in abiotic conditions. Ungulate populations, however, also impact forest integrity and productivity, and the effects of ungulate browsing likely interact with the effects of climate change. This raises the issue of whether climate-adapted strategies will be compatible with abundant ungulate populations. Here, we endeavour to (1) review if/how climate-adapted strategies currently consider ungulates and (2) to highlight how browsing could affect the success of these strategies, using a systematic mapping protocol and available knowledge of ungulate browsing.
   Recent Findings We identified 57 references discussing climate-adapted forest management that mentioned ungulates, almost exclusively in boreal and temperate forests. The majority (35/57) of these considered browsing to be a threat to climate adaptation. Ungulates could especially prevent the achievement of changes in tree species composition or forest state desired to increase forest resilience. Browsing could also interact with the success of proposed climate-adapted approaches (e.g., nature-based silvicultural approaches and assisted migration), based on known effects of browsing.
   Summary Potential interactions between large ungulate populations and climate-adapted forest management are sometimes considered but are not a large part of adaptation strategies. More empirical and modeling data would be beneficial, especially on the interactive effect of climate variables and browsing on tree regeneration. Without this, the climate-adapted strategies implemented today could result in future regeneration failures and exacerbate the pressure on forests.

AB  - Restoration of channelized streams by returning coarse sediment from stream edges to the wetted channel has become a common practice in Sweden. Yet, restoration activities do not always result in the return of desired biota. This study evaluated a restoration project in the Vindel River in northern Sweden in which practitioners further increased channel complexity of previously restored stream reaches by placing very large boulders (> 1 m), trees (> 8 m), and salmonid spawning gravel from adjacent upland areas into the channels. One reach restored with basic methods and another with enhanced methods were selected in each of ten different tributaries to the main channel. Geomorphic and hydraulic complexity was enhanced but the chemical composition of riparian soils and the communities of riparian plants and fish did not exhibit any clear responses to the enhanced restoration measures during the first 5 years compared to reaches restored with basic restoration methods. The variation in the collected data was among streams instead of between types of restored reaches. We conclude that restoration is a disturbance in itself, that immigration potential varies across landscapes, and that biotic recovery processes in boreal river systems are slow. We suggest that enhanced restoration has to apply a catchment-scale approach accounting for connectivity and availability of source populations, and that low-intensity monitoring has to be performed over several decades to evaluate restoration outcomes.

AB  - Mountain birch forests in the northern areas of Sapmi, the Saami homeland, serve as pastures for semi-domesticated reindeer. Recent reindeer management of the area has, to date, proceeded with little involvement of reindeer herders or their knowledge. To get more in-depth understanding of recent changes, we present together herders' knowledge and scientific knowledge concerning the impacts of herbivory and climate change on mountain birch forests in three Saami communities in Norway and in Finland. Most of the herders interviewed reported changes in weather during the preceding decades. Herders agreed that the canopy and understorey of mountain birch forests have changed. The observed transformations in the quality of pastures have increased the financial costs of reindeer husbandry. Our study demonstrates that herders have practical knowledge of the present state and recent changes of birch forests, and of the responses of reindeer caused by these. This knowledge generally coincides with scientific knowledge. We call for better integration of knowledge systems and a better protocol for co-production of knowledge as it relates to more adaptive future reindeer management regimes. Such integration will facilitate understanding of cultural adaptation within rapidly changing social-ecological systems in which sustainable reindeer husbandry continues to be an important livelihood.

AB  - Urban residents and their pets utilize urban greenspaces daily. As urban dog ownership rates increase globally, urban greenspaces are under mounting pressure even as the benefits and services they provide become more important. The urine of dogs is high in nitrogen (N) and may represent a significant portion of the annual urban N load. We examined the spatial distribution and impact of N deposition from dog urine on soils in three urban greenspace typologies in Finland: Parks, Tree Alleys, and Remnant Forests. We analyzed soil from around trees, lampposts and lawn areas near walking paths, and compared these to soils from lawn areas 8 m away from pathways. Soil nitrate, ammonium, total N concentrations, and electrical conductivity were significantly higher and soil pH significantly lower near path-side trees and poles relative to the 8 m lawn plots. Also, stable isotope analysis indicates that the primary source of path-side N are distinct from those of the 8 m lawn plots, supporting our hypothesis that dogs are a significant source of N in urban greenspaces, but that this deposition occurs in a restricted zone associated with walking paths. Additionally, we found that Remnant Forests were the least impacted of the three typologies analyzed. We recommend that landscape planners acknowledge this impact, and design parks to reduce or isolate this source of N from the wider environment.

AB  - The sustainability paradigm of the European Landscape Convention calls for increased involvement of all affected parties in combination with active leadership to promote social values. As a result, the Swedish Forest Agency (SFA) has requested further development of methods for broad consultation and active participation in order to strengthen the social values of forests. This paper aims to identify in particular the private forest owners' perceived need for collaboration and dialog regarding the social values of forests. The study's primary empirical data was derived from interviews with 40 private forest owners. A framework developed by Emerson et al. (2012) was applied to facilitate analysis of the forest owners' perceptions of procedural and institutional arrangements, existing leadership, the current level of knowledge and access to different types of resources. The paper identifies a need for the SFA to become more proactive and assume more of a leading role. The level of knowledge regarding social values was found to be quite low among the majority of the private forest owners. They wanted more information; they asked for increased support and advice, and they wanted to see improved coordination rather than collaboration on social values. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Although generally given little attention in vegetation studies, ground-dwelling (terricolous) lichens are major contributors to overall carbon and nitrogen cycling, albedo, biodiversity and biomass in many high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for > 20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 x 1 (30 x 30 m) and 3 x 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.

AB  - Ecosystems can undergo regime shifts where they suddenly change from one state into another. This can have important implications for formulation of management strategies, if system characteristics develop that are undesirable from a human perspective, and that have a high resistance to restoration efforts. This paper identifies some of the ecological and economic consequences of increased abundance of filamentous algae on shallow soft bottoms along the Swedish west coast. It is suggested that a successive increase in the sediment nutrient pool has undermined the resilience of these shallow systems. After the regime shift has occurred, self-generation properties evolve keeping the system locked in a high-density algae state. The structural and functional characteristics of the new system state differ significantly from the original one, resulting in less valuable ecosystem goods and services generated for society. In Sweden, loss of value results from the reduced capacity for mitigating further coastal eutrophication, reduced habitat quality for commercial fishery species, and the loss of aesthetic and recreational values.

AB  - Multifunctionality is seen as one of the key benefits delivered by sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). It has been promoted by both scientific research and practical guidelines. However, interrelations between different benefits are vaguely defined, thus highlighting a lack of knowledge on ways they could be promoted in the actual design process. In this research, multifunctionality has been studied with the help of scenario analysis. Three stormwater scenarios involving different range of SUDS elements have been designed for the case area of Kirstinpuisto in the city of Turku, Finland. Thereafter, the alternative design scenarios have been assessed with four criteria related to multifunctionality (water quantity, water quality, amenity, and biodiversity). The results showed that multifunctionality could be analyzed in the design phase itself, and thus provided knowingly. However, assessing amenity and biodiversity values is more complex and in addition, we still lack proper methods. As the four criteria have mutual interconnections, multifunctionality should be considered during the landscape architectural design, or else we could likely lose some benefits related to multifunctionality. This reinforces emerging understanding that an interdisciplinary approach is needed to combine ecological comprehension together with the system thinking into SUDS design, locating them not as individual elements or as a part of the treatment train, but in connection with wider social ecological framework of urban landscape.

AB  - Hedgerows are semi-natural wooded habitats and an important element in agricultural landscapes across Western and North-Western Europe. They reduce erosion, function as carbon sinks and thus provide essential ecosystem services. Moreover, they form a structurally diverse ecosystem for numerous taxa and connect otherwise fragmented forest habitats. This study compiled data from the hedgerow-rich oceanic regions of Europe, covering a gradient from Southern Sweden to Northern France, to analyse the influence of management, landscape context and climate variables on the number of herbaceous forest specialists in hedgerows. The species frequencies in hedgerows were related to their functional traits to identify plant characteristics that are beneficial for species dispersal and persistence in hedgerows. Our results show that numerous forest plant species, but not all, can thrive in hedgerows. Those are likely thermophilic, tolerant against regular disturbance and able to disperse efficiently. Hedgerows in regions that are warm or that are impacted by heat and drought events contain fewer forest species. Intensive adjacent land-use had a negative impact on forest species richness, while the surrounding forest cover was not significantly important. In congruence with previous regional studies, wider hedgerows contain more forest species, which is most likely caused by a more effective buffering of the microclimate. Thus, hedgerow width gains in importance in times of climate change and increasing extreme weather events. It is a key factor for habitat quality also on a European scale that needs to be considered for future management strategies.

AB  - Diversified crop production is a key agroecological practice that enhances ecosystem functions and reduces reliance on costly external inputs, such as for plant protection and nutrition but might also increase labour costs and lower crop yields. We investigate if functional diversification, i.e., cultivation of crop species with contrasting ecological functions, is associated with a higher growth in farm economic performance and input selfsufficiency. This is compared with increased related crop diversity i.e., the cultivation of genetically closely related crop species. We apply the system GMM dynamic panel data estimator to 35,195 medium and large Swedish farms (2001-2018), combining information on crop grown on each field and year with farm financial and individual characteristics. We find growth in farm economic performance and input self-sufficiency to respond positively to functional crop diversification and negatively to related crop diversification. The results highlight that a decomposed assessment of crop diversification provides an enhanced understanding of the buildup of resource-use efficiencies and production- and market risk reductions on Swedish farms.

AB  - Conversion of Norway spruce (Picea abies) plantations to more diverse and resilient forest types is an important task for European forest managers in the face of climate change and increased focus on ecosystem services beyond timber production. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to cost-effectively restore such forests. This study reports the influence of vicinity (distance) of forest type (mixed or spruce), fencing and mechanical site preparation (MSP) on the early performance of planted beech (Fagus sylvatica) seedlings and natural regeneration of other tree species following clear-cuts of Norway spruce in southern Sweden. After 6 years, we found clear effects of fencing and MSP, but not of vicinity of forest type. Fencing had a positive effect on height growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) but not on height of planted beech and naturally regenerated birch (Betula pendula, B. pubescens). There was a positive effect of MSP on survival and height growth of planted beech, and on the amount of natural regeneration of Scots pine. We conclude that establishment of beech forest is greatly accelerated by active regeneration approaches such as planting. In addition, the combination of planting beech, natural regeneration of other species, fencing and MSP is effective to promote the transition to mixed and diverse stands with both broadleaves and conifers. Fencing represented the highest cost among the treatments, and its cost-effectiveness depends on the local ungulate browsing pressure. In our study, fencing was critical to protect natural regeneration of Scots pine from browsing. Finally, natural regeneration of birch was abundant in our study and relatively unaffected by fencing and MSP treatments. With time, pre-commercial thinning of the naturally regenerated birch will be needed to maintain a diverse mixture of tree species.

AB  - Environmental stressors related to climate change and other anthropogenic activities are impacting Arctic marine ecosystems at exceptional rates. Within this context, predicting future scenarios of deep-sea ecosystems and their consequences linked with the fate of coastal areas is a growing need and challenge. We used an existing food-web model developed to represent the outer basin of the Malangen fjord, a northern Norwegian deep-sea ecosystem, to assess the potential effects of plausible future trajectories of change for major drivers in the area, including links to coastal kelp forests. We considered four major drivers (kelp particulate organic matter [POM] production entering the deep sea, fishing effort, king crab invasion, and ocean warming) to project 12 future scenarios using the temporal dynamic module of Ecopath with Ecosim approach. Overall, we found that the impact of warming on the deep-sea ecosystem structure and functioning, as well as on ecosystem services, are predicted to be greater than changes in kelp forest dynamics and their POM production entering the deep sea and the king crab invasion. Yet, the cumulative impacts are predicted to be more important than noncumulative since some stressors acted synergistically. These results illustrate the vulnerability of sub-Arctic and Arctic marine ecosystems to climate change and consequently call for conservation, restoration, and adaptation measures in deep-sea and adjacent ecosystems. Results also highlight the importance of considering additional stressors affecting deep-sea communities to predict cumulative impacts in an ecosystem-based management and global change context and the interlinkages between coastal and deep-sea environments.

AB  - Contact with green space has been associated with diverse beneficial impacts on human health. Studies focusing on green exercise suggest that physical activity undertaken in green environments provides more mental health benefits than physical activity in indoor or other outdoor settings. However, this evidence is largely based on experimental field studies that control the participants' contact with green space, while there is a lack of evidence that the real-life settings for green exercise promote mental health. This study applies a spatial approach using public participation GIS (PPGIS) methods to explore the perceived restorative outcomes of diverse outdoor physical activity environments. The data were collected in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, Finland, with a map based online survey directed to adults aged 18-65 years (n = 760). Perceived restoration was measured with three variables; stress reduction, relaxation, and nature enjoyment. Logistic regression analyses revealed significant differences in the perceived restoration outcomes between diverse outdoor physical activity environments. Stress reduction and relaxation during physical activity were most likely to be experienced near blue spaces and in large (>30 ha) urban and recreational forests, while nature enjoyment was associated with natural environments of all sizes. The results of this study suggest that exercising in blue spaces and in large natural areas provides additional restorative benefits compared to exercise undertaken in built outdoor environments. These results support a synergistic conception of urban health that acknowledges the diversity of health benefits provided by public open spaces, in particular blue and natural green settings.

AB  - Growing and densifying cities set challenges for preserving and enhancing sufficient and good quality green urban environment. Rooftops offer vacant room for additional urban greening that may contribute to the well-being of people and the liveability of cities, but this potential lacks empirical support. In spite of the fact that even small green spaces produce, for example restorative experiences, the literature concerning the experiential and recreational benefits of green roofs is still scarce. To identify the experiential potential of a small urban green roof we explored restorative and other experiences of 178 people visiting a sparsely vegetated green roof in the centre of Helsinki, Finland, using a questionnaire. We showed that the studied green roof provided restorative and other positive experiences to the visitors. The level of perceived restorativeness was relatively high. In addition, the results revealed multiple perceived qualities that reflected visual as well as other sensory experiences, beauty, suitability of the place for oneself and the urban context, nature, desire to explore the place and interestedness, positive excitement, and safety. Furthermore, answers to the open questions revealed a wide range of other observations and feelings, such as peace, joy, excitement and hope. Our study indicates that even a small and rather ascetic accessible green roof has potential to offer a moment of respite in the middle of urban everyday hassle, thus implying that these kinds of solutions may allow for a pinch of beneficial green in places where more diverse and lusher solutions are not possible due to, e.g. the load capacity of a roof.

AB  - There has been a significant change of conditions in forestry in the last few years, mainly due to the bark beetle calamity, climate change and the changing social order to provide various forest functions in the Czech Republic. This research aimed to find out the opinion of the professional public on current topics related to the calamity situation in the forests. Our work found out the opinions of the professional public using two questionnaires distributed by e-mail. The questions were focused on legislative changes in forestry, communication of state forest administration, the use of Czech wood and wooden constructions. Results showed that a majority of respondents were convinced of the need to reduce the share of Norway spruce in Czech forests. Respondents also commented positively on the future emergence of payments for forest ecosystem services, and preferred constructions with a significant proportion of wood by public contracting authorities. The results provide valuable information for the creation of communication strategies in forestry. For the purposes of Ministry of Agriculture, the results can be used as a feedback on the legislative changes made so far in relation to the bark beetle calamity and in creating proposals for further changes.

AB  - There is increasing pressure to use currently untapped resources in the deep sea, raising questions regarding ecosystem service trade-offs in these often unknown areas. We assessed the trade-offs between protection of cold-water coral reefs and economic activities, such as fisheries and petroleum extraction, through a survey of a representative sample of the populations of Norway and Ireland. Choice-experiment surveys were conducted in workshop settings and through the internet. Both survey approaches provided some similar results, such as preferences for protection. Our cross-country comparison showed the general public in Norway and Ireland was willing, despite possible conflict with extractive and consumptive economic activities in the deep sea, to protect cold-water corals as habitat for fish. On average, people were willing to pay NKr 341 and NKr 424 for a small and large increase in protected areas respectively, and NKr 880 if the area is important habitat for fish, all else held equal. However, there was large variation across individuals and countries. Norwegian respondents valued pure existence of cold-water corals more than the Irish respondents, and the latter were less willing to trade off industrial activities than the former. Nonetheless, the findings support conservation of cold-water corals and more generally of ocean environments that provide habitat for fish, which the current deep sea governance systems are not adequately designed or sufficiently well-structured to secure.

AB  - We conducted a three-way split sample discrete choice experiment (DCE) to investigate welfare estimates for attributes related to the management of coastal cod stocks in Arctic Norway. In a base DCE design, respondents faced three core attributes: (1) coastal cod spawning biomass as an indicator of the sustainability of the cod stocks, (2) stricter regulations on primary user groups (commercial fishers, local recreational anglers, the marine fishing tourism industry), and (3) annual household cost. In two experimentally varied DCE designs, respondents received a fourth attribute that explicitly describes the expansion of the marine fishing tourism industry in the region. In treatment 1, the expansion is represented by the number of coastal cod caught by marine fishing tourists as an indicator of the industry's environmental impact. In treatment 2, the expansion is represented by the number of new jobs as an indicator of the industry's socioeconomic impact. These two attribute translations, designed to be perfectly correlated, serve as an instrument for testing a choice architecture - value activation framework recently proposed in the management science literature. Mixed logit estimation results indicate that welfare estimates vary significantly across choice architectures, both statistically and economically. Additional regression analyses of conditional welfare estimates and respondents' status quo choices yield mixed evidence of value activation. The overall message of the study is that DCE researchers should be cognizant of their role as choice architects when advising public resource managers and policymakers.

AB  - The paper deals with forest management history of Norway spruce dominated forest ecosystem in Central Europe. Until the early 18th century, the remnants of climax Norway spruce forests below the alpine tree line in study area was affected only by a locally conducted selection logging. By the end of the 18th century, these forests were utilized in two different ways based on available wood transport: (i) forests that allowed transport of harvested wood to the valleys by river drives were intensively harvested by clearcutting with no subsequent artificial restoration, leaving the stands to be spontaneously renewed by natural regeneration, whereas (ii) forests that did not allow river drives maintained their primeval character. In the subsequent years, the clear cuts often reached the alpine tree line, and, in combination with grazing and hay making, caused a downward shift of the tree line by up to 100 meters of altitude. Abandoning the no longer suitable clear-cut harvests below the alpine tree line in the mid 19th century has the historical influence of forest harvests as one of the factors causing the alpine tree line altitudinal downward shift. Recently, a gradual upward shift of the alpine tree line ecotone is being observed in the study area under climate change. The results of this study suggest that research on forest management history can be consider as a decision-support tool for conservation management strategies for mountain forest habitats in protected areas.

AB  - Considering the potential of wetlands to dampen temporal variability of water flow through the landscape, they are increasingly considered as possible nature-based solutions to mitigate risks of flooding and drought. In this study, we investigate flow variability by means of a flow dampening factor and use observation data from 1984 to 2013 for 82 Swedish catchments to statistically and comparatively analyze the large-scale effects on this factor of multiple wetlands and lakes in the landscape. The results show good correlation between large-scale flow dampening and relative area of lakes and floodplain wetlands within a catchment. An increase in relative area up to around 15% for lakes and 0.5% for floodplain wetlands lowers the temporal standard deviation of runoff (R) to around 10%-15% of that for precipitation (P), compared with a common flow-variability dampening of around 35% for catchments with lake-wetland area close to zero. Further increase in these relative areas, or in those of wetland types other than floodplain wetlands, has little or no flow dampening effect. The results indicate that the large-scale flow dampening effect of lakes and floodplain wetlands is mainly due to their water-storage capacity and less due to their possible effects on the partitioning of P between R and evapotranspiration. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of accounting for the problem scale and relative water-storage capacity of wetlands when considering their large-scale efficiency as possible nature-based solutions for large-scale flow-variability regulation in whole catchments.

AB  - Landscape fragmentation threatens habitats, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In tackling this threat, the dynamic processes of social-ecological systems should be recognised and understood. Although network analysis based on graph theory has been recognised as an efficient way of spatially understanding landscape or habitat connectivity, only few studies have offered specific approaches or suggestions for integrating detailed social-ecological values into geographical distributions. As a contribution to bridging this gap, this paper introduces a social-ecological network model for the issue of landscape or habitat fragmentation applied to the case of Stockholm, Sweden. Graph theory was used in combination with sociotope and biotope maps for simple visualisation of network situations in two-dimensional maps. The European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus), European common toad (Bufo bufo) and human beings were selected as indicator species, based on a landscape ecology analysis in Stockholm Municipality in 2009. Slope, land use and human disturbance maps were assessed in order to decide cost values of travelling from node to node. Lease-cost-path accumulation was used to create ideal reference maps of green networks. Three separate maps were then developed for suggesting efficient routes for three indicators in city scale that mainly connect from the Royal National City Park to the other parts of the city. The model in Hjorthagen neighbourhood to highlight two practical paths that link this fragmented community to its neighbouring park areas. Findings make it possible to address two scales of network improvement strategies, namely first for the city-scale green network that connects geographical habitats (nodes) and the regional green wedges of the city, and the second that of neighbourhood links between habitats in detailed layers of green networks. Strategic improvement potentials are presented based on ideal reference maps of green networks correspondingly.

AB  - Context Hemipteran pests cause significant yield losses in European cereal fields. It has been suggested that local management interventions to promote natural enemies are most successful in simple landscapes that are dominated by large arable fields.
   Objectives We study how farming category (conventional, new and old organic fields) and landscape complexity affect pests, natural enemies and biological control services in spring barley. We further analyse if yields are related to pest infestation or biological control services.
   Methods The amount of pasture and the length of field borders were used to define landscape complexity around barley fields in Southern Sweden. Arthropods were sampled with an insect suction sampler and predation and parasitism services were estimated by field observations and inspections of pest individuals.
   Results Pest infestation was affected by landscape complexity, with higher aphid, but lower leafhopper numbers in more complex landscapes. Aphid predation was higher under organic farming and affected by effects on predator abundance and community composition independent of landscape complexity. Auchenorrhyncha parasitism was neither significantly affected by landscape complexity nor by farming category. Higher aphid predation rates and lower aphid densities were characteristic for organically managed fields with higher barley yields.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that it is possible to increase both aphid biological control services and barley yield via local management effects on predator communities independent of landscape complexity. However, the success of such management practices is highly dependent on the pest and natural enemy taxa and the nature of the trophic interaction.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is an ambitious piece of legislation designed to protect and improve water quality throughout Europe. However, forests are only mentioned once in the WFD, and forestry is not mentioned at all, despite its potential implications for streams, rivers and lakes. Here we present a transdisciplinary commentary on the WFD and its implications for forests and forestry in Sweden. This commentary has been prepared by forestry stakeholders, biophysical and social scientists. While we were cognizant of a large body of discipline-specific research, there are very few inter-or trans-disciplinary commentaries which link academic and stakeholder perspectives on the WFD. We had originally felt that there would be little commonality in our concerns. However, we found significant areas of agreement. Our key areas of concern about the implications of the WFD for forestry in Sweden included: (i) concerns about what is meant by good ecological status and how it is assessed; (ii) a perceived lack of clarity in the legal framework; (iii) an inadequate environmental impact assessment process; and (iv) uncertainties about appropriate programs of measures for improving water quality. We were also concerned that ecosystem services provided by forests and the positive effects of forestry on water quality are inadequately recognized in the WFD.

AB  - The concept of values has been extensively used as a proxy to investigate relationships between human-beings and their environment. Using a pragmatic epistemology, we investigated valuation processes at stake when farmers choose their management practices, focusing on soil biota valuations. We sought to determine to what extant values are situation-dependent and likely to evolve over time. We used five Focus Groups, in France, Germany, Romania, Spain and Sweden, where farmers described soil management situations and evaluated the outcomes of their practices. Soil management practices were reasoned according to local and current situations and not chosen 'by principle'. Soils were mentioned in the assessment of practices outcomes rather than as a criterion for practices choices. Values appeared dynamic, influenced by social consensus on good practices and farming objectives. Implementing a new practice might develop knowledge that is further integrated in valuations, thereby reforming the references upon which farmers evaluate their practices. Overall, debating on what matters in agriculture in different regions before defining management measures or soil indicators might be necessary to design a sustainable European policy on soils.

AB  - Climate change induces multiple abiotic and biotic risks to forests and forestry. Risks in different spatial and temporal scales must be considered to ensure preconditions for sustainable multifunctional management of forests for different ecosystem services. For this purpose, the present review article summarizes the most recent findings on major abiotic and biotic risks to boreal forests in Finland under the current and changing climate, with the focus on windstorms, heavy snow loading, drought and forest fires and major insect pests and pathogens of trees. In general, the forest growth is projected to increase mainly in northern Finland. In the south, the growing conditions may become suboptimal, particularly for Norway spruce. Although the wind climate does not change remarkably, wind damage risk will increase especially in the south, because of the shortening of the soil frost period. The risk of snow damage is anticipated to increase in the north and decrease in the south. Increasing drought in summer will boost the risk of large-scale forest fires. Also, the warmer climate increases the risk of bark beetle outbreaks and the wood decay by Heterobasidion root rot in coniferous forests. The probability of detrimental cascading events, such as those caused by a large-scale wind damage followed by a widespread bark beetle outbreak, will increase remarkably in the future. Therefore, the simultaneous consideration of the biotic and abiotic risks is essential.

AB  - In northern Sweden, the positive effects of tourism involvement by Sami Indigenous people are mostly shown in terms of employment, yet at times have been shown to go beyond economic ones and include other equally important benefits. Only when all components are seen at the same time can we get a true understanding of tourism as a livelihood strategy. This paper uses a sustainable rural livelihoods approach to investigate the different roles and meanings of tourism among Sami tourist entrepreneurs in northern Sweden. It does so using data from 13 semi-structured interviews with Sami Indigenous tourist entrepreneurs. The results indicate that there are many goals and objectives tourism jobs serve among Sami Indigenous people in the Swedish north. For example, the tourism business is at times seen as a more sustainable way of using reindeer. Tourism was also a way for Sami to express themselves and keep certain traditions alive. Another leading conclusion relates to tourist entrepreneurs as cultural ambassadors for Sami issues. By presenting factual information about Sami people, challenging stereotypes and by making others aware of the many hardships reindeer herders face, Sami tourist entrepreneurs attribute to their work meanings that are social, cultural and even political.

AB  - Ecosystems and biodiversity produce benefits to society, but many of them are hard to quantify. For example, it is unclear whether European societies gain benefits from experiencing rivers that host high native biodiversity. Without such knowledge, monetary investments into ecologically oriented river management plans are difficult to justify. The objective of this study was to reveal how the public in four European countries values ecological characteristics of domestic rivers and the outcomes of hypothetical river basin management plans designed to improve river ecosystems, particularly fish biodiversity. We conducted a choice experiment among the populations in Norway, Sweden, Germany, and France. We found similar preference structures in all countries with high marginal willingness-to-pay for improvements of abiotic river attributes (increased accessiblity of the river banks, improved bathing water quality, decreased river fragmentation). Citizens also benefited from certain fish species occurring in a river with native salmonid species being more valued than nonnatives, particularly in Norway, and from the degree of a river's native biodiversity. Welfare measures calculated for selected river basin management plans (policy scenarios) revealed societal benefits that were primarily derived from ecological river management whereas a scenario focusing on hydroelectricity production generated the lowest utility. We conclude that ecological river management may produce high nonmarket economic benefits in all study countries, particularly through the management of abiotic river attributes and the restoration of declining or extinct fish species. Our results help to inform decisions on restoration efforts by showcasing the benefits that these measures have for the public.

AB  - Ecological restoration is expected to reverse the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Due to the low number of well-replicated field studies, the extent to which restoration recovers plant communities, and the factors underlying possible shortcomings, are not well understood even in medium term. We compared the plant community composition of 38 sites comprising pristine, forestry-drained, and 5 or 10 years ago restored peatlands in southern Finland, with special interest in understanding spatial variation within studied sites, as well as the development of the numbers and the abundances of target species. Our results indicated a recovery of community composition 5-10 years after restoration, but there was significant heterogeneity in recovery. Plant communities farthest away from ditches were very similar to their pristine reference already 10 years after restoration. In contrast, communities in the ditches were as far from the target as the drained communities. The recovery appears to be characterized by a decline in the number and abundance of species typical to degraded conditions, and increase in the abundance of characteristic peatland species. However, we found no increase above the drained state in the number of characteristic peatland species. Our results suggest that there is a risk of drawing premature conclusions on the efficiency of ecological restoration with the current practice of short-term monitoring. Our results also illustrate fine-scale within-site spatial variability in the degradation and recovery of the plant communities that should be considered when evaluating the success of restoration. Overall, we find the heterogeneous outcome of restoration observed here promising. However, low recovery in the number of characteristic species demonstrates the importance of prioritizing restoration sites, and addressing the uncertainty of recovery when setting restoration targets. It appears that it is easier to eradicate unwanted species than regain characteristic species by restoration.

AB  - This qualitative study aimed to map what information is used in the forest planning process at large forest-owning companies, how it is used, its level of uncertainty and currently employed strategies to handle forest information uncertainty. An additional aim was to assess the status of the paradigm of the forest planning hierarchy in forestry. We used data from semi-structured interviews with representatives of six large forest-owning companies in Sweden, representing 30 per cent of the productive forest land in the country. Our results show that the forest planning process is a hierarchical system of decisions where the information used in the different planning stages is of varying quality and that the traditional hierarchical planning paradigm still plays a vital role in forestry. The most central source of information in the whole forest-planning process is the forest stand database (forest inventory). This includes uncertain information from various sources, including subjective field measurements and aerial image interpretation. However, the use of remote sensing estimates to feed the databases is increasing, which will probably improve the overall quality. Another important finding is that forest companies tend not to use decision support systems or optimization models to solve planning problems outside the scope of strategic planning; thus, most planning is done manually, e.g. in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. Apart from the hierarchical division of the planning process itself, we identified six main strategies that the companies use to control information uncertainty, namely locking the future by making a decision, utilizing a surplus of available harvests, updating information before a decision is made, replanning when the plan is found to be infeasible, planning by looking back and ignoring the uncertainty, either intentionally or unintentionally. The results from this study increase our understanding of contemporary forest-planning practices and will be helpful in the development of decision support systems and methods for information collection.

AB  - The spread of remote sensing technologies allows for continuous and precise mapping of forest ecosystem attributes over large areas. One of the most important attributes of a forest ecosystem is site productivity, an essential determinant of resource availability. Knowledge of site productivity is crucial for sustainable forest management because it is the basis for predictions of future forest growth and is fundamental to long-term planning in forestry. Models of forest dynamics allow us to better understand the functioning of forest ecosystems and to assess the provision of ecosystem services. However, discussions on the factors affecting forest growth are ongoing. Previous research has not clarified the influence of stand density on the height increment of trees. Consequently, this uncertainty leads to inconsistent predictions for stand growth and nonoptimal forest management decisions. We aimed to analyse the effect of stand density on top height (TH) growth and the development of the TH growth model for Scots pine based on bitemporal ALS measurements. We applied repeated ALS observations from two acquisitions (2011, 2019) to fit a density-sensitive TH growth model. We found that stand density affected the TH growth of Scots pine. A higher stand density stimulated TH growth, particularly in productive sites showing a TH increment of about 10%. We demonstrated the usefulness of bitemporal ALS measurements for developing a TH growth model for Scots pine considering stand density. We found that the predictive accuracy of the TH increment increased when stand density was considered.

AB  - Natural disturbances such as wind are known to cause threats to ecosystem services as well as sustainable forest ecosystem management. The objective of this research was to better understand and quantify drivers of predisposition to wind disturbance, and to model and map the probability of wind-induced forest disturbances (P-DIS) in order to support forest management planning. To accomplish this, we used open-access airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data as well as multi-source National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to model P-DIS in southern Finland. A strong winter storm occurred in the study area in December 2011. High spatial resolution aerial images, acquired after the disturbance event, were used as reference data. Potential drivers associated with P-DIS were examined using a multivariate logistic regression model. The model based on LiDAR provided good agreement with detected areas susceptible to wind disturbance (73%); however, when LiDAR was combined with multi-source NFI data, the results were more promising: prediction accuracy increased to 81%. The strongest predictors in the model were mean canopy height, mean elevation, and stem volume of the main tree species (Norway spruce and Scots pine). Our results indicate that open-access LiDAR data can be used to model and map the probability of predisposition to wind disturbance, providing spatially detailed, valuable information for planning and mitigation purposes.

AB  - Whilst the re-introduction of fire can contribute to biodiversity conservation in Fennoscandian forests, the effects on reindeer herding remain uncertain. To assess the short- and long-term effects of prescribed burning on lichen supply in a productive forest landscape, we developed a model simulating lichen biomass available for reindeer grazing, covering 300 years and 1500 pine stands, under different soil preparation scenarios, including different prescribed burning regimes and mechanical scarification. Our simulations revealed that burning 25-50% of yearly clear-cuts has the potential to stop, or even reverse, reindeer lichen decline at landscape scale after 70 years, greatly surpassing the short-term losses caused by burning. No burning or burning 5% of yearly clear-cuts, as required by the FSC certification, compounded the negative effects of fire suppression and scarification on lichen. Compared to the scenario with no soil preparation, all our simulations resulted in a continuous decrease of lichen supply in Lichen-type stands, indicating that any form of disturbance in these habitats can strongly limit future gains.

AB  - The gray wolf (Canis lupus) is a source of concern and a cause of damage to people's livelihoods. In Finland, as in most countries, actual damages are compensated according to the real lost value. However, often, the suffered damages are larger than what is compensated, and worries and fears are not accounted for at all. The purpose of our transdisciplinary action research is to contribute to the process of modifying the scientific, administrative, and everyday habits of mind in order to meet the practical prerequisites of living with the wolf. In 2014, we planned and participated in a process designed to update Finland's wolf population management plan. During our study, we applied e-deliberation, conducted a national wolf survey, and organized solution-oriented workshops in wolf territory areas around Finland. By applying abductive reasoning, we illustrate the basic features of an economic scheme that would help finance and coordinate practical modifications to the ecological, economic, and institutional circumstances and settings in wolf territory areas. The potential economic instrument is based on payments for improved ecostructures. In our paper, we describe the organization, functioning, and financing of this instrument in detail.

AB  - Populations of large herbivores, including members of the deer family Cervidae, are expanding across and within many regions of the northern hemisphere. Because their browsing on trees can result in economic losses to forestry and strongly affect ecosystems, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how best to mitigate resultant damage. Previous research has highlighted the importance of regulating deer density and the availability of alternative forage to reduce browsing damage levels in conifer production stands. However, often only one or two proxies of forage availability have been used instead of applying a broad foodscape approach and more knowledge is needed to understand which types of alternative forage best mitigate damage. We conducted field inventories of damage that occurred during the previous fall/winter in 112 production stands in southern Sweden, while also measuring forage availability and cervid faecal pellets in the surrounding landscape (16 ha). Local landowners provided data on supplementary feeding. We found that variation in cervid (Alces alces, Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Dama dama) browsing damage to top shoots or stems of young Scots pine trees (Pinus sylvestris, hereon pine), was better explained by the availability of alternative natural forage (using several indices and species of trees and shrubs) than by supplementary feeding. The proportion of damaged pine trees was higher in stands with a lower density of pine stems; in landscapes with a lower density of key broadleaf tree species (genera Sorbus, Salix, Populus and Quercus); and in landscapes with more open land (agricultural fields and paddocks). Damage was also higher in stands where relatively large amounts of moose faeces was found, while not related to the amount of faeces from other cervid species. The amount of supplementary feed (silage or other types such as root vegetables) did not explain variation in pine damage, but the result was possibly affected by relatively few study areas supplying sufficient data on supplementary feeding. The results from our inventory illustrate the efficacy of using naturally growing forage to mitigate browsing damage to young pine trees in managed landscapes. Creation of such forage is also recommended over supplementary feeding because of co-benefits to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - The article examines the preconditions for the aggravation of the energy danger for Ukraine and the world as a whole, in particular in the context of the strengthening of the economic crisis and war in Ukraine. The issue of compliance by energy organizations with the International Climate Paris Agreement and the achievement of the Global Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 were studied. The component indicators of the global index of energy innovations were analyzed. The main global energy indicators and their results in 2021 compared to 2020 were monitored. The paper also estimates domestic electricity consumption in the world by country in 2021, as well as trends in the growth of global energy consumption in general and by continent in 2021 compared to 2020. The result of such trends was that the consequences of sanitary measures and the economic crisis of 2020 was felt mainly in the sphere of services, transport and carbon-intensive electricity production.
   The authors considered the key changes in the field of energy in the world in 2021 compared to 2020 and the dynamics of CO2 emissions related to energy in the G20 countries in recent years and based on this justified the forecast of European gas prices and the price of Brent oil to 2026 year. The main characteristics of countries with a high index of global energy innovation were considered. It was found that, for example, the Norwegian government had developed a strategy for carbon capture and storage (CCS), which aimed to identify measures to promote technology development and reduce the costs of CCS. It was found that the main goal of the EU regarding the share of renewable energy sources is 32% of the final energy consumption by 2030. This target was not distributed among the Member States, but the share of renewable energy sources in the Member States should be at least the same as in 2020.
   In the article, the authors examined the stages of state regulation of the innovation policy of the energy sector of Ukraine and substantiated the place of the energy sector in the national innovation policy of Ukraine. Formation of innovation policy in the energy sector of Ukraine requires definition of the concept and strategic plans of its innovative development. In particular, it was found that one of these priority areas should be renewable energy (wind, solar, etc.).
   The result of the authors' scientific research is that the innovative system of the energy sector is a fairly developed network intellectual structure that connects research and design organizations belonging to different sectors of the economy. Using the potential of the positive influence of a number of important global factors should be the basis of the transformation of innovative management of energy industry organizations in Ukraine.

AB  - Resilience implies, in its essence, the capacity of a system to tolerate disturbances while retaining its essential functions. In the context of agriculture, resilience thinking calls for considering the ability of farms to thrive in turbulent times along with the ability of the ecological system - in which the agricultural production is embedded - to retain its function and integrity. Resilience is a relevant conceptual tool to analyse the contradictory management demands that farms are facing within the current neoliberal market regime: being economically viable and environmentally sustainable. In this study, the resilience of farms was operationalised through farmers' perceptions concerning their farms' development trajectories in these two dimensions. The operationalisation strategy applied to farm survey data from Finland suggested that the majority of Finnish farms were vulnerable in either or both of these dimensions. The resilient farms were characterised by large size, development orientation, possession of social capital and adoption of targeted agri-environmental measures. The agrifood system was characterised by increasing level of centralisation and connectedness affecting all systemic levels, including the farm systems. Resilience can be seen as a manifestation of a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle, in which both the farm structure and the farmer's agency are well aligned with the contemporary context, whereas vulnerability is the result of a similar, but vicious cycle.

AB  - Multivariate statistical analyses of data on environmental variables and benthic fauna from 14 oil and gas fields obtained from 24 surveys collected between 1985 and 1993 are presented. At all fields oil-based drilling mud was used. The purpose of this study was to investigate contamination gradients, assess effects on benthic fauna both spatially and temporally and to evaluate measures such as diversity indices, indicator species and multivariate analysis techniques in assessment of pollution. Results from analyses of baseline surveys of environmental variables and fauna were characterised by a lack of distinct gradients in station placement, having a typical shot-gun pattern in PCA-, DCA- and MDS-ordination analyses. Likewise there was no consistency in which environmental variables correlated with the fauna. Contamination was assessed using all the physical and chemical data in classification and PCA-ordination analyses. Clear patterns were found using 4 categories, conveniently termed initial, moderate, severe and gross. The categories were usually apparent as rings radiating from the platform. Initial contamination of the outermost areas at most fields was shown as elevated levels of barium and total hydrocarbons (THC) and sometimes also by elevated levels of zinc, copper, cadmium and lead. Three fields were studied in particular and showed contaminated areas of over 100 km(2) (Valhall), over 15 km(2) (Gyda) and over 10 km(2) (Veslefrikk). After a period of 6 to 9 yr contamination had spread, so that nearly all of the outermost stations 2 to 6 km away from the platforms showed evidence of contamination. Thus, the existing sampling design is no longer suitable for assessment of the area contaminated. Effects on the fauna showed, as with contamination, 4 categories. Analyses linking fauna and environmental variables indicated that the effects were mainly related to THC, barium and strontium, but also to metals Like zinc, copper, cadmium and lead, which are all discharged in drill-cuttings. Effects on the fauna closely followed the patterns of contamination with only a few stations at each field that were contaminated not showing effects. Thus the areas showing effects were only slightly less than the areas contaminated. Subsequent to cessation of discharges biodegradation of oil and reduced concentrations of THC were observed. Yet there was an extension of areas where the fauna was affected several years after cessation of drill-cutting discharges. This may indicate that barite and related compounds associated with the discharges also have an environmental impact. However, preliminary results from fields using only water-based mud clearly indicate a reduction in environmental contamination and biological impact, compared to effects reported here, for oil-based drill-cuttings. Diversity indices applied to the data did not show the extent of effects and such indices alone should not be used to interpret changes. The consistent patterns that the multivariate techniques were able to detect showed that these methods were far superior. Analyses of the initial effects on the fauna showed that there were no consistent patterns in changes in species composition over fields or time, and thus the search for 'universal' sensitive indicator species does not seem to be rewarding. Yet under gross effects of pollution there were consistent patterns with the same species dominating.
   Finally, the initial effects of pollution included severe reductions in organisms that are key components of the benthic communities and also food for bottom-living fish, and are thus ecologically important.
   The new fauna which establishes in the contaminated sediments close to platforms, often with high abundance, will probably be less valuable as a food source for fish populations since it is of small size and lives sub-surface.

AB  - The growth of nature-based tourism has raised the need to better understand tourists' expectations towards outdoor recreation environments. There is little knowledge, however, of international tourists' attitudes towards forest management practises or of their effect during winter. This study investigated how commercial forests correspond to the environmental expectations of international nature-based tourists and how the season affects tourists' landscape preferences. Altogether 750 foreign visitors to Finnish Lapland responded to a survey and evaluated photographs presenting various types of forest landscapes in summer and winter. Beautiful scenery was the most important motive for the choice of travel destination and for participating in outdoor recreation. The results highlight the strong impact of seasons on the perceived quality of the landscape in commercial forests. Seasonal differences are largest in regeneration areas as snow cover mitigates the effects of forestry operations. Even-aged, middle-aged and mature forest stands were considered to be suitable for tourism in both summer and winter. There is a demand for adapted management regimes in commercial forests targeting year-round nature-based tourism. In conclusion, forestry and tourism can coexist in the same area with good planning and with management actions that take visual quality and recreational values of the environment into account.

AB  - This paper explores the potential of public-private partnerships to contribute to the resolution of decision-making dilemmas concerning private goods that also provide public services. We focus on forests that deliver many ecosystem services and are important for biodiversity, which pose problems regarding the values that should be considered in their protection and exploitation. Conflicts between the interests and values concerned (or at least prioritization difficulties) will arise and their satisfactory resolution will require some kind of collaboration between governmental authorities and private forest owners. Thus, the Swedish Forest Agency has initiated a pilot project on a new form of such partnerships, Nature Conservation Agreements for social values, which are considered as a case study here. We use an adapted version of the Ladder of Partnership Activity, which includes theoretical constructs such as context, perceptions and motives, creation of collaborative advantages and the constitution of rules, to see if and how these partnerships can enhance an embedded governance system, by enabling the actors to address collective problems in a mutually satisfactory manner. Our results contribute knowledge on how the governance of forests can be designed, and the kinds of values that could be included to spur the implementation of partnerships.

AB  - Natural disturbances significantly influence forest ecosystem services and biodiversity. Accurate delineation and early detection of areas affected by disturbances are critical for estimating extent of damage, assessing economical influence and guiding forest management activities. In this study we focus on snow load damage detection from C-Band SAR images. Snow damage is one of the least studied forest damages, which is getting more common due to current climate trends. The study site was located in the southern part of Northern Finland and the SAR data were represented by the time series of C-band SAR scenes acquired by the Sentinel-1 sensor. Methods used in the study included improved k nearest neighbour method, logistic regression analysis and support vector machine classification. Snow damage recordings from a large snow damage event that took place in Finland during late 2018 were used as reference data. Our results showed an overall detection accuracy of 90%, indicating potential of C-band SAR for operational use in snow damage mapping. Additionally, potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data in estimating growing stock volume in damaged forest areas were carried out, with obtained results indicating strong potential for estimating the overall volume of timber within the affected areas. The results and research questions for further studies are discussed.

AB  - Reindeer husbandry and forestry are practiced in the same areas in northern Fennoscandia. Reindeer pastures have largely deteriorated. We aimed to quantify the separate and combined effects of reindeer grazing and forestry on the amount of ground lichens. To do this, we mapped and inventoried all larger enclosures (49) in Finnish Lapland where forest management practices were similar in both sides of the fence. The average time since fencing was 43 years. We recorded the cover and estimated dry biomass of ground lichens, as well as parameters describing forest stand characteristics. The effect of reindeer grazing on both the cover and estimated dry biomass of lichens was clear: in the ungrazed (fenced) sites, the lichen cover (35.8%) was on average 5.3-fold and the dry biomass (1929 kg ha(-1)) 14.8-fold compared with the corresponding estimates in the grazed sites (6.8% and 130 kg ha(-1)). The effect of forestry on lichens was smaller. In the grazed stands the cover and biomass of lichens were higher in the mature stands compared to the younger stand development classes, whereas in the ungrazed stands there were no significant differences between the development classes. Both reindeer grazing and forestry affect the cover and biomass of ground lichens. The influence of reindeer grazing is, however, much heavier than that of forestry. The decrease of not only the biomass, but also the lichen cover, is alarming. The decrease of lichen cover may hinder the recovery of reindeer pastures, which in the long run endangers the sustainability of reindeer husbandry.

AB  - Lapland is one of the most attractive nature-tourism areas in Europe, and tourism is vital for local economy. However, recreational tourist activities such as skiing, hiking and horse riding deteriorate the unique and vulnerable nature of Northern Finland. Erosion and wearing of tourist areas negatively affects biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduce the attractiveness of the region. Tourism is also the source of other environmental disturbances such as wastes. Currently, in Lapland, the prevalent waste treatment method is disposal, and wastes are transported over long distances due to lack of recipient facilities for waste management. The suggestion for sustainable waste management Scenario presented in this paper is to find a synergistic solution to both of these problems, by local treatment of bio-waste in an anaerobic digestor and utilization of digestate to revegetate eroded land. It is proposed that bio-waste is co-digested with sewage sludge and offal from slaughterhouses in Yllas in the municipality of Kolari. An estimated 500-1000 t of digestate could be produced and used in tourist areas annually. Experiences from existing seasonal bio-waste collection schemes and interviews of local tourist enterprises and tourists indicate that there is willingness to extend the source separation of wastes. Assessment of the digestion Scenario suggests that economic costs of investment could be offset by avoided costs and by additional environmental and social benefits. It is concluded that this zero waste approach could lead to an improved image of Lapland as a sustainable tourist destination. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing forest plantation stands in a way that retains productivity targets, but that also fosters biodiversity and stand resilience are key sustainable forest management goals. Current forestry policy advocates a diversification of forest stands to achieve these goals, favouring mixed age structures and polycultures over single-aged monocultures. Evidence is lacking, however, to support this management recommendation for biodiversity gains and related ecosystem service delivery. We used indices of taxonomic diversity and functional structure to compare ground vegetation communities in mixed and pure stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) in each of three study regions. We categorised the 91 vascular plant species identified into functional effect and response groups. We tested the hypotheses that ground vegetation communities (i) differ significantly in structure and composition between Scots pine and oak monocultures and (ii) show enhanced levels of taxonomic and functional diversity and functional redundancy in mixed stands of Scots pine and oak compared with monocultures. We explored the implications of any differences in the functional structure of ground vegetation communities in the different stand types on two ecosystem services: nutrient availability and levels of resource provisioning for herbivores. Nine functional response groups (RG) and seven functional effect groups (EG) were identified with considerable overlap in the RG and EG species grouping. Three RGs had traits characteristic of forests (spring flowering herbs, tree saplings and shrubs/climbers), one RG had traits characteristic of open habitats (annual ruderals) and the remaining RGs had more generalist traits (anemochorous perennials, graminoids and short perennials). No significant differences were found among stand types in terms of taxonomic diversity or richness of the different functional trait groups. Ground vegetation communities in the three study regions also had similar levels of functional redundancy across stand types. However, Scots pine and oak monocultures harboured significantly different abundances of species with distinct functional traits. In all three study regions, anemochorous perennials were significantly more abundant in Scots pine monocultures than oak monocultures, while two core forest groups (shrubs/climbers, spring flowering herbs) were significantly more abundant in oak monocultures. Mixed stands had intermediate abundances of these functional groups. These differences have implications for the comparative availability of food resources and shelter for wildlife, but also the mobilisation and temporal availability of nutrients in the two monocultures. Thus, mixtures of Scots pine and pedunculate oak can temper significant tree species identity influences on ground vegetation functional diversity. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hydrological conditions are among the most important factors influencing nutrient concentrations in rivers and their fluxes out of the catchments. In the boreal area extreme hydrological conditions are typical with intense floods during the snow-melt period in spring and the base-flow conditions during winter and summer.
   In this study we compared nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) concentrations and fluxes among summer seasons (June-August) with contrasting hydrology in four small boreal rivers with differing land-use in southern Finland.
   For the analysis we selected 3 years of the lowest summer discharge (1999, 2010, 2011) and 3 years of the highest summer discharge (1996, 1998, 2004).
   During high discharge summers NH4-N and DON concentrations were on average 187 and 240 % higher than during low discharge summers. Because of large differences in discharge between the summers the flux values of the different N fractions were at maximum 10-20 times higher during high discharge summers. The effect of heavy rains on N loading was clearly demonstrated in summer 2004 when two consecutive floods transported 42 % of the annual NO3-N flux, 44 % of the NH4-N flux and 57 % of the DON flux out of the catchment.
   Available nitrogen storages in the studied catchment areas were probably in excess especially during the wet summers when the plant uptake was presumably lower compared to dryer and warmer summers. When the hydrological conditions were suitable for surface and subsurface runoff, the concentrations and fluxes of NO3-N, NH4-N and DON increased substantially.

AB  - Transition zones between mountain forests and treeless tundra, i.e. treeline ecotones, are characterized by great regional variety. In this paper, we discuss the biodiversity in various trophic levels in treeline ecotones throughout Europe, with particular focus on recent changes in land use and climate in northern and central mountains. In northernmost Europe, mountain birch prevails, while conifers (spruce, pine, larch) are the dominating species further south. While at continent-wide to global scales, the ecotone position is largely controlled by heat deficiency, it depends on a multitude of partly interacting abiotic and biotic factors other than climate at smaller scales. Climate change is a driving factor in treeline ecotone change, including physiognomic structure and biodiversity, although the effects of climate and other factors often overlap. Historical legacy plays an important role in this respect, and human impacts are particularly important. The recent decline in pastoral use of many European treeline areas often strongly influences plant diversity and re-growth of trees and other woody species. Climate change together with changing tree cover may influence snow cover, moisture regime, and nutrient conditions. Subsequently changed site conditions influence plant-plant interactions, favoring some species and disfavoring others, and plant-animal interactions. Native animals may cause widespread or local disturbances in treeline ecotone areas. Mass outbreaks of leaf-eating insects, for example, usually affect comparatively large forested areas whereas mammalian herbivores and birds have more local impact. However, high numbers of wild or domestic mammalian herbivores may challenge the carrying capacity of treeline ecotone areas at the same time as they preserve an open pasture character. This calls for cross-disciplinary study approaches, addressing the complexity of the ecotone regarding both causal background and biogeographic diversity.

AB  - Forest cover is increasing in many regions due to spontaneous reforestation on abandoned pastures and fields. The resulting recent forests may need management to improve ecosystem quality, and this could possibly be combined with timber production in specific cases. Temperate deciduous (TD) trees have declined steeply during the past millennium, but some now increase in the recent forests, often mixed with Norway spruce. Removing spruce may benefit these trees and for example oak regeneration, flowering plants and pollination. The total area of forest suitable for restoration in Norway and Sweden is >100,000ha. We evaluate the cost of selective cutting based on 26 field trials, 13 in each country, and sales from the initial cutting on average just barely compensate for the costs. By resurveying plots from a parallel project in Sweden, we found that about half of the cut volume had regrown after 16 years, and a second thinning may be needed in the near future. Coarse woody debris (CWD) had increased by 78%, indicating increasingly natural conditions. We conclude that selective cutting in recent forests may be part of a strategy to reach restoration and sustainability goals, but that long-term incentives for landowners need to be developed.

AB  - Continuous cover riparian forests host significant plant and animal species richness, a range of habitats, and natural processes of importance for both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite widely covered controversies, biodiversity offsetting continues to be introduced in novel places as a solution to counter biodiversity loss. As previous studies have focused on contestation around offsetting, there is a lack of studies analyzing how actors generate consensus while constructing biodiversity offsetting policies. To assess this, we analyze the early phases of policy construction in Finland, a country that until recently did not have policy mechanisms for offsetting in place. Based on document analysis and interviews with experts, we argue that expert stakeholders' widespread support for biodiversity offsetting is explained by the interplay of three framings in the early phase of policy development. First, expert stakeholders share an understanding of biodiversity offsetting as a necessary policy mechanism to which there are no alternative solutions. Second, divergent views on the mechanism are accommodated through maintaining an interpretatively flexible understanding of the policy mechanism. Third, concerns over past policy failures are refurbished as opportunities to learn from in developing an experimental approach to policy implementation. This designates offsetting primarily as an expert issue for technical deliberation and forecloses other policy options, while placing high expectations on the ability of experimental governance to solve problems.

AB  - An ex-ante impact assessment of land use plans is required in the preparation or revision phase to inform planners and other stakeholders about the possible or likely impacts of the plans. This study presents a method for estimating the quantitative effects of legislative decisions, the forest owner decisions, and a regional land use plan for forest resources and potential wood supply. The uncertainty associated with the interpretation of design codes used in regional land use plans was taken into account in the estimation. The analyses used MELA software, designed to operate on big data sets involving the characteristics of a large forest area. Estimates were produced for the Kainuu and Varsinais-Suomi case study areas in Finland. We observed large differences in the effects of legislative decisions, the forest owner decisions and a regional land use plan on forest resources available for wood supply and potential wood supply between these two provinces. In Varsinais-Suomi private forest owners and companies were affected considerably more than in Kainuu. There was little uncertainty associated with the interpretation of design codes in Kainuu, but the selection of the interpretation set may have a large effect on the estimates in Varsinais-Suomi.

AB  - Shaping livable cities is an enduring issue for urban planning, which came dramatically to the forefront of relevant policies with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study explores what makes cities livable by using neighborhood satisfaction and neighborhood happiness as measures of urban livability. The determinants of neighborhood satisfaction and neighborhood happiness are examined and compared, using geospatial and survey data from two cities, one from the South and the other from the North European context: Thessaloniki, Greece and Oslo, Norway. A structural equation model is developed and tested. In both cities, common determinants of neighborhood satisfaction are found to be the proximity to city center, neighborhood perceived safety, and place attachment, whereas common determinants of neighborhood happiness are found to be neighborhood perceived safety, neighborhood perceived quietness, neighborhood social cohesion, place attachment, and lower neighborhood density. Important differences between the two cities were also observed. Numerous local amenities seem to positively contribute to urban livability in Thessaloniki, but not in Oslo. Parks and trees are positively linked to neighborhood happiness in Oslo, but not in Thessaloniki. These differences support the view that some of the links between neighborhood characteristics and livability depend on the local context related to local culture, attitudes, and preferences, all of which might also be influenced by the local built environment.

AB  - Over the last few decades, the concept of Green Infrastructures (GI) has been studied in several disciplines such as landscape architecture, landscape ecology and planning. However, scholars are still debating the best approaches to enhance the understanding of GI amongst practitioners. Indeed, a multi-disciplinary collaboration is needed to move beyond any obstacles to the development of GI. This paper presents a literature review that focuses on the barriers which still limit the adoption of GI, the concept of multifunctional GI, and the need for collaborative groups of professionals. In particular, the study explores the three Finnish cities of Vantaa, Tampere and Jyvaskyla, which are currently addressing new GI strategies and introducing the Urban Green Infrastructures within the built environment. The study presents the results from a multi-disciplinary collaborative process that consisted of a pre-questionnaire, learning activities, workshops, as well as a post-questionnaire. 23 official practitioners (architects, landscape architects, engineers and experts in natural sciences) from the city planning departments as well as four researchers in landscape architecture and urban planning were involved in the collaborative process. The results show that an understanding of GI gradually evolved amongst participants. The findings also reveal that rigid planning practices still represent obstacles to the development of GI. Hence, new urban planning approaches to the GI are needed, as well as more concrete actions involving stakeholders. New activities should be used when developing GI, such as learning about GI, proposing GI strategies and actions, as well as reflecting on existing planning tools.

AB  - Urban green spaces (UGSs) support human health and well-being in diverse ways. In addition to their availability and accessibility, also the quality of UGSs is relevant for understanding human-environment interactions between urban populations and their local UGS. However, data on UGS quality are rarely available with the geographic coverage required for spatial decision making and urban green infrastructure (UGI) planning and management. This study uses data from a large-scale public participation GIS (PPGIS) survey to predict perceived UGS quality across the city of Espoo, Finland. The respondents (n 3,132) mapped over 8,500 frequently visited sites situated in UGSs. Generalized linear mixed models were used to study associations between the perceived place quality of the respondent-mapped sites and diverse objectively measured UGS characteristics. The presence of blue elements, high forest biodiversity, level of UGS maintenance, and low daytime noise exposure contributed to positive perceptions of UGS quality, while daytime noise exposure and decreasing UGS size were associated with negative perceptions. The model was extrapolated spatially to predict perceived UGS quality across the entire city, revealing local differences in the accessibility of high-quality UGS. The results exemplify how both UGS quantity and quality are relevant for understanding the mechanisms leading to UGS visitation and the health and well-being benefits gained from UGS use and exposure. Moreover, the study demonstrates how UGS characteristics valued by the local population may be identified to support local UGI planning and management.

AB  - The need for better understanding and conservation of wild plant resources with potential for domestication or utilization in crop improvement has been highlighted in recent years. Botanical resources such as herbaria, databases, and floras offer an information-rich platform from which to select species of interest based on desirable traits. To demonstrate the potential of these resources, wild, native forage legumes were screened for inclusion in northern Swedish grassland agricultural systems (leys). The poor persistence of red clover in multi-year leys is a limitation to the current management strategy in the region. Wild, native forage legumes with the potential for longer persistence were considered for inclusion as minor components in leys to contribute to the system in later years of production. Using the Umea University Herbarium, local floras, and both regional and international biodiversity databases, seven wild forage legume species were selected based on phenology, morphology, and native range. Particular focus was given to the potential for species to provide pollinator resources early in the season, leading to species with early flowering being preferred. Biodiversity databases were also used to locate wild populations of the selected species to facilitate seed collection for future cultivation, as additional study of the agronomic potential of the selected species is necessary. Here, we have shown that the rich biodiversity data stored in botanical institutions can jumpstart the selection of wild species for utilization in the agriculture sector based on various traits of interest.

AB  - The return of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) to western Norway has sparked human-predator conflicts because otters prey on vulnerable Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. Although predation may not be the ultimate cause of salmon population declines, otters that kill adult salmon in rivers before they spawn impact the salmon spawning stock, with potential consequences for stock recruitment and ecosystem services (especially fisheries). To gain insight into impacts of otter predation on salmon populations, we quantified the predation by otters on adult salmon in two rivers in western Norway using a combination of radiotelemetry and temperature loggers. We tagged 30 salmon in Aureelva and 30 salmon in Sore Vartdalselva, and tracked the salmon until they died or left the river. This method identified the fates of 95% of tagged salmon. Estimated predation rates on adult salmon were 32% in Aureelva and 95% in Sore Vartdalselva. The salmon stock in Sore Vartdalselva was well below the spawning target, partly attributable to putatively additive mortality from predation by otters. Notwithstanding, we found no evidence that otters selectively killed salmon based on sex, length, health status, or activity level. Salmon in Sore Vartdalselva had greater predation risk compared to salmon in Aureelva, possibly due to differences in habitat types such as availability of holding pools. The presence of more holding area in Aureelva probably provided predation refuges for adult salmon that buffered the effectiveness of otter predation. Our findings emphasise that management decisions should be guided by river-specific evaluations of impacts of predation on salmon. Otters are a very visible predator operating at the final phase of the life cycle before spawning, so predation is liable to be controversial given that salmon are now Red Listed in Norway.

AB  - Efficient conservation of wide-ranging carnivores requires that adaptive management consider the varying ecological and societal conditions within the entire range of a population. In northern Europe, large carnivore management has to balance carnivore conservation and maintaining the indigenous reindeer-herding culture. Wolverine Gulo gulo monitoring and management in Sweden is currently focused on alpine reindeer husbandry areas where wolverine abundance and associated depredation conflicts have been highest. However, this focus ignores a potential southwards population expansion because current monitoring relies on snow-based tracking methods that are not applicable outside northern alpine areas. Thus, in this study we: (1) used available monitoring data from 1996 to 2014 in Sweden to assess wolverine distribution trends in relation to national management goals, and (2) evaluate the current monitoring protocol against the use of camera stations as an alternative, snow-independent, method for detecting wolverine presence at the southern periphery of its distribution. We show that the wolverine population in Sweden has expanded considerably into the boreal forest landscape, and colonized areas without reindeer husbandry and persistent spring snow cover. The latter indicates a less strict relationship between wolverine distribution and snow cover than previously hypothesized. Current management continues to use a monitoring protocol that is only adapted to high-conflict alpine areas, and is not adapting to changing conditions in the population range, which creates a problematic scale mismatch. Consequently, national management decisions are currently based on incomplete population information, as roughly a third of wolverine's range is not included in official population estimates, which could have detrimental consequences for conflict mitigation and conservation efforts. This illustrates that an important key to successful carnivore conservation is flexible management that considers the entire range of conditions at the appropriate regional and temporal scales under which carnivores, environment and people interact.

AB  - Urban cemeteries represent an unusual type of greenspace that can provide a wide range of ecosystem benefits and services if they have mature tree populations. However, the extent to which tree management is prioritized in cemeteries alongside tasks associated with the burial and commemoration of the deceased is unknown. Given the large differences that exist amongst burial traditions and cemetery management around the world, it seems likely that cemetery tree management will not be uniform across countries. To investigate this, we compared cemetery governance and management in Halifax (Canada) and Malmo (Sweden) to determine which factors influence their cemetery tree populations, with a specific focus on tree planting.
   An inventory of places in which trees could be planted in cemeteries indicated that a large number of trees could theoretically be planted in both cities' cemeteries. However, manager interviews and a review of cemetery legislation indicated multiple dimensions of governance that result in the very real prospect that precious few of these plantable spots will actually become occupied by a tree. These dimensions differed between the two cities, with financial constraints and limited knowledge about trees playing a large role in Halifax, while in Malmo, legislation and public opinion influence the extent to which tree planting occurs. As such, the cities require different solutions to promote tree planting in their cemeteries to avoid future canopy loss and ensure the long-term continued provision of current ecosystem benefits and services.

AB  - To better understand the dynamics of bee populations in crops, we assessed the effect of landscape context and habitat type on bee communities in annual entomophilous crops in Europe. We quantified bee communities in five pairs of crop-country: buckwheat in Poland, cantaloupe in France, field beans in the UK, spring oilseed rape in Sweden, and strawberries in Germany. For each country, 7-10 study fields were sampled over a gradient of increasing proportion of semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape. The CORINE land cover classification was used to characterize the landscape over a 3 km radius around each study field and we used multivariate and regression analyses to quantify the impact of landscape features on bee abundance and diversity at the sub-generic taxonomic level. Neither overall wild bee abundance nor diversity, taken as the number of sub-genera. was significantly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitat. Therefore, we used the most precise level of the CORINE classification to examine the possible links between specific landscape features and wild bee communities. Bee community composition fell into three distinct groups across Europe: group I included Poland, Germany, and Sweden, group 2 the UK, and group 3 France. Among all three groups, wild bee abundance and sub-generic diversity were affected by 17 landscape elements including some semi-natural habitats (e.g., transitional wood land-shrub), some urban habitats (e.g., sport and leisure facilities) and some crop habitats (e.g., non-irrigated arable land). Some bee taxa were positively affected by urban habitats only, others by semi-natural habitats only, and others by a combination of semi-natural, urban and crop habitats. Bee sub-genera favoured by urban and crop habitats were more resistant to landscape change than those favoured only by semi-natural habitats. In agroecosystems, the agricultural intensification defined as the loss of semi-natural habitats does not necessarily cause a decline in evenness at the local level, but can change community composition towards a bee fauna dominated by common taxa.

T2  - SCIENCE AND STEWARDSHIP TO PROTECT AND SUSTAIN WILDERNESS VALUES
LA  - English
CP  - 7th World Wilderness Congress Symposium
AB  - The term "friluftsliv," coined by Henrik Ibsen, refers to the outdoor life which has characterized Norwegian culture, This paper considers the role of friluftsliv in maintaining traditional cultural relationships with the Norwegian landscape, in the light of more recent developments, particularly international adventure sports (such as snowboarding) and the adoption of friluftsliv in schools. This paper uses examples to illustrate how friluftsliv traditions find diverse expression in nature-based experiences based on informal social relations and the family, and how it is shaped by everyday access to the natural and cultural landscape. This is contrasted with contemporary trends to institutionalize friluftsliv and contemporary outdoor recreation-based equipment and expensive travel. The comparison suggests that attention should be paid to how institutional and commercial forms of friluftsliv may erode the role of tradition in maintaining a strong connection between cultural identity and environmental sustainability, and provides some insights into how environmental education can be considered as a lifelong, communal process rather than something concentrated in the school.

AB  - Large herbivores are capable of modifying entire ecosystems with a combination of direct (for example browsing/grazing, trampling, defecation) and indirect (for example affecting plant species composition that then alters soil properties) effects. With many ungulate populations increasing across the northern hemisphere it is important to develop a general theory for how these animals can be expected to impact their habitats. Here we present the results of an 8-year experimental exclusion of moose (Alces alces) from 15 recent boreal forest clear-cut sites in Central Norway. We used standard univariate techniques to describe the treatment effect on multiple forest and soil properties and combined this with a multivariate Bayesian network structure learning approach to objectively assess the potential mechanistic pathways for indirect effects on soils and soil fertility. We found that excluding moose had predictable direct effects, such as increasing the ratio of deciduous to coniferous tree biomass and the canopy cover and decreasing soil bulk density and temperature. However, we found no treatment effects on any measures of soil processes or quality (decomposition, nitrogen availability, C/N ratio, pH, nutrient stocks), and furthermore, we found only limited evidence that the direct effects had cascading (indirect) effects on soils. These findings oppose the commonly held belief that moose exclusion will increase soil fertility, but still highlights the strong ability of moose to directly modify forested ecosystems.

AB  - Natural wetlands used to cover a significant part of the landscape, but these ecosystems have declined by >50% worldwide, and even more in Denmark and Sweden. However, since the 1980s, various policies have been implemented to restore and create wetlands. This study provides a comprehensive historical overview of policies used to stimulate the creation and restoration of wetlands in Denmark and Sweden, and also analyses what factors have facilitated participation or have been barriers for landowners. The analysis of wetlands implementation programmes in Denmark showed a change towards narrower focus on nitrogen reduction from 1998 and onwards, whereas policies in Sweden often have had a wider multifunctional purpose. In both countries, there has been a change in the compensation structure from a lump sum to annual payments, parallel to an observed increase in costs for wetlands implementation. There is still a large potential for recreating many more wetlands, and the national targets have not been reached in neither Denmark nor Sweden. Key success factors, for future wetlands implementation are sufficient compensation levels, flexible scheme designs and information-based strategies documenting relevant benefits and sustainability issues. In general, more advice and support from the state, regional and local participants, and farmers' organisations, are required to increase the participation and achieve successful and cost-efficient wetlands implementation. A collaborative and catchment-based approach holds promise, where wetland governance can serve as a platform for collaboration between policy bodies and between farmers. Additionally, politicians and decision makers need to accept the area targets presented to them when setting policy goals for wetlands implementation, and to accept that restoring and constructing wetlands requires long implementation times before results can be demonstrated.

AB  - Sami reindeer herders have considerable traditional knowledge about a neurological reindeer disease resembling elaphostrongylosis, but the causative agent was not identified prior to the description of the brainworm Elaphostrongylus rangiferi in Russia in 1958. Elaphostrongylosis was quickly recognised as a serious cause of reindeer morbidity and mortality. The ecology, epidemiology and pathophysiology of the disease were studied in Sweden and Norway during the 1960s and in particular the 1970s to 1990s. In Finland, elaphostrongylosis was not recognised as an important disease for Finnish reindeer husbandry, even though the presence of brainworm infection has been documented. Brainworm has an indirect lifecycle with snail and slug intermediate hosts. The free-living L1 larvae have extremely good freeze tolerance and can survive > 360 days at - 80 degrees C in water (solid ice). Even though reindeer brainworm is clearly well adapted to the Arctic chill, the lifecycle stages outside the reindeer final host are sped up at warmer environmental temperatures. Arctic summer temperatures are close to the developmental threshold of the parasite in the intermediate gastropod hosts (8-10 degrees C), and the parasite has typically had a 2-year life cycle. Disease outbreaks generally occur during the winter following the infection of reindeer with infected snails and slugs during the summer and autumn. Warmer summers result in faster development of brainworm larvae in the intermediate hosts. Clinical symptoms have been seen reported as early as August, such as in the outbreak in Trondelag, Norway in 2018. The reindeer brainworm is also a cause of conflict between reindeer herders and small ruminant farmers, because it can cause severe disease in goats and sheep, which share pasture with reindeer. Many knowledge gaps remain if we wish to successfully predict and mitigate for large-scale outbreaks in a future with a predicted warmer, wetter and wilder climate.

AB  - Riparian forests (RFs) along streams and rivers in forested landscapes provide many ecosystem functions that are important for the biodiversity and biogeochemistry of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In riverine landscapes, many of these ecological and biogeochemical functions have been found to be maximized in riparian areas with discharge of upland-originating groundwater (GW). This ecological significance, and the fact that riparian areas with GW discharge are important sources of many chemical elements in streams and rivers, makes these places important hotspots in the landscape. The natural functioning of RFs is however threatened by poorly designed management practices, with forestry being one of the most important examples in timber producing regions. Logging operations in riparian, but also in adjoining upland forests, threaten to alter many riparian functions. This effect is accelerated in GW discharge hotspots because of their sensitive soils and the high connectivity with uphill areas. We thus argue that forestry practices should give higher consideration to riparian GW discharge areas, and we demonstrate how improved riparian buffer zone management can be incorporated into every-day forestry planning. We offer a practical tool for more optimized site-specific riparian buffer design by using model-derived high resolution maps with detailed information about wetness and soil-water flow paths within RFs. We describe how such site-specific riparian buffer management differs from fixed-width buffers, which are generally applied in today's forestry, and address some risks connected to fixed-width buffer management. We conclude that site-specific riparian management, allowing wider buffers at GW discharge areas and more narrow buffers on sites of lower ecological significance (i.e. riparian sites without GW flow paths), would benefit a variety of ecosystem services, mitigate negative-effects caused by forestry and create more variable and heterogeneous riparian corridors. Finally, we show examples of how the new forestry planning can be applied. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Agroforestry landscapes are crucial to human wellbeing; however, they are in sharp decline across Europe. Improved understanding of the complexity of agroforestry landscapes within different biophysical, social cultural, economic and governance contexts is essential for designing effective policy and management interventions that are more tightly aligned with societal expectations and aspirations. This paper identifies and compares values that people attribute to agroforestry landscapes across North-Eastern Europe, using case studies in Sweden, Latvia, Belarus, and the Russian Federation. We apply the multiple-value approach developed for the conceptual framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services to an assessment of agroforestry landscapes. Using data from a total of 1634 face-to-face structured interviews, we (i) analyse and explore the preferences of diverse groups of respondents for agroforestry landscapes; (ii) identify a broad range of nature's contributions to people (NCP) that were attributed to agroforestry landscapes by respondents; and, (iii) analyse values of agroforestry landscapes across different contexts in NorthEastern Europe. We found that a highly heterogenous group of people - broadly irrespective of age, education, gender, place of residence, as well as political, economic, or social-cultural context - perceive agroforestry landscapes to be important to their quality of life. Respondents attributed multiple NCP to agroforestry landscapes, and nonmaterial NCP are the most frequently assigned in all four countries. An absolute majority of respondents across all case studies considered relational values of agroforestry landscapes to be important for their quality of life with identity as the most often associated with agroforestry landscapes. We discuss how relational values might be incorporated in policies and practices related to agroforestry landscapes in North-Eastern Europe.

AB  - The main objective of this study is to estimate and compare farmer demand for afforestation agreements in the Netherlands and Germany under different institutional-economic contract design conditions. Farmers' responsiveness to financial and non-financial incentives to convert part of their land into forest is examined in a discrete choice experiment. Besides landowner and contract characteristics, we test the role of motivational drivers in explaining farmers' willingness to conclude afforestation agreements. These are expected to lower demand for financial compensation. We fix financial compensation levels in contractual agreements relatively low compared to opportunity costs, but comparable to what farmers currently receive for nature conservation measures. Although we find substantial demand for afforestation agreements in both samples, Dutch and German farmers value contract conditions differently. This has important implications for the effectiveness of varying compensation levels on scheme participation rates. Farmers are willing to trade-off financial compensation against non-financial terms and conditions. However, having a positive environmental disposition towards wildlife conservation does not necessarily result in the acceptance of lower levels of financial compensation.

AB  - Agroforestry is widely purported to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, rehabilitate degraded landscapes, and enhance the provisioning of ecosystem services. Yet, evidence supporting these longer-term impacts is limited. Using a quasi-experimental impact evaluation design informed by a theory-based and mixed methods framework, we investigated selected intermediate and final outcomes of a nine-year effort led by Vi Agroforestry, a Swedish non-governmental organization (NGO), to promote agroforestry in large sections of Bungoma and Kakamega counties in western Kenya. We compared households belonging to 432 pre-existing farmer groups operating in 60 program villages and 61 matched comparison villages. To address potential self-selection bias, we used program targeting as an instrument for program participation, combined with the difference-in-differences approach to control for time-invariant differences between our treatment and comparison groups. We complemented the above with semi-structured interviews with a sub-sample of 40 purposively selected program participants. Despite evidence of variable program exposure and agroforestry uptake, we found modest, yet statistically significant, effects of Vi Agroforestry's program on intermediate outcomes, such as agroforestry product income, fuelwood access, and milk yields among dairy farmers. We also found that this program modestly increased asset holdings, particularly among households represented by female program participants. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Regional clear-felling of naturally dynamic boreal forests has left remote forest landscapes in northern Europe with challenges regarding rural development based on wood mining. However, biodiversity conservation with higher levels of ambition than what is possible in regions with a long forest history, and cultural heritage, offer opportunities for developing new value chains that support rural development. We explored the opportunities for pro-active integrated spatial planning based on: (i) landscapes' natural and cultural heritage values in the transboundary Kovda River catchment in Russia and Finland; (ii) forest canopy loss as a threat; and (iii) private, public and civil sector stakeholders' views on the use and non-use values at local to international levels. After a 50-year history of wood mining in Russia, the remaining primeval forest and cultural heritage remnants are located along the pre-1940 Finnish-Russian border. Forest canopy loss was higher in Finland (0.42%/year) than in Russia (0.09%/year), and decreased from the south to the north in both countries. The spatial scales of stakeholders' use of forest landscapes ranged from stand-scale to the entire catchment of Kovda River in Russia and Finland (similar to 2,600,000 ha). We stress the need to develop an integrated landscape approach that includes: (i) forest landscape goods; (ii) other ecosystem services and values found in intact forest landscapes; and (iii) adaptive local and regional forest landscape governance. Transboundary collaboration offers opportunities for effective knowledge production and learning.

AB  - In recent decades, the City of Stockholm, Sweden, has grown substantially and is now the largest city in Scandinavia. Recent urban growth is placing pressure on green areas within and around the city. In order to protect biodiversity and ecosystem services, green infrastructure is part of Stockholm municipal planning. This research quantifies land-cover change in the City of Stockholm between 2003 and 2018 and examines what impact urban growth has had on its green infrastructure. Two 2018 WorldView-2 images and three 2003 QuickBird-2 images were used to produce classifications of 11 land-cover types using object-based image analysis and a support vector machine algorithm with spectral, geometric and texture features. The classification accuracies reached over 90% and the results were used in calculations and comparisons to determine the impact of urban growth in Stockholm between 2003 and 2018, including the generation of land-cover change statistics in relation to administrative boundaries and green infrastructure. For components of the green infrastructure, i.e., habitat networks for selected sensitive species, habitat network analysis for the European crested tit (Lophophanes cristatus) and common toad (Bufo bufo) was performed. Between 2003 and 2018, urban areas increased by approximately 4% while green areas decreased by 2% in comparison with their 2003 areal amounts. The most significant urban growth occurred through expansion of the transport network, paved surfaces and construction areas which increased by 12%, mainly at the expense of grassland and coniferous forest. Examination of urban growth within the green infrastructure indicated that most land area was lost in dispersal zones (28 ha) while the highest percent change was within habitat for species of conservation concern (14%). The habitat network analysis revealed that overall connectivity decreased slightly through patch fragmentation and areal loss mainly caused by road expansion on the outskirts of the city. The habitat network analysis also revealed which habitat areas are well-connected and which are most vulnerable. These results can assist policymakers and planners in their efforts to ensure sustainable urban development including sustaining biodiversity in the City of Stockholm.

AB  - During the last decade, several well-publicized grazing-related incidents of vegetation degradation have helped to form an official opinion of overutilization of some mountain areas and a concern that Swedish reindeer husbandry may not be ecologically sustainable. We examine these examples in a temporal and management perspective to assess the scale of impact on summer grazing grounds in the Swedish mountains. Long-term data on population dynamics of reindeer show no trend with fluctuations around 225 000 animals for the last century. Data on grazing effects from Langfjallet (Dalarna) and Mittaklappen (Harjedalen) are discussed in detail. We compare these data to the situation in Finnmark, Norway, and in northern Finland where reindeer husbandry in recent decades does not seem to have been ecologically sustainable. We conclude that large-scale overexploitation by reindeer in the Swedish mountains is not evident. However, strong grazing and trampling effects may be found around enclosures and fences.

AB  - In November 2016, the Scottish Government announced that they were minded to allow the two 'trial' reintroduced populations of Eurasian beaver Castor fiber to remain in Scotland and be allowed to expand naturally, and that the species will receive legal protection. This was a historic moment: the first formally approved reintroduction of a mammal species anywhere in the United Kingdom. The issues surrounding beaver reintroduction to Scotland had been the subject of intense investigation and public debate over the previous 21years. Extensive multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work was performed to assess the desirability and feasibility of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver and informed the government's decision. This was one of the most detailed assessments carried out for any species reintroduction proposal. The work was broadly divided into desk-based and stand-alone studies based primarily on the European and North American experience of living with beavers, the scientifically monitored Scottish Beaver Trial reintroduction in west Scotland, a study of beavers resulting from unauthorised releases in an east Scotland catchment and the work of a specialist group that examined beaver-salmonid interactions and issues. It was confirmed that beavers have a very positive influence on biodiversity overall, although some specific species and habitats of high conservation importance can be adversely affected if appropriate management is not in place. Beavers provide a range of ecosystem services with the potential for socio-economic benefits. However, beavers' activities may affect some land uses, the extent and significance depending on local conditions. Management techniques are well developed, although some will require refinement and appropriate licensing within a Scottish regulatory regime. A strategic approach to developing management throughout Scotland will need to be progressed in partnership with key stakeholders.

AB  - Agricultural intensification has led to the conversion of natural habitats into agricultural fields, increased field sizes and simplified crop rotations. The resulting homogenisation of the landscape has led to a decline in bees, which provide an essential ecosystem service to agriculture. It has been suggested that an increase in landscape crop diversity supports higher biodiversity by providing more diverse and continuous resources without taking land out of agricultural production. We selected 14 faba bean (Vicia faba minor L.) fields in southern Sweden along uncorrelated gradients of landscape crop diversity and proportion of semi-natural habitat within 1.5 km radii surrounding focal fields. Pollinator surveys and pollinator exclusion experiments were conducted to assess whether landscape crop diversity affected pollinator densities, pollinator foraging behaviour (i.e. legitimate flower visitation, nectar robbing or extra-floral nectary visitation), pollination and yield formation. Landscape crop diversity enhanced bumble bee densities. Insect-pollinated faba bean plants produced, on average, 27 % higher bean weight per plant than bagged plants and the insect pollination benefit decreased with increasing semi-natural habitat cover. Bumble bee and honey bee densities, the proportion of nectar robbing bees as well as faba bean yield increased with increasing proportion of semi-natural habitat. Pollinator densities were not the driver of high yields associated with higher proportions of semi-natural habitat because the observed yield increase was unrelated to pollinator densities and driven by bagged plants that were excluded from pollinator visits. Insect pollination, however, clearly decreased the yield gap associated with low proportions of semi natural habitat in the landscape. Our results highlight that agri-environmental policies should promote the retention of existing semi-natural habitats and encourage landscape crop diversity to provide pollinators with sufficient food and nesting resources.

AB  - The risk of wind damage to European forests is expected to increase due to the changed climate. Research efforts in forestry have been focussing on the development of analytical and modelling tools to aid with the evaluation and the prediction of forests' vulnerability to wind damage, and ultimately to inform forest management decisions aimed at promoting wind-resistance in forest stands. Recent catastrophic wind damage to European forests has shown that wind damage risk applies also to montane forests. These are of particular importance for the various ecosystem services they provide, including protection from gravitational hazards and defence against soil erosion. At present, the available forest wind risk models have been tested and used mainly on production or planted forests in different countries, but never in the complexity of mountainous terrains. The aim of this study is to introduce a methodology for the validation of a new parametrisation of the ForestGALES wind risk model, specifically designed for the alpine scenario. To do so, we used parameters from pulling tests in the field, and laboratory mechanical tests. We also developed a workflow that, starting from data obtained by LiDAR, aims at producing wind damage vulnerability maps. After validating this new parameterisation, we investigated the variations in wind vulnerability for a case study in the Italian Alps by introducing the Difference of Vulnerability (DoV) raster. Among our results, the DoV proves to be an innovative tool whose future use can increase understanding of the factors predisposing a forest stand to wind instability.

AB  - The natural and old-growth forests and their associated biodiversity continues to fade worldwide due to anthropogenic impact in various forms. The boreal forests in Fennoscandia have been subject to intensive clearfelling forestry since the middle of twentieth century. As a result, only a fraction of forests with long temporal continuity remains at the landscape level. In Sweden, some of these primary forests have been formally protected, whereas other forests with known high conservation values are not. Collectively, both protected and not protected known valuable primary forests are included in a nationally delineated network of high conservation value forests (HCVF). In addition to HCVF, older forests that have not been clearfelled since the mid-1900s, i.e., "proxy continuity forests," have recently been mapped across the entire boreal biome in Sweden. In this paper, we analyze how these proxy continuity forests may strengthen the HCVF network from a green infrastructure perspective. First, we evaluate the spatial overlap between proxy continuity forests and HCVF. Second, we perform a large-scale connectivity analysis, in which we show that adding proxy continuity forests located outside HCVF strongly increases the structural connectivity of the network of protected forests. Finally, by assessing habitat suitability for virtual species specialized in pine, spruce, and broadleaf forests, we find large regional differences in the ability to secure habitat and thereby functional green infrastructure by considering currently unprotected primary forest. We show that, by adding those forests to the network, the area of habitat for low-demanding species dependent on spruce or pine forests can be largely increased. For high-demanding species, additional habitat restoration in the landscape matrix is needed. By contrast, even counting all valuable broadleaf forests available is not enough to provide a suitable habitat for their associated species, which indicates a large need for landscape-scale habitat restoration initiatives, in particular, for broadleaf forests.

AB  - Mapping the spatial and temporal dynamics of species distributions is necessary for biodiversity conservation land-use planning decisions. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning have allowed for high-resolution species distribution modeling that can inform landscape-level decision-making. Here we compare the performance of three popular Sentinel-2 (10-m) land cover maps, including dynamic world (DW), European land cover (ELC10), and world cover (WC), in predicting wild bee species richness over southern Norway. The proportion of grassland habitat within 250 m (derived from the land cover maps), along with temperature and distance to sandy soils, were used as predictors in both Bayesian regularized neural network and random forest models. Models using grassland habitat from DW performed best (RMSE = 2.8 +/- 0.03; average +/- standard deviation across models), followed by ELC10 (RMSE = 2.85 +/- 0.03) and WC (RMSE = 2.87 +/- 0.02). All satellite-derived maps outperformed a manually mapped Norwegian land cover dataset called AR5 (RMSE = 3.02 +/- 0.02). When validating the model predictions of bee species richness against citizen science data on solitary bee occurrences using generalized linear models, we found that ELC10 performed best (AIC = 2278 +/- 4), followed by WC (AIC = 2367 +/- 3), and DW (AIC = 2376 +/- 3). While the differences in RMSE we observed between models were small, they may be significant when such models are used to prioritize grassland patches within a landscape for conservation subsidies or management policies. Partial dependencies in our models showed that increasing the proportion of grassland habitat is positively associated with wild bee species richness, thereby justifying bee conservation schemes that aim to enhance semi-natural grassland habitat. Our results confirm the utility of satellite-derived land cover maps in supporting high-resolution species distribution modeling and suggest there is scope to monitor changes in species distributions over time given the dense time series provided by products such as DW.

AB  - In the management of natural resources, conflicting interests and objectives among different stakeholders often need to be considered. Here, we examine how two contrasting management scenarios of boreal forests in northern Sweden differ in their consequences on forest structural composition and the economic gains at harvest. Management strategies prioritize either (i) forest characteristics that promote grazing resources for reindeer herded by the indigenous Sami, or (ii) timber production as practiced in Sweden today. When prioritizing reindeer grazing, forest stands develop a higher abundance of older age classes with larger trees and lower stem density, which reduces harvest and revenue levels by approximately 20 % over a 100-year period. The differences between these strategies illustrate the complexity in finding a trade-off for coexistence between industrial land users and other livelihoods that share the same landscape. Political support and institutional solutions are necessary to initiate changes in policy in finding such trade-offs in the management of environmental resources and thereby influence the optimal distribution of costs and benefits between different actors.

AB  - The abundance of aquatic vegetation is increasing in rivers and lakes worldwide. The aim of this study was to find how the macrophyte Juncus bulbosus Linnaeus affects salmonids and benthic macroinvertebrates in Norwegian rivers. The proliferation of J. bulbosus in the study rivers commenced after the development of hydropower in the 1960s and 1970s. J. bulbosus is now considered a nuisance for humans in many areas of the rivers. We found a higher density of juvenile fish and higher density, weight and species richness of invertebrates in areas with J. bulbosus than in areas with gravel, suggesting that the vegetation is not limiting fish and invertebrates. This may be because macrophytes increase the surface area and provide shelter, food and a variety of ecological niches. Adult salmonid fish can be negatively affected when their spawning grounds are covered by vegetation. However, overgrowth is not common and may take years since fish clear the river bed of macrophytes during redd digging, indicating competition between macrophytes and fish for riverbed habitat. Our results suggest that one should not assume that outgrowths of macrophytes have negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is important to map all impacts and distinguish nuisance to humans from effects on the ecosystem.

AB  - Several predictions point to changes in the marine benthic macrofauna associated with climate change, but so far only a few and minor changes have been reported. This study relates observed changes in the species composition to climate change by looking on the past decades in the Kattegat between Denmark and Sweden. A reduction of the total number species and a reduction of species with a northern range parallel to an increase of species with a southern range have been observed. The most likely explanation of the changes is the increase in temperature of the bottom water. Increased temperature could change the species distributions but also decrease primary production which impacts recruitment and growth. Hypoxia and bottom trawling could also act synergistic in this process. A sparse occurrence of previously encountered Arctic-Boreal species and critical foundation species, which gives the area its special character, suggests a change in biodiversity and might therefore be designated as early warning signals of a warmer climate. The northern fauna below the halocline with limited capacity of dispersal and low reproduction potential, can be considered as sensitive with low adaptive capacity to climate change. Therefore, not only tropical and high-latitude species, but also benthos on deep bottoms at mid-latitudes, could be vulnerable to warming. As many species live at the edge of their range in the Kattegat, and also are dependent of distant recruitment, large scale changes will probably be detected here at an early stage. It is important to protect relatively undisturbed reference areas in the Kattegat for future studies, but also for preserving a large number of ecosystem services, biotopes, habitats, and fish species.

AB  - Forest biomass has become a viable alternative energy source for replacing fossil fuels, particularly after the European Union acknowledged its sustainability status. To reach zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 in Sweden, new efficient methods of biomass extraction, such as geometrical biomass thinnings, are being explored and tested. These machine-based methods involve the extraction of above-ground biomass in narrow, 1-2 m-wide strips between extraction racks. While evidence-based optimization of biomass extraction mostly focuses on time- and cost-efficiency and on stand growth, criteria such as tree diversity are often overlooked. However, with ongoing climate change, tree diversity is crucial to strengthening the resilience and productivity of future forests, which also enhance the provision of ecosystem services and overall biological diversity. Therefore, we studied the effects of different biomass thinning strategies on spatial tree diversity in southern Sweden using nearest-neighbour summary statistics. We found scientific evidence that different geometrical designs of biomass thinning, especially in 1 or 2 m-wide strips, resulted in higher spatial tree diversity compared to conventional biomass thinning. Hence, in mixed conifer-broadleaved forests, biomass thinning in 1 or 2 m-wide strips is recommended for maintaining spatial tree diversity.

AB  - Aim of study: We aim at (i) developing a reference definition of mixed forests in order to harmonize comparative research in mixed forests and (ii) briefly review the research perspectives in mixed forests.
   Area of study: The definition is developed in Europe but can be tested worldwide.
   Material and methods: Review of existent definitions of mixed forests based and literature review encompassing dynamics, management and economic valuation of mixed forests.
   Main results: A mixed forest is defined as a forest unit, excluding linear formations, where at least two tree species coexist at any developmental stage, sharing common resources (light, water, and/or soil nutrients). The presence of each of the component species is normally quantified as a proportion of the number of stems or of basal area, although volume, biomass or canopy cover as well as proportions by occupied stand area may be used for specific objectives. A variety of structures and patterns of mixtures can occur, and the interactions between the component species and their relative proportions may change over time.
   The research perspectives identified are (i) species interactions and responses to hazards, (ii) the concept of maximum density in mixed forests, (iii) conversion of monocultures to mixed-species forest and (iv) economic valuation of ecosystem services provided by mixed forests.
   Research highlights: The definition is considered a high-level one which encompasses previous attempts to define mixed forests. Current fields of research indicate that gradient studies, experimental design approaches, and model simulations are key topics providing new research opportunities.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is a global problem with profoundly negative environmental, social and economic consequences. From a governance perspective, there is a need to ensure a coordinated effort to directly address it. This study reviews 90 legislative documents from 17 countries from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK that primarily border the sea. The primary finding from this study is that the European national policies and legislation addressing OA is at best uncoordinated. Although OA is acknowledged at the higher levels of governance, its status as an environmental challenge is greatly diluted at the European Union Member State level. As a notable exception within the EEA, Norway seems to have a proactive approach towards legislative frameworks and research aimed towards further understanding OA. On the other hand, there was a complete lack of, or inadequate reporting in the Marine Strategy Framework Directive by the majority of the EU Member States, with the exception of Italy and the Netherlands. We argue that the problems associated with OA and the solutions needed to address it are unique and cannot be bundled together with traditional climate change responses and measures. Therefore, European OA-related policy and legislation must reflect this and tailor their actions to mitigate OA to safeguard marine ecosystems and societies. A stronger and more coordinated approach is needed to build environmental, economic and social resilience of the observed and anticipated changes to the coastal marine systems.

AB  - Fifteen years after the heavy storm "Vivian", it is still not clear how succession in subalpine forests that were affected by the storm will continue and when regrowing forests will provide effective protection from natural hazards such as avalanches. We used a simulation model to evaluate forest succession, forest structure and the protective effect in subalpine blowdown areas after 50 simulation years under different scenarios. The scenarios included the effects of different management strategies such as clearing the fallen logs or leaving the sites untouched ("uncleared"), variations in seed supply, and ungulate browsing. The simulation results indicated that forest structure was heterogeneous after 50 years, with a high amount of trees between 11 and 100 cm hei-ht, and a low amount of trees taller than I m. The number of trees > 5 m, which is important for the protective effect of a site, was lower at uncleared areas if the area was covered with high amounts of fallen logs, but diversity of microsites was higher than at cleared areas. We found that it is particularly important that abundant seed supply occurs within the first few years after the blowdown at cleared sites, because in later stages there was high competition by tall herbs, which prevented the establishment of tree regeneration. Larger time lags between seed years in the simulations led to retarded tree regeneration. Particularly at cleared sites, ungulate browsing retarded tree regeneration. In contrast, uncleared sites had a higher potential to recover from high browsing pressure due to a high amount of favourable microsites that are provided by decaying logs. These results of our model simulations may help understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration and providing perspectives for management after blowdown events. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In Romania, natural Norway spruce forests are spread across upper mountain slopes (1300-1800 m). They perform multiple functions, being especially recognised for their economic value. However, where planted forests extend beyond the spruce's naturally occurring areas, they are frequently exposed to deleterious environmental factors. In Romania, forest planning is based on typological studies that were carried out between 1950 and 1970, and the regulations arc applied in a somewhat flexible manner. In the context of the potential threats from climate change that could amplify induced destabilising phenomena, the risks to which these forests are becoming exposed can only be mediated through flexible management and the permanent adaptation of forest planning. For this reason, the purpose of this study was to develop a strategy for adapting forest management plan guidelines, with a view to improving ecosystem stability. A Norway spruce forest was chosen from the south-eastern Carpathians, which is included in the Natura 2000 Fagaras Mountains site. The models on which we based our current stand compositions resulted from long-term monitoring and analysis of species and stand structures. Stand structure - and forest structure, in general - is key to the continuous existence of stand functions and ecosystem services. Through design decisions, we promote biodiversity and the natural, better adapted, regeneration of local provenances. We highlight the rationale behind forest management planning and its regulations, with respect to the sustainable management of Norway spruce forests, which are vulnerable to potential changes in their structure as a result of climate change. Based on our findings, we propose the adaptation of measures used in forest management planning for Norway spruce forests to include protective functions that can be applied to all man-made Norway spruce forests introduced in former beech forest regions, and mixed coniferous/beech forests, that are vulnerable to changing environmental factors.

AB  - Many wetlands have been drained due to urbanization, agriculture, forestry or other purposes, which has resulted in a loss of their ecosystem services. To protect receiving waters and to achieve services such as flood control and storm water quality mitigation, new wetlands are created in urbanized areas. However, our knowledge of greenhouse gas exchange in newly created wetlands in urban areas is currently limited. In this paper we present measurements carried out at a created urban wetland in Southern Finland in the boreal climate.
   We conducted measurements of ecosystem CO2 flux and CH4 flux (FCH4) at the created storm water wetland Gateway in Nummela, Vihti, Southern Finland, using the eddy covariance (EC) technique. The measurements were commenced the fourth year after construction and lasted for 1 full year and two subsequent growing seasons. Besides ecosystemscale fluxes measured by the EC tower, the diffusive CO2 and CH4 fluxes from the open-water areas (FwCO(2) and FwCH(4), respectively) were modelled based on measurements of CO2 and CH4 concentration in the water. Fluxes from the vegetated areas were estimated by applying a simple mixing model using the above-mentioned fluxes and the footprintweighted fractional area. The half-hourly footprint-weighted contribution of diffusive fluxes from open water ranged from 0% to 25.5% in 2013.
   The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the studied wetland was 8.0 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), with the 95% confidence interval between 18:9 and 34.9 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), and FCH4 was 3.9 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), with the 95% confidence interval between 3.75 and 4.07 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The ecosystem sequestered CO2 during summer months (June-August), while the rest of the year it was a CO2 source. CH4 displayed strong seasonal dynamics, higher in summer and lower in winter, with a sporadic emission episode in the end of May 2013. Both CH4 and CO2 fluxes, especially those obtained from vegetated areas, exhibited strong diurnal cycles during summer with synchronized peaks around noon. The annual FwCO(2) was 297.5 g C-CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) and FwCH(4) was 1.73 g C-CH4 m(-2) yr(-1). The peak diffusive CH4 flux was 137.6 nmol C-CH4 m(-2) s(-1), which was synchronized with the FCH4.
   Overall, during the monitored time period, the established storm water wetland had a climate-warming effect with 0.263 kgCO(2)-eqm(-2) yr(-1) of which 89% was contributed by CH4. The radiative forcing of the open-water areas exceeded that of the vegetation areas (1.194 and 0.111 kgCO(2)-eqm(-2) yr(-1), respectively), which implies that, when considering solely the climate impact of a created wetland over a 100-year horizon, it would be more beneficial to design and establish wetlands with large patches of emergent vegetation and to limit the areas of open water to the minimum necessitated by other desired ecosystem services.

AB  - Wood-living beetles make up a large proportion of forest biodiversity and contribute to important ecosystem services, including decomposition. Beetle communities in managed southern boreal forests are less species rich than in natural and near-natural forest stands. In addition, many beetle species rely primarily on specific tree species. Yet, the associations between individual beetle species, forest management category, and tree species are seldom quantified, even for red-listed beetles. We compiled a beetle capture dataset from flight intercept traps placed on Norway spruce (Picea abies), oak (Quercus sp.), and Eurasian aspen (Populus tremulae) trees in 413 sites in mature managed forest, near-natural forest, and clear-cuts in southeastern Norway. We used joint species distribution models to estimate the strength of associations for 368 saproxylic beetle species (including 20 vulnerable, endangered, or critical red-listed species) for each forest management category and tree species. Tree species on which traps were mounted had the largest effect on beetle communities; oaks had the most highly associated beetle species, including most of the red-listed species, followed by Norway spruce and Eurasian aspen. Most beetle species were more likely to be captured in near-natural than in mature managed forest. Our estimated associations were compatible ? for many species ? with categorical classifications found in several existing databases of saproxylic beetle preferences. These quantitative beetle-habitat associations will improve future analyses that have typically relied on categorical classifications. Our results highlight the need to prioritize conservation of near-natural forests and oak trees in Scandinavia to protect the habitat of many red-listed species in particular. Furthermore, we underline the importance of carefully considering the species of trees on which traps are mounted in order to representatively sample beetle communities in forest stands.

AB  - Knowledge of people's understanding of environmental problems is vital for the effective implementation of the ecosystem approach to marine management. This is especially relevant when conservation goals are aimed at ecosystems in the deep-sea that are remote to the consciousness of most people. This study explores public perceptions of the deep-sea environment among the Scottish and Norwegian public. It further analyses the relationships between respondents' pro-environmental concerns toward the marine environment and personal characteristics using a multiple indicators multiple causes model. The results show that public knowledge of the deep-sea environment is low for Scottish and moderate for Norwegians. Awareness of cold-water corals was high for the Lofoten case study area amongst the Norwegian public and low for the Mingulay reef complex in the Scottish case. These differences might arise because Norway is known to host the world's largest cold-water corals in the Lofoten area; a fact that has been well-publicized. We find that most people think changes in the deep-sea have at least some effect on them. On average, the public perceive the deep-sea condition to be at most "fairly good" but are dissatisfied with the management of it with approximately only one third or less thinking it is well-managed. Generally, the public perception from both countries show ecocentric attitudes toward the marine environment implying that they recognize the value of ecosystem services, the current ecological crisis and the need for sustainable management.

AB  - Tree plantations in low-income countries are emerging as central tools for global climate change mitigation. However, there is growing evidence that focusing on the carbon-binding aspect of trees in such forests often oversimplifies political ecologies and constrains local livelihoods. One reason is a strong reliance on land use maps, leading to monodimensional and disconnected views of landscapes. This study examines one such climate forest, Kachung plantation in Uganda, run by the company Green Resources on land leased from the Ugandan state through its National Forest Authority. The carbon emission reductions are purchased by the Swedish Energy Agency. Drawing on the Katz conceptualisation of countertopographies, we present a 'situated topography' of Kachung based on the experiences of local women. In contrast to the 'distant topography' produced by the actors investing in the project, it reveals a dynamic landscape where women know and use a diversity of local trees and have well-established strategies for regeneration. However, their access to useful trees and farmland is constrained by the plantation, resulting in increased livelihood struggles. In line with Katz, we suggest that producing similar situated topographies for other climate forests can help create strong countertopographies, displaying more diverse, connected and dynamic uses of landscapes than seen from a distance.

AB  - Dam removal is an increasingly common practice. Dams are removed for various reasons, with safety, economics, and ecosystem restoration being the most common. However, dam removals often cause controversy. Riparian land owners and local communities often have a negative view of removal, and their reasons vary. It may be the loss of recreational benefits such as swimming and boating, loss of cultural and historical context tied to the dam, or fear that removal may have a negative effect on aesthetic values. Because controversies are often picked up by local media, and media in itself is an important channel to build support around a cause, the way in which dam removals are reported and discussed in the media is likely to influence the debate. Here, we examine the ways in which proponents and opponents of dam removal frame the services provided by two contrasting ecosystems, i.e., an existing dam and the potential stream without a dam, by performing a media discourse analysis of the reasons given for removal and the reasons presented for the dam to remain in place. Our source material includes Internet-based newspaper articles and their associated public comments in four dam removal controversies in Sweden. Our analysis indicates that public opposition is not based on knowledge deficiency, where more information will lead to better ecological decision-making, as is sometimes argued in dam removal science; it is instead a case of different understandings and valuation of the environment and the functions it provides.

AB  - In agricultural landscapes, sown flower strips can benefit pollinators and pollination of nearby plants, but their impact on pollination in the wider landscape is poorly studied. We evaluated effects on reproductive success of field bean (Vicia faba) and woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) using data from two study systems, both including study sites (1 km radius) with (flower strip sites) or without flower strips (control sites). To assess whether flower strips enhance pollination in the wider landscape, we compared the reproductive success between plants growing in field borders (> 160 m to nearest flower strip) at flower strips sites and control sites. We also tested if flower strips reallocate pollination functions in the landscape. We did this by comparing the reproductive success of plants at flower strip sites, growing adjacent to the flower strips with plants growing in a more distant field border at the same site (> 160 m). Finally, we tested if these potential effects depended on the heterogeneity of the landscape. In field borders without an adjacent flower strip, plant reproductive success was unaffected by the presence of a flower strip at the site, and increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity independently of site type (flower strip vs. control). In contrast, adjacent to the flower strips, reproductive success declined with increasing landscape heterogeneity, resulting in a positive net effect of adjacent flower strips in homogeneous landscapes and a negative effect in heterogeneous landscapes. Our results show that while decreasing landscape heterogeneity may impair pollination in homogeneous landscapes, this can be locally mitigated by sowing flower strips. However, in heterogeneous landscapes, flower strips may instead reduce pollination of adjacent plants.

AB  - Large carnivores have historically been decreasing worldwide, often as a result of human-carnivore conflicts. However, large carnivores are recovering throughout Europe, and European management scenarios can provide important insights into broad issues related to human-large carnivore existence. After becoming almost extinct in Sweden during the mid-19th century the Swedish grey wolf (Canis lupus) population has now recovered. Current national wolf management aims to promote distribution shifts from the current areas in central Sweden, potentially also into a previously exempt reindeer husbandry area. Prior wolf re-introductions have highlighted the necessity of pro-active management for colonization success. Identification of likely range expansion areas could therefore be paramount for a successful Swedish wolf management. We characterized the demographic and spatial progression of Swedish wolves during 2001-2015 and used a MaxEnt approach to species distribution models to identify potential range expansion areas. The Swedish wolf population had expanded from 10 to almost 60 reproductions or territorial pairs, and increased in both range size and density. Our distribution models suggested that Swedish wolf management may face trade-offs between costs of hosting wolves in densely populated areas in southern Sweden with cattle and sheep and the costs of allowing wolves to expand into reindeer husbandry areas with associated cultural and economic consequences. Spatially explicit data on the economic, social and cultural factors associated with wolf conflict and acceptance may be paramount for developing optimal management strategies in the face of such a trade-off.

AB  - In managed forests, leaving retention trees during final harvesting has globally become a common approach to reconciling the often conflicting goals of timber production and safeguarding biodiversity and delivery of several ecosystem services. In Finland, the dominant certification scheme requires leaving low levels of retention that can benefit some specific species. However, species responses are dependent on the level of retention and the current low amounts of retention clearly do not provide the habitat quality and continuity needed for declining and red-listed forest species which are dependent on old living trees and coarse woody debris. Several factors contribute to this situation. First, the ecological benefits of the current low retention levels are further diminished by monotonous standwise use of retention, resulting in low variability of retention habitat at the landscape scale. Second, the prevailing timber-oriented management thinking may regard retention trees as an external cost to be minimized, rather than as part of an integrated approach to managing the ecosystem for specific goals. Third, the main obstacles of development may still be institutional and policy-related. The development of retention practices in Finland indicates that the aim has not been to use ecological understanding to attain specific ecological sustainability goals, but rather to define the lowest level of retention that still allows access to the market. We conclude that prevailing retention practices in Finland currently lack ecological credibility in safeguarding biodiversity and they should urgently be developed based on current scientific knowledge to meet ecological sustainability goals.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (deadwood) serves as a dwelling space for many rare species, and is therefore a most important factor to ensure diversity in forest ecosystems. However, wood from forest ecosystems is also needed for construction and heating. Therefore, a forest enterprise has to simultaneously incorporate the provision of suitable habitats, as well as the production of wood into their long-term management plans. If the owner wants to fulfil such multiple objectives in an effective way, the providing of ecosystem services can be included in economic planning. Applying computer aided robust optimization techniques, we optimized the provision of deadwood for two exemplary enterprises in East Bavaria, Germany. The results show that high amounts of deadwood provision can cause severe opportunity costs for the forest owner. These costs highly depend on the tree species, the sorting strategy and the time horizon, in which the deadwood objective is reached. Low deadwood targets up to 5m(3) ha(-1) can be provided most cost-effectively with crown material, while higher targets (20m(3) ha(-1) and more) are better achieved with heavy timber grades or the provision of total trees. The novelty of our research is the inclusion of deadwood targets in a risk-considering optimization tool on enterprise level. Instead of calculating the economic loss of commercially not-used timber assortments we show a way of deriving the impact of such decisions at stand level on the economic performance of the whole forest enterprise. We were able to derive optimized opportunity costs. These costs can be used as guidelines for necessary incentives to encourage forest owners to incorporate the provision of deadwood into their management.

AB  - The increased pressure on the marine ecosystems highlights the need for policies and integrated approaches for sustainable management of coastal areas. Spatial planning based on geographic information of human activities, ecological structures and functions, and their associated goods and services is a fundamental component in this context. Here, we evaluate the potential of predictive modeling to provide spatial data on one ecosystem function, mussel growth for use in such processes. We developed a methodology based on statistical modeling, spatial prediction, and mapping for the relative growth of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. We evaluated the performance of different modeling techniques and classification schemes using empirical measurements of growth from 144 sampling sites and data on biological, chemical, and physical predictors. Following comparisons of the different techniques and schemes, we developed random forest models to predict growth along the Swedish west coast. Implemented into GIS the best model produced in this study predicts that low, intermediate, and high growth rates can be expected in 53%, 32%, and 15% of modeled area, respectively. The results of this study also suggest that the nature and quality of predictor data hold the key to improving the predictive power of models. On a more general note, this study exemplifies a feasible approach based on measuring, modeling, and mapping for obtaining scientifically based spatial information on ecosystem functions and services affected by a complex set of factors. Such information is fundamental for maritime spatial planning and ecosystem-based management and its importance is likely to increase in the future. Because of its close link to nutrient assimilation and production yield, site-specific information of soft tissue growth such as the map of predicted growth rate developed in this study can be used as a tool for optimizing actions aimed at mitigating eutrophication and aquaculture operations and in maritime spatial planning processes of coastal areas.

The contextual background is one of increasing conflict with the public welfare services reported by the media and by users. Public employees are unskilled in restorative practices, and the Norwegian mediation service is not adapted to Sami conditions. We initiated an innovative process to test whether the Norwegian Mediation Service methodology could be used to resolve disputes concerning reindeer herding and whether this cooperation may contribute to mediation methods adapted to Sami societies.

AB  - Farmers may promote the cultivation of under-sown cover crops (CCs) in various ways without jeopardizing the yield of a cash crop. With this survey, we aimed to understand how Finnish farmers manage possible challenges with under-sown CCs. A farmer survey was carried out in 2021. We invited 6493 farmers who had selected CCs as a registered measure to answer a questionnaire with 20 statements (a Likert scale), and 1130 responded (17.4%). A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to measure the strength of the association between 11 farm/farmer characteristics of the respondents and 20 statements. Responses indicated that farmers often took under-sown CCs into account during the growing season. Sowing was considered an especially critical measure and the CC seeding rate was often assessed with a test run before sowing. Thirty-nine per cent of the respondents had made investments, most often to facilitate sowing. The farmers usually adjusted the fertilizer rate only according to the cash crop. Early harvesting of a cash crop was considered important by 58% of farmers to ensure that the CCs do not hamper the harvest. Farmers harvested cash crops as soon as they matured and were harvestable, though they had mixed views on whether CCs impacted the quality of the cash crop. Subsidized, investing farmers were likely to be oriented towards the benefits from the ecosystem services provided by CCs. Their experiences should be shared among the farming community to support the large-scale implementation of CCs.

AB  - Ongoing urban expansion may degrade natural resources, ecosystems, and the services they provide to human societies, e.g., through land use and water changes and feedbacks. In order to control and minimize such negative impacts of urbanization, best practices for sustainable urban development must be identified, supported, and reinforced. To accomplish this, assessment methods and tools need to consider the couplings and feedbacks between social and ecological systems, as the basis for improving the planning and management of urban development. Collaborative efforts by academics, urban planners, and other relevant actors are also essential in this context. This will require relevant methods and tools for testing and projecting scenarios of coupled social-ecological system (CSES) behavior, changes, and feedbacks, in support of sustainable development of growing cities. This paper presents a CSES modeling approach that can provide such support, by coupling socio-economically driven land use changes and associated hydrological changes. The paper exemplifies and tests the applicability of this approach for a concrete case study with relevant data availability, the Tyresan catchment in Stockholm County, Sweden. Results show that model integration in the approach can reveal impacts of urbanization on hydrological and water resource, and the implications and feedbacks for urban societies and ecosystems. The CSES approach introduces new model challenges, but holds promise for improved model support towards sustainable urban development.

AB  - Climate change will further constrain water availability in dry inner-alpine environments and affect water relations and growth conditions in mountain forests, including the widespread larch forests. To estimate the effects of climate conditions on water balance and growth, variation in sap flow and stem radius of European larch was measured for 3yr along an elevation transect from 1070 to 2250m above sea level (asl) in an inner-alpine dry valley in South Tyrol/Italy. Additionally, long-term climate-growth relations were derived from tree cores. Sap flow and radial growth were reduced in dry periods up to an elevation of 1715m, leading to maximum annual growth at 2000m. In a wet year no growth difference between elevations was observed. Long-term tree ring data showed a positive growth response to precipitation up to 1715m and to temperature only above 2000m. Our results demonstrate that reduced water availability and higher atmospheric water demand limit larch at low elevation within dry Alpine regions. This indicates a general upward shift of this species' elevational amplitude upon climate change, and respective negative effects on future silvicultural use and ecosystem services at lower elevations in the European Alps.

AB  - Soil biodiversity plays a key role in regulating the processes that underpin the delivery of ecosystem goods and services in terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural intensification is known to change the diversity of individual groups of soil biota, but less is known about how intensification affects biodiversity of the soil food web as a whole, and whether or not these effects may be generalized across regions. We examined biodiversity in soil food webs from grasslands, extensive, and intensive rotations in four agricultural regions across Europe: in Sweden, the UK, the Czech Republic and Greece. Effects of land-use intensity were quantified based on structure and diversity among functional groups in the soil food web, as well as on community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. We also elucidate land-use intensity effects on diversity of taxonomic units within taxonomic groups of soil fauna. We found that between regions soil food web diversity measures were variable, but that increasing land-use intensity caused highly consistent responses. In particular, land-use intensification reduced the complexity in the soil food webs, as well as the community-weighted mean body mass of soil fauna. In all regions across Europe, species richness of earthworms, Collembolans, and oribatid mites was negatively affected by increased land-use intensity. The taxonomic distinctness, which is a measure of taxonomic relatedness of species in a community that is independent of species richness, was also reduced by land-use intensification. We conclude that intensive agriculture reduces soil biodiversity, making soil food webs less diverse and composed of smaller bodied organisms. Land-use intensification results in fewer functional groups of soil biota with fewer and taxonomically more closely related species. We discuss how these changes in soil biodiversity due to land-use intensification may threaten the functioning of soil in agricultural production systems.

AB  - Energy crops are a new player in the traditional agricultural landscape. The present paper analyses the land uses surrounding and the spatial characteristics of the main energy crops in Sweden (willow, poplar, hybrid aspen and reed canary grass) compared to traditional agricultural crops during the period 2006-2018. Spatial metrics (number of shape characterising points, shape index and rectangularity ratio) are calculated for each field, as well as the nearby land uses at varying distances, at radius: 500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m and 5000 m. A total of 1560 energy crop fields are studied in the 2006 dataset and 3416 fields in the 2018 dataset, which are compared to 58,246 fields with cereal crops in 2006 and 131,354 fields in the 2018 dataset. Results show that, despite being established on previous agricultural land, energy crops present a different spatial profile compared to traditional agricultural crops. Field shapes present less complexity than before, and the overall spatial features become more regular with time in both cases of energy crops and cereals, suggesting an increasing trend in cost-efficient agricultural practices and planning. Important differences concerning land use diversity at different scales are found between plantations versus grasses. In general, willow plantations are located in agriculture-dominated areas (> 70% at 500 m, > 50% at 2000 m), whereas reed canary grass is in forest-dominated landscapes (> 30% at 500 m, > 60% at 2000 m); both contribute to diversifying existing land uses although with varying effects. The results of this study are a basis to assess the impacts of energy crops at landscape level and can translate into applications in energy policy and planning.

AB  - Most economic valuation studies of species derive from stated preferences methods. These methods fail to take into account biodiversity values that the general public is not (made) informed about or has no experience with. Hence, production function (PF) and replacement cost (RC) approaches to valuation may be preferable in situations where species perform key life support functions in ecosystems, such as seed dispersal, pollination, or pest regulation. We conduct an RC analysis of the seed dispersal service performed by the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) in the Stockholm National Urban Park, Sweden. The park holds one of the largest populations of giant oaks in Europe, and the oak (Quercus robur and Quercus petrea) represents a keystone species in the hemiboreal forests. The primary objective was to estimate the number of seed-dispersed oak trees that resulted from jays and to determine the costs of replacing this service though human means. Results show that depending upon seeding or planting technique chosen, the RC per pair of jays in the park is SEK 35,000 (USD 4900) and SEK 160,000 (USD 22,500), respectively. Based on the park's aggregated oak forest-area, average RC for natural oak forest regeneration by jays is SEK 15,000 (USD 2100) to SEK 67,000 (USD 9400) per hectare, respectively. These estimates help motivating investments in management strategies that secure critical breeding and foraging habitats of jays, including coniferous forests and jay movement corridors. The analysis also illustrates the need for detailed ecological-economic knowledge in a PF or RC analysis. The continuous temporal and spatial oak dispersal service provided by jays holds several benefits compared to a man-made replacement of this service. PF and RC approaches are particularly motivated in cases of known functional ecological relationships, and critically important in estimating management measures where mobile link organisms and keystone species form key mutual relationships that generate high biodiversity benefits. In relation to obtained results, we discuss insights for conducting valuation studies on particular species. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The sustainable management of urban greenery consists, among others, of the inventory, valuation, and protection of trees of monumental size. This article presents the results of the inspection of 13 large trees growing in the city of Sandomierz, located in south-eastern Poland. The examined specimens belong to five species: Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.), common ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), white poplar (Populus alba L.), English oak (Quercus robur L.), and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.). The health condition of the trees was assessed using acoustic and electrical tomography, as well as chlorophyll fluorescence tests. Diagnostics employing sound waves and electrical resistivity were crucial in assessing tree health. The data based on chlorophyll fluorescence confirmed the results obtained during tomographic examinations. It was an innovative combination of three non-invasive methods of examining the health condition of trees and their valuation. Economic valuation allows us to reduce to common denominator issues that are often difficult to decide due to different perspectives-expressing the economic value of trees. Calculating the value of trees allowed us to show the city's inhabitants the value of trees that are of monumental size. Thanks to the cooperation of scientists with the city authorities, an economic plan for trees of monumental size was created, distinguished by an individualized and holistic approach to each specimen covered by the study. The database prepared has a chance to become an effective management instrument used by environmental protection authorities and a source of knowledge and education for the city's inhabitants.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are increasingly used to facilitate both rigorous analysis and stakeholder involvement in natural and water resource planning. Decision-making in that context is often complex and multi-faceted with numerous trade-offs between social, environmental and economic impacts. However, practical applications of decision-support methods are often too technically oriented and hard to use, understand or interpret for all participants. The learning of participants in these processes is seldom examined, even though successful deliberation depends on learning. This paper analyzes the potential of an interactive MCDA framework, the decision analysis interview (DAI) approach, for facilitating stakeholder involvement and learning in groundwater management. It evaluates the results of the MCDA process in assessing land-use management alternatives in a Finnish esker aquifer area where conflicting land uses affect the groundwater body and dependent ecosystems. In the assessment process, emphasis was placed on the interactive role of the MCDA tool in facilitating stakeholder participation and learning. The results confirmed that the structured decision analysis framework can foster learning and collaboration in a process where disputes and diverse interests are represented. Computer-aided interviews helped the participants to see how their preferences affected the desirability and ranking of alternatives. During the process, the participants' knowledge and preferences evolved as they assessed their initial knowledge with the help of fresh scientific information. The decision analysis process led to the opening of a dialogue, showing the overall picture of the problem context and the critical issues for the further process.

AB  - Trees and other vegetation have been advocated as a mitigation measure for urban air pollution mainly due to the fact that they passively filter particles from the air. However, mounting evidence suggests that vegetation may also worsen air quality by slowing the dispersion of pollutants and by producing volatile organic compounds that contribute to formation of ozone and other secondary pollutants. We monitored nanoparticle (>10 nm) counts along distance gradients away from major roads along paired transects across open and forested landscapes in Baltimore (USA), Helsinki (Finland) and Shenyang (China) - i.e. sites in three biomes with different pollution levels - using condensation particle counters. Mean particle number concentrations averaged across all sampling sites were clearly reduced (15%) by the presence of forest cover only in Helsinki. For Baltimore and Shenyang, levels showed no significant difference between the open and forested transects at any of the sampling distances. This suggests that nanoparticle deposition on trees is often counterbalanced by other factors, including differing flow fields and aerosol processes under varying meteorological conditions. Similarly, consistent differences in high frequency data patterns between the transects were detected only in Helsinki. No correlations between nanoparticle concentrations and solar radiation or local wind speed as affecting nanoparticle abundances were found, but they were to some extent associated with canopy closure. These data add to the accumulating evidence according to which trees do not necessarily improve air quality in near-road environments. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Hydropower accounts for 60% of Sweden's electrical supply, with hundreds of rivers dammed across the country. However, the impacts of these dams on stream biodiversity and ecosystem processes, such as litter decomposition or algal growth, have been poorly researched. Such processes underpin key ecosystem services delivered from freshwater environments, including provision of food and clean water and the mitigation of pollutants. To address these deficiencies, we assessed physico-chemical, community and functional responses along a hydromorphological gradient. We selected 10 streams from Western Sweden ranging from unregulated to strongly regulated by hydropower dams. The sites were characterised based on land use, water chemistry, riparian vegetation and hydrogeomorphological data, including discharge changes, the extent of ditching and channelization. A PCA on these variables allowed us to extract a first component used as a representative of the stream regulation gradient. Community structural variables include richness and Shannon diversity of four taxonomic groups (diatoms, invertebrates, macrophytes, fish), while functional responses include litter decomposition and algal productivity. Initial analyses indicate relatively strong functional responses along the gradient: variability in litter decomposition and algal growth rates decrease as hydroelectric regulation increase. However, there is little consistency among the taxonomic groups along the gradient: fish richness decreased while macrophyte and invertebrate abundances were the lowest at intermediate level of disturbance. These results would provide an additional dimension in the bioassessment of human impacts on aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Wood pastures are some of the most species-rich environments found in Europe and therefore essential habitats for biodiversity conservation. Society also puts faith in multiple values of trees, ranging from climate change mitigation to socio-cultural traditions. Therefore, the seemingly arbitrary tree density limit for pasture environments imposed by the EU through its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) threatened both biological and societal values. In this study on farmers' perspectives, we target the effects of the CAP tree density limit on management of wood pastures in a low-intensively managed agricultural landscape of southern Sweden. The case of simplifying nature by using simple number limitations was used as an entry point in semi-structured, open-ended, interviews with farmers and officials about their view on trees and pasture management in relation to policy directives. The interviews showed that the policy incentive shifted the management focus from grazing quality to the number of trees and that farmers are willing to cut in order to get subsidies and timber revenues, however not unreflectingly. Farmers had high knowledge about the wide ranging social, cultural and natural values of trees, and are often themselves as good regulators of tree management as policies intend to be. Our study reveals many difficulties in managing the complex relations within landscapes with simplified legal measures, opening up for further discussion about improving policy instruments to preserve both social and biological values of wood pastures. However, although the tree density limit has been criticised on many points related to biodiversity conservation, this study shows that other values linked to pasture trees, e.g. the aesthetic values and their importance as shelter for grazing animals, could be an argument to actually keep the focus on trees as indicators of pasture management quality. We suggest that trees in general and wood-pastures in particular therefore are good starting points, or boundary-objects, for collaboration between production and conservation interests of farming and environmental management.

AB  - Management of urban trees is key to sustaining and increasing essential ecosystem services, and most management decisions are made based on urban tree inventories. Vitality is one of the key parameters when conducting tree inventories. However, consensus on how vitality should be assessed is lacking, and there is limited understanding of how visual vitality assessments are affected by aspects of different professional background, growing sites and tree age. In a Delphi study with 19 participants completing the whole study, we asked urban foresters and ecologists to assess the vitality of 21 trees in urban and rural settings and to rate how important 40 different parameters were for their assessment of each tree's vitality. The data obtained were analysed using Cronbach's alpha, unconstrained ordination, hierarchal clustering and indicator values. In testing for differences, mixed general linear models and constrained ordination were used. Professionals participating in the study showed good overall agreement in ranking trees as more or less vital, but with large differences in what was considered a fully vital tree. When performing vitality assessments, the parameters used differed between old and young trees, and between urban and rural sites. There was also a systematic difference between urban foresters and ecologists in performing tree vitality assessments, with ecologists consistently rating tree vitality higher and using fewer parameters. Parameters used for assessing vitality comprised aspects relating to sign of decay, external damage, loss/death of biomass, growth performance and site conditions. Vitality should thus be regarded as a complex parameter that needs calibration-based assessment approaches and the person performing the assessment should always be included as an additional variable. Overall, this study clearly showed the need to establish consensus on how tree vitality should be assessed and rated.

AB  - In northern Sweden, forestry and reindeer husbandry overlap spatially and judicially. To mitigate conflicting objectives regarding land use, the concept of "samrad" has been introduced as a form of institutional arrangement of environmental politics. This study explores how stakeholders have interpreted this concept and corresponding processes from its first introduction in 1923 to 2019. Language, including the cartographic language, is regarded as a mean for argumentation. Results show that the understandings and expectations of samrad differ among actors in terms of procedure, issues, efficiency and outcomes. As compared to the lexical definition and understanding, the samrad practice has merely become an instrument for information exchange before decisions are made, rather than a functional arrangement for conflict mitigation. This ambiguity is in parallel to a deregulated forest policy and a watered-down meaning of samrad in public administration. However, the transformative potential of participatory mapping suggests a new way of thinking about power relations in land use matters within the framework of samrad.

AB  - AimsTo apply the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) to pollen count data from multiple sites to estimate local vegetation abundance and compare with charcoal-derived records of burning.
   LocationExmoor, southwest England, UK.
   MethodsPollen count data from 16 sites were transformed to estimates of distance-weighted vegetation abundance using the LRA (REVEALS and LOVE models), correcting for bias in pollen production and dispersal. Charcoal concentration data from six sites were normalized using Box-Cox transformation to produce z-scores. Moving-window correlation was undertaken to compare pollen percentage values for key taxa (Calluna, Poaceae) and localized burning. Estimates of distance-vegetation abundance (LRA output) and time-averaged charcoal z-scores were compared to assess the role of burning as a driver for upland vegetation cover.
   ResultsComparison of pollen percentage and normalized charcoal z-scores show little correlation between vegetation cover and burning. Estimates of distance-weighted vegetation abundance and normalized charcoal data show relationships between vegetation change and burning at four of the six sites. The relationships are site-specific: three sites suggest burning promoted grass-dominated vegetation, at one site burning promoted heather-dominated vegetation, and in two sites there is no apparent relationship.
   ConclusionsThe patterning of vegetation within uplands is a crucial part of ecosystem service delivery, and contemporary and future management benefits from understanding of long-term' development, i.e. patterns over millennia. The correction of biases within pollen production and dispersal to produce local vegetation estimates has demonstrated spatial heterogeneity in vegetation cover on Exmoor that is not otherwise evident in the pollen percentage data (which retain a strong influence of the regional vegetation cover). The relationship between LRA-derived vegetation cover and burning is not apparent in comparisons between pollen percentage data and charcoal records. This implies that studies that use pollen proportional data alone can misrepresent the relationship between vegetation cover and fire. This study demonstrates that fire has been an important part of the development of this cultural landscape.

AB  - Resilient ecosystems provide natural insurance value, or resilience value, to the landowner and to society at large. In response to global calls for integrating biodiversity in sector policy and planning, we analysed the specified resilience value by simulating three storm regimes and five management scenarios: Business As Usual/BAU (spruce-dominance), Spruce Monoculture, More Broadleaves, Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF), and No Thinnings. The forest decision support system Heureka RegWise was used to simulate the effects of storms on forest dynamics and Net Present Value (NPV). No Thinnings, CCF and More Broadleaves were more resilient to storms (reduced damage cost) compared to BAU. BAU had the highest NPV only if storms are ignored, a common assumption in today's forest planning. Given storms, No Thinnings maximises NPV on landscape level. On the 20% most vulnerable plots the NPV was much higher for No Thinnings and slightly higher for CCF and More Broadleaves, compared to BAU. CCF and More Broadleaves also provide nature-based solutions (co-benefits) including public goods. However, forestry adaptations to storms are slow in Sweden, in contrast to e.g. German state forestry which emphasises maximising tree growth and resilience to several stresses and disturbances rather than NPV optimisation.

AB  - Forests are increasingly managed both to provide a sustainable yield of timber and for supplying a range of ecosystem services in line with the concept of sustainable forest management. Several incommensurable interests must then be considered, and it is necessary to strike a balance between different objectives. In evaluation of trade-offs to be made, both objective factors and subjective values need to be taken into account. In recent years, continuous cover forestry (CCF) has been put forward as an alternative to even-aged forestry. The aim of this study was to use scenario analysis in combination with multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate whether CCF is a suitable strategy based on the decision makers' objectives and preferences for sustainable forest management in a specific landscape. This approach was applied to a planning case on the forest estate of the Linkoping municipality in southwestern Sweden. The scenario analyses provided insights into relevant quantitative factors, while the MCDA evaluation helped in clarifying the objectives of the forest management and in assessing the relative importance of various objectives. The scenario analyses showed that in this case CCF is a good management strategy in ecological and social terms but yields worse economic outcomes than conventional even-aged forestry. In the Linkoping case, there was a relatively strong emphasis on ecological and social aspects and thus, in summary, CCF seemed to be the most suitable option.

AB  - Worldwide urbanisation emphasises the importance of planning for cities that sustain and promote the wellbeing of their residents. The planning of a living environment that supports well-being requires both intersectoral cooperation between policy sectors and interaction between researchers and practitioners. With 12 case studies (of 11 Finnish municipalities and one city region), we provide a description of a knowledge co-production process originating from the use of a new planning-support tool called StrateGIS that can be used for discovering built-environment indicators for integrated planning for well-being. Based on spatial multi-criteria analysis, we also investigate how the tool fostered intersectoral discussion among practitioners during the process. Practitioner knowledge was merged with scientific knowledge at different stages of the process: in structuring the value tree, in setting the objectives, in selecting the criteria and in defining the spatial representation for each criterion. Intersectoral discussion during the process was seen as fruitful and relatively easy despite the different types of expertise present in the workshops. Based on our results, the local experts specialised in spatial data have an intermediary role between practitioners since they can build understanding of how data is translated into spatial information when using a spatial planning-support tool.

AB  - In Finland, privately owned nature areas are widely used for recreation due to open public access. However, since landowners are not obligated to take everyman's rights into consideration when making management decisions, the recreational quality of nature areas is not guaranteed for users. We examined whether individual recreationists on private lands would be willing purchase management actions from landowners that influence recreational quality. In addition to willingness to pay, we assessed willingness to contribute labor to such actions. The results demonstrated that about half of the recreationists who participated in our survey were willing to contribute labor and about 10% were willing to pay to direct the management of their typical recreation site on private lands. The mean willingness to pay was 92 euros per year and the mean willingness to contribute labor 3.5 days per year. A latent class regression model revealed that recreationists were not, however, completely homogeneous in their preferences for the actions or in their preferred contribution forms. On the basis of the results, there is moderate demand from recreationists for management to improve recreational quality and the potential for local landscape management arrangements that allow individual recreationists to contribute labor.

AB  - Many apex predator populations are recolonizing old areas and dispersing to new ones, with potential consequences for their prey species and for livestock. An increasing population of the White-tailed Eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) has settled north of the Arctic Circle in northern Finland, mainly at two big water reservoirs but also in areas with mainly terrestrial habitat. We examined nesting habitat preferences and prey use of White-tailed Eagles in this environment, where reindeer husbandry is a traditional livelihood and concerns are rising that the growing White-tailed Eagle population poses a threat to reindeer calves. Lakes, peat bogs, and marshlands were preferred habitats in the nesting territories. Fish constituted 64.3% of the identified prey items, with birds accounting for 28.5% and mammals 7.2%. The nesting territory habitat within a 10 km radius and the latitude influenced the prey composition at both the group and species level. The occurrence of reindeer calves as prey increased with latitude but was not associated with any habitat. Knowledge of the diet and territory preferences can be used to predict future dispersal and local prey use of this species. Nesting White-tailed Eagles do not seem to pose a threat to traditional reindeer herding, but further research is needed regarding non-breeding sub-adults and whether the White-tailed Eagles actually kill reindeer calves or simply exploit their carcasses.

AB  - In a north European context, identifying invasive species is far from trivial because the vegetation has been influenced by human activities for thousands of years. New species have immigrated continuously since the end of the last glaciation, both spontaneously and through direct or indirect help by man. Still, newly immigrated species may be problematic in a nature conservation context and may harm biodiversity, and cause changes in ecosystem services. In this study, all 721 presently established vascular plant and bryophyte taxa known to have been introduced to, or to have immigrated to, Sweden since the year 1700 are assessed for their invasive potential. The assessment is based on six components considered relevant for their invasiveness: 1) ability to compete in natural vegetation, 2) ability to form dense populations, 3) realized dispersal ability, 4) gene flow to native relatives, 5) time since immigration and 6) distance to their native range. Although the relative importance of these components is context dependent, a compound general index of invasive concern is proposed and calculated for all taxa. The index of invasive concern is validated by comparing it to assessments by a Bayesian Belief Network in which the influences of the same six components are assigned by expert opinions. In addition, rough estimates of the present-day abundance of each taxon in Sweden are presented. The origin, biology and possible impact of the 150 taxa with the highest index values are discussed. Based on the index of invasive concern, Campylopus introflexus, Epilobium adenocaulon, E. ciliatum, Rosa rugosa, Lamiastrum galeobdolon subsp. argentatum, Orthodontium lineare, Solidago canadensis, Calystegia sepium subsp. spectabilis, Rubus armeniacus and Prunus serotina are identified as the ten most problematic alien vascular plant and bryophyte taxa in Sweden.

AB  - Sustainable management of contaminated sediments requires careful prioritization of available resources and focuses on efforts to optimize decisions that consider environmental, economic, and societal aspects simultaneously. This may be achieved by combining different analytical approaches such as risk analysis (RA), life cycle analysis (LCA), multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and economic valuation methods. We propose the use of stochastic MCDA based on outranking algorithms to implement integrative sustainability strategies for sediment management. In this paper we use the method to select the best sediment management alternatives for the dibenzo-p-dioxin and -furan (PCDD/F) contaminated Grenland fjord in Norway. In the analysis, the benefits of health risk reductions and socio-economic benefits from removing seafood health advisories are evaluated against the detriments of remedial costs and life cycle environmental impacts. A value-plural based weighing of criteria is compared to criteria weights mimicking traditional cost-effectiveness (CEA) and cost-benefit (CBA) analyses. Capping highly contaminated areas in the inner or outer fjord is identified as the most preferable remediation alternative under all criteria schemes and the results are confirmed by a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology can serve as a flexible framework for future decision support and can be a step toward more sustainable decision making for contaminated sediment management. It may be applicable to the broader field of ecosystem restoration for trade-off analysis between ecosystem services and restoration costs.

AB  - In recent decades, human-Rangifer (reindeer and caribou) interactions have increasingly been studied from a scientific perspective. Many of the studies have examined Norwegian wild reindeer or caribou in North America. It is often questioned whether results from these studies can be applied to reindeer in managed herds, as these animals have been exposed to domestication and are also more used to humans. In order to examine the domesticated reindeer's reactions to various disturbance sources, we reviewed 18 studies of the effects of human activity and infrastructure on 12 populations of domesticated reindeer and compared these to studies on wild reindeer and caribou; based on this, we discuss the effects of domestication and tameness on reindeer responses to anthropogenic disturbance. We also consider the relevance of spatial and temporal scales and data collection methods when evaluating the results of these studies. The reviewed studies showed that domesticated reindeer exhibit avoidance behaviours up to 12 km away from infrastructure and sites of human activity and that the area they avoid may shift between seasons and years. Despite a long domestication process, reindeer within Sami reindeer-herding systems exhibit similar patterns of large-scale avoidance of anthropogenic disturbance as wild Rangifer, although the strength of their response may sometimes differ. This is not surprising since current Sami reindeer husbandry represents an extensive form of pastoralism, and the reindeer are not particularly tame. To obtain a true picture of how reindeer use their ranges, it is of fundamental importance to study the response pattern at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to the reindeer, whether domesticated or wild.

AB  - To conceptualize the violence of the Nordic states in the Arctic, this article provides a spatial analysis of relationships between Norway, Sweden, and Finland and the Sami and reindeer inhabiting their northern parts. The analysis is informed by Deleuze and Guattari's concepts of smooth and striated space and examines how the Nordic states, through their striation activities, are perpetrating violence toward nomadic forms of life. Rather than casting the spatial relationships between states and reindeer herders as "land use conflicts," the article shifts the focus from competing activities to violence toward one form of life perpetrated by another. Tracing state efforts of bordering, rationalization of reindeer herding as an industry, infrastructure developments, and cultivation of selected predatory lines of flight, the article illuminates an indirect violence that is slowly eliminating nomadic forms of life. This loss highlights that in the sixth great extinction, the world is losing not only distinct biological species but also different forms of life within species. Ultimately, the striation activities of the biopolitical Nordic states, in their narrow focus on Western knowledge regimes, security, profit, and geopolitical positioning for an impending Arctic resource boom, enact a violent and destructive homogenization of what constitutes life.

AB  - Respecting connections between the diversity of values and forms of knowledge is essential to support a decision-making that fosters relationships between ecosystems and people. However, little theory has been developed for clarifying interactions between values and knowledge, and their relevance for environmental policy. We surfaced the overlooked relationship between values and knowledge by studying individual cognitive and emotional processes during a guided visioning exercise in the context of the multifunctional landscapes of Ostergotland, Sweden. We investigated these cognitive processes using 30 semi-structured interviews and questionnaires organized around three types of relationships: vision. values, vision. knowledge, and especially values. knowledge. The analysis of the relationship between vision and values reveals that all types of values including core human values, relational, and intrinsic values are important in shaping the decision-making context in which landscape management visions arise. The relationship between vision and knowledge uncovers the mix of experiential and theoretical knowledge that informs the decisionmaking context. Interviews unfold three modalities in terms of how values and knowledge relate: i) linked and not necessarily connected (e.g. when individuals perceive a high conflict between their knowledge and their values leading to one construct silencing the other); ii) mutually reinforcing (e.g. when values and knowledge are seen as feeding into one another); and iii) intertwined (e.g. when individuals perceive that values and knowledge can co-exist). We discuss our findings in the context of their relevance for a collaborative decision-making process for balancing consensus and dissensus in multifunctional landscapes.

AB  - We analyze the emergence of an adaptive co-management system for wetland landscape governance in southern Sweden, a process where unconnected management by several actors in the landscape was mobilized, renewed, and reconfigured into ecosystem management within about a decade. Our analysis highlights the social mechanisms behind the transformation toward ecosystem management. The self-organizing process was triggered by perceived threats among members of various local stewardship associations and local government to the area's cultural and ecological values. These threats challenged the development of ecosystem services in the area. We show how one individual, a key leader, played an instrumental role in directing change and transforming governance. The transformation involved three phases: 1) preparing the system for change, 2) seizing a window of opportunity, and 3) building social-ecological resilience of the new desired state. This local policy entrepreneur initiated trust-building dialogue, mobilized social networks with actors across scales, and started processes for coordinating people, information flows and ongoing activities, and for compiling and generating knowledge, understanding, and management practices of ecosystem dynamics. Understanding, collaborative learning, and creating public awareness were part of the process. A comprehensive framework was developed with a shared vision and goals that presented conservation as development, turned problems into possibilities, and contributed to a shift in perception among key actors regarding the values of the wetland landscape. A window of opportunity at the political level opened, which made it possible to transform the governance system toward a trajectory of ecosystem management. The transformation involved establishing a new municipal organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). This flexible organization serves as a bridge between local actors and governmental bodies and is essential to the adaptive governance of the wetland landscape. It is also critical in navigating the larger sociopolitical and economic environment for resilience of the new social-ecological system. We conclude that social transformation is essential to move from a less desired trajectory to one where the capacity to manage ecosystems sustainably for human well-being is strengthened. Adaptability among actors is needed to reinforce and sustain the desired social-ecological state and make it resilient to future change and unpredictable events.

AB  - While previous socio-ecological systems research has shown relationships between local knowledge and the assignment of landscape values, the relationships between value assignment and more nuanced forms of local knowledge remain less understood. This study makes use of public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS), a method for identifying and mapping landscape attributes important to local communities. We use this method to assess the spatial associations between three landscape attributes often overlooked in the PPGIS literature: landscape values, self-reported knowledge about different types of landscape management practices and land-use types. We analyzed responses from residents of Mjolby kommun, Sweden (n = 301) using Monte Carlo simulations and density-based clustering. Overall, we found stronger spatial associations between landscape values and land-use types compared with landscape values and self-reported knowledge about landscape management. For example, significant positive associations were found between aesthetic and recreation values and certain land-use types, but there was no association between these values and self-reported knowledge. The land-use type to which a landscape value is assigned is sometimes supported by self-reported knowledge (especially for underrepresented landscape values), while self-reported knowledge did not provide a conclusive pattern about value assignment on its own. We discuss the implications of using PPGIS in integrated landscape management for building multifunctionality in landscape management by addressing the values of different land-use stakeholders, and the potential benefits of increased inclusivity in forms of local knowledge.

AB  - Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an increasingly popular scheme to mitigate CO2 emissions from large point sources (IPCC 2005). Thermal power plants account for a large portion of the world's total CO2 emissions and are therefore the most attractive target for CCS. For a typical thermal power plant; the process would involve capturing the CO2, transporting it to a suitable location for storage and storing it in a manner that will ensure minimal leakage over a very long period of time. Due to public concerns and protests regarding storage onshore, offshore geological storage of CO2 is most likely to be used for future projects (Winden et al. 2011). The successful implementation of CCS thus depends on the feasibility of capturing the CO2, transporting it to an offshore site and injecting it deep beneath the seabed. Pilot projects such as the Sleipner rig in Norway have already proven the feasibility of using offshore geological storage and post combustion technology for capturing CO2 can also be considered mature. No long distance, large scale transportation solutions for CO2 has yet been proven to work with satisfactory results. Transportation of CO2 is thus identified as an area where breakthroughs could lead to forward leaps in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a study on a possible future way of solving CO2 transportation issues associated with the use of CCS.
   Geological storage locations are located in the sedimentary basins which is where oil and gas reserves are also found. The issue of transporting CO2 from an onshore power plant to an offshore storage site can thus be compared to the issue of transporting natural gas from an offshore extraction site to an onshore power plant or production facility. This is conventionally done using either ships or pipelines. This paper investigates the cost competitiveness of using the third alternative of Gas To Wire (GTW) where the gas is combusted offshore. This eliminates the need for transportation altogether and the concept has already been proven to be attractive for exploiting certain gas fields. It is shown here that the concept is even more attractive in a scenario where CCS is used since it eliminates two transportation issues. In this study, the transportation cost of natural gas and CO2 is compared to the costs of sub-sea High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) electrical cables and is shown to be higher. Pipelines have a large potential to be the most economical way of transporting CO2 to most prospective storage sites in the future (Winden et al. 2011) and will therefore be used to represent a conventional method of CO2 transportation in this study. For comparison, the alternative of transporting by ship or using a pipeline-ship combination will also be presented briefly. Initial studies show that the reduction in transportation costs compared to all conventional methods would more than offset the increased costs of operating a power plant offshore. It is also shown that the gains in transportation cost will decrease the Levelised Cost Of Energy (LCOE) for an example scenario located in Western Australia.

AB  - Rapid urbanisation and climate change have motivated the development of urban green infrastructure (UGI) as a planning strategy to support the wellbeing of urban people and ecosystems while parallel adapting cities to climate change. Forest (tree-covered areas > 0.5 ha) is a key UGI component that afford a wider range of ecosystem services and mitigate urban heat islands more effectively than non-wooded green spaces. However, understanding of spatial configurations (variation in patch size and frequency) of forests across the gradient of urbanisation and between cities is limited to case studies. This represents a considerable knowledge gap for identification of general patterns that can inform integration of forest resources in UGI planning that have value beyond the individual city level. In this study we used Geographic Information Systems to explore the spatial configuration of forests across cities located within landscapes characterised by different levels of anthropogenic modification (degree of forest cover) and socio-political contexts, i.e. all Danish and Swedish cities > 10,000 inhabitants (n = 176). We applied general linear modelling to investigate the relationship between forest cover, patch size and frequency with 1) regional landscape type, 2) demographic trends 1960-2010, and 3) the gradient of urbanisation (measured in three zones: urban core (0.2 km from city boundary), urban fringe (0.2-2 km), and urban periphery (2-5 km)). Regardless of demographic trends, forest cover was lowest in cities settled in large-scale agricultural regions, higher in regions with mosaics of forest and farming, and highest in forest-dominated regions. However, in all cities forest cover was lowest in the urban zone and peaked on the urban fringe rather than on the urban periphery. Furthermore, pocket woods (0.5-2 ha) accounted for over 50 % of patches in all three urban zones, irrespective of regional landscape type. We conclude by discussing how these general patterns could inform strategies for integration of urban forests in UGI planning.

AB  - Maintaining the provision of multiple forest ecosystem services requires to take into consideration forest sensitivity and adaptability to a changing environment. In this context, dynamic models are indispensable to assess the combined effects of management and climate change on forest dynamics. We evaluated the importance of implementing different approaches for simulating forest management in the climate-sensitive gap model ForClim and compared its outputs with forest inventory data at multiple sites across the European Alps. The model was then used to study forest dynamics in representative silver fir-European beech stands in the Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia) under current management and different climate scenarios. On average, ForClim accurately predicted the development of basal area and stem numbers, but the type of harvesting algorithm used and the information for stand initialization are key elements that must be defined carefully. Empirical harvesting functions that rigorously impose the number and size of stems to remove fail to reproduce stand dynamics when growth is just slightly under- or overestimated, and thus should be substituted by analytical thinning algorithms that are based on stochastic distribution functions. Long-term simulations revealed that both management and climate change negatively impact conifer growth and regeneration. Under current climate, most of the simulated stands were dominated by European beech at the end of the simulation (i.e., 2150 AD), due to the decline of silver fir and Norway spruce caused mainly by harvesting. This trend was amplified under climate change as growth of European beech was favored by higher temperatures, in contrast to drought-induced growth reductions in both conifers. This forest development scenario is highly undesired by local managers who aim at preserving conifers with high economic value. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining a considerable share of conifers in these forests may not be feasible under climate change, especially at lower elevations where foresters should consider alternative management strategies.

AB  - Kelp forests are productive coastal ecosystems that provide a range of ecosystem services. Mapping the distribution and area occupied by kelp forests is a critical step to identify their ecosystem functions and services, including their role in the carbon cycle, and to detect changes in their distribution. We compiled quantitative data of the dominant genera Laminaria and Saccharina across the Nordic region, allowing us to separate kelp forests (areas with dense or moderately dense kelp coverage) from occurrences of single or few individuals. By fitting boosted regression trees to the compiled data, we modelled and predicted the distribution of kelp forests across the Nordic region. Despite the large scale of the analyses, the models captured well the kelps' environmental affinities and predicted the presence of kelp forests with high accuracy. Dense kelp forests are found along the rocky shores of all the Nordic countries, except in the brackish Baltic Sea, with largest areas in Norway, Greenland and Iceland. The results of this study set the scene for future studies on the importance of kelp forests in the Nordic region, including their contribution to the marine carbon budget.

AB  - Hunting is a widespread but often overlooked land-use activity, providing major benefits to society. Hunting takes placein most landscapes, yet it remains unclear which types of landscapes foster or dampen hunting-related services, and how hunting relatesto other land uses. A better understanding of these relationships is key for sustainable land-use planning that integrates wildlifemanagement. This is particularly urgent for Europe, where wildlife populations are increasing. Focusing on Sweden, we explored thespatial associations among hunting, agriculture, and forestry to identify archetypical combinations of these land uses. Specifically, wecombined indicators on the extent and intensity of agriculture and forestry, with data on hunting bags for 63 game species using self-organizing maps, a non-parametric clustering approach. We identified 15 typical bundles of co-occurring land uses at the municipalitylevel across Sweden. The harvest of forest grouse, bears, and moose co-occurred with forestry in northern Sweden, whereas the harvestof small game, different deer species, and wild boar co-occurred with agriculture across southern Sweden, reflecting species' biology,environmental factors, and management. Our findings also highlight the strength of associations among hunting and other land uses.Importantly, we identified large areas in central Sweden where harvest of game was below average, possibly indicating that intensityof hunting is out of balance with that of agriculture or forestry, potentially fostering conflict between wildlife and land use. Collectively,our results suggest that (1) hunting should be considered a major land use that, in Sweden, is more widespread than agriculture andforestry; (2) land-use planning must therefore integrate wildlife management; and (3) such an integration should occur in a regionalizedmanner that considers social-ecological context. Our approach identifies a first spatial template within which such context-specificland-use planning, aiming at aligning wildlife and diverse land uses, can take places.

AB  - Urban forests provide opportunities for outdoor recreation to many people. Knowledge of the motives for visiting forests is needed for the planning and management of these forests. Since forests are used for a diverse set of recreational activities, however, the motives for different activities are multifaceted. To explore recreational motives, this scene preference study conducted in Sweden examined relations between setting evaluations (i.e., mystery, legibility, valence, and activation), setting preference, general forest perceptions, and intention to engage in forest activities. Two alternative models were examined in relation to five different activities: walking, going on outings, exercising, picking berries or mushrooms, and studying plants and animals. Results revealed that preference mediated between setting evaluations and intention to go on outings, whereas setting evaluations were direct predictors of intention to walk and exercise. However, the models did not describe antecedents of intention to pick berries or mushrooms, or to study plants and animals, satisfactorily. In addition, general forest perceptions, particularly emphasising the restorative qualities of forests, were important for intention to engage in all the examined recreation activities. Results are discussed in relation to landscape preference research and attitude-behaviour theory. In addition, practical implications for encouraging forest recreation are highlighted.

AB  - During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural grasslands have been highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50 km(2) in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K. arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species. Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.

AB  - The demand for wood-based energy is foreseen to grow as energy and climate policies around the world promote the use of bioenergy for climate change mitigation. However, the carbon impacts of forest bioenergy range widely in the literature. The value-choices made on the response of forest management to bioenergy demand have a major influence on the results obtained from modeling exercises and may actually change the contribution of forest bioenergy from climate worsening to climate change mitigation. Despite their relevance, there is very little information, or transparency, as to the empirical basis by which these assumptions are chosen and evaluated against.
   This study aims to fill in this crucial knowledge gap through a mix of critical review, analysis of historical statistical data, and expert judgement. Several prominent studies reporting climate change mitigation from forest bioenergy in three countries are reviewed: Canada, Sweden, and Southeast USA. This analysis shows that the studies rely on assumptions that bioenergy demand will spur supply responses aimed at more efficient forest management and/or relative increases in forest area. Confronting literature assumptions with trends in historical data, we present the most extensive reality-check of bioenergy literature assumptions to date.
   We find that studies projecting a large role of forest bioenergy in climate change mitigation rely on assumptions that are too optimistic, at times outright unrealistic.
   We believe scientists could avoid the misinterpretation of their results and improve the policy relevance of their work by more transparent reporting of: i) value-laden assumptions, ii) their influence on the results, iii) the process and rationale behind such assumptions, especially distinguishing between assumptions that reflect incremental changes in management from assumptions requiring transformational change in several industrial sectors.

AB  - While some species rapidly decline, compromising vital ecosystem services, others are stable or even increasing in abundance. We studied shifts in species richness and abundance of moths over five decades in Central Sweden and examined whether and how changes were associated with phenotypic traits. We combined information from captures in a light trap in historical time (the 1970s) and contemporarily (2019) with provincial colonisation records. Both community species richness and the abundance of moths increased between the time periods. A large fraction (38%) of the 410 species were not present in both periods, 101 species had colonised the area (an estimated influx of about 2.5 new species per year), and 51 species had disappeared (an estimated local extinction rate of about 1.16 species per year). Abundance increased with an increasing number of host plants and with increasing colour pattern variation. The composition of the community shifted towards species characterised by smaller wingspan and larger ranges. The functional trait variability of the moth community was homogenised from the historical to the contemporary period, in line with reports from other species communities in modern landscapes. However, our finding of a concomitant increase in species richness and total abundance differs from the results of many recent studies of insect communities in other geographic regions.Implication for insect conservationWe conclude that the entire boreal moth fauna is undergoing a substantial biogeographical shift, changing to the moth species historically occurring at more southern latitudes. The alterations in species composition, overall abundance, and community-wide trait distribution described here may cascade up and down in the ecosystem because moths are important pollinators, herbivores, and prey.

AB  - Pruning is a necessary part of tree management both in silvicultural systems and in urban forestry. For the wood industry's production of high-quality timber, as well as for the urban forest's risk reduction and ecosystem services enhancements, it is essential that the pruning is accurately implemented. This study aimed to determine the effect of pruning season on discoloration amount and occlusion rate in four broadleaved tree species. In 2014, 84 trees were pruned in January, May and September. Six years later, the 252 samples from the three pruning points per tree were collected and analysed. 'Common oak (Quercus robur L.)' and 'small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill.)' showed least discoloration when pruned in January, 'wild cherry (Prunus avium L.)' showed least discoloration when pruned in September and 'Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.)' did not show any significant differences. All species occluded fastest when pruned in January, but at different rates. Common oak occluded 84 per cent of the samples, Norway maple 42 per cent, small-leaved lime 32 per cent and wild cherry 13 per cent. In summary, the pruning month affected discoloration amounts and occlusion rates of the tested tree species in varied ways. Our research suggests an important knowledge gap regarding optimal species-specific pruning times and underlying reasons for different reactions to pruning.

AB  - Challenges facing agriculture and food supply in Nordic countries are unique to an ecoregion with short growing season, Limited arable Land, and tong distance from import suppliers. Among the Long-term challenges that will influence food availability in the region are scarcity of fossil fuels, changes in production conditions due to global warming, preserving ecosystem services in multifunctional rural Landscapes, fragility of national and regional subsidies, and recognition of food as a human right. Research on broad and critical topics is not simple, and often moves beyond the comfort zones of disciplinary scientists. Thesis projects are most valuable if they provide a growth and Learning experience for students and faculty as well as contribute in some way to resolving major issues that will impact food systems and quality of Life for people of the region. Most frequently, MSc and PhD student research projects address narrow questions for which methods are known and answers can be easily predicted. With Limited research funding this is a Luxury we cannot afford. Research and education programs should address high-priority issues in the agriculture and food sector, both broad and narrow, as well as on-farm production questions and constraints in Local food systems. Agroecology provides an organizing framework to set priorities and address critical issues regarding environmental impacts, alternative farming strategies, economics of production, and social viability of future farming and food systems. Limited budgets and human resources make it imperative that regional networks design coordinated efforts to identify and examine priority concerns for Long-term sustainability of farming and food systems. This is one goal of the network AGROASIS, a group of researchers and students who are Linked through the regional agroecology MSc education program centered in Norway and run by systems educators from five countries. The process of setting research priorities and seeking support is described.

AB  - Environmental and economic performance of forestry on drained peatlands was reviewed to consider whether continuous cover forestry (CCF) could be a feasible alternative to even-aged management (EM). CCF was regarded feasible particularly because continuously maintaining a tree stand with significant transpiration and interception capacity would decrease the need for ditch network maintenance. Managing CCF forests in such a way that the ground water levels are lower than in clear-cut EM forests but higher than in mature EM forests could decrease greenhouse gas emissions and negative water quality impacts caused both by anoxic redox reactions and oxidation and mineralization of deep peat layers. Regeneration studies indicated potential for satisfactory natural regeneration under CCF on drained peatlands. An economic advantage in CCF over EM is that fewer investments are needed to establish the forest stand and sustain its growth. Thus, even if the growth of trees in CCF forests were lower than in EM forests, CCF could at least in some peatland sites turn out to be a more profitable forest management regime. An advantage of CCF from the viewpoint of socially optimal forest management is that it plausibly reduces the negative externalities of management compared to EM. We propose that future research in drained peatland forests should focus on assessing the economic and environmental feasibility of CCF.

AB  - This study evaluated the potential of red clover as a sole diet for house crickets (Acheta domesticus, AD) and the effect of ensiling or drying red clover biomass on growth, survival and water consumption of AD. Wild AD were caught near Uppsala, Sweden, and reared in a climate-controlled room under a 12-h light regime. One day-old third-generation cricket nymphs (n=2,880) were used in a 56-day feeding trial. The experimental diets (n=8) were early-cut (pre-bloom) and late-cut (late-bloom) red clover, preserved as frozen-fresh, dry-silage, haylage and hay, and a control diet. All clover diets were fed as sole diets with salt block available ad libitum in every treatment. Feed dry matter intake, feed conversion ratio ( FCR, kg feed dry matter per kg weight gain), number and weight of crickets and water consumption were recorded every five days. FCR was higher for late-cut than early cut-red clover, but overall cricket weight and survival rate did not differ between cutting times (P=0.939). FCR, weight and survival were not affected by forage conservation method. Total feed consumption was highest for red clover hay. Crickets fed red clover diets had lower (P<0.01) weight and higher FCR than crickets fed the control diet, but their survival rate was not different from that of control crickets during the first 25 days of life. Water consumption of AD fed the control diet was about half that reported for pigs and poultry. Crickets fed on fresh red cover had lower (P=0.04) water consumption compared with crickets fed dried or ensiled red clover, but ensiling did not reduce water consumption compared with hay. Red clover cannot be recommended as a sole feedstuff for AD, but early and latecut red clover had similar effects. The possibility to partly include late cut red clover in cricket diets is interesting from an ecosystem service perspective since the flowering crop will provide feed for declining populations of bees and other pollinators.

AB  - We study the management of mixed-species boreal forests and tree species composition in a stand-level economic-ecological, size-structured model. The model includes ecological tree species interaction, a detailed harvesting cost module, optimal harvest timing, and optimization between continuous cover and rotation forestry. Optimization is solved by applying a trilevel structure in which the optimal rotation is the highest-level problem, harvest timing is the mid-level problem, and thinning intensity is the lowest-level problem. Given realistic regeneration costs and a 3% interest rate, continuous cover forestry is optimal and may include up to a 40% fraction of broadleaves. A low interest rate and low regeneration cost together with the presence of light-demanding Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) favours rotation forestry. Eurasian aspen (Populus tremula L.) decreases the bare-land value but is optimal to fell without utilization only when it has no commercial value. Overyielding in terms of cubic metre output does not reveal the economically preferable species combination. Managing single-species stands by removing other species that are naturally regenerated decreases the economic outcome by 35%-44%. Felling noncommercial trees without utilization shows that the economically optimal solution avoids high-grading. Maintaining the number of large-diameter trees beyond the level that maximizes profitability implies only minor losses. Omitting thinning decreases the bare-land value up to 73%.

AB  - Bryophytes and lichens are two main components of the forest floor vegetation. They provide essential ecosystem services, including nutrient recycling and water regulation. Here, we contrast the species richness, cover and community composition of forest floor bryophytes and lichens in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated production forests. The study sites were located in the hemiboreal zone of southern Sweden, and represented early-, mid- and late rotation stands. Our aim was to examine the potential consequences for forest floor biodiversity from the decreasing use of Scots pine production forests in this region.
   Whereas Scots pine and Norway spruce stands did not differ in bryophyte cover, we found a higher cover of lichens in Scots pine stands, and highest in the intermediate aged stands. Also the species richness of lichens was higher in the Scots pine stands, while bryophyte species richness was higher in the Norway spruce stands. Differences in canopy cover and associated light transmittance to the forest floor appears to be important drivers for distinctive different forest floor communities in the Scots pine and Norway spruce stands, as revealed by NonMetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS). Mean Ellenberg indicator values for bryophytes and lichens showed that species associated with Scots pine stands were characterized by their tolerance of brighter conditions, higher insolation, and better adaptation to a continental climate. Norway spruce stands instead had a comparably larger proportion of species tolerating lower light, but also indicators of higher available nutrient levels, humidity, and pH. The outcome of the Ellenberg indicator species analysis, as well as the larger cover of lichens,and adaptations to drought found among some mosses, revealed that forest floor communities are shaped by different environmental factors in Scots pine and Norway spruce production stands. These environmental differences, and the quantified shifts in forest floor communities identified in this study, indicate the large shifts in understory bryophyte and lichen species composition and abundance that is likely to occur if Scots pine stands are converted to Norway spruce.

AB  - BackgroundEuropean forests are considered a crucial resource for supplying biomass to a growing bio-economy in Europe. This study aimed to assess the potential availability of forest biomass from European forests and its spatial distribution. We tried to answer the questions (i) how is the potential forest biomass availability spatially distributed across Europe and (ii) where are hotspots of potential forest biomass availability located?MethodsThe spatial distribution of woody biomass potentials was assessed for 2020 for stemwood, residues (branches and harvest losses) and stumps for 39 European countries. Using the European Forest Information SCENario (EFISCEN) model and international forest statistics, we estimated the theoretical amount of biomass that could be available based on the current and future development of the forest age-structure, growing stock and increment and forest management regimes. We combined these estimates with a set of environmental (site productivity, soil and water protection and biodiversity protection) and technical (recovery rate, soil bearing capacity) constraints, which reduced the amount of woody biomass that could potentially be available. We mapped the potential biomass availability at the level of administrative units and at the 10kmx10km grid level to gain insight into the spatial distribution of the woody biomass potentials.ResultsAccording to our results, the total availability of forest biomass ranges between 357 and 551 Tg dry matter per year. The largest potential supply of woody biomass per unit of land can be found in northern Europe (southern Finland and Sweden, Estonia and Latvia), central Europe (Austria, Czech Republic, and southern Germany), Slovenia, southwest France and Portugal. However, large parts of these potentials are already used to produce materials and energy. The distribution of biomass potentials that are currently unused only partially coincides with regions that currently have high levels of wood production.ConclusionsOur study shows how the forest biomass potentials are spatially distributed across the European continent, thereby providing insight into where policies could focus on an increase of the supply of woody biomass from forests. Future research on potential biomass availability from European forests should also consider to what extent forest owners would be willing to mobilise additional biomass from their forests and at what costs the estimated potentials could be mobilised.

AB  - Transport infrastructure is closely linked to several sustainability issues of main policy relevance, and significant impacts on biodiversity as well as resource use and construction costs relate to the corridor design and location in the landscape. The aim of this study was to develop methods for railway corridor planning, in which corridor design and location would be based on important ecological and geological sustainability criteria. The method, an MCA framework including both spatial and non-spatial MCA, was demonstrated on a railway planning proposition in an urbanising area north of Stockholm, Sweden. Alternative spatial alignments for 6 railway corridors were derived based on criteria representing biodiversity, resource efficiency and costs, developed from ecological and geological knowledge, data and models. The method identified a study area specific positive synergy between ecological and geological sustainability criteria. The evaluation part of the methodology could furthermore identify uncertainties in the input data and assumptions and conflicts between ecological criteria. In order to arrive at a well-informed decision support system, the criteria as well as the decision rules employed could be further elaborated. Other relevant sustainability issues would also need to be integrated, such as cultural landscapes, recreation, and other ecosystem services. Still, arriving at a corridor design informed by the ecological and geological conditions in the planned area, as demonstrated by this study, could improve the sustainability performance of transport infrastructure planning.

AB  - The Swedish coastal zone is a scene of conflicting interests about various goods and services provided by nature. Open-access conditions and the public nature of many services increase the difficulty in resolving these conflicts. "Sustainability" is a vague but widely accepted guideline for finding reasonable trade-offs between different interests. The UN view of sustainable development suggests that coastal zone management should aim at a sustainable ecological, economic, and social-cultural development. Looking closer at economic sustainability, it is observed that economic analyses about whether changes in society imply a gain or a loss should take into account the economic value of the environment. Methods used for making such economic valuation in the context of the Swedish coastal zone are briefly reviewed. It is noted that the property rights context matters for the results of a valuation study. This general background is followed by a concise presentation of the design and results of four valuation studies on Swedish coastal zone issues. One study is on the economic value of an improved bathing water quality in the Stockholm archipelago. The other studies are a travel cost study about the economic value of improved recreational fisheries in the Stockholm archipelago, a replacement cost study on the value of restoring habitats for sea trout, and a choice experiment study on the economic value of improved water quality along the Swedish westcoast.

AB  - The article is devoted to the forestry in Russia and Finland considered through economic relations developing under the influence of national forest legislation and state forest management systems. The purpose of the article is to assess the trends in the development of forest relations formed within the framework of national forest regulations and their respective forest management mechanisms on the example of two countries: Russia and Finland. The study is based on a system approach to forestry considered from an ecological and economic perspective, using subject-object, abstract and logical methods, comparative, spatial, statistical analysis, modern theories of sustainable development, as well as foreign and domestic experience of forest relations. The research novelty lies in revealing trends in the development of forest economy formed under the influence of national forest legislation systems, forest management systems taking into account population's opinion. The ratio of organizationaladministrative and economic methods of forest management by public authorities of the two countries are analyzed. The economic efficiency of forest management in two countries is compared through contrasting costs and revenues of forestry. The positive and negative trends of the Russian forest economy since the beginning of the administrative reform in the country are analyzed. Trends in forest economy, environment and sociology showed are more negative rather than positive. The research results can be in demand by research institutions forecasting the development of sectoral economies, forest organizations for building economic relations between the state, forestry business and the population. The study can be continued in terms of assessing trends in the development of forestry as an eco-economic system with a long manufacturing cycle, taking into account the new paradigm of thinking about the role of renewable forest resources in human life.

AB  - Using local and recycled materials is a sustainable way to establish a vegetated roof. In order to understand how the roof ecosystem functions and returns ecosystem services, it is important to study vegetation, soil organisms and runoff quality. We established a vegetated roof experiment based on a substrate containing lightweight crushed concrete, an alkaline side product from a concrete factory, mixed with compost. This five-year experiment in southern Finland tested how planting method (pre-grown vegetation mats vs. pot planting), compost content (20% vs. 40%, fresh volume), and substrate depth affect the cover and diversity of plants, the abundance of soil animals and the quality of runoff. Although the substrate had a high pH (7.3-11.8), many vascular plants were able to survive and establish viable populations. The planting method had a strong effect on plant diversity and the cover of individual species because the vegetation mats became dominated by the invasive, non-native Phedimus hybridus. Establishment with pot plants in turn provided bare ground that was colonised by spontaneous non-invasive species. This resulted in higher diversity, and a more even distribution of species. The amount of compost had only a weak impact on vegetation, whereas high pH generally reduced plant abundance and diversity. The concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in runoff were low as compared to values reported from many other vegetated roofs, were not affected by compost content and decreased over time. In summary, the high-pH substrate based on recycled materials is an environmentally responsible choice, suitable for a wide variety of plants, even rare and endangered species.

AB  - In Finland, there is an ongoing adoption and learning process considering the cultivation of cover crops (CCs). The primary aim is to claim the benefits of CCs for agricultural production and ecosystems, which are both appreciated by Finnish farmers. A farmer survey with 1130 respondents was carried out to build an up-to-date understanding of how farmers have succeeded with CCs and whether they intend to continue with the use of CCs and to collect farmers' views on knowledge gaps that should be filled by research or better knowledge sharing. The studied groups were farmers who had selected CCs as a registered measure in 2020 to receive agricultural payments. Data came from the Finnish Food Authority. Organic farmers were slightly more positive: they have had longer experience with CCs, but organic production is also more dependent on the ecosystem services provided by CCs. A high share of respondents agreed that their experiences with CCs have improved over time and were confident that CCs had become a permanent element of their production systems. Most of the farmers also agreed that the area under CCs would expand significantly in Finland and considered the cultivation of CCs as an effective measure to improve soil conditions. They often considered that challenges in adopting CCs were exaggerated and disagreed that bad experiences prevented them from expanding or continuing the use of CCs. The agricultural payment available for Finnish farmers to support the cultivation of CCs is quite reasonable (EUR 97 + EUR 50 per hectare) to compensate for any economic risks of CCs. Free word answers from the farmers highlighted research needs (in descending order) in the following areas: crop protection, sowing practices, the use of diverse CCs and their mixtures, and impacts on yield and profitability. Many of these are universal, i.e., have been reported elsewhere. Younger farmers (& LE;50 years) highlighted profitability, which is, in many European countries, a key barrier to the deployment of CCs. Farmers from the east and north regions, where the growing season is short, highlighted alternative CC choices as a knowledge gap.

AB  - Objective Elevated resting metabolic rates (RMR, kcal/day) are a well-established mechanism for maintaining core body temperature among cold climate populations. A high degree of interindividual variation has recently been noted among circumpolar populations. To further examine RMR variability, we investigated anthropometric and metabolic differences among reindeer herders from subarctic Finland. Methods Resting metabolic rates, body mass, body composition, height, age, and sex were measured among 20 reindeer herders (5 females, 15 males, 20-64 years) from seven herding districts surrounding the Arctic Circle of Finland in January of 2019. Results Females had a mean RMR of 1798 +/- 216 kcal/day and males 1753 +/- 503 kcal/day. When controlling for body mass and fat-free mass, females had significantly higher RMRs relative to males (P < .01). Contrary to previous cold climate population studies, measured RMR among males was not significantly different from predictive equation estimates (P > .05). However, predictive equations significantly underestimated female RMR by a mean of 25.2% +/- 5.9% (P < .01). Conclusion These results mirror earlier findings, though in ways previously unseen. In this population: (a) There is a high degree of RMR interindividual variability, but only among males, and (b) there is evidence for elevated RMR, but only among females. Though the sample size is small, preliminary results suggest the presence of sex-based differences in metabolic adaptations to cold climates within this population subset. Potential reasons for this sex-based difference are discussed including a presentation of a hypothesis about the dual role of thyroid hormone in both reproductive and metabolic processes.

AB  - Land tenure issues can contribute to food insecurity, limited livelihood opportunities and consequently poverty. Lack of land tenure can cause migratory movements that can affect not only individuals and families but also communities or even entire nations. This study aims to underline the scientific and social relevance of land tenure studies by identifying research focus and trends. To this end, we analyzed all scientific publications related to land tenure from 1950 to 2020. The three most active countries in this field are the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. The three most active countries in this field are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, with the three main institutions being Wageningen University & Research, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Three different research periods have been identified in this domain. In the period from 1950 to 1999, the main research clusters identified were related to socioeconomics and demography issues. In the second period, from 2000 to 2009, the main research clusters identified were related to specific geographical areas and land rights issues, with an emphasis on countries in Africa or South America. In the third period, from 2010 to 2020, the main research clusters identified were related to environmental aspects. It has been found that land tenure studies have always been linked to what subsequently became the sustainable development goals, especially those related to the elimination of poverty and hunger in the first period, economic growth and reducing inequalities in the second period, and climate change in the third period. From a geographical point of view, the first two periods were characterized by terms related to continents such as Africa, Asia, or Latin America, with Africa being the most frequently used term in the first two periods. In the third period, studies on specific countries stood out, especially those related to China and Mexico.

AB  - Extreme droughts are expected to increase in frequency and severity in many regions of the world, threatening multiple ecosystem services provided by forests. Effective strategies to adapt forests to such droughts require comprehensive information on the effects and importance of the factors influencing forest resistance and resilience. We used a unique combination of inventory and dendrochronological data from a long-term (>30 years) silvicultural experiment in mixed silver fir and Norway spruce mountain forests along a temperature and precipitation gradient in southwestern Germany. We aimed at examining the mechanisms and forest stand characteristics underpinning the resistance and resilience to past mild and severe droughts. We found that (i) fir benefited from mild droughts and showed higher resistance (i.e., lower growth loss during drought) and resilience (i.e., faster return to pre-drought growth levels) than spruce to all droughts; (ii) species identity determined mild drought responses while species interactions and management-related factors strongly influenced the responses to severe droughts; (iii) intraspecific and interspecific interactions had contrasting effects on the two species, with spruce being less resistant to severe droughts when exposed to interaction with fir and beech; (iv) higher values of residual stand basal area following thinning were associated with lower resistance and resilience to severe droughts; and (v) larger trees were resilient to mild drought events but highly vulnerable to severe droughts. Our study provides an analytical approach for examining the effects of different factors on individual tree- and stand-level drought response. The forests investigated here were to a certain extent resilient to mild droughts, and even benefited from such conditions, but were strongly affected by severe droughts. Lastly, negative effects of severe droughts can be reduced through modifying species composition, tree size distribution and stand density in mixed silver fir-Norway spruce forests.

AB  - In the face of a strong societal emphasis on sustainable development, the research on environmentally conscious consumers is becoming increasingly important. In a country such as Finland, non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners can be used as a proxy for a high-involvement group engaged in forest ecosystem service provision and consumption. NIPF owners constitute a large proportion of the Finnish population and, based on previous research, the values they ascribe to forest meaning and use have become more diverse, strongly emphasizing recreational and conservation values alongside timber production. We thus hypothesize that understanding the NIPFs consumer perceptions better offers new insights into future consumer value creation in Finnish society overall, especially concerning the segment of consumers associated with the lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS). First, the theoretical aim of the study was to validate a measurement model for forest owners engaged in pro-environmental consumption behavior and its effect on the meaning of forest for them. Second, the empirical aim was to identify different consumer categories among NIPF owners by classifying them into groups based on their sustainability orientation, and determine how the valuation of various uses of forests differs between these groups. The data set of 394 forest owners was collected in Finland in 2013 by telephone interview and was analysed using multivariate methods. The findings indicate that the owners with the highest sustainability orientation have a greater emphasis on multiple benefits of forests than owners who have a lower orientation to sustainable consumption behavior, and that they could be therefore considered as an interesting peer group for developing new service offerings in the changing forestry markets as well.

AB  - Many tree species worldwide are suffering from slow or failed natural regeneration with dramatic consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, it is difficult to disentangle the complex effects of factors influencing regeneration processes on long-lived tree species at large scales. In this study, we use long-term data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (1953-2015) combined with deer hunting data (1960-2015) to reveal experimentally-intractable processes impeding oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration in southern Sweden. Oak-dominated ecosystems are widespread in northern temperate regions, where oaks are foundation species with disproportionate importance for biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our study reveals that during the last six decades, oak tree numbers and standing volume have continuously increased, while natural regeneration of oak declined steeply after the early 1980s. We connect this decline to denser and darker forests, combined with increased abundance of deer. Land use changes during the six decades, such as abandonment of traditional practices and large-scale introduction of forest management oriented towards high volume production, led to continuously denser forests and thereby reduced the oak regeneration niche. In addition, the impact of changed game management was evident. This was particularly clear from a natural experiment on Gotland, a large island free of deer until roe deer were introduced in the late 20th century, at which point oak regeneration began a steep decline. At the stand level, natural oak regeneration could be expected to mainly occur in pulses after disturbance events, followed by a period of low regeneration success as the cohort ages. However, at a landscape scale one would expect a mix of successional stages that would even out such demographic patterns. A prolonged period of low regeneration at a landscape scale will eventually lead to a large gap in the oak size distribution as was observed in this study. This could eventually hurt the many species dependent on old and large oak trees. Active management to restore the oak regeneration niche, i.e. forest habitats with more light and less browsing pressure, therefore seems essential. The latter includes developing strategies that manage both deer populations and their available food across landscapes. Our study is the first to link oak regeneration failure to long-term changes in land use and increased deer populations at a landscape scale in this region. Furthermore, our study show how historical data can clarify confounded processes impacting long-lived forest species.

AB  - Public acceptance of environmental compensation (offsetting) as a mechanism to address negative human impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services is critical. Given that "in-kind/on-site" compensation is rarely possible, proposals must address trade-offs with respect to design. We measure Swedish citizens' support for compensation and analyze preferences for design attributes based on a choice experiment in which respondents choose between various compensation alternatives to address the hypothetical loss of green space due to urban development. We find citizens' support for compensation is high, but the activity causing the damage affects acceptance. Our model suggests that several design attributes affect choice but size of the compensation area was valued highest, both in relative and absolute terms. Further, our results suggest that compensation should be primarily focused on creating or improving biodiversity and nature values in order to be in line with public preferences. Additionally, choice depends on interactions between attributes: a larger compensation site matters more when it is relatively further away; and the importance of size and distance from damage depends on whether compensation type focuses on nature or recreational values. Observable characteristics such as a respondent's age, income and education affect compensation design preferences, but perceptions and previous experiences have the largest effect on choice. Our findings suggest that public preferences are consistent with many of the general recommendations found in guidance documents, but local context may argue for alternative priorities with respect to certain species, habitats, and/or the wellbeing of certain groups. To engender broad support, compensatory offsets will need to balance scientific rigor with transparent involvement of the public.

AB  - The relatively continuous belt of wilderness and nature conservation areas in northern Finland forms an ecological corridor between the vast taiga forests of Siberia and the protected areas of the Scandinavian mountains. This corridor has a special importance for the movement and habitat of large predators, and it enables the gene exchange of other taiga species. Many human uses, such as reindeer husbandry, hunting, fishing, forestry, and mineral prospecting affect the diversity of plant and animal species in wilderness areas. The effects of these uses and the means to control them are discussed in this paper.

AB  - In this study, we explore Indigenous energy opposition to and acceptance of small hydropower development. In S ' apmi (i.e., the traditional homeland of the Indigenous S ' ami people), land development poses a major threat to the cultural and material needs of the S ' ami people through the loss of pastures essential to S ' ami reindeer herding. In contrast to large-scale renewable energy projects such as hydropower, power line and wind power projects, the impact of small hydropower (SHP) development on Indigenous land use has received relatively little attention. We mapped Indigenous opposition to and acceptance of new SHP development in a key region for S ' ami reindeer herding in northern Norway from 2010 to 2018. Our results show how the proliferation of SHPs on reindeer pastures caused concern among S ' ami reindeer owners and their representatives, who devoted consid-erable resources to participating in and opposing new SHPs through public hearing processes. In many cases, other actors, such as environmental interests, also opposed. Nevertheless, most cases opposed by Indigenous representatives were licensed (59 %). Considering our results and given the potential for and interest in expanding renewable energy, Indigenous opposition to SHP development warrants greater attention. Our approach provides a larger-scale, larger-N, quantitative view of opposition to SHP development that can com-plement more qualitative and in-depth approaches.

AB  - The indigenous people Sami are an ethnic minority living in Finland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Throughout history, Samis have been living close to nature. Working with reindeer husbandry, fishing-farming, hunting, herding, and harvesting for food supplies, has traditionally been an integral part of their lives. Currently, only 2,500 of the similar to 65,000 Samis in Norway are operating reindeer husbandry (2019). Most Samis today work in mainstream jobs, and the fishing-farming culture gradually become more like the mainstream societies where Samis live. Fieldwork with participant observation and semi-structured interviews carried out at Riddu Riddu Festivala in the period 2009-2018. In addition, the governing bodies of seven other Sami festivals have been interviewed. All together 46 in-depth interviews and participant observations conducted, in addition to document analysis of the festivals. The aim was to study how physical and outdoor activities included in the festivals create indigenous people's identities and cultural understanding and how the activities at the festivals might develop climate and environmental awareness. Indigenous festivals and their governing bodies offer many different forms of physical and cultural activities from Samis and different indigenous peoples to the youth and children taking part. Further, the study shows that important aims for the organizers are to spread the knowledge about Samis (i.e., local coastal Samis and regional reindeer/Inland Samis) and other indigenous peoples, and making environment-friendly festivals. They are trying to educate the children and youth in the cultural practices of their forefathers and foremothers. The manifold of activities offered at the festivals seem to create sustainable ties between persons, which equip the participants with social and cultural capital in addition to networks across festivals organizations internationally. The participants further express that taking part in the festival activities create symbolic capital, due to that they might express their indigeneity at the festivals both for people living in the region and for a greater audience. According to the participants, the festivals have equipped the participants with cultural awareness, as well as the children and youth taught an appreciation of nature so they can enjoy and respect nature and develop climate and environmental awareness.

AB  - Understanding the economic costs imposed by wildfire smoke is important to evaluating competing fire management approaches and setting appropriate mitigation budgets. The nascent literature on wildfire smoke costs has largely examined the indirect health costs associated with individuals' exposure to smoke. However, this ignores the direct costs of wildfire smoke, that is, the costs that smoke creates by directly affecting an individual's utility. Direct costs may arise from smoke-induced changes in visibility of scenic amenities or disruptions to ecosystem services that individuals see value in preserving. For the first time, the life satisfaction approach is applied to estimate wildfire smoke economic costs faced by individuals from direct and indirect sources. Using nationally-representative data from the US Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System over 2006-2010, results suggest that US adults are willing to pay $373 [95% CI: $86.8, $659.2] to avoid one day of wildfire smoke over their county of residence within a six month period. Residents of rural areas are willing to pay $130 more to avoid one smoke day than urban residents. These results are higher than extant willingness to pay estimates of indirect smoke-induced health impacts, suggestive that the true costs of wildfire smoke are larger than previously estimated.

AB  - Several iconic coastal and fjord landscapes in Northern Norway have undergone natural spontaneous regrowth of abandoned agricultural areas and pastureland. At the same time, recent public discourse has assumed that such regrowth may taint tourists' and outdoor recreationists' perceptions of rural areas. Consequently, this in situ multilingual study in the archipelago of Vesteralen investigated this assumption. The results revealed that tourists' and visiting recreationists' foremost interest was in pristine rural areas that seemed devoid of human presence or activity. At the same time, roughly half of the visitors enjoyed seeing working farms. The enquiry displays preference ambivalence about the combination of "cultural" and "natural" elements of the rural landscape. The investigation also illustrates a disparity between foreign tourists' desire for lush deciduous vegetation and Norwegian visitors' fondness for a more open agricultural seaside with grassland and shrubland and just a few scattered trees, as the study area had appeared some decades earlier. Moreover, some implications of land use policy are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global transition towards renewable energy production has increased the demand for new and more flexible hydropower operations. Before management and stakeholders can make informed choices on potential mitigations, it is essential to understand how the hydropower reservoir ecosystems respond to water level regulation (WLR) impacts that are likely modified by the reservoirs' abiotic and biotic characteristics. Yet, most reservoir studies have been case-specific, which hampers large-scale planning, evaluation and mitigation actions across various reservoir ecosystems. Here, we investigated how the effect of the magnitude, frequency and duration of WLR on fish populations varies along environmental gradients. We used biomass, density, size, condition and maturation of brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) in Norwegian hydropower reservoirs as a measure of ecosystem response, and tested for interacting effects of WLR and lake morphometry, climatic conditions and fish community structure. Our results showed that environmental drivers modified the responses of brown trout populations to different WLR patterns. Specifically, brown trout biomass and density increased with WLR magnitude particularly in large and complex-shaped reservoirs, but the positive relationships were only evident in reservoirs with no other fish species. Moreover, increasing WLR frequency was associated with increased brown trout density but decreased condition of individuals within the populations. WLR duration had no significant impacts on brown trout, and the mean weight and maturation length of brown trout showed no significant response to any WLR metrics. Our study demonstrates that local environmental characteristics and the biotic community strongly modify the hydropower-induced WLR impacts on reservoir fishes and ecosystems, and that there are no one-size-fits-all solutions to mitigate environmental impacts. This knowledge is vital for sustainable planning, management and mitigation of hydropower operations that need to meet the increasing worldwide demand for both renewable energy and ecosystem services delivered by freshwaters.

AB  - nitori Accumulating evidence highlights increased mortality risks for trees during severe drought, particularly under warmer temperatures and increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD). Resulting forest die-off events have severe consequences for ecosystem services, biophysical and biogeochemical land-atmosphere processes. Despite advances in monitoring, modelling and experimental studies of the causes and consequences of tree death from individual tree to ecosystem and global scale, a general mechanistic understanding and realistic predictions of drought mortality under future climate conditions are still lacking. We update a global tree mortality map and present a roadmap to a more holistic understanding of forest mortality across scales. We highlight priority research frontiers that promote: (1) new avenues for research on key tree ecophysiological responses to drought; (2) scaling from the tree/plot level to the ecosystem and region; (3) improvements of mortality risk predictions based on both empirical and mechanistic insights; and (4) a global mong network of forest mortality. In light of recent and anticipated large forest die-off events such a research agenda is timely and needed to achieve scientific understanding for realistic predictions of drought-induced tree mortality. The implementation of a sustainable network will require support by stakeholders and political authorities at the international level.

AB  - As climate continues to change, disturbances may increasingly navigate forest ecosystems towards tipping points, causing irreversible state shifts and a loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. In this review, I elaborate the Special Issue topic 'Natural disturbances as tipping points of forest ecosystems under climate change' featured by Forestry and suggest a suit of adaptive measures to mitigate increasing disturbances and their impacts on forest ecosystems. The Special Issue contains seven case studies assessing drought, fire, wind and bark beetle disturbances in Europe, North America and Africa. Despite high severities and/or frequencies, disturbances have not yet induced a shift of the investigated forest ecosystems towards an alternative state. Instead, forests have shown high resistance, resilience or both. For instance, one case study reveals that short-interval fires in European beech forests may not even significantly alter tree species composition due to the high resprouting ability of beech. Yet, other case studies identify distinct differences in resilience amongst ecoregions, and indicate that climate change and disturbance interactions might tip the future carbon balance of forests from sink to source. Many forest ecosystems are likely able to cope with future increases in disturbance activity to some degree. However, tipping points might vary across ecosystems dominated by different disturbance agents. While wind and bark beetles mainly affect canopy trees, fire and drought also directly impair tree regeneration, thus reducing the capacity of ecosystems to recover and reorganize. Hence, forest ecosystems in which fire and drought are the dominant disturbance agents might approach tipping points earlier than forests dominated by other agents if disturbance activity continues to increase. Several proactive and reactive adaptive measures are available to mitigate increasing disturbances, but more research is needed to develop robust and region-specific strategies to prevent tipping points in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Undisturbed peatlands are effective carbon sinks and provide a variety of ecosystem services. However, anthropogenic disturbances, especially land drainage, strongly alter peat soil properties and jeopardize the benefits of peatlands. The effects of disturbances should therefore be assessed and predicted. To support accurate modeling, this study determined the physical and hydraulic properties of intact and disturbed peat samples collected from 59 sites (in total 3,073 samples) in Finland and Norway. The bulk density (BD), porosity, and specific yield (Sy) values obtained indicated that the top layer (0-30 cm depth) at agricultural and peat extraction sites was most affected by land use change. The BD in the top layer at agricultural, peat extraction, and forestry sites was 441%, 140%, and 92% higher, respectively, than that of intact peatlands. Porosity decreased with increased BD, but not linearly. Agricultural and peat extraction sites had the lowest saturated hydraulic conductivity, Sy, and porosity, and the highest BD of the land use options studied. The van Genuchten-Mualem (vGM) soil water retention curve (SWRC) and hydraulic conductivity (K) models proved to be applicable for the peat soils tested, providing values of SWRC, K, and vGM-parameters (alpha and n) for peat layers (top, middle and bottom) under different land uses. A decrease in peat soil water content of >= 10% reduced the unsaturated K values by two orders of magnitude. This unique data set can be used to improve hydrological modeling in peat-dominated catchments and for fuller integration of peat soils into large-scale hydrological models.

AB  - Management of salmonids at local and regional levels in the Baltic, Sea is best analyzed by viewing the Baltic region as a complex social-ecological system. The ecosystem approach, now in an implementation phase in the Baltic Sea region, provides a framework for understanding interdependencies between resources, ecosystems and society, and examining management trade-offs. This study focuses on application of the ecosystem approach to management of two salmonids: the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fishery in the Baltic Sea region and the brown trout S. trutta recreational fishery in Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. These cases provide illustrative examples of some current trend!; and key challenges for sustainable salmonidae management. The Baltic Sea has low biodiversity and Atlantic salmon is one of the few commercially or recreationally important fish species. In this region, fish resources and the ecosystems they depend on are shared by nine coastal nations. The different salmon populations spawn in their native rivers but mix in offshore areas where they are harvested by national fishing fleets. In the Baltic, a number of factors have impacted wild salmon populations. Hydropower development in the Baltic coastal states has led to declines in wild salmon populations and, to compensate, annual stocked fish releases. In attractive coastal areas such as the Stockholm archipelago in Sweden, increased recreational fishing has led to a shift in user patterns from small-scale commercial fisheries by islanders towards a heterogeneous group of visiting recreational fishers. Efforts to reorganize fisheries management institutions in the Baltic Sea region indicate the need to consider the full range of user groups, develop coherent multilevel management institutions, and achieve a better understanding of the role of diverse fish populations in the ecosystem.

AB  - In Oslo, as elsewhere, the COVID-19 outbreak and the following lockdown measures during spring 2020 led to increased use of urban green infrastructure. Whether this has led to more durable changes in recreation patterns remains an open question. We used mobile tracking data from 53,000 STRAVA users to explore the longevity of increases in recreational activity. We compared 2020 activity levels relative to a weather benchmark (i.e. baseline), defined as the activity one would have expected given the time of year and prevailing weather conditions. Recreational activity increased by 240% during the five weeks of comprehensive lockdown and were maintained until the summer vacation period in June/July when they dropped to baseline levels. Yet, during August they increased again to 89% above baseline. Although activity increased across all city land use zones, after lockdown there was a shift away from residential and commercial zones toward city green spaces including forests and protected areas. Cultural landscapes and protected areas received disproportionately high activity levels relative to the length of recreational trails available within them. Recreationists in the teenager demographic (13-19) exhibited a four-fold increase in their share of the STRAVA user-base at the start of lockdown. The COVID-19 pandemic and its disruptions to the status quo has had lasting effects over the short-term on the way Norwegian citizens recreate. Our findings reinforce the value of urban nature and open spaces for societal pandemic preparedness, particularly youths, during and after times of crisis.

AB  - Many cities worldwide are using re-greening strategies to help reverse urbanization patterns that aggravate environmental issues. Green infrastructure (GI) has become a significant and effective strategy to address environmental problems. To better understand GI, this study uses CiteSpace to analyze 5420 published papers in the field of GI on the Web of Science database from 1990-2020. This bibliometric analysis will help new scholars and researchers to better understand the current status and trends in GI research, as well as identify further research needed in the field. This study evaluated research on GI trends according to publication amounts, keywords, journals, disciplines, countries, institutions, and authors. Results show that, first, GI research has experienced rapid growth since 2014. Second, GI, ecosystem services, and city are the top three keywords related to GI research, with green roof as the keyword with the strongest linkage. Third, Sustainability, Urban Forestry and Urban Greening, and Landscape and Urban Planning are the top three journals publishing GI research. Fourth, the top three disciplines researching GI are environmental science, engineering, and science and technology. Fifth, the USA is the top ranked country in terms of the number of published GI-related papers (1514 papers), followed by China (730 papers) and England (546 papers). Sixth, the US Environmental Protection Agency (84 papers) is the top institution in terms of publications, followed by the Chinese Academy of Science (83 papers) and the Swedish University of Agriculture (66 papers). Finally, D. Haase has the most published articles (29 papers), followed by S. Pauleit (28 papers) and P. Angelstam (26 papers). These findings indicate that GI has developed significantly in the last 30 years, with a high probability for increased growth in the future.

AB  - Many diadromous fish populations are declining and at risk of collapse. Lack of river connectivity is a major contributor to these declines, as free migration routes between marine and freshwater habitats are crucial for life-history completion. For the conservation and ultimately recovery of such species, it is imperative that remedial measures aimed at increasing connectivity are effective. This study investigated the distribution patterns of ascending juvenile European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) in rivers in south-western Sweden, with a focus on the effects of barriers and measures that aim to reduce the impact of barriers, i.e. fish-passage solutions (FPSs). Eel occurrence data were spatially and temporally integrated with the national databases of dams and FPSs in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment to evaluate their effect on ascending eel distribution. The types of barriers assessed were: (i) dams with nature-like fishways; (ii) dams with eel ramps; (iii) dams with technical fishways; and (iv) dams without FPSs. Dams fitted with eel ramps or technical fishways, as well as dams without FPSs, produced a significant negative effect on the probability of eel occurrence upstream. This negative effect was not found for dams fitted with nature-like fishways, indicating that these solutions may function better than the other FPS types in this study. The probability of eel occurrence decreased with distance from the sea and increased with area sampled, number of electrofishing runs, water temperature, and with the size of the bottom substrate. We suggest that future conservation strategies for improving the natural immigration of juvenile eels should include optimizing FPS function (e.g. placement and design), the continued maintenance of FPSs, the construction of nature-like fishways, and preferably the removal of dams, which will also benefit the downstream migration of maturing eels as well as restoring other ecosystem services.

AB  - This paper models the optimal allocation of research resources aimed at understanding the consequences of a marine invasion. The model assumes returns to research are uncertain. Furthermore there are joint returns to research ahead of the invasion frontier and within the already invaded area. Research ahead of the frontier helps define external damages by establishing the baseline ecosystem services and values; research in the invaded area determines restoration needs and costs associated with controlling the invaded area's population. Additionally, research in the invaded area may improve management of any commercial aspect of the invading species, which may warrant accommodation. In such a case, simple application of the precautionary approach to the invasion has direct quantifiable costs in foregone commercial benefits. Benefits of research thus may accrue either from improved information regarding the potential or actual damages of the invasion, or from improved information for solving the common property management challenges of a commercial species. In the latter case, improved management heightens expectations of foregone benefits ahead of the frontier. We use the Red King Crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) invasion in Norway as a case study. The crab is a valuable global commodity whose invasive presence in the Barents Sea is impacting the benthos. Harvesting or controlling the crab reduces these impacts, but the net benefits of doing so are uncertain and require both baseline research and restoration research to ascertain. We distinguish the research for Red King Crab in different types based on the potential to reveal marginal external benefits from commercial harvesting. We illustrate how misallocation of research resources can be reduced when the uncertainties create incentives that promote research into tangible commercial benefits over less certain ecosystem benefits. Our analysis suggests that there is currently greater marginal benefit from directing more research resources toward baseline research at the frontier of the invasion instead of making additional investments in research that focuses on the commercial potential of the invasive yet valuable crab.

AB  - Incentive-based mechanisms are regarded as efficient instruments to reconcile conservation and development. This win win objective has been difficult to accomplish; cross-compliance has, therefore, been suggested as a mechanism to ensure sustainability. Cross-compliance, which requires producers to conform to production regulations and environmental standards to qualify for direct payments, has been a popular instrument in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Since 1990, cross-compliance has been the main characteristic of policy design in Sami reindeer husbandry in Finnmark, Norway. All direct transfers to the Sami pastoralists have been connected to harvesting demands to decrease the number of reindeer and to conserve pastures. The content of these incentive-based mechanisms are decided through negotiated agreements with the Sami Reindeer Herders' Association of Norway (NRL), and the regulation of reindeer numbers and access to pastures are delegated to co-management boards. Despite the participation of the Sami pastoralists in shaping these policies, win win objectives have not been achieved. Although the cross-compliance program could have been improved by payment for graded results, the lack of regulations by the administration or co-management boards is more likely to be the cause of failure to reach sustainability. Despite the long-term failures of the cross-compliance program, policies have been slow to change. We might attribute this delay to the NRL's strong position in the negotiated agreements. In general, we argue that the success of the cross-compliance program depends on a well-functioning governance system that can implement regulations and sanctions if incentives do not work as intended.

AB  - Virtual reality-based urban audit methods are gaining increasing attention; however, most virtual urban audit studies have focused on panoramic views. The 3D city model-based geovisualizations have remained until now rather unexplored in user studies for urban audits and for communicative urban planning. We explored the feasibility of a 3D geovisualization-based urban audit in virtual reality (VR) for assessing the perceived quality of an urban park deck in Helsinki, Finland. For this purpose, we created a photorealistic and geometrically accurate 3D model (Bryga 3D) based on photogrammetric and laser scanning data. Bryga 3D was implemented on a game engine to be viewed with a head-mounted VR display. Bryga 3D's ability to convey information in a subjective urban audit, that is, subjectively perceived affordances of a park deck, was tested in a walk-along interview study comparing auditing in situ and via the VR method. A comparison of the results with in-situ (n = 13) and VR interviews (n = 21) show that the perception of several tangible elements, such as spatial division, landforms, paths, and chairs when using Bryga VR was similar to when performed in situ. Perception of vegetation was weaker in VR in terms of its detailed quality, which somewhat affected the presented development ideas and assessment of the seasonal context. Also, weaker perception of the surroundings and city context affected the results in VR. However, considering that Bryga 3D presents an example of a highly automated 3D city modeling process conducted with minimal manual work, its results are encouraging for future attempts to advance such realizations for the purposes of communicative urban planning. 3D geovisualization-based virtual audits could be used when urban green space audits are not possible or when they are demanding to implement in situ.

AB  - Urban social-ecological resilience research has focused on conceptual explorations, while less attention has been paid to how resilience thinking in practice may inform urban development. Using the rapidly urbanizing landscape in Stockholm as a case, we explore the urban specifics of resilience thinking practice and thereby contribute to the development of knowledge and practice of social-ecological resilience thinking generally. The study addresses an urban wicked problem: how to ensure that people continue to have access to the means necessary to realize benefits from green blue infrastructure, when the city is changing and governance is fragmented. Drawing on insights from the design and implementation of a participatory dialogue process, we outline methodological adaptations to a resilience informed system exploration, to better accommodate the complexity of urban systems. The participatory process included three phases: basic system understanding, dealing with change over time, and identifying alternative ways forward. Different knowledge elicitation and deliberation methods were deployed within workshops, surveys, and interviews, and were paralleled by a thorough reflexive analysis of process outcomes. The main discussion points are stakeholder participation, the role of discourses, identities and mandates, agency, and adaptive capacity, and alternative strategies for dealing with change. Deep knowledge of the complexities of urban land use and governance requires the involvement of diverse stakeholders. Handling this diversity poses a challenge for process design: combining the ambition of an inclusive process and the need to be relevant with the use of bridging concepts increases the risk of reducing the level of complexity of the deliberative process. There is also a risk of participation bias, where stakeholders knowledgeable about the green blue infrastructure are easier to engage compared to stakeholders with knowledge about drivers of change and urban governance, which will influence the system understanding and envisioned alternative pathways for taking action.

AB  - In the Dinaric Mountains, the future of silver fir and Norway spruce appears to be uncertain, especially given the threat of climate change to both species and browsing pressure on fir. Stand development of mixed Dinaric mountain forest in Slovenia was simulated for the period 2010-2110 using the ForClim model to explore the prospects of both target species under five management scenarios (business-as-usual, no management, single-tree selection, fir conservation and exclusion of browsing) and three climate scenarios (current climate and two climate change scenarios). Simulations under the current climate revealed a decrease in fir proportion from 53% in 2010 to 14-37% in 2110, while the proportion of spruce remained relatively constant (13% in 2010 and 9-13% in 2110). Climate change may intensify the decline of both species along an elevation gradient. An upward shift was projected for fir in the observed period; in low-elevation stands (600-800 m a.s.l.), fir could almost disappear, while at high elevations (1050-1400 m a.s.l.), our simulations projected an increase in the proportion of both fir and spruce. No single management strategy proved to be significantly beneficial for either species. The most promising strategies were the fir conservation-oriented scenario and the exclusion of browsing; large ungulates strongly impacted the development of fir, but not that of spruce. Forest management affords different options for maintaining both species, but its capacity to prevent fir decline under climate change and high browsing pressure is limited. Concurrent measures of wildlife management and silviculture should be applied to maintain conifers in the studied forests.

AB  - In anticipation of more severe summer droughts, forestry in temperate Europe is searching for drought-resistant ecotypes of native tree species that might maintain ecosystem services in the future. We investigated how spring precipitation and soil conditions interact with summer drought and affect the establishment of conifer seedlings from different climatic origin. Emergence, establishment and subsequent performance of seedlings originating from autochthonous, Central Alpine, continental Eastern European, and Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies populations were studied in the dry Alpine Rhine valley, Switzerland, at three sites with differing soil water holding capacities and in 3 years with contrasting weather conditions. In addition to this natural inter-annual variation, precipitation was manipulated within sites with throughfall reduction roofs. Seedling establishment and growth were principally affected by the spring weather in the year of emergence. In years with average to positive spring water balance, seedlings grown at the site with the highest water holding capacity had 2-5 times more aboveground biomass than seedlings grown at sites with less favourable soils. Effects of seed origin were marginal and only detectable at the drier sites: contrary to our expectations, seedlings from the Central Alpine Rhone valley, where the climatic spring water deficit is large, outperformed those from the Mediterranean. Consequently, plantation of non-native populations from dryer origin will mitigate the effects of increased summer drought at driest sites only, while the inter-annual variability of spring precipitation will continue to enable temperate conifers to regenerate on a wide range of forest soils independent of seed origin.

T2  - BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL

KW  - meat

KW  - Norway
AB  - Purpose - This paper attempts to explain the drastic fall in income experienced by Saami reindeer herders in Nor-them Norway between 1976 and 2000, in spite of increasing government subsidies. Saami herders maintain a legal monopoly as suppliers of reindeer meat, a traditional luxury product in Norway.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper shows that a review of the literature is supported by qualitative interviews.
   Findings - The paper argues that main explanatory variables are to be found in the interaction of a number of factors, mainly: cyclical climatic variation in Northern Norway; a system with fixed prices, independent of the variations in supply, that magnified the effects of the natural cycles; increasingly severe sanitary regulations forcing Saami herders to abandon slaughtering and preparation; and the oligopoly market powers of the non-Saami actors taking over slaughtering and processing. It is argued that the fall in herders' income resulted from a failure of the Norwegian Department of Agriculture to understand key factors distinguishing sub-Arctic herding from sedentary agriculture. Sanitary requirements and the government's quest for economies of scale in processing contributed to playing the volume of production into the hands of non-Saami oligopolies. In this way the Saami herders lost the meat production that traditionally was at the core of both their culture and their economic livelihood.
   Originality/value - The paper is relevant for the management of herding and other production systems in areas with cyclical production, and documents the damaging effects on the aboriginal culture resulting from Norway's exclusive use of modem agricultural science in managing such systems.

AB  - Boom corridor thinning (BCT) has been proposed as a cost-effective technique for biomass thinning (BT) in young dense stands. The objective of this study was to determine how various BCT operations affect stand structure following biomass thinning and to compare the results with conventional selective thinning methods. Two series of field experiments were established; BCT 1-series: Three sites in south of Sweden (9 and 11 m in mean and dominating tree height) with five treatments, including a control, conventional selective thinning and three BCT treatments (1 m and 2 m wide corridors and selective BCT). The second BCT series: Three regions in Sweden (in the north, centre and in the south), with two stand sites in each region with different tree heights (4/9 m and 5/10 m in mean/dominating tree height). Treatments were control, pre-commercial thinning (PCT), conventional selective thinning and BCT (high and low thinning). Following the first biomass thinning, BCT regimes and selective thinning methods resulted in similar stand structures based on the number of possible future crop trees (>80 mm in diameter at breast height). However, BCT maintained a higher diversity of tree sizes as well as more stems per hectare, including deciduous species, than the selective thinning approaches. The stands after BCT should have more vertical complexity, especially when compared to pre-commercial thinning. The structural heterogeneity resulting from BCT may also increase stand biodiversity and ecosystem service values.

AB  - The non-indigenous tanaidacean crustacean Sinelobus vanhaareni Bamber, 2014 was first found in northern Europe in 2006 and has since spread to the northern Baltic Sea. Here, we surveyed the distribution of the species in different habitats in southwestern Finland, focusing on vegetated macroalgal and seagrass habitats (i.e., Fucus vesiculosus beds and Zostera marina meadows). We also evaluated its potential impacts by synthesizing current knowledge on the traits and ecology of the species, and identified knowledge gaps. We found that S. vanhaareni is now present throughout most of the southwestern Finnish coast, in a number of vegetated and non-vegetated substrates down to 25 m depth. Furthermore, the presence of egg-brooding females in most areas also confirms that the population is self-sustaining. The species is especially abundant in shallow macroalgal belts and eelgrass meadows, which are critical habitats for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem service provisioning, highlighting the need to understand the effects of S. vanhaareni in these important ecosystems. Its presence on boat hulls and in marinas and harbours suggests that recreational boating may be a major spread vector, while drifting macroalgal fragments may also contribute to regional spread. At this stage of invasion, we found high overlap in epifaunal community composition in sites where S. vanhaareni was present and sites where it was absent. Based on the functional traits of S. vanhaareni and closely related species, we infer that it is likely part of the detritus-based pathway in benthic food webs. However, additional sampling and experiments are necessary to determine the true extent of its distribution and to quantify trophic links (through stable isotope analysis, gut content analysis, and experimental trials) to fully understand its effects on communities and trophic networks in the northern Baltic Sea.

KW  - TYPOLOGY
AB  - Forest management guidelines changed at the end of the 1990's in Finland. Biodiversity, visual landscape, water systems, and different forms of forest use are now better taken into account. The objectives, outdoor recreation motives, and attitudes towards the present forest management activities of the non-industrial private forest owners called family forest owners in this article, whose forest holdings are located in northern Finland, were studied. In addition, a forest owner typology based on the above-mentioned motives, objectives, and attitudes was created, and the relationship between the typology and the forest owners' background was tested. Principal component analysis, log-linear models, canonical correlations, and K-means cluster analysis were used in the data analysis. The results showed that especially commercial timber production, but also multiple-use forestry, is important for forest owners. Non-timber products such as game, berries, and forest mushrooms were considered more important than biodiversity, conservation of endangered species, tourism, and reindeer herding. The current, more ecological forest management activities were widely accepted by the owners. The changes had been perceived in the forest management activities. Close relationships were found between the objectives, attitudes and motives of the forest owners. Those owners who emphasized ecological tourism and multiple-use forestry, more frequently accepted detailed conservation and other "softer" management methods than those who emphasized commercial timber production. Typologies, called conservationists, timber producers, and multi-objective forest owners, were identified. Forest owner's education and source of income were closely related to their typology. Highly educated forest owners and those who gained their money from tourism belonged to the groups named conservationists or multi-objective owners, whereas those who lived on forestry income represented timber producers.

AB  - Significant parts of Fennoscandia have been used by Saami reindeer husbandry for many centuries, and this has altered the vegetation cover. Cultural remains like abandoned reindeer pens (giedtieh) and milking pens (buhtjeme-aevieh) are found in connection to abandoned seasonal dwellings (laavth-gaetieh and derhvie-gaetieh) for the reindeer Saami groups. The abandoned pens still appear as oval shaped areas of luxuriant grass- and herb-rich vegetation surrounded by meager mountain vegetation, due to slow growth of vegetation. This paper presents a study on using visual analysis of aerial and satellite imagery, multispectral classification (hyper-clustering) and linear spectral unmixing (SAM) of satellite imagery to detect Saami cultural remains. Visual analysis of high spatial resolution satellite imagery (QuickBird-2) and aerial photography enabled detection of maintained and abandoned reindeer pens, milking pens and old individual dwelling sites. Signs of them can also be detected by middle resolution imagery (Landsat TM/ETM+ and IRS-P6) but are to coarse to use since the spatial extent of these remains is to small to detect without prior knowledge of their location in the landscape. Using the classification methods on the fused Landsat ETM+ PAN imagery, we were able to detect the pens substantial to almost perfect (70-95% accuracy). The hyper-clustering method was slightly better than the SAM-method, but the first was more labor demanding. The results from this study show that use of satellite imagery is a helpful tool for the detection of even subtle traces in vegetation of cultural activities in large-scale mountain landscapes.

AB  - Canopy-forming macroalgae living on rocky bottoms provide valuable ecosystem services but long-term eutrophication has narrowed their distribution and depth zonation in the Baltic Sea. The spatial distribution of macroalgae is shaped by many factors, such as light, salinity, nutrients and wave exposure. In addition, the lack of suitable hard substrates limits the distribution of algae in many areas. Analysing how the spatial distribution of macroalgae is modified by changes in environmental conditions is relevant for focusing management actions. To quantify the resultant distribution under various environmental and management scenarios, both current environmental conditions and substrate limitation need to be considered. We estimated the potential distribution area of bladderwrack Fucus spp. under 11 water transparency scenarios in 9 Finnish sea areas differing in morphology and eutrophication status. The prevailing averaged long-term water transparency conditions were interpreted from satellite images. Ten scenarios were calculated based on hypothetical changes in euphotic depth from -50% to +50% of the present. Species distribution modelling was used to assess the potential distribution areas of Fucus. In addition, to quantify the influence of substrate limitation, we estimated the average substrate limitation with two correction methods: (i) by using field data from underwater videos within the predicted distribution areas and (ii) by using a habitat model representing the distribution of reefs (i.e. rocky bottoms) in the study area. The decrease of euphotic depth by 50% from the present level narrowed the distribution area of Fucus by 24-53% in the Southwestern archipelago, 55-70% in the Gulf of Finland, 37-66% in the Bothnian Sea and 59-100% in Kvarken. An increase in euphotic depth significantly broadened the spatial distribution of Fucus. Decreasing share of suitable hard substrate along depth gradient however hinders broadening of the distribution area. If all areas were suitable for growth, a 50% increase in euphotic depth would expand the distribution area by 124-803%, depending on area. When only suitable substrates were taken into account, this percentage remained at 9-270%. We conclude that substrate limitation needs to be taken into account when estimating macroalgal species distribution in the marine environment. We show how this can be done also when comprehensive bottom substrate maps are not available. Our results are valuable when setting the targets for environmental management plans, and for balancing the local management measures in a cost effective manner.

AB  - Urban greenspace (UGS) is important for human wellbeing, particularly physical and mental health, and is claimed to support social cohesion. However, the expansion and densification of urban centres in recent decades has occurred largely at the expense of UGS. This risks its attractiveness for users. Although recent research has identified various factors that influence the use of UGS in different contexts, few studies have taken an explicit, bottom-up approach to understand which factors constrain willingness to use it. This study analyses responses from an online survey in Sweden (N = 2806) to identify the main constraints to UGS usage, and for whom these are constraints. Respondents could select from 22 different types of constraints - relating to incivilities, man-agement, accessibility and availability, safety, and personal issues. Respondents could also provide comments to identify additional constraints. Incivilities were the most perceived problem. For example, litter was selected by 53% of respondents, while vandalism was selected by 24%. At the same time, many respondents perceived few or no constraints - 59% stated that nothing prevented them from using UGS, while 35% stated that they saw no problems. Safety-related and accessibility/availability constraints were not strongly identified although many respondents commented that UGS in Sweden is inadequate given the large number of users, and that the UGS that people want to use the most is often inaccessible without a car. Multiple binary logistic regression was used to investigate relationships between perceptions of constraints and fourteen predictor variables. Odds ratios were used to determine whether significant (p < 0.05) relationships were meaningful. Our findings show that different groups have starkly divergent perceptions of constraints relating to UGS. Several key factors - including age, self -reported nature-connectedness, distance to UGS, and frequency of use - were associated with a heightened likelihood of perceiving different groups of constraints. However, relationships between constraints and factors relating to environmental justice were not straightforward. These findings indicate the complexity of UGS planning challenges relating to densification, the New Urban Agenda and promotion of societal benefits, and a need to further integrate multiple user perspectives, especially of younger adults and infrequent users.

AB  - Biocrusts can be found in a wide array of habitats, where they provide important ecosystem services. These microbial associations are particularly important in High Arctic environments, where biocrust colonize the newly exposed barren soil after glacier retreat and significantly contribute to soil stabilization and nutrient cycling. Starting from incipient, structurally simple biolayers, they develop in complexity, increasing from the glacier terminus. Starting from a simple community structure, mainly constituted by cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria and fungi immersed in a self-secreted extracellular polymeric matrix (cyanobacterial crusts), they later may recruit mosses and lichens (moss crusts and lichen crusts, respectively). The extracellular polymeric matrix protects the biocrust community from abiotic constraints, notably drought and freezing stress, from external physical harming factors, and from predation. The physicochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix are related to several of its properties, such as its soil-stabilizing effect and water retention. We analysed the chemical (monosaccharidic composition) and macromolecular (molecular weight distribution) properties of the extracellular polymeric matrix of biocrusts with different morphologies collected in northwestern Spitsbergen, Norway. The uronic acid content and molecular weight (MW) distribution of the extracellular polysaccharidic matrices (EPMs) appeared in accordance with the developmental stages of the biocrusts. The MW distribution also showed significant differences between the samples, possibly reflecting differences in microbial enzymatic activities leading to the degradation of high-MW polymers into smaller compounds. The MW distribution profiles presented some important differences, reflecting differences in environmental conditions and, probably, the seasonal variance in microbial community composition that is known to characterize the environment examined in the present study.

AB  - Plant communities are attracting increased interest in connection with forest and landscape inventories due to society's interest in ecosystem services. However, the acquisition of accurate information about plant communities poses several methodological challenges. Here, we investigate the use of presence-absence sampling with the aim to monitor state and change in plant density. We study what plot sizes are informative, i.e. the estimators should have as high precision as possible.
   Plant occurrences were modelled through different Poisson processes and tests were developed for assessing the plausibility of the model assumptions. Optimum plot sizes were determined by minimizing the variance of the estimators. While state estimators of similar kind as ours have been proposed in previous studies, our tests and change estimation procedures are new.
   We found that the most informative plot size for state estimation is 1.6 divided by the plant density, i.e. if the true density is 1 plant per square metre the optimum plot size is 1.6 square metres. This is in accordance with previous findings. More importantly, the most informative plot size for change estimation was smaller and depended on the change patterns. We provide theoretical results as well as some empirical results based on data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory.
   Use of too small or too large plots resulted in poor precision of the density (and density change) estimators. As a consequence, a range of different plot sizes would be required for jointly monitoring both common and rare plants using presence-absence sampling in monitoring programmes.

AB  - Vascular plant observances were compiled for 10 well-documented parishes in Scania, southernmost Sweden, from published floras, herbarium specimens, modern inventories, and a large citizen-science database to provide decade-level presence/absence data of species throughout the period 1800-2020. Species-specific plant traits and ecological indicator values were then used to examine functional and ecological changes based on the species composition, as well as the performance of particular vegetation types. The results were generally congruent among the 10 parishes, and indicate that several of the most important drivers of recent floristic changes, including climate changes, woody encroachment, and soil chemistry alterations have in fact acted continuously and concerted for more than a century. Floristic composition has shifted in favor of species with an affinity to higher N and P levels, as well as species which are generally more long-lived and competitive. Additionally, species less favored by grazing/mowing, and with lower demand for sunlight and moisture have increased. However, several of these trends appear to have accelerated over the past 50 years, and so has the increase of the proportion of alien invasive species in the flora. Species favored by climatic warming have also increased, at least since the 1970's. The flora of different parts of the province has become more homogenous over time, indicating a loss of biodiversity at the regional, but not at the local scale. Instead, analyses of the biodiversity relevance, associated non-plant species and ecosystem services such as nectar production provided by the flora, suggest that local biodiversity is likely to have increased. The study demonstrates that even highly fragmented data, if compiled from a multitude of sources spanning centuries, may reveal congruent temporal changes in both biodiversity, ecosystem functions and ecological drivers and provide a historic context for monitoring recent and future changes.

AB  - Hydropower, as a flexible energy source, has sparked renewed interest in the ongoing decarbonisation of the society. Simultaneously, a wider transformation of the socio-ecological system towards more sustainable practices of energy production is required. Our paper draws from the sustainable transformation theory and the concepts of transformability, hydro-social cycle, and aquatic regime to study a system of water governance and regulation in Finland. Our case study data consists of 16 semi-structured interviews and 207 news articles from Yle national broadcast company. We studied the policy frames to reveal how the water governance actors understand, view and make sense of future river use and restoration, and how they utilise the frames for strategic purposes. Results demonstrate that the future river use and restoration were framed by four modes of thinking: 1) hydropower as a 'cultural trauma', 2) restoring rivers and dam removal after hydropower construction and operation to improve ecological flows in rivers, 3) improving the social acceptance of hydropower and dam removal, and 4) improving the efficiency of the hydropower regime as a flexible source of power. Our paper shows that to enable pathways for socio-ecological-technical transformations of aquatic ecosystems further scientific scrutiny should be focused on reconciliation of the interest of river restoration, recreational uses of aquatic environments and the flexible energy function of hydropower in energy transition. Removal of migration barriers and small-scale hydropower plants and building fishways and bypasses are part of this transformation. Furthermore, the river regulation needed to give impoundment facilities the flexibility, causes changes in water levels which may be a potential source of conflict between riparian residents and hydropower operators. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on water governance that recognises the local dynamics and interactions within the social-ecological systems.

AB  - Expectations of what forests and woodlands should provide vary among locations, stakeholder groups, and over time. Developing multifunctional forests requires understanding of the dynamic roles of traditions and cultural legacies in social-ecological systems at multiple levels and scales. Implementing policies about multifunctional forests requires a landscape and social-ecological perspective, and recognition of both spatial and temporal features at multiple scales. This study explores the dissemination of even-aged silviculture in central, eastern and northern Europe, and the consequences of choosing different vantage points in social-ecological systems for mapping of barriers, and to identify levers, towards multifunctional forest landscapes. Using a narrative approach, we first summarise the development of even-aged silviculture in four European regions. Next, we focus on Sweden as a keen adopter of even-aged silviculture, and identify levers at three groups of vantage points. They were (1) biosphere with biodiversity as short-hand for composition, structure and function of ecosystems, which support human well-being at multiple scales; (2) society in terms of different levels of stakeholder interactions from local to global, and (3) economy represented by value chain hierarchies and currencies. The emergence of even-aged silviculture >200 years ago formed an expanding frontier from central to northern Europe. Sustained yield wood production and biodiversity conservation encompass different portfolios of ecosystem aspects and spatio-temporal scales. Ignorance and lack of knowledge about these differences enforce their mutual rivalry. An exploratory review of six groups of stakeholders at multiple levels in the traditional industrial forest value chain highlights inequalities in terms of distribution of income and power across different levels of governance. This effectively marginalises other than powerful industrial actors. The distribution of financial results along the value chain is dynamic in space and time, and not all benefits of forest ecosystems can be measured using monetary valuation. There are also other currencies and incentives. A discussion of cultural trajectories in central and eastern European, Russian and Swedish forest management illustrates that forest history patterns repeat themselves. Longitudinal case studies of countries and regions can help foster holistic multi-dimensional and multilevel systems thinking. Application of deep levers of change is likely to require external drivers. A key challenge is to handle the manufacturing of doubt and decay of truth, i.e., the appearance of alternative facts, and the diminishing role of evidence and systems analyses in political and civic discourses. This transition is fuelled by new and rapidly evolving digital arenas.

AB  - This case study explores a learning situation in a forest garden in Sweden. A forest garden is an edible polyculture landscape with different layers of mostly perennial vegetation. The forest garden is designed to maximize the yield of useful plants while minimizing the input of energy and resources, including human labour. Forest gardens may offer learning situations that contextualize interconnectedness and relations between organisms as well as situations that are beneficial for evaluative development (Keller t, 2002), i.e. the development of values, beliefs and moral perspectives in children.
   Twenty-seven seven to eight year old primary school children were followed in the first six months of a three year project in which they participated in developing a forest garden.
   The aim of the study is to investigate how the children reason with respect to different organisms' dependence on and relations to each other, themselves included. Specifically: How do the children describe their own relationships with other organisms, as well as the relationships between other organisms in the forest garden?
   What values of nature are expressed by the children, and in relation to which situations in the forest garden? Data were collected in the form of field notes, audio and video recordings and photos from the children's visits to the forest garden. The photos were used for stimulated recall in focus group interviews. The data were analysed using a combination of qualitative content analysis (Patton, 2002) and semi-quantitative methods.
   The children in the study presented a unidirectional perspective about the relationship between themselves and the organisms, especially the insects, in the forest garden. Rather than asking what these organisms can do for me/us, they pose the question: What can I/we do for the bugs/plants/ bees?
   The humanistic values, expressed by the children as a willingness to help other organisms (mostly insects) are in line with the explicit aims of the former curriculum for Biology to "promote care and respect for nature". We should note that these humanistic values are no longer explicitly stated in the current curriculum. It is striking that the anthropocentric ecosystem services perspective (introduced in the current curriculum from grade 4), is so rare in the data. The children seldom mentioned the benefits for humans from insect pollination, even though this relationship is clearly stated by the pedagogues together with humanistic values.
   In observations, the children showed a great deal of curiosity for the natural environment (naturalistic value) as well as joy and enthusiasm about participating in the different activities that took place in the forest garden. Aesthetic values were expressed in relation to flowers, cones, berries, a snail's shell etc. This study shows that forest gardens have the potential to be places where children can connect emotionally and cognitively to other organisms.

AB  - Trees have the potential to improve urban air quality as leaves and needles capture air pollutants from the air, but further empirical data has been requested to quantify these effects. We measured the concentration of 32 poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in leaves of pin oak (Quercus palustris) and needles of black pine (Pinus nigra) in the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, during the summer of 2018. Oak leaves were collected twice (June, Sep-tember), while one-year-old (C + 1) and three-year-old (C + 3) pine needles were sampled in June to study the temporal development of leaf/needle PAH concentrations. Specific leaf area (SLA) was estimated, which permit-ted calculation of leaf/needle area-based PAH content that were compared with the mass-based concentration. In addition, the air concentration of PAHs and NO2 was measured using passive samplers. There was a strong correlation between air concentrations of PAH and NO2, indicating that the pollutants to a large degree originate from the same sources. In the oak leaves there was a significant decrease in low molecular mass PAHs (L-PAH, mainly gaseous) between June and September, but a significant increase in high molecular mass PAHs (H-PAH, mainly particle-bound). There was a strong correlation between L-PAH concentration in leaves and in air indicating an influence of equilibrium processes between ambient air and leaf. In the pine needles, there was a significant increase of both L-PAH and H-PAH in three-year-old needles compared to one-year-old needles. Pine was superior to oak in accumulating PAHs from the air, especially for L-PAHs when comparing area-based content. However, H-PAH concentrations were higher in oak leaves compared to pine needles on a leaf mass basis, emphasizing the importance of how concentrations are expressed. The results from this study can contribute to the development of urban planning strategies regarding the effect of vegetation on air quality. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose of Review(1) To develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the Saami people; (2) to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of climate change on Saami culture and Sapmi region; and (3) to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well-being of the Saami.
   Recent Findings The Saami health is on average similar, or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area. Warming climate has already influenced Saami reindeer culture. Mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns.
   Summary The lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the Saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of Saami. Possibilities for Saami to adapt to climate change are limited.

AB  - This review presents how the boreal and the tropical forests affect the atmosphere, its chemical composition, its function, and further how that affects the climate and, in return, the ecosystems through feedback processes. Observations from key tower sites standing out due to their long-term comprehensive observations: The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory in Central Amazonia, the Zotino Tall Tower Observatory in Siberia, and the Station to Measure Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations at Hyytiala in Finland. The review is complemented by short-term observations from networks and large experiments.
   The review discusses atmospheric chemistry observations, aerosol formation and processing, physiochemical aerosol, and cloud condensation nuclei properties and finds surprising similarities and important differences in the two ecosystems. The aerosol concentrations and chemistry are similar, particularly concerning the main chemical components, both dominated by an organic fraction, while the boreal ecosystem has generally higher concentrations of inorganics, due to higher influence of long-range transported air pollution. The emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds are dominated by isoprene and monoterpene in the tropical and boreal regions, respectively, being the main precursors of the organic aerosol fraction.
   Observations and modeling studies show that climate change and deforestation affect the ecosystems such that the carbon and hydrological cycles in Amazonia are changing to carbon neutrality and affect precipitation downwind. In Africa, the tropical forests are so far maintaining their carbon sink.
   It is urgent to better understand the interaction between these major ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate, which calls for more observation sites, providing long-term data on water, carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles. This is essential in finding a sustainable balance between forest preservation and reforestation versus a potential increase in food production and biofuels, which are critical in maintaining ecosystem services and global climate stability. Reducing global warming and deforestation is vital for tropical forests.

AB  - Sami reindeer herders in northern Fennoscandia have historically cut trees with high quantities of arboreal lichens to feed their animals during harsh winters. In this study we analysed temporal and spatial patterns of lichen-tree cuttings of Scots pine in a remote forest landscape in northern Sweden. We wanted to test the hypothesis that repeated cutting of such trees may have had long-lasting effects on the forest ecosystem that are still discernable today. Our analyses included an inventory of remaining lichen-tree stumps, and a field survey of forest variables to relate structural variation within the forest to these cuttings. We used dendrochronological methods to date stumps and reconstruct forest structure. Our results show that more than 7,000 trees were cut for this purpose over a period of almost 300 years within an area covering 6 km(2). Lichen-tree cutting was most intense during the late 18th century when ca. 600-1,000 trees were cut during each decade. We did not detect any significant relationship between past lichen-tree cutting and present small-scale forest heterogeneity, and suggest that this might be due to the small size of the cut trees and the long time elapsed since most of the cuttings. We conclude that vestiges such as stumps from lichen-tree cutting are highly valuable for our understanding of past land use. Furthermore, since they are located in an unlogged and very old forest, this highlights the need to acknowledge the interconnectedness between ecological and cultural values of such forests and the need to identify and protect them.

AB  - Past In the early twentieth century, forestry was one of the most important sectors in Norway and an agitated discussion about the perceived decline of forest resources due to over-exploitation was ongoing. To base the discussion on facts, the young state of Norway establishedLandsskogtakseringen- the world's first National Forest Inventory (NFI). Field work started in 1919 and was carried out by county. Trees were recorded on 10 m wide strips with 1-5 km interspaces. Site quality and land cover categories were recorded along each strip. Results for the first county were published in 1920, and by 1930 most forests below the coniferous tree line were inventoried. The 2nd to 5th inventories followed in the years 1937-1986. As of 1954, temporary sample plot clusters on a 3 km x 3 km grid were used as sampling units. Present The current NFI grid was implemented in the 6th NFI from 1986 to 1993, when permanent plots on a 3 km x 3 km grid were established below the coniferous tree line. As of the 7th inventory in 1994, the NFI is continuous, and 1/5 of the plots are measured annually. All trees with a diameter >= 5 cm are recorded on circular, 250 m(2)plots. The NFI grid was expanded in 2005 to cover alpine regions with 3 km x 9 km and 9 km x 9 km grids. In 2012, the NFI grid within forest reserves was doubled along the cardinal directions. Clustered temporary plots are used periodically to facilitate county-level estimates. As of today, more than 120 variables are recorded in the NFI including bilberry cover, drainage status, deadwood, and forest health. Land-use changes are monitored and trees outside forests are recorded. Future Considerable research efforts towards the integration of remote sensing technologies enable the publication of the Norwegian Forest Resource Map since 2015, which is also used for small area estimation at the municipality level. On the analysis side, capacity and software for long term growth and yield prognosis are being developed. Furthermore, we foresee the inclusion of further variables for monitoring ecosystem services, and an increasing demand for mapped information. The relatively simple NFI design has proven to be a robust choice for satisfying steadily increasing information needs and concurrently providing consistent time series.

AB  - Conservation biological control (CBC) is a promising tool for ecological intensification that aims to establish resilient natural enemy populations that contribute to pest management with reduced use of pesticides and at the same time support native biodiversity in agroecosystems. Yet the impact of natural enemies in CBC is often limited due to missing resources such as food, habitat, and hibernation shelters. Here, we studied a CBC strategy that incorporates these essential resources combined with semiochemicals, focusing on how the common green lacewing can enhance biological control of aphids.
   In a 4-year field study conducted at three locations in the region of East Norway, we developed a CBC strategy combining the three measures ATTRACT (a ternary attractant that increase lacewing egg laying), FOOD (floral buffer strips), and SHELTER (insect hotels for overwintering survival) to increase aphid biological control in spring barley. We recorded the number of lacewings, ladybirds, hoverflies, parasitized aphid mummies, and the two cereal aphid species Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi. Our CBC strategy resulted in a significant increase in lacewing activity and significant aphid suppression. At all three locations and over the 4-year period, aphid infestation was below the economic damage threshold in the field plots using CBC measures. In contrast, during two of the years, the density of the aphid infestation in the control plots was significantly above the damage threshold. We found evidence that use of the ternary attractant supported green lacewings but led to loss of ladybirds, hoverflies, and parasitoids, even though flower strips were used as alternative resources.
   Our study shows a promising increase in lacewing activity in the agricultural landscape and high biological control of aphids in barley. Long-term field studies are needed to evaluate the impact on non-target species and the agroecosystem before practical application of this approach can be considered. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Transboundary nature protected areas constitute a considerable proportion of all the existing spatial forms of biodiversity protection. One prominent example is the Bialowieza Forest, shared by Poland and Belarus. There is a considerable literature on allocation of funds to preserving nature shared by several countries. Some of this literature assess the funding schemes and the impacts on biodiversity within the EU. A particular challenge for the Bialowieza Forest is that the larger part of it is outside the EU border. There has been less research on the economic benefits that citizens attach to protected transboundary land nature on the other side of the border. We are trying to fill the gap by finding out and comparing preferences towards increased protection of domestic and foreign segments of the transboundary Bialowieza Forest, stated by samples of Polish and Belarusian citizens. The results of a discrete choice experiment show an almost unilateral preference for nature conservation, passive protection of forest land, on the domestic side. Whilst Polish respondents on average are willing to pay for an increased area under protection, on their side of the border, most Belarusians seem to be satisfied with the status quo. Taken at face value, there is even an apparent mutual disutility derived from the perspective of co-financing bilateral passive protection programmes in the Bialowieza Forest. By use of latent class analyses of responses, a group of the Polish sample willing to contribute to the transboundary conservation is identified and described, and compared against the non-cooperative groups on both sides of the border. The results can to some extent be explained by a strict border division with a high fence, by differences in welfare or by behavioural reasons. However, it cannot be ruled out that the affected populations simply do not perceive the Bialowieza Forest as a binational public good.

AB  - Research Highlights: The European Union's last large intact forest landscapes along the Scandinavian Mountain range in Sweden o ff er unique opportunities for conservation of biodiversity, ecological integrity and resilience. However, these forests are at a crossroad between intensified wood production aimed at bio-economy, and rural development based on multi-functional forest landscapes for future-oriented forest value chains. Background and Objectives: We (1) estimate the area of near-natural forests potentially remaining for forest harvesting and wood production, or as green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation and human well-being in rural areas, (2) review how forest and conservation policies have so far succeeded to reduce the loss of mountain forests, and (3) discuss what economic, socio-cultural and ecological values that are at stake, as well as different governance and management solutions. Materials andMethods: First, we estimated the remaining amount of intact mountain forests using (1) the Swedish National Forest Inventory, (2) protected area statistics, (3) forest harvest permit applications and actually harvested forests, (4) remote sensing wall-to-wall data on forests not subject to clear-felling since the mid-1950s, (5) mapping of productive and non-productive forestland, and (6) estimates of mean annual final felling rate. Second, we review policy documents related to the emergence of land use regulation in north Sweden, including the mountain forest border, and illustrate this with an actual case that has had significant policy implementation importance. Results: There is a clear difference between the proportions of formally protected productive forestland above the mountain forest border (52.5%) and north Sweden in general (6.3%). A total of 300,000 ha of previously not clear-felled mountain forest outside protected areas remain, which can support novel value chains that are not achievable elsewhere. Conclusions: The mountain forests in Sweden provide unique conservation values in the European Union. Since the beginning of the 1990s, policy regulations have been successful in limiting forest harvesting. Currently, however, mountain forests are a battle ground regarding intensification of forest use, including logging of forests that have never been subject to clear-felling systems vs. nature conservation and wilderness as a base for rural development. The ability of mountain municipalities to encourage sustainable rural forest landscapes must be strengthened.

AB  - At the heart of debate surrounding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) lies an inherent anxiety over the division of responsibility between states and corporations. Commonly taken for granted is a natural and a priori separation of government and market activities. This paper provides a critique of the conceptual division of responsibility between 'state' and 'market' actors, and explores the politically ambivalent roles of state financed companies in global CSR dialogues on the rights of Indigenous Peoples. It uses a case concerning logging on Saami reindeer herding territory, and explores a particularly Finnish articulation of CSR and supply-chain management in the Finnish forestry and paper sector.

AB  - The Sami are recognized as an Indigenous people and a national minority in both Norway and Sweden, and their involvement in any planning concerning their traditional territories is required. The aim of this article is to examine how Sami interests are secured and institutionalized in municipal comprehensive planning (MCP). We use two case study areas: Sortland municipality in Norway and Vilhelmina municipality in Sweden. Analysis of various qualitative materials indicates that, despite contextual and institutional differences, the planning processes in the case study areas have similar outcomes. We conclude that formal rights of the Sami are not always acknowledged by the politicians who make the final decision. Rather, the Sami depend on the politicians' willingness to consider their needs.

AB  - 1. A major challenge in biodiversity conservation is to facilitate viable populations of large apex predators in ecosystems where they were recently driven to ecological extinction due to resource conflict with humans.
   2. Monetary compensation for losses of livestock due to predation is currently a key instrument to encourage human-carnivore coexistence. However, a lack of quantitative estimates of livestock losses due to predation leads to disagreement over the practice of compensation payments. This disagreement sustains the human-carnivore conflict.
   3. The level of depredation on year-round, free-ranging, semi-domestic reindeer by large carnivores in Fennoscandia has been widely debated over several decades. In Norway, the reindeer herders claim that lynx and wolverine cause losses of tens of thousands of animals annually and cause negative population growth in herds. Conversely, previous research has suggested that monetary predator compensation can result in positive population growth in the husbandry, with cascading negative effects of high grazer densities on the biodiversity in tundra ecosystems.
   4. We utilized a long-term, large-scale data set to estimate the relative importance of lynx and wolverine predation and density-dependent and climatic food limitation on claims for losses, recruitment and population growth rates in Norwegian reindeer husbandry.
   5. Claims of losses increased with increasing predator densities, but with no detectable effect on population growth rates. Density-dependent and climatic effects on claims of losses, recruitment and population growth rates were much stronger than the effects of variation in lynx and wolverine densities.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis provides a quantitative basis for predator compensation and estimation of the costs of reintroducing lynx and wolverine in areas with free-ranging semi-domestic reindeer. We outline a potential path for conflict management which involves adaptive monitoring programmes, open access to data, herder involvement and development of management strategy evaluation (MSE) models to disentangle complex responses including multiple stakeholders and individual harvester decisions.

AB  - 1. Experimental studies linking community composition to functioning are typically confined to small and closed micro- or mesocosms. Such restricted conditions may affect both species' biology and their environment. Yet, targeting simple features in the behaviour of species may circumvent these constraints. Focusing on ecological functions provided by dung beetles, we test whether large, open-top cages - MESOCLOSURES - will intercept the flight trajectories of beetles, thereby allowing manipulation of local community composition.
   2. MESOCLOSURES were built in both tropical forest (Brazil) and temperate grasslands (Finland), thus testing their general efficiency. Within the respective environments, we varied different aspects of MESOCLOSURE design: in the tropical forest, we examined the impact of MESOCLOSURE dimensions on exclusion efficiency, whereas in the temperate grassland, we assessed the potential for selectively excluding and including community members by different mesh sizes. In the temperate environment, we also went from method to application, using MESOCLOSURES to relate community composition to functioning under two simulated grazing regimes.
   3. MESOCLOSURES allowed efficient manipulation of dung beetle communities, maintaining dung beetle densities at intended levels in both temperate and tropical systems. In the tropics, the smallest cages (1x1m) offered the highest contrast in beetle densities inside vs. outside of the fence, whereas the largest cages (9x9m) offered the lowest. Nonetheless, densities inside cages never exceed one-fifth of those outside. At the temperate site, manipulations of community structure through mesh size yielded significant differences in functioning and suggested an interaction between small dung-dwelling species and large tunnelling species. Within cages, higher grazing was reflected in augmented dung removal.
   4.We conclude that MESOCLOSURES can be effectively used to study dung beetle functions across habitats and latitudes. As applied insights, the present study adds resolution to the significance of different functional groups of dung beetles and shows that grazing pressure may have an important impact on the ecosystem functions that they provide. Overall, this study suggests that targeted manipulation of dispersal may offer new solutions for linking fauna to ecosystem functions with minimal impact on the processes measured.

AB  - Understanding the full diet of natural enemies is necessary for evaluating their role as biocontrol agents, because many enemy species do not only feed on pests but also on other natural enemies. Such intraguild predation can compromise pest control if the consumed enemies are actually better for pest control than their predators. In this study, we used gut metabarcoding to quantify diets of all common arachnid species in Swedish and Spanish apple orchards. For this purpose, we designed new primers that reduce amplification of arachnid predators while retaining high amplification of all prey groups. Results suggest that most arachnids consume a large range of putative pest species on apple but also a high proportion of other natural enemies, where the latter constitute almost a third of all prey sequences. Intraguild predation also varied between regions, with a larger content of heteropteran bugs in arachnid guts from Spanish orchards, but not between orchard types. There was also a tendency for cursorial spiders to have more intraguild prey in the gut than web spiders. Two groups that may be overlooked as important biocontrol agents in apple orchards seem to be theridiid web spiders and opilionids, where the latter had several small-bodied pest species in the gut. These results thus provide important guidance for what arachnid groups should be targets of management actions, even though additional information is needed to quantify all direct and indirect interactions occurring in the complex arthropod food webs in fruit orchards.

AB  - Loss of natural forests by forest clearcutting has been identified as a critical conservation challenge worldwide. This study addressed forest fragmentation and loss in the context of the establishment of a functional green infrastructure as a spatiotemporally connected landscape-scale network of habitats enhancing biodiversity, favorable conservation status, and ecosystem services. Through retrospective analysis of satellite images, we assessed a 50- to 60-year spatiotemporal clearcutting impact trajectory on natural and near-natural boreal forests across a sizable and representative region from the Gulf of Bothnia to the Scandinavian Mountain Range in northern Fennoscandia. This period broadly covers the whole forest clearcutting period; thus, our approach and results can be applied to comprehensive impact assessment of industrial forest management. The entire study region covers close to 46,000 km(2) of forest-dominated landscape in a late phase of transition from a natural or near-natural to a land-use modified state. We found a substantial loss of intact forest, in particular of large, contiguous areas, a spatial polarization of remaining forest on regional scale where the inland has been more severely affected than the mountain and coastal zones, and a pronounced impact on interior forest core areas. Salient results were a decrease in area of the largest intact forest patch from 225,853 to 68,714 ha in the mountain zone and from 257,715 to 38,668 ha in the foothills zone, a decrease from 75% to 38% intact forest in the inland zones, a decrease in largest patch core area (assessed by considering 100-m patch edge disturbance) from 6114 to 351 ha in the coastal zone, and a geographic imbalance in protected forest with an evident predominance in the mountain zone. These results demonstrate profound disturbance of configuration of the natural forest landscape and disrupted connectivity, which challenges the establishment of functional green infrastructure. Our approach supports the identification of forests for expanded protection and conservation-oriented forest landscape restoration.

AB  - Governance networks play an increasingly important role in ecosystem management. The collaboration within these governance networks can be formalized or informal, top-down or bottom-up, and designed or self-organized. Informal self-organized governance networks may increase legitimacy if a variety of stakeholders are involved, but at the same time, accountability becomes blurred when decisions are taken. Basically, democratic accountability refers to ways in which citizens can control their government and the mechanisms for doing so. Scholars in ecosystem management are generally positive to policy/governance networks and emphasize its potential for enhancing social learning, adaptability, and resilience in social-ecological systems. Political scientists, on the other hand, have emphasized the risk that the public interest may be threatened by governance networks. I describe and analyze the multilevel governance network of Kristianstads Vattenrike Biosphere Reserve (KVBR) in Southern Sweden, with the aim of understanding whether and how accountability is secured in the governance network and its relation to representative democracy. The analysis suggests that the governance network of KVBR complements representative democracy. It deals mainly with "low politics"; the learning and policy directions are developed in the governance network, but the decisions are embedded in representative democratic structures. Because several organizations and agencies co-own the process and are committed to the outcomes, there is a shared or extended accountability. A recent large investment in KVBR caused a major crisis at the municipal level, fueled by the financial crisis. The higher levels of the governance network, however, served as a social memory and enhanced resilience of the present biosphere development trajectory. For self-organized networks, legitimacy is the bridge between adaptability and accountability; accountability is secured as long as the adaptive governance network performs well, i.e., is perceived as legitimate. Governing and ensuring accountability of governance networks, without hampering their flexibility, adaptability, and innovativeness, represents a new challenge for the modern state.

AB  - The global extraction of minerals is commonly located in areas populated by indigenous people; and while conflicts between multinational corporations and local activists and indigenous people are widespread today, the understanding of their dynamics are lacking. The Swedish government's encouragement to an expanding mining industry has caused resistance due to environmental and social implications, particularly its effect on Sarni reindeer husbandry. The resistance to a mine in Gallok is based on the belief that the right to decide about land use historically falls on the Sarni people, and the right to affect land use is detrimental for the survival of Sarni culture and reindeer husbandry. Although the conflict may be perceived as concerning access to natural resources, we argue that the perceived environmental conflict can be viewed as part of a larger struggle over social status and recognition. Data have been collected using qualitative methods such as observations, interviews and documents. The subsequent analysis relies on a meta-theoretical framework of justice as recognition using a typology of relations of power. Our findings suggest that relations of power constitute different categories of social actors. Stakeholders like the Sami population are subordinated to more dominant stakeholders such as the government, the company and media, who have 'more' power or 'different' kinds of power 'over' others. Through these asymmetric power relations, historicalstate-Sami relations are continuously reproduced within prevailing institutions, and also in this mining conflict. Interviewees from business and the municipality testified to the discourses driven by a neoliberal and profit-focused worldview. Challenging the neoliberal discourse, other stakeholders, namely civil society and Sami, expressed an alternative discourse based on a local, traditional, cultural, environmental and anti-neoliberal worldview.

AB  - Trees in the urban right of way areas have increasingly been considered part of a suite of green infrastructure practices used to manage stormwater runoff. A paired-catchment experimental design (with street tree removal as the treatment) was used to assess how street trees affect major hydrologic fluxes in a typical residential stormwater collection and conveyance network. The treatment consisted of removing 29 green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and two Norway maple (Ater platanoides) street trees from a medium-density residential area. Tree removal resulted in an estimated 198 m(3) increase in surface runoff volume compared to the control catchment over the course of the study. This increase accounted for 4% of the total measured runoff after trees were removed. Despite significant changes to runoff volume (p <= 0.10), peak discharge was generally not affected by tree removal. On a per-tree basis, 66 L of rainfall per m(2) of canopy was lost that would have otherwise been intercepted and stored. Runoff volume reduction benefit was estimated at 6376 L per tree. These values experimentally document per-capita retention services rendered by trees over a growing season with 42 storm events. These values are within the range reported by previous studies, which largely relied on simulation. This study provides catchment scale evidence that reducing stormwater runoff is one of many ecosystem services provided by street trees. This study quantifies these services, based on site conditions and a mix of dedduous species, and serves to improve our ability to account for this important yet otherwise poorly constrained hydrologic service. Engineers, city planners, urban foresters, and others involved with the management of urban stormwater can use this information to better understand tradeoffs involved in using green infrastructure to reduce urban runoff burden.

AB  - Climatic variability often is thought to be most important for ecosystem development at ecotones, while competition is thought to be most important farther from ecotones, where neighboring plants compete for scarce resources. However, climatic variability may also modulate consequences of competition, especially under recent and future climate change. Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests are among the most important ecosystems in the mountain regions of Europe and provide various ecosystem services. Many of these forests are currently in a self-thinning, stem-exclusion phase. Understanding processes governing forest dynamics during this phase is necessary for understanding future forest structure and processes as well as effects of climatic variability on ongoing forest development. We studied growth and mortality patterns in unmanaged 100-150 years-old Norway spruce forests that originated after stand-replacing disturbances in the Parangalitsa Reserve in Bulgaria. We collected data on forest structure and tree ring samples from 648 live and dead trees (DBH >4 cm) to analyze onset, pattern and duration of mortality, as well as contributing factors.
   We found that climate extremes acted together with competition to cause sharp growth declines lasting from a few years to several decades and, in some cases, eventually led to death. The majority of dead trees had one to several consecutive growth declines, most of which initiated in response to extreme summer droughts during periods of high within-stand competition (after trees were 40-50 years old). Our tree-ring analysis revealed that some suppressed trees that died were more drought-sensitive than living trees. Other climate extremes such as unusually cold winters or summers also contributed to sharp growth reductions in some cases. Trees that died had significantly lower initial radial growth, which suggests that in the absence of external disturbances, the outcome of mortality in the stem-exclusion stage may be pre-determined from factors that determine initial growth rates. Spatial distribution data showed that there was no significant aggregation of dead and live trees and that in almost all cases, neither live nor dead trees were clustered.
   Our findings contribute to understanding mortality processes in self-thinning subalpine Norway spruce forests in Europe and show that under climate change scenarios that include more frequent future droughts, even forests in which competition is thought to be the main driver of dynamics, may experience higher rates of mortality.

AB  - Environmental policy increasingly emphasizes involvement of local users and land owners in ecosystem management, but conservation planning is still largely a bureaucratic-scientific endeavour of identifying biological values for protection. Neither biological inventories nor stakeholder analyses, that tend to focus on conflicting interests, capture human resources in the landscape or the social structures and processes underlying biological conservation values. Social-ecological inventories are therefore proposed during the preparation phase of conservation projects as a means to identify people with ecosystem knowledge that practise ecosystem management. The method presented here focuses on local steward groups acting outside official management plans. In a social-ecological inventory of a river basin of southern Sweden, local steward groups, their ecosystem management activities, motives, and links to other actors involved in ecosystem management were identified through interviews, participatory observations and a review of documents and other written material. Several hundred active local stewards were organized in 10 local steward groups that managed and monitored a range of ecosystem services at different spatial scales. Contributions of local stewards included on-site ecosystem management, long-term and detailed monitoring of species and ecosystem dynamics, local ecological knowledge, public support for ecosystem management and specialized networks. Two conservation projects are used to illustrate how local steward groups came together in multi-level networks and collaborated around specific conservation issues. The projects have been linked to ecosystem management at the landscape level through a flexible municipality organization, the Ecomuseum Kristianstads Vattenrike (EKV). EKV has acted as a 'bridging organization', coordinating and connecting many of the local steward groups to organizations and institutions at other levels. The process has been guided by social capital and shared visions for the whole landscape. The study shows that ecosystem management likely relies on multi-level collaboration and social-ecological inventories may help identify actors that are fundamental in such management systems. Social-ecological inventories should be employed in any attempt to develop and implement ecosystem management.

AB  - Global climate change has been seen to result in marked impacts on forest ecosystems such as accelerated tree mortality worldwide due to incidental hydraulic failure caused by intensified and more frequent occurrence of extreme drought and heat-waves. However, it is well understood how the tree hydrological strategies would adjust to environmental variability brough about by climate changes. Here we investigated the hydraulic adjustment as a mechanism of acclimation to different climate conditions along an altitudinal gradient in Faxon fir (Abies fargesii var. faxoniana) - a tree species that plays a key role in conservation of wildlife and maintenance of ecosystem services in subalpine forests. The hydraulic traits and selective morphological and physiological variables were measured seasonally along an altitudinal gradient from 2,800 to 3,600 m a.s.l. We found that the native percentage loss of conductivity (PLC) increased with altitude across the seasonal measurements. Both the native sapwood-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and native leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (K-1) significantly decreased with altitude for measurements in July and October, coinciding with the timing for peak growth and pre-dormancy, respectively. The morphological traits varied toward more conservative tree hydrological strategies with increases in altitude, exhibiting trade-offs with hydraulic traits. The total non-structural carbohydrates in both needle (NSCNeedle) and branch (NSCBranch) as well as photosynthetic capacity of current-year leaves played variable roles in maintaining the integrity of the hydraulic functioning and shaping the hydraulic adjustment under prevailing environmental conditions. Our findings indicate that Faxon fir possesses some degree of hydraulic adaptability to water limitation imposed by climate fluctuations in subalpine region through morphological and physiological modifications.

AB  - Ecosystems at high altitudes and latitudes are expected to be particularly vulnerable to the effects of global change. We assessed the responses of littoral invertebrate communities to changing abiotic conditions in subarctic Swedish lakes with long-term data (19882010) and compared the responses of subarctic lakes with those of more southern, hemiboreal lakes. We used a complex systems approach, based on multivariate time-series modelling, and identified dominant and distinct temporal frequencies in the data; that is, we tracked community change at distinct temporal scales. We determined the distribution of functional feeding groups of invertebrates within and across temporal scales. Within and cross-scale distributions of functions have been considered to confer resilience to ecosystems, despite changing environmental conditions. Two patterns of temporal change within the invertebrate communities were identified that were consistent across the lakes. The first pattern was one of monotonic change associated with changing abiotic lake conditions. The second was one of showing fluctuation patterns largely unrelated to gradual environmental change. Thus, two dominant and distinct temporal frequencies (temporal scales) were present in all lakes analysed. Although the contribution of individual feeding groups varied between subarctic and hemiboreal lakes, they shared overall similar functional attributes (richness, evenness, diversity) and redundancies of functions within and between the observed temporal scales. This highlights similar resilience characteristics in subarctic and hemiboreal lakes. Synthesis and applications. The effects of global change can be particularly strong at a single scale in ecosystems. Over time, this can cause monotonic change in communities and eventually lead to a loss of important ecosystem services upon reaching a critical threshold. Dynamics at other spatial or temporal scales can be unrelated to environmental change. The relative intactness' of these scales that are unaffected by global change and the persistence of functions at those scales may safeguard the whole system from the potential loss of functions at the scale at which global change impacts can be substantial. Thus, an understanding of scale-specific processes provides managers with a realistic assessment of vulnerabilities and the relative resilience of ecosystems to environmental change. Explicit consideration of intact' and affected' scales in analyses of global change impacts provides opportunities to tailor more specific management plans.

AB  - Roles of intensive reindeer grazing and several additional land use factors in the reduction in ground lichens (Cladonia spp.) in pastures grazed by the semi-domesticated reindeer have been argued in Finland. Our analysis showed that several factors and processes explain the standing biomass of lichens (during 2005-2008) and the recent changes in this biomass (after 1995-1996) on lichen pastures located in the 20 northernmost herding districts in Finland. The higher the long-term reindeer densities on the lichen pastures the lower was the lichen biomass. The lichen biomass was also strongly affected by the grazing system; the lowest biomass values of lichens were measured in all grazing areas that were used in the snow-free seasons. The lichen biomass in pine forests less than 80 years old and in all mountain type lichen pastures was lower than that in mature and old pine forests. The lichen biomass also decreased as the proportion of arboreal lichen pastures within a district decreased and the proportion of human infrastructure increased. The aerial drift of heavy metals from the Kola Peninsula appeared to reduce lichens in a small north-eastern part of the study area. Increases in summer precipitation and winter temperatures increased the amount of lichens, but increases in summer temperatures and winter precipitation had the opposite effect. Reindeer densities, grazing system, pasture type and the previous abiotic factors were also associated with the reduction in lichen biomass between the inventories. We conclude that several local, regional and even global factors and processes affect the state of reindeer pastures in large and complex grazing ecosystems. Therefore, more comprehensive research and management strategies for the entire reindeer herding environment are needed.

AB  - Forestry, as a large industry, has significant impacts on the quality of nature-based tourism landscapes in boreal forests. In Finland, the rapid growth of nature-based tourism has expanded outdoor recreation activities from protected areas into timber production forests; this is particularly so in northern Finland. This paper focuses on assessing balanced local net impacts of three alternative land-use scenarios, in which the level of integration between nature-based tourism (NBT) and traditional forestry is varied. The study is located in northern Finland in the area between two top-rated tourist resorts, Yllas and Levi. The results of the case study support the idea of an eligible integration between NBT and forestry, which takes into account scenic qualities of forested landscapes by restricting traditional management practices. In our case, the increased number of tourists (due to a more attractive forest environment) offset the losses accrued in forestry (due to restricted forest management).

FX  - What are the implications of this study for practical management decision-making? It can be argued that this study has addressed that tourism can actually generate real economic value for regions which also provide a wealth of ecosystem services. From the practical decision-making point of view, one easy-to-apply means to generate real economic value is to integrate nature-based tourism with traditional forestry in areas which possess solid local tourism demand. In such integration the costs of providing the adequate landscape quality for tourists are simply determined in a form of extra tourists needed to compensate for the losses in forestry. Currently, private forest owners are not rewarded directly for the production of forest externalities (landscape quality including sufficient recreation possibilities) resulting in that they are less willing to decide on forest management regimes that aim at improved landscape or other environmental values. In the future, a development of market-based methods to enhance the provision of amenity benefits in private lands should be developed and adapted to meet the needs of various regions in Europe. These types of approaches are currently developed in a large project NEWFOREX (New ways to Value and Market Forest Externalities) funded by the European Union under the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.

AB  - Wetlands are biodiversity hotspots that provide several essential ecosystem services. On a global scale, wetlands have greatly declined due to human activities. To counteract wetland loss, created wetlands are used as a conservation tool to facilitate biodiversity and provide habitats mainly for birds and amphibians. Fishes are likely to colonise the created wetlands and potentially affect the diversity and occurrence of amphibians. Still, species occurrence data for fish in created wetlands are largely lacking. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we investigated occurrence and co-occurrence patterns of fish and amphibian communities in 52 wetlands (some of which are ponds) created to benefit mainly bird and amphibian communities in south-central Sweden. Altogether, 17 fish and five amphibian species were detected in the created wetlands out of the 32 fish and six amphibian species found in the regional species pool. Amphibians were less common in wetlands physically connected to other wetlands. Connected wetlands were more fish-rich than isolated ones, suggesting potential fish avoidance. Additionally, the amphibian community occupied a narrower environmental niche compared to the fish community. Nevertheless, we observed only five statistically significant negative fish-amphibian species co-occurrences (out of 14 species considered). Even though our results suggest amphibian avoidance/exclusion from the created biodiversity wetlands, they also show that fish and amphibians frequently co-exist. Increased habitat heterogeneity in terms of water vegetation, size, shape, and structure of the wetland could be possible factors enabling the co-existence of these two taxa. With this study, we contribute to the general knowledge of fish occurrence patterns in created biodiversity wetlands. By comparing the frequencies of fish occurrence in natural and created wetlands, we have shown that there was some mismatch in what is common in natural compared to created wetlands. This mismatch probably comes from species-specific habitat requirements, stocking, and differences in detectability when using eDNA metabarcoding (small species detected) versus conventional multi-mesh gill-net methods (small species missed). Therefore, our results obtained using eDNA metabarcoding can complement the pre-existing knowledge of amphibian and fish associations and increase our understanding of how to create wetlands to facilitate biodiversity of several taxa.

AB  - The expansion of wind turbines plays a significant role in developing the ability of a country like Sweden to achieve climate-neutral energy production without relying on nuclear power plants. Wind-turbine energy production is expected to grow in the coming decades. Conflicts may arise between, on the one hand, the government and the energy authority, and, on the other hand, municipalities and property owners, especially if this expansion affects other economic activities, such as tourism and reindeer husbandry, or property values. This report aims to analyse the negative capitalization of wind turbines on property values in Sweden over the last ten years. Our conclusions clearly show a relatively significant capitalization and that this capitalization is relatively local, within eight kilometers of the wind power plant. Large wind turbines, or larger clusters of wind turbines in wind farms, impose a greater socio-economic cost on lower value properties.

AB  - Strong land-use pressure challenges sustainable development and calls for landscape approaches that balance economic, ecological, and socio-cultural aspects and interests. In the boreal, sub-alpine, and alpine regions in Sweden, encompassing 32 million ha, many and different land-use interests overlap, which causes risks for conflict, but potentially also suggests integration and synergy opportunities. Based on geographic information system (GIS) analyses of geographically delineated national interests regulated in the Swedish Environmental Code, including, amongst others, Natura 2000, contiguous mountains, recreation, reindeer husbandry, and wind power, and based on forestry as a dominating land use, we found extensive overlap among similar but also between dissimilar types of interest. In some mountain municipalities, our results show that the designated national interest area is four times as large as the available terrestrial area. Moreover, the overlap is much higher in the alpine than in the boreal biome, and there is increasing designation for nature conservation and a decreasing designation for national interests for culture, recreation, and tourism from south to north. We interpret the results with reference to multiple-use needs and opportunities for landscape approaches to sustainable planning. Departing from biodiversity conservation values, we also discuss opportunities to focus planning strategies on assessing synergy, integration, and conflict based on nature-based and place-based land-use characteristics.

AB  - There is an increasing interest to restore the ecosystem services that eelgrass provides, after their continuous worldwide decline. Most attempts to restore eelgrass using seeds are challenged by very high seed losses and the reasons for these losses are not all clear. We assess the impact of predation on seed loss and eelgrass establishment, and explore methods to decrease seed loss during restoration in the Swedish northwest coast. In a laboratory study we identified three previously undescribed seed predators, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, of which shore crabs consumed 2-7 times more seeds than the other two species. The importance of shore crabs as seed predators was supported in field cage experiments where one enclosed crab caused 73% loss of seeds over a 1-week period on average (similar to 21 seeds per day). Seedling establishment was significantly higher (14%) in cages that excluded predators over an 8-month period than in uncaged plots and cages that allowed predators but prevented seed-transport (0.5%), suggesting that seed predation constitutes a major source of seed loss in the study area. Burying the seeds 2 cm below the sediment surface prevented seed predation in the laboratory and decreased predation in the field, constituting a way to decrease seed loss during restoration. Shore crabs may act as a key feedback mechanism that prevent the return of eelgrass both by direct consumption of eelgrass seeds and as a predator of algal mesograzers, allowing algal mats to overgrow eelgrass beds. This shore crab feedback mechanism could become self-generating by promoting the growth of its own nursery habitat (algal mats) and by decreasing the nursery habitat (seagrass meadow) of its dominant predator (cod). This double feedback-loop is supported by a strong increase of shore crab abundance in the last decades and may partly explain the regime shift in vegetation observed along the Swedish west coast.

AB  - As a potential planting strategy, species mixing increases biomass production, improves ecosystem service functions, and mitigates climate change. However, the effect of species mixing on tree growth and drought resilience in semi-arid areas remains unclear. Hence, we established tree-ring chronologies of Robinia pseudoacacia L. in pure Robinia pseudoacacia L. plantation (RP) and mixed plantations with Hippophae rhamnoides L. and Populus simonii Carr. at differ-ent proportions of 8:2 and 5:5 (RH 8:2, RH 5:5, RC 8:2, RC 5:5) in the typical semi-arid region of the Loess Plateau (LP), China. The mean annual growth, climate-growth relationships, and tree resilience (Rs) to drought, including resistance (Rt) and recovery (Rc), were analyzed using dendrochronological methods. The results showed that the growth of R. pseudoacacia L. in mixed plantations was lower when Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) >0, but much higher than that in monoculture under drought stress (PDSI <0 or after drought event). Meanwhile, the relationship between PDSI and tree growth was significantly positive in the pure plantation, but weakened in the mixed plantations, indicat-ing that species mixing alleviated drought stress to some extent. The resilience results showed that, although the Rc was higher in monoculture after drought events, species mixing could enhance Rt and mitigate the growth decline of R. pseudoacacia L. during drought events. Moreover, the Rt varied significantly among mixing species and propor-tions and was also affected by the magnitude and timing of drought. The RC 5:5 and RH 8:2 had higher resistance to moderate and severe drought stress. However, RC 8:2 and RH 5:5 could cope better with mild drought stress. These results indicate that species mixing can alleviate drought stress and improve the drought resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to expand species mixing to maximize plantation functions and minimize the potential impacts of warming and drought in semi-arid regions.

AB  - The assessment of potential impacts of climate change on forests and forestry requires an interdisciplinary approach. This paper introduces the collaborative,German Forest Sector under Global Change" study, which was designed to demonstrate the potential of such an analysis. The objective of the study was to investigate the nature and extent of possible impacts of global climate change on forests and the forest sector in Germany. Our paper describes the overall project philosophy, as well as the scenarios for changing climate and forest management that were used in the research network. The assessment was based on inventories of national forest resources as well as on several simulation models: the forest growth simulator SILVA 2.2, the forest patch models FORSKA-M and 4C, the forest scenario model ActioSilva, a forest estate model and the forest product market model FPMM. From forest inventory data 200 forest stands were selected to represent structure and composition of forests in Germany Stand development was projected 30 years into the future under both current and changed climatic conditions. For each forest inventory plot, climate data were generated corresponding to current climate (1961-1990) and two climate change scenarios based on the projections of the HadCM2 and ECHAM4 global circulation models for the years 2041-2070. For Germany, both climate change scenarios show an increase of 2.9-3.6 degreesC in mean temperature, but rainfall differed markedly between scenarios. While the HadCM2 model projects on average a 20% increase in annual precipitation in this region, the ECHAM4 model projects reduced precipitation, along with a greater temperature increase during the summer months. Three prototypical management strategies are used for the assessment, spanning a triangle including pure economical orientation, optimised timber volume yield, and priority to ecosystem services from the forest. These extreme management strategies were devised to encompass the great variety of different management objectives that are encountered in German forestry. The paper ends with an outlook on the remaining papers of this journal supplement, which presents the results of three years of work of the research network, documenting significant progress in quantitative forest science and global change research in Germany.

AB  - The food system is responsible for some of society's most pressing sustainability challenges. Dietary guidelines are one policy tool to help address the multiple sustainability challenges associated with food systems through dietary recommendations that better support environmental and human well-being. This article develops and applies a sustainability framework scoring tool comprised of four key dimensions (environmental, economic, human health, and sociocultural and political) and 32 sub-dimensions of sustainable food systems for the analysis and modification of national dietary guidelines. Two coders pilot tested the framework to quantify the occurrence of sustainability dimensions and sub-dimensions in national and regional dietary guidelines of 12 randomly selected high-income and upper-middle income countries including Albania, Australia, Brazil, the Grenadines, Grenada, Qatar, Netherlands, Nordic Countries, St. Vincent, Sweden, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Sustainability Dimension Scores (SDS) were calculated as a percentage of the occurrence of the eight sub-dimensions comprising each sustainability dimension and Total Sustainability Scores (TSS) were calculated as a percentage of the occurrence of the 32 sub-dimensions in each guideline. Inter-rater reliability of TSS and SDS indicated high validity of applying the sustainability framework for dietary guidelines. SDS varied between the four sustainability dimensions with human health being the most represented in the dietary guidelines examined, as hypothesized (average SDS score of 83%; range from 50 to 100%). Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were found in mean SDS between the four sustainability dimensions. Overall, results indicate that the ecological (average SDS score of 31%; range from 0 to 100%) economic (average SDS score of 29%; range from 0 to 100%), and socio-cultural and political (average SDS score of 44%; range of 0-100%) dimensions of sustainability are underrepresented in the examined national dietary guidelines with significant differences in SDS between guidelines (p < 0.0001). TSS varied by country between 12 and 74% with a mean score of 36% (+/- 20%). Brazil had the highest TSS (74%) followed by Australia (69%). The sustainability framework presented here can be applied by policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to identify gaps and opportunities to modify national dietary guidelines and associated programs for transforming food systems through diets that support planetary health.

AB  - Forest subsidies are widely used to achieve policy objectives aimed at maintaining and supporting the provision of the various ecosystem services provided by forests. In the European Union, an important instrument is the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) within the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), but countries also have national subsidy systems. In both cases, individual countries determine which objectives they want to achieve with the subsidy schemes and which measures are supported. In this comparative study, we investigate which forest-related measures are subsidized across Europe and which forest owners, representing a very heterogeneous group, are involved in the activities of the subsidy systems.We collected data on subsidies paid out for forest-related measures from Austria, Finland, Germany, Slovenia and Sweden from the EAFRD funding period 2014-2020 for a comparison of the funded activities. Further, we analysed how subsidies were distributed among private forest owners with forest holdings of different sizes by performing G-tests to compare the observed with the expected subsidies received by forest owners in the different size categories.The results show that through the flexibility given by the CAP for countries to adjust their subsidy programmes to the specific national needs, EAFRD funds and equivalent national subsidies are indeed used for a wide range of activities instead of only a few following one common European goal. Reflecting the different needs and various forest functions, the subsidized activities range from the more ecology-oriented "investment to increase resis-tance and the ecological value of forests" to the more management-oriented "purchase of new machinery and new equipment for forestry operations".In all five countries, small-scale forest owners with holdings smaller than 200 ha are the largest owner group and manage a large share of the forest area in private hands (from 47% in Austria to 97% in Slovenia). However, especially owners of the smallest holdings (< 20 ha) rarely use the funding scheme of the EAFRD framework and thus receive a disproportionately low share of subsidies. There might be several reasons for this. Small-scale forest owners are generally less involved regarding policy issues (including subsidy schemes) than owners of larger forest holdings and may not be aware of all funding opportunities. In addition, the considerable effort to apply, including project preparation, administration and documentation may be perceived as a barrier.It became clear that the current subsidy systems of the countries focus on different forest policy objectives. Our study further revealed that the documentation of subsidy distribution is partly unclear and inconsistent across countries hampering European comparisons. However, understanding current subsidy distribution is urgently needed for increasing the effectiveness of subsidy systems to achieve European policy goals of vital multifunc-tional forests.

AB  - Boreal forests are rich in non-timber forest products from plants: wild berries and herbs used commercially or by households as food, medicine, decoration, or raw material. Approximately two hundred wild plant species have been documented for their nutritional uses in Finland, and many of these species occur in forests. However, the provisioning of edible plants by managed forests has received little attention, despite the fact that forest vegetation is altered by forest management practices. In this study, we use nation-wide forest vegetation and tree stand data consisting of a total of 1,778 sample plots to quantify the richness and abundance of edible wild plants in Finnish forests. Responses of edible species richness, abundance, and composition to stand characteristics such as site type, tree species composition, stand density, and management history are analyzed with regression models, NMDS ordination, and diagnostic species analysis, for forests on mineral soils and on peatlands separately. A total of 68 edible wild plant species occur in our dataset, with their occurrence and abundance varying between species and between sites. Our results indicate that habitat characteristics, namely site fertility and stand density, are the strongest determinants of overall edible plant provisioning. The richness of edible species as well as their total abundance were lower in less fertile site types and in denser stands. Recent timber harvesting and plantation as opposed to natural regeneration had a negative effect on edible species abundance in mineral soil forests. Several edible plant species confined to the richest site types accounted for the increase in species richness, while different forest management practices had generally none or a negligible number of diagnostic species. We conclude that a large and diverse set of edible wild plants occurs in Finnish forests, and the effects of stand characteristics and management on overall edible plant richness and abundance may be muddled by opposite species-level responses. Edible plant provisioning should be further analyzed at the level of smaller species groups or individual species to reveal the opportunities to support it in managed forests.

AB  - Understanding the responses of ecological communities to perturbation is a key challenge within contemporary ecology research. In this study we seek to separate specific community responses from general community responses of plant communities to exclusion of large cervid herbivores. Cervid herbivory and forestry are the main drivers of vegetation structure and diversity in boreal forests. While many studies focus on the impact of cervids on trees, a high proportion of the biodiversity and ecosystem services in boreal forests is found in the field layer. However, experimental approaches investigating the influence of herbivory on understory vegetation are highly localised. In this study we use a regional-scale design with 51 sites in four boreal forest regions of Norway, to investigate the influence of cervid herbivory on the physical and ecological structure of field layer vegetation. Our study sites cover a range of forest types differing in productivity, management and dominant cervid species, allowing us to identify generic responses and those that are specific to particular conditions. We found that the height of the field layer and the abundances of individual species were most susceptible to change following short-term cervid exclusion across different forest types and cervid species. Total vegetation density and vascular plant diversity did not respond to cervid exclusion on the same time scale. We also found that the field-layer vegetation in clear-cut forests used by moose was more susceptible to change following cervid exclusion than mature forests used by red deer, but no strong evidence that the response of vegetation to herbivore exclusion varied with productivity. Our study suggests that the parameters that respond to cervid exclusion are consistent across forest types, but that the responsiveness of different forest types is idiosyncratic and hard to predict.

AB  - The intention of the present project was to map the present state of the reindeer ranges especially in the forests by using satellite images,and to extraxt parameters about the grazing capabilities mainly in the forests in the Vilhelmina and Fredrika (Bjurholm) areas in Sweden. The total overall accuracies of the maps produced during the project were estimated to be c. 86%+/-5% for the summer pasture map in Vilhelmina,and about 88.5%+/-8% for the winter pasture map in the Fredrika area. The state of the lichens in the forests was very good, meaning that the reindeer herders within this area of Sweden had a very balanced and sustainable reindeer management practice. Clear cutting activities by large forest companies have reduced the lichen resources (the mean winter diet for the reindeer) in the lichen dominated pine forests within the Fredrika area.

AB  - Increasing pollution levels in waters from remote mountain areas in northern Sweden have been observed. To support a sustainable water quality management, it is necessary to know which environmental and antrophogenic factors influence the water quality. The purpose of this study was to map the Escherichia coli prevalence in the catchment area of the upper part of a large northern Scandinavian river and investigate the controlling factors of microbial contamination. A total of 112 water samples were collected from various locations in the research area between July 2020 and December 2020. These samples were analyzed for microbial and chemical characteristics, and information about tourism and reindeer herding was compiled. Additionally, microbial and physicochemical water characteristics collected by Indalsalven Water Conservation Association (IWCA, 1993-2020) and Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI, 2004-2020) were analyzed. The results showed that E. coli enumerations ranged between 0 and 500 CFU/100 ml. There was generally no obvious relation between suspected point sources, e.g., sewage treatment plants at mountain stations, and E. coli levels at downstream sampling points. Principal component analysis showed that E. coli was correlated to coliforms, total heterotrophic count, river discharge, CODMn and river color. Since microbial analyses are time-consuming, expensive and difficult to perform in remote areas, it is important to find more easily extracted water parameters that can serve as a proxy for E. coli. In particular, river color and discharge are promising parameters that may serve as an early indication of bacterial outbreak and fecal contamination in mountain waters.

AB  - For the first time, an economic analysis of a fully simulated forest transformation process from even-aged to uneven-aged stand structure using natural regeneration was performed using an individual tree growth simulator. A comparison to a 'business as usual' management approach (i.e. age-class scenario) was also made. Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.)-dominated forests of different ages were selected for the simulation: forest at thinning stage (52 years; hereafter, 'younger stand') and a mature stand (95 years) to explore different starting points for the transformation. The harvested and remaining stand volume showed only little fluctuation over the course of the simulation period in the case of the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario. The age-class scenario, on the other hand, showed peaks and drops in the timber volume. The land expectation values at the end of transformation were higher (i=1 or 2 per cent) or equal (i=3 per cent) to those of the age-class scenario for the younger stand. The transformation of younger forests appears to be economically interesting (under interest rates above 2 per cent) as the early revenues of more intensive thinnings achieve an equilibrium growing stock well below the potential maximum growing stock of an even-aged stand. This suggests transformation management to be economically efficient under the given silvicultural and economic conditions. The transformation of mature stands was found to be less economically viable due to the lower holding values for the transformation (uneven-aged) scenario compared with the age-class scenario. However, the holding values of the younger stand were higher for all interest rates compared with the age-class scenario. This study concludes that transformation (uneven-aged) scenario yielded more economically viable silvicultural approach (in the case of younger forests) and a steadier trend in harvested and remaining timber volume showing no major fluctuations. Transformation approach also forms a better foundation where other ecosystem services can be built.

AB  - Berry-producing Vaccinium shrubs are keystone species in boreal forest ecosystems and their berries provide an essential food source for many vertebrates. In Fennoscandia, both the abundance and cover of Vaccinium have decreased in forests, with intensive forestry practice as a main driver. Vaccinium seedling recruitment is constricted to recruitment windows of opportunity and appears to be infrequent, mainly due to seed dispersal limitation. Passerine birds are key players in seed dispersal, which can be directed towards perching points such as coarse woody debris. In this study, we investigated the potential for directed endozoochory by passerine birds towards cut stumps and if such stumps were viable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, in an intensively managed boreal forest landscape of central Norway. We surveyed stump and paired forest floor microsites for passerine scat (i.e. potential seed rain) and Vaccinium seedlings. We collected passerine scat and conducted germination experiments to assess if they contained viable seed. We tested the microsite effect (i.e. forest floor/stump) on scat deposition and seedling establishment and then used modified ensemble classifiers to identify important environmental factors affecting scat deposition and seedling establishment patterns. We found that passerine scat was disproportionally deposited on stumps, and that the vast majority of scat contained viable Vaccinium seed. Stumps were also suitable recruitment windows for Vaccinium species, as a higher probability of seedling establishment occurred at stumps compared with the forest floor. However, scat deposition and seedling establishment at stumps were rather contextual and determined by environmental variables. The probability of scat deposition increased with higher complexity of the vertical forest structure and lower canopy cover, whereas seedling establishment required bryophyte cover and larger stumps, or alternatively smaller stumps with competition-free spaces. Our results highlight a pathway to successful sexual reproduction for Vaccinium species in managed forests: passerine birds direct endozoochorous seed dispersal towards tree stumps, which can offer suitable conditions for seedling establishment. However, the spatiotemporal variability both in forest stand structure and in stump conditions have a strong influence on the success of sexual recruitment via this pathway.

AB  - In many regions of the world, drought is projected to increase under climate change, with potential negative consequences for forests and their ecosystem services (ES). Forest thinning has been proposed as a method for at least temporarily mitigating drought impacts, but its general applicability and longer-term impacts are unclear. We use a process-based forest model to upscale experimental data for evaluating the impacts of forest thinning in a drought-susceptible valley in the interior of the European Alps, with the specific aim of assessing (1) when and where thinning may be most effective and (2) the longer-term implications for forest dynamics.
   Simulations indicate that forests will be impacted by climate-induced increases in drought across a broad elevation range. At lower elevations, where drought is currently prevalent, thinning is projected to temporarily reduce tree mortality, but to have minor impacts on forest dynamics in the longer term. Thinning may be particularly useful at intermediate and higher elevations as a means of temporarily reducing mortality in drought-sensitive species such as Norway spruce and larch, which currently dominate these elevations. However, in the longer term, even intense thinning will likely not be sufficient to prevent a climate change induced dieback of these species, which is projected to occur under even moderate climate change. Thinning is also projected to have the largest impact on long-term forest dynamics at intermediate elevations, with the magnitude of the impact depending on the timing and intensity of thinning. More intense thinning that is done later is projected to more strongly promote a transition to more drought-tolerant species.
   We conclude that thinning is a viable option for temporarily reducing the negative drought impacts on forests, but that efficient implementation of thinning should be contingent on a site-specific evaluation of the near term risk of significant drought, and how thinning will impact the rate and direction of climate driven forest conversion.

AB  - P>1. Landscape management practices that alter energetic linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats can affect associated ecosystem processes, and ultimately the provision of ecosystem services of importance to humanity. Such effects cannot always be inferred from current biomonitoring schemes, which are typically based on assessment of community structural parameters rather than functional attributes related to important ecosystem-level processes.
   2. We investigated effects of forest clearcutting, a major landscape-level disturbance known to alter the energetic basis of aquatic food webs, on headwater streams in northern Sweden. The key ecosystem process of leaf decomposition was measured as an index of ecosystem functioning. The biomass of detritivorous shredders was also quantified, along with various community structural parameters associated with the diversity, composition and functional guild organisation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   3. No differences in macroinvertebrate abundance, diversity or assemblage composition were detected between forested and clearcut streams, and most functional guilds were similarly unaffected, though species density of scrapers was higher in forested than clearcut channels.
   4. In contrast, mass loss of two leaf species was elevated in all clearcut streams, with evidence for increases in the efficiency per degree-day of both the microbial and detritivore mediated fractions of decomposition.
   5. Increased rates of leaf mass loss in the clearcut streams were associated with greater phosphate concentrations and shredder biomass, and with an increased relative abundance of broadleaves in standing stocks of benthic litter. Together, these findings indicate a more rapid transfer of energy and nutrients through the detrital pathways of our clearcut streams.
   6. These results demonstrate the utility of litter decomposition assays for monitoring effects of forest management on stream ecosystem functioning, and have implications for nutrient cycles in landscapes extensively influenced by forest management. The markedly different responses of our functional and structural measures to clearcutting highlight the value of incorporating methods for the functional assessment of ecosystems into biomonitoring schemes.

AB  - Targets to reduce global warming impacts of the transportation sector may lead to increased land use and negative land quality changes. The aim of this paper is to implement the Land Use Indicator Calculation in Life Cycle Assessment (LANCA (R)) model to assess land quality impacts and land use efficiencies (concerning occupation and transformation) of different example renewable transport energy systems for passenger cars. In addition, the land use impacts are normalized according to the Soil Quality Index building on LANCA (R) and included in the environmental footprint. The assessment is based on information from GaBi life cycle assessment software databases and on literature. Functional unit of the model is to provide annual drive of 18,600 km for a passenger car in the EU. The analysis includes examples of biomass, electricity, electricity to fuels and fossil-based energy systems. Our findings confirm previous research that biomass-based transport energy systems have risks to lead to significantly higher land occupation and transformation impacts than do fossil oil or electricity-based ones. According to the LANCA (R) model, methane from Finnish wood and German corn has the highest impacts on filtration and the physicochemical filtration reduction potential. Sugarcane ethanol and palm oil diesel systems, on the other hand, lead to the highest erosion potential. Electricity-based transportation energy systems appear to be superior to biomassbased ones from the perspectives of land occupation, land transformation, and soil quality impacts for the selected examples. Land quality impacts should be taken into account when developing and expanding renewable transportation energy systems. The paper shows that the LANCA (R) method is applicable for the assessment of transport systems in order to provide extended information on environmental sustainability, which should be included more often in future analysis. However, it can be challenging to interpret underlaying assumptions, especially when aggregated information is used from databases.

AB  - Present-day disturbances are transforming European forest landscapes, and their legacies determine the vulnerability and resilience of the emergent forest generation. To understand these legacy effects, we investigated the resilience of the aboveground forest biomass (B-abg) to a sequence of disturbances affecting the forest in different recovery phases from the initial large-scale impact. We used the model iLand to simulate windthrows that affected 13-24% of the 4 8 in a Central European forest landscape. An additional wind event was simulated 20, 40, 60, or 80 years after the initial impact (i.e., sequences of two windthrows were defined). Each windthrow triggered an outbreak of bark beetles that interacted with the recovery processes. We evaluated the resistance of the B-abg to and recovery after the impact. Random Forest models were used to identify factors influencing resilience. We found that B(abg )resistance was the lowest 20 years after the initial impact when the increased proportion of emergent wind-exposed forest edges prevailed the disturbance-dampening effect of reduced biomass levels and increased landscape heterogeneity. This forest had a remarkably high recovery rate and reached the predisturbance B-abg within 28 years. The forest exhibited a higher resistance and a slower recovery rate in the more advanced recovery phases, reaching the pre-disturbance B-abg within 60-80 years. The recovery was enhanced by higher levels of alpha and beta diversity. Under elevated air temperature, the bark beetle outbreak triggered by windthrow delayed the recovery. However, the positive effect of increased temperature on forest productivity caused the recovery rate to be higher under the warming scenario than under the reference climate. We conclude that resilience is not a static property, but its magnitude and drivers vary in time, depending on vegetation feedbacks, interactions between disturbances, and climate. Understanding these mechanisms is an essential step towards the operationalization of resilience-oriented stewardship. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Good hygienic quality of surface waters is essential for drinking water production, irrigation of crops and recreation. Predictions of how and when microbes are transported by rivers are needed to protect downstream water users. In this study we tested the new process-based INCA-Pathogens model in the agricultural Loimijoki River basin (3138 km(2)) in Finland, and we quantified ecosystem services of water purification and water provisioning for drinking and recreation purposes under different scenarios. INCA is a catchment scale process based model to calculate pollutant transfer from terrestrial environment and point sources to the catchment outlet. A clear gradient was observed in the numbers of faecal coliforms along the River Loimijoki. The highest bacterial counts were detected in the middle part of the main stream immediately after small industries and municipal sewage treatment plants. In terms of model performance, the INCA-Pathogen model was able to produce faecal coliform counts and seasonality both in the low pollution level sampling points and in the high pollution level sampling points. The model was sensitive to the parameters defining light decay in river water and in soil compartment, as well as to the amount of faecal coliforms in the manure spread on the fields. The modeling results showed that the number of faecal coliforms repeatedly exceeded 1000 bacteria 100 ml(-1). Moreover, results lead to the following conclusions: 1) Climate change does not cause a major threat to hygienic water quality as higher precipitation increases runoff and causes diluting effect in the river, 2) Intensification of agriculture is not a threat as long as animal density remains relatively low and environmental legislation is followed, 3) More intensive agriculture without environmental legislation causes a threat especially in tributaries with high field percentage and animal density, and 4) Hygienic water quality in the River Loimijoki can best be improved by improving sewage treatment. We conclude that this catchment scale model is a useful tool for addressing catchment management and water treatment planning issues. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, the total area of plantation forest is increasing as deforestation and fragmentation of native forest continues. In some countries commercial plantations make up more than half of the total forested land. Internationally, there is growing emphasis on forestry policy for plantations to deliver biodiversity and ecosystem services. In Ireland, native forest now comprises just 1% of total land cover while non-native spruce forest makes up 60% of the plantation estate and approximately 6% of the total land cover. The majority of plantation invertebrate biodiversity assessments focus on ground-dwelling species and consequently a good understanding exists for these guilds, especially ground-active spiders and beetles. Using a technique of insecticide fogging, we examine the less well understood component of forest systems, the canopy fauna (Coleoptera, Araneae, Diptera and Hemiptera), in Irish spruce plantations (Sitka and Norway) and compare the assemblage composition, richness and abundance to that of remnant native forest (ash and oak). In addition, we examine the potential for accumulation of forest species in second rotation spruce plantations and identify indicator species for each forest type.
   From 30 sampled canopies, we recorded 1155 beetles and 1340 spiders from 144 species and over 142000 Diptera and Hemiptera from 71 families. For all taxa, canopy assemblages of native forests were significantly different from closed-canopy plantation forests. No indicators for plantation forest were identified; those identified for native forest included species from multiple feeding guilds. Plantations supported approximately half the number of beetle species and half the number of Diptera and Hemiptera families recorded in native forests. Although assemblages in Norway spruce plantations were very different to those of native forest, they had consistently higher richness than Sitka spruce plantations. No differences in richness or abundance were found between first rotation and second rotation Sitka spruce plantations. Compared to other forest types, Sitka spruce plantations contained far greater total abundance of invertebrates, due to vast numbers of aphids and midges. Under current management, Sitka spruce plantations provide limited benefit to the canopy fauna typical of native forests in either first or second rotations. The large aphid populations may provide abundant food for insectivores but may also lead to reduced crop production through defoliation. Progressive forestry management should attempt to diversify the plantation canopy fauna, which may also increase productivity and resilience to pest species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dramatic and persistent reductions in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are common in many coastal areas. While offshore cod stocks still were abundant and productive, the Swedish west coast showed signs of diminishing adult cod abundance at the beginning of the 1980s, where the local cod component was considered to be extirpated. To survey the present cod spawning activity and stock composition, we initiated egg trawling over two consecutive years (203 hauls in total) in combination with population genetic analyses (425 individually genotyped eggs). Here, we provide evidence of cod spawning at the Swedish Skagerrak coast, suggesting recolonization or that local cod has recovered from a nearly depleted state. Early stage eggs were found inside fjords too far to have been transported by oceanic drift from offshore spawning areas. The cod eggs were genetically similar in early to late life-stages and cluster mainly with the local adult cod, indicating that eggs and adults belong to the same genetic unit. The cod eggs were genetically differentiated from adult North Sea cod, and, to a lesser degree, also from the Kattegat and oresund cod, i.e. indicating a possible recovery of local coastal stock. The patterns of the genetic structure in the inshore areas are, however, difficult to fully disentangle, as Atlantic cod in the North Sea-Skagerrak area seem to be a mixture of co-existing forms: local cod completing their entire life cycle in fjords and sheltered areas, and oceanic populations showing homing behaviours. The egg abundances are considerably lower compared with what is found in similar studies along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. Nevertheless, the discovery of locally spawning cod along the Swedish west coastalthough at low biomassesis an encouraging finding that highlights the needs for endurance in protective measures and of detailed surveys to secure intraspecific biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Forests play an important role in regulation of the global climate; moreover, they provide human beings with a whole range of ecosystem services. Forest health and ecosystem functioning have been influenced by anthropogenic activities and their consequences, such as air pollution, surface mining, heavy metal contamination, and other biotic and abiotic stress factors, which had an especially serious effect on central Europe. Many aspects of the physiological state of trees are more or less related to the concentrations of two main groups of leaf photosynthetic pigments: chlorophylls and carotenoids. Therefore, their contents can be used as non-specific indicators of the actual tree physiological status, stress and the pre-visible tree damage. Variations in leaf biochemical composition affect foliar optical properties and can be assessed remotely using high spectral resolution data (hyperspectral data). These data were successfully used in earlier studies to detect vegetation stress and damage. However, only a few approaches have dealt with the use of hyperspectral remote sensing to assess vegetation physiological status on a regional scale. Moreover, little or no research has been done on assessing vegetation health while utilizing multi-date hyperspectral images.
   In this study, the method for assessing forest health conditions using optical indices retrieved from hyperspectral data was applied to the two temporal HyMap date sets acquired in 07/2009 and 08/2010 to detect stress for the Norway spruce forests in Sokolov, NW Bohemia, a region affected by long-term extensive mining. The classification results were validated by ground truth data (total chlorophyll-Cab, carotenoids-Car and carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio-Car/Cab) and were associated with the geochemical conditions of the forest stands. Both biochemical analysis of the sampled foliage and classification of 2009 and 2010 hyperspectral image identified the same sites affected by vegetation stress. In addition to higher Car/Cab, which enabled detection of the stressed trees using hyperspectral image data, these sites showed critically low pH and lower values for the macronutrient parameters in both organic horizons and, in addition, both sites exhibit critically low base cation to aluminum ratios (Bc/Al) for lower organic and top mineral (0-20 cm) soil horizons.
   The results of this study demonstrate (i) the potential application of hyperspectral remote sensing as a rapid method of identifying tree stress prior to symptom expression, and (ii) the added value of multi-temporal approaches for hyperspectral data and its further potential for monitoring forest ecosystems.
