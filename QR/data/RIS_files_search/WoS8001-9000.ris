AB  - Niche diversification of polymorphic Arctic charr can be altered by multiple anthropogenic stressors. The opossum-shrimp (Mysis relicta) was introduced to compensate for reduced food resources for fish following hydropower operations in Lake Limingen, central Norway. Based on habitat use, stomach contents, stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) and trophically transmitted parasites, the zooplanktivorous upper water-column dwelling 'normal' morph was clearly trophically separated from two sympatric deep-water morphs (the 'dwarf' and the 'grey') that became more abundant with depth (> 30 m). Mysis dominated (50-60%) charr diets in deeper waters (> 30 m), irrespective of morph. Mysis and/or zooplankton prey groups caused high dietary overlap (> 54%) between the 'dwarf' morph and the two other 'normal' and 'grey' morphs. After excluding Mysis, the dietary overlap dropped to 34% between the two profundal morphs, as the 'dwarf' fed largely on deep-water zoobenthos (39%), while the 'grey' morph fed on fish (59%). The time-integrated trophic niche tracers (trophically transmitted parasites and stable isotopes) demonstrated only partial dietary segregation between the two deep-water morphs. The high importance of Mysis in Arctic charr diets may have reduced the ancestral niche segregation between the deep-water morphs and thereby increased their resource competition and potential risk of hybridization.

TI  - A new portable biosensor technology for area reduction
T2  - DETECTION AND REMEDIATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR MINES AND MINELIKE TARGETS IV, PTS 1 AND 2
LA  - English
CP  - Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines and Minelike Targets IV Conference
AB  - This paper describes the expected performance of a new portable vapour detection system under development by Biosensor Applications Sweden AB (Biosensor). The system is designed for area reduction in humanitarian mine clearance operations. It consists of a collection system and a biosensor with a sensitivity capable of detecting picogram levels of TNT molecules. Biosensor has over the past four years developed the base technology for detection of TNT for a land mine application. A prototype for TNT detection will be tested in minefields during 1999. Our technology, sometimes called "the artificial dog nose", has by many experts been described as revolutionary.
   The Biosensor system is intended to be a high volume, highly selective, highly sensitive, portable and rugged vapour detection system at low cost. The collection system is a simple and elegant solution based on a unique air sampling technology converting sought-gas into liquid with the aim of achieving a yield of 50%. Existing commercial air-sampling systems typically achieve a yield of less than 5%. In our system we have chosen to use a bioelectric sensor for the analysis of the sample. The sensor is based on the weight loss technology in a Quartz Crystal Microbalance system antibodies leave the surface of a piezo electric quartz crystal which oscillates at its natural frequency. The advantage with combining the antibodies with the weight loss technology is that it is very specific and sensititve.
   This will provide a method for more efficient and much less time consuming mine clearance operations. The proposed Biosensor system is intended for area reduction at an initial stage of the mine clearance operation. The system can also be used for verification and quality control when an area is cleared.

AB  - Background: A regular supply of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus to agriculture is needed for global food security, and increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural-urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and capture some of its energetic value via biogas production. Anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, both energy and nutrient recovery can be achieved. Two promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from different types of wastewater are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. This review examined the effectiveness of these ecotechnologies for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment.
   Methods: We searched for academic and grey literature published after 2013. Searches were performed in 5 bibliographic databases in English, in the search engine Google Scholar in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish, and across a range of organisational websites in English, Swedish, Finnish and Polish. Eligibility screening was conducted at two levels: 'title and abstract' and 'full text'. Included eligible studies were subject to a critical appraisal that assessed external and internal study validity. We extracted information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis included narrative synthesis of each study of sufficient validity. We performed quantitative synthesis on a subset of studies.
   Review findings: The review included 30 studies on struvite precipitation and 8 studies on ammonia stripping. Both pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were found to have a clear influence on the effectiveness of struvite precipitation process (and thus nutrient removal rates). The response to pH was found to be non-linear, resembling a bell curve with a maximum around pH 9.5. Mg:PO4 ratio was found to have a positive effect on removal up to a ratio as high as 4:1. However, it should be noted that high removal efficiencies were sometimes achieved at a ratio as low as 1:1 as well. Although the effects of pH and Mg:PO4 ratio were clear, the model developed could not accurately predict removal based on these two parameters alone. Studies on ammonia stripping were relatively heterogeneous. Due to the small size of the evidence base, and the heterogeneity between studies, no conclusions are presented regarding the influence of different process parameters on the outcome of ammonia stripping.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, when performed under the right conditions (i.e. pH around 9.5 and Mg:PO4 ratio of at least 1:1), available evidence suggests that struvite precipitation is an effective technology for the recovery of nutrients from the liquid phase of anaerobic digestate. The evidence base is limited for ammonia stripping. We provided suggestions of which data to report in future studies.

AB  - Non-Christian immigrants coming to Sweden encounter a mainly secular society with a strong Lutheran heritage, as physically symbolized by the more than 3500 church towers scattered throughout the country, often in central locations in cities and villages. In this landscape dotted with Christian landmarks, there are few visible physical spaces linked to the identity of Muslim immigrants. The aim of this article is to analyse the religious and cultural significance that Muslim immigrants attach to the presence or absence of mosques in their neighbourhood. Drawing upon a conceptual framework that distinguishes between physical, mental and social space, the analysis focuses on the meaning of place and the identity attached to the mosques. The empirical basis for the study includes interviews with imams complemented by articles and other written materials published in newspapers and on the internet. In the concluding section, we return to and reflect upon our overarching question: the relationship between faith and place in a multi-religious, multi-ethnic society. As illustrated in the article, mosques not only function as internal markers of religious faith but also serve as arenas where links can be developed to Christian and secular parts of Swedish society. Thus, they are important in providing both bonding and bridging capital, thus making it possible to develop a Muslim identity in Sweden.

AB  - In 1996, an old forest pasture grazed from the 1960s to 1988 was restored by coppicing, fencing and grazing by cattle to protect a local population of the endangered butterfly Euphydryas aurinia. An adjoining ungrazed meadow provided a control. In the first years, the butterfly became almost extinct due to the nearly complete consumption of the host plant of the larva, Succisa pratensis, by cattle. The butterfly population quickly recovered when the grazing pressure was lowered. Thus, the intensity of management should be adjusted by continuous monitoring of the target species. In the 2000s, the annual population was about 50 butterflies, but marked fluctuations took place, probably caused by natural factors. Grazing benefited the meadow flora and improved the habitat of butterflies in general. Extensive forest grazing clearly has the potential for enhancing biodiversity. The value of the experiment is, however, limited because only a single pair of meadows was available for comparison. In the future, it will be even more difficult to arrange a similar experiment due to the great decline in the numbers of traditional meadows and forest grazing in SE Finland.

AB  - Research Highlights: Past disturbances occurred naturally in primary forests in the Southern Carpathians. High- and moderate-severity disturbances shaped the present structure of these ecosystems, which regenerated successfully without forestry interventions. Background and Objectives: Windstorms and bark beetle outbreaks have recently affected large forest areas across the globe, causing concerns that these disturbances lie outside the range of natural variability of forest ecosystems. This often led to salvage logging inside protected areas, one of the main reasons for primary forest loss in Eastern Europe. Although more than two-thirds of temperate primary forests in Europe are located in the Carpathian region of Eastern Europe, knowledge about how natural disturbances shape the forest dynamics in this region is highly essential for future management decisions. Material and Methods: We established our study in a primary forest valley situated in the centre of the largest temperate primary forest landscape in Europe (Fagaras Mountains). A dendrochronological investigation was carried out to reconstruct the natural disturbance history and relate it to the present forest structure. Results: The dendrochronological analysis revealed high temporal variability in the disturbance patterns both at the patch and stand level. Moderate severity disturbance events were most common (20-40% of canopy disturbed in 60% of the plots) but high severity events did also occur (33% of the plots). Regeneration was spruce-dominated and 71% of the seedlings were found on deadwood microsites. Conclusions: We conclude that the current structure of the studied area is a consequence of the past moderate-severity disturbances and sporadic high-severity events. The peak in disturbances (1880-1910) followed by reduced disturbance rates may contribute to a recent and future increase in disturbances in the Fagaras Mts. Our findings show that these disturbance types are within the range of natural variability of mountain spruce forests in the Southern Carpathians and should not be a reason for salvage logging in primary forests from this area.

AB  - Forest water bodies, e.g., pools, constitute 'environmental islands' within forests, with specific flora and fauna thus contributing considerably to the landscape biodiversity. The mite communities of Oribatida and Mesostigmata in two distinctive microhabitats, water-soaked Sphagnum mosses at the edge of a pool and other mosses growing on the medium-wet forest floor nearby, were compared in a limestone forest in Southern Norway. In total, 16,189 specimens of Oribatida representing 98 species, and 499 specimens of Mesostigmata, from 23 species, were found. The abundance and species number of Oribatida were significantly lower at the pool, while the abundance and species richness of Mesostigmata did not differ. Both the communities of Oribatida and of Mesostigmata differed among the microhabitats studied and analysis showed significant differences between the community structures in the two microhabitats. The most abundant oribatid species in Sphagnum mosses was Parachipteria fanzagoi (Jacot, 1929), which made up over 30% of all Oribatida, followed by Atropacarus striculus (C.L. Koch, 1835) and Tyrphonothrus maior (Berlese, 1910) (14% and 12% of Oribatida, respectively). Among Mesostigmata Paragamasus parrunciger (Bhattacharyya, 1963) dominated (44% of Mesostigmata), followed by P. lapponicus (Tragardh, 1910) (14% of Mesostigmata). Most of these species, except P. lapponicus, were either absent or very uncommon in the other microhabitat studied. The specific acarofauna of the forest pool shows the importance of such microhabitats in increasing forest diversity. In addition, a quarter of the mite species found had not been reported from Norwegian broadleaf forests before, including five new species records for Norway and four new to Fennoscandia, all found in the medium-wet microhabitat. Most of these species are rarely collected and have their northernmost occurrence in the studied forest.

AB  - The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires Member States to estimate the level of human impacts on their marine waters. We report the first attempt to quantify the magnitude and distribution of cumulative impacts of anthropogenic pressures for an entire regional sea, the Baltic Sea. We used a method which takes account of the sensitivity of different ecosystem components and gives scores for potential impacts in 5 km x 5 km areas. Our quantification of impacts was based on data layers of anthropogenic pressures and ecosystem components. The classification of the anthropogenic pressures follows the MSFD and the outcome of the index was targeted to facilitate the implementation of the directive. The study presents the cumulative impacts over the entire sea area and shows that the highest estimated impacts were in the southern and south-western sea areas and in the Gulf of Finland. The lowest index values were found in the Gulf of Bothnia. The results coincide with the population densities of the adjacent catchment areas. Fishing, inputs of nutrients and organic matter and inputs of hazardous substances comprised 25%, 30% and 30%, respectively, of the total cumulative impact. The approach used is transparent and the results are useful in regard to ecosystem-based management, e.g. for area-based management and assessments. Examples of uses are given together with analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we estimate the Relevant Source Area of Pollen (RSAP) in past hypothetical landscapes of the Middle and Late Holocene in southern Sweden, in order to explore the possible effects of past changes in vegetation composition, openness and structure in terms of patch size and spatial distribution. The RSAP of small basins (bogs or lakes) in the past has to be estimated if quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation at the local spatial scale is to be achieved using Sugita's Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA). In this study we apply a forward modelling approach to estimate past RSAP using the computer simulation model HUMPOL The landscape designs are based on past landscape maps produced using a combination of palaeobotanical, archaeological and historical data, and the area's geology and soil characteristics. Four time windows characterised by different landscape/land-use were selected, i.e. Early Neolithic, Late Bronze Age, Viking Age, and Middle Ages. We found that RSAP estimates for hypothetical past landscapes in Skane differ by ca. 600 m to 1200 m between the selected time periods, whatever the size of the basin (lake or bog, 25250 m radius). The most probable explanation for the differences in RSAP between time slices is variable patch size and spatial distribution of patches in the landscape. The RSAPs vary between ca. 1200 and 2300 m for small basins (25 m and 70 m radius), and between ca. 2000 and 3000 m for larger basins (250 m radius). These values are within the range of earlier estimates of modern and past RSAPs for southern Scandinavia obtained using simulated or empirical data. These results suggest that, given the type of setting of that region in terms of taxa composition and traditional land-use, the RSAP for small-size lakes (25-250 m radius) will generally be in the range ca. 1200-3000 m. The forward modelling approach is found to be useful to assess the possible effects on RSAP of changes in vegetation/landscape characteristics between different periods of the past. Moreover, comparison of RSAP estimates obtained using both the forward and backward modelling approaches will be important to identify the most credible RSAP estimates for the past.

AB  - This research addresses local governance for building energy efficiency. In order to turn an increasingly proactive environmental policy agenda at subnational levels into practice, local governments experiment with new forms of governance. One important policy area in this regard is building energy use, often addressed through urban development projects. Such initiatives provide important insight into the role that local governments may play in terms of pushing developers from mainstream building practices towards the uptake of more radical energy efficient solutions by enabling socio-technical translation. The analysis is based on two case studies from Sweden and Denmark, where the local governments have actively sought to challenge mainstream building practices through a combination of different modes of governing. It is shown how this combination of different modes of governing at the local level provides several translation entries for local governments seeking to foster sustainability transitions. The article concludes that more attention should be directed towards translation as part of the practical environmental governing at the local level.

AB  - Sustainable development has by now become an element deeply integrated in the everyday design. It has many shades and may be found under many names. We speak about resiliency in design and procurement of passive, ecologic, plus energy, or nZEB buildings. Nevertheless, if we look closely, we may distinguish certain characteristic ideas. First, sustainable development of societies and urbanization processes should be consistent on a deeper level than presently, and be included within design processes, organization, and planning, as well as modernization and redevelopment procedures of existing urban tissue. Secondly, urbanization should be perceived holistically, as an interaction and harmonious development of both natural and manmade environments, with solutions based on the best technical and technological standards available. Lastly, described ideas are achievable only, if we include continuous cooperation between urban planners, architects, specialist consultants, as well as energy-efficient interdisciplinary solutions to achieve high standard energy measures. One of the thresholds is economic feasibility; the other is health and well-being of the users which should always be discussed as a priority. This paper-outside a brief theoretical approach to initial procedures in design management-will dwell on transformation and modernization of an existing building belonging to the Warsaw University of Technology, one of the oldest universities in Poland, its founding dating back to the beginning of the twentieth century. In 2015, a Nordic Finance Mechanism grant dedicated to the nZEB technology transfer from Norway to Poland was awarded to a group of researchers from Warsaw University of Technology and NTNU Trondheim. The main aim of the project is implementation of nZEB knowledge in Poland, as well as preparation of two integrated concept designs for public (University) buildings as exemplary case studies which could act as the benchmarks for other public buildings.

AB  - Distribution and population trends of Temminck's Stint Calidris temminckii were studied along the Finnish coast of the Bothnian Bay. The southernmost birds bred in Vaasa, the northernmost pairs were found in Tornio. The current population size was estimated at 170-200 pairs. Most pairs bred in non-protected, natural habitats on the mainland. Most sites were inhabited by 1-4 pairs. The colony size varied between one and twenty. Comparision with previous censuses revealed that the Temminck's Stint has decreased coastwide during the twentieth century. The magnitude and time of the decline differed from sub-area to another. The causes may include shrinkage and deterioration of habitats and increased predation and human disturbance. Validity of these and other possible explanations are reviewed and discussed.

AB  - This article is about experiences of a cemetery landscape: a physical space that was chosen as a depository for hu man remains, and where different memorial and disposal practices have developed behav iour al patterns that together form a cemetery culture. Through qualitative research at St Eskil's, Eskils- tuna, Sweden, encompassing field ob servations and interviews (N=14) with stake holders and people from the general public, we aim to describe and discuss the cemetery as a place and environment experienced from a per spective of people of diverse backgrounds. The study reveals important characteristics that facilitate designing, caretaking, developing and using cemeteries more generally. Findings show that most interviewees, independent for example of cultural or religious adherence, describe the cemetery as a beautiful natural or garden -like place. The well -maintained landscape is em - phasized as a self-evident or impressive quality. The cemetery is experienced as "typically Swedish' and described in terms of order and sense of care. Diversity in both design and multi- cultural and individual expressions are observed, acknowledged and welcomed. We conclude that nature (including a garden approach), care and diversity are key concepts that should be considered in design and development of future cemeteries.

The perceptions of local and organic food systems actors regarding equity (or fairness) between the actors and viability of the local communities are examined to analyze social sustainability in Juva, Finland. The findings lend conditional support to the positive relationship between localized food systems and actors within these systems feeling empowered and influential, while also supporting other research emphasizing the limitations of farmer influence on vertical distributional channels, irrespective of production methods (i.e., organic or conventional).

AB  - Based on original, unpublished graphic documents, this article describes the history and architecture of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition's Swedish Pavilion. The building's decades-long evolution began on Montjuic Hill, the site of the Exhibition, where,it was built by Swedish architect Peder Clason. Its unique watchtower showcased the architect's zeal for modernity. The tower's design broke new ground and involved the use of Swedish materials and woodworking techniques.
   Shortly thereafter, Barcelona City Council's Culture Delegation issued a tender open to all mountain municipalities in Catalonia at least 500 meters above sea level with developed land available that was suitable for building the Swedish Pavilion. The aim was to establish a permanent school for 300 students in the Pavilion. The Permanent School of Berga was designed by architect Josep Goday and included the Swedish Pavilion, which was adapted to create eight classrooms, as well as additional rooms, a library and a large meeting space to be used as an auditorium, theater and lecture hall.
   On February 2, 1939, in the final stages of the Spanish Civil War, General Francisco Franco's troops occupied the city of Berga and the Permanent Educational Community. The facility was converted into a military hospital, then used as a barracks for the Fourth Catalan Mountain Hunters' Battalion and remained occupied for the next fifty years.
   In the late 1980s, the Berga military barracks lost its strategic value as a garrison and the Spanish Ministry of Defense decided to dismantle its facilities there. The Berga Town Council seized the opportunity to strike up negotiations with the Defense Ministry in Madrid in the hopes of recovering for city use the land in the Pla del Alemany area and all its facilities. Negotiations on the agreement to transfer the property from the Ministry to the Berga City Council started in the last quarter of 1993 and the agreement was signed in the first quarter of 1994.
   Once the agreement was signed, the Berga City Council decided to completely overhaul the area and furnish it with the administrative, social, cultural and educational facilities the city needed, in addition to a residential zone in the section of the property adjacent to the city.
   It was against this backdrop, a year before the agreement was signed, that a young, recently graduated, Berga-born building engineer,
   Josep Camps i Boixadera, submitted his Final Year Project for the university to the city council, which consisted of plans to rebuild the old Swedish Pavilion and transform it into the auditorium of a small regional university. Josep Camps alone should therefore be credited with the idea of rebuilding the Pavilion.
   As a result of this and other favorable circumstances, the city council took the initiative to recover and rebuild the Pavilion designed by Peder Clason for the 1929 International Exhibition in Barcelona. The Pavilion was to remain on the Pla de Alemany premises in Berga, but would once again be given a new purpose: it would be fitted with lecture rooms and exhibition spaces. This meant that although the building's external dimensions and features would remain the same, the new interior would not be an exact copy of Clason's original designs.

AB  - This study explores how geopolitical aspects can affect actors' sense of agency to achieve the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its ambition to transform the world sustainably by studying the linkages between global change and the 2030 Agenda as described by Swedish change agents. Sweden has a self-declared ambition for leadership in the 2030 Agenda. The world's high-income countries, including Sweden, have been given a specific responsibility to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The results of this focus group study show that the geopolitical landscape encompasses a multitude of actors and roles whose relationships are filled with tension, creating dichotomies between them. The analysis indicates that Sweden is assessed to be dependent on functioning ecosystems, both locally and globally, as well as causing global environmental change. Two narratives have emerged: (i) the narrative of the 2030 Agenda, referring to deliberate societal transformations that can be controlled and steered, and that have a direction; and (ii) the narrative of geopolitics, indicating perceptions of emergent transformations that appear uncontrollable, drifting aimlessly towards an unknown future. These narratives might influence the understanding of societal transformations, and need to be considered in the facilitation of platforms for deliberative transformations or responses to emerging transformations.

AB  - Wind-energy expansion raises concerns over its potential impacts on bird populations. Birds may be affected directly via collision with turbines or indirectly via habitat loss or displacement due to disturbance. Species with long generation times, low reproductive output or high habitat specialisation are more likely to be impacted. Using national-scale breeding bird distributions, we applied a quantitative prioritisation method to assess the vulnerability of species to onshore wind-energy developments in Finland. We assessed 214 species that regularly breed in the country. Each species was assigned a priority score based on a combination of life-history traits, habitat specialisation, exposure to wind energy and conservation status. We found that the priority scores varied markedly between species, allowing a distinction between a minority of high-ranked species and a majority of low-ranked species. High-ranked species included terns (e.g., Sternula albifrons), raptors (e.g., Aquila chrysaetos), gulls (e.g., Larus fuscus), some forest-dwelling passerines (e.g., Poecile montanus) and ducks (e.g., Aythya ferina). Low-ranked species included woodpeckers (e.g., Picus canus) and many passerines. Our results indicate that the priority species are not limited to the more highly regarded large raptors, and that wind-energy impact assessments need to pay special attention to high-ranked species inhabiting coastal areas.

AB  - In this study, we assess the relations between nature-based tourism (NBT) products and natural resources. Based on interviews with providers of relatively new and emerging NBT products in Norway, we analyze the requirements set by the NBT products, the relevant resource characteristics, and the in-between connections. Findings are categorized along six dimensions, which are discussed within the context of the NBT experiencescape. Conclusions indicate that key dimensions of the NBT experiencescape are multi-faceted and partly in conflict with each other. The study proposes a framework that may serve as a tool for identifying and managing natural resources important to the NBT sector.

AB  - The three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus favours structurally complex forest biotopes that are also preferred by its predators and competitors. Among them, the goshawk Accipiter gentilis is a top predator that may have a positive indirect effect on the woodpecker by its negative impact on other predators. We studied this predator-prey community in a forest-dominated area of 470 km(2) in southern Finland in 1987-2005 by controlling goshawk occupancy and habitat changes. Goshawk affected densities of bird predators and hole-nesting species and locations of the nest sites of woodpeckers. Goshawk (+) and great spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos major (-) were significantly associated with density changes and breeding success of three-toed woodpecker. Positive influence of goshawk was correlated with landscape fragmentation that indicates that goshawk could decrease mammalian nest predation on three-toed woodpecker. Territory quality of three-toed woodpecker may be substantially modified by species interactions and be mediated to its population development.

AB  - The epiphytic vegetation on 19 pollarded trees of Fraxinus excelsior at the farm Havra, Osteroy, western Norway was investigated. Each trunk was divided into a basal zone, a middle zone and a top zone. In each zone the four different aspects were analysed by squares (12 sampling units from each trunk). Within a total of 225 sampling units, 173 taxa were recorded (84 lichens, 72 bryophytes, 17 vascular plants). The epiphytic vegetation was classified into seven TWINSPAN groups, and it is shown by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) that these groups are mainly separated by the first two DCA axes. In an attempt to explain the floristic composition, several environmental variables were measured, and the floristic and environmental data were analysed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A pollarded tree, depending on its age, represents a continuum of perhaps several hundred years. Some of the recorded epiphytic lichens are very rare in Norway, and the pollarded trees thus contribute greatly to the biodiversity of the old cultural landscape. Several epiphytic species take advantage of favourable light conditions on trunks in the open fields. At Havra, woodland has developed by tree colonization of old meadows and open fields during the last 40 years after the cessation of earlier managements. Some floristic differences between the epiphytic vegetation on trunks in the open fields and in the woodland are found. This suggests a change in the epiphytic vegetation because of the creation of a more shady habitat in parts of the area during a few decades.

AB  - Concerns over future healthcare capacity along with continuing demands for sustainability call for novel solutions to improve citizens' health and wellbeing through effective prevention and improved diagnosis and treatment. Part of the solution to tackle the challenge could be making the most of the exploitation of genomic data in personalized risk assessment, creating new opportunities for data-driven precision prevention and public health. Presently, the utilization of genomic data in the Finnish healthcare system is limited to a few medical specialty areas. To successfully extend the use of genomic information in everyday healthcare, evidence-based and feasible strategies are needed. The national actions that Finland is taking towards this goal are 1) providing scientific evidence for the utility of genomic information for healthcare purposes; 2) evaluating the potential health-economic impact of implementing precision healthcare in Finland; 3) developing a relevant legal framework and infrastructures for the utilization of genomic information; 4) building a national multidisciplinary expert network bringing together relevant professionals and initiatives to achieve consensus among the different stakeholders on specific issues vital for translating genomic data into precision healthcare; 5) building competence and genomic literacy skills among various target groups; and 6) public engagement (informing and educating the public). Taken together, these actions will enable building a roadmap towards the expedient application of genomic data in Finnish healthcare and promoting the health of our citizens.

AB  - The structure of Scandinavian boreal forests has changed in many ways as a result of modem intensive forestry. One of the most fundamental changes is the loss of coarse woody debris (CWD), which has adversely affected many wood-inhabiting species. The consequences of reductions in CWD and its variability have received much attention in the literature recently. However, a neglected substratum change with possible profound ecological implications is enhanced tree growth rate due to forestry practices such as thinning and fertilization. In the study presented here we investigated how tree growth rate influenced the decay capacity of two threatened species, Phlebia centrifuga and Fomitopsis rosea, and a common species, F pinicola, of saprotrophic wood-decay fungi. Their decay capacity was measured as the weight loss they caused in Picea abies wood-discs categorised as fast-, moderately-, and slow-grown.
   The results show that the rates of decay caused by all three species were highest in fast-grown wood cut in thinnings, and lowest in slow-grown wood cut in extensively managed stands. None of the stands had been fertilised. Interestingly, rate of decay caused by the common generalist fungus F pinicola was 50% higher in fast-grown wood than in slow-grown wood, suggesting that the turnover of dead wood is much higher in intensively managed forests. Thus, the time window for wood-living species to colonize CWD, which is a transient habitat even in old-growth forests, is even shorter in intensively managed forests. This may adversely affect species with poor dispersal ability. Moreover, F rosea decayed the slow-grown wood significantly more rapidly than the other species. This suggests that it may be adapted to such substrates, and that F rosea may be favoured in old-growth forests where trees generally have slower growth rates than in managed forest. For P. centrifuga, there was a large variation in its decay capacity among genets, indicating a need for further studies on the genetics of threatened wood-fungi, given the species' fragmented distribution. circle dot 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Demographic population dynamics, gene flow, and local adaptation may influence each other and lead to coupling of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, especially in species inhabiting fragmented heterogeneous environments. Here, I review long-term research on eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics in the Glanville fritillary butterfly inhabiting a large network of approximately 4,000 meadows in Finland. The metapopulation persists in a balance between frequent local extinctions and recolonizations. The genetic spatial structure as defined by neutral markers is much more coarse-grained than the demographic spatial structure determined by the fragmented habitat, yet small-scale spatial structure has important consequences for the dynamics. I discuss three examples of eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics. (i) Extinction-colonization metapopulation dynamics influence allele frequency changes in the phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) gene, which leads to strong associations between genetic variation in Pgi and dispersal, recolonization, and local population dynamics. (ii) Inbreeding in local populations increases their risk for extinction, whereas reciprocal effects between inbreeding, population size, and emigration represent likely eco-evolutionary feedbacks. (iii) Genetically determined female oviposition preference for two host plant species exhibits a cline paralleling a gradient in host plant relative abundances, and host plant preference of dispersing females in relation to the host plant composition of habitat patches influences immigration (gene flow) and recolonization (founder events). Eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics in heterogeneous environments may not lead to directional evolutionary changes unless the environment itself changes, but eco-evolutionary dynamics may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation attributable to fluctuating selection in space and time.

AB  - Sustainable physical activity and active transportation are important for achieving sustainable societies as well as for achieving the sustainable development goal of health and wellbeing for all. The main objective of this pilot study was to investigate the general public's perceptions of sustainable physical activity and active transportation in the cities of Gavle (Sweden) and Maputo (Mozambique). Twelve semi-structured asynchronous e-mail interviews were subjected to content analysis. Findings indicated that participants knew what physical activity is and that they related it to general health and wellbeing. However, the majority were not familiar with the meaning of "sustainable physical activity" or "active transportation." Furthermore, they did not know about the relationship between sustainable development and physical activity. The few participants who knew about active transportation said that it could contribute to reducing greenhouse gases. They mentioned barriers to active transportation in their respective cities, however, ranging from laziness (in the case of Gavle) to cultural norms and associations such as linking the use of active transportation to lacking the means to buy a motor vehicle (in Maputo). There is a need to integrate sustainability literacy with the already existing health and public health literacies to provide this knowledge to the general population. To this end, rather than creating new educational programmes for the public, the existing materials can be adjusted to include aspects of sustainability and sustainable health behaviours and lifestyles.

AB  - While the role of agency is widely acknowledged in socio-technical transition research, there remains a research gap on agency in transitions and a call for studies using an actor-centred approach to transition studies. In response to this call, this paper addresses the role of actors and, particularly, organisations in transitions. It examines the role of organisational change in socio-technical sustainability transitions and, more specifically, how transition initiatives may trigger and support these changes in organisations and systems. For this purpose, the paper draws on literature from both transition studies and organisational change management (OCM) to build a multi-scale, integrative theoretical heuristic. This addresses drivers and barriers for organisational change as an integral part of transition processes, connecting the micro level of the individual, the meso level of the organisation and the macro level of the broader system in which the organisation is located. With the goal of illustrating the links between OCM and transition studies, this paper empirically examines the impact of Region 2050, a large, multi-organisation transition initiative in Sweden, in terms of creating change within the organisations involved. The main focus is on how the organisations acquire the new knowledge and capabilities required for improving regional planning for sustainability. The empirical study identifies leverage points at the micro-, meso- and macro-levels, which may be used in order to change strategic planning processes. Three different theoretical concepts from transition studies and OCM that could help to foster long-term planning are also identified: (1) the macro level of institutional plurality and its connection to the meso- (organisational) level; (2) collaboration as a key success factor on the organisational level; and (3) at the micro-level, the roles of individuals as change agents and boundary spanners. Overall, the case highlights the merits of the OCM literature for transition studies and their emphasis on understanding interacting processes operating at multiple scales. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Climate scenarios predict that temperatures will rise and the subsequent heat periods that negatively impact human well-being will increasingly become common. The impact of heat in cities can be adapted to through urban planning, economic investments and other measures. The outcomes of adaptation should be monitored, for example, through indicators. However, adaptation outcome indicators are lacking research and development. We report a co-development process of adaptation outcome indicators that can be used to assess adaptation progress to urban heat risk. We use existing literature, a focus group discussion and a questionnaire to codevelop 16 indicators in the City of Helsinki, Finland. Developed indicators take into account key urban characteristics, including social vulnerability, state of the environment, infrastructure, green-blue infrastructure, economic resources, and knowledge and awareness. This study provides a framework for cities to develop their adaptation monitoring strategy and illustrates a novel empirical case study of derivation process of urban heat risk adaptation indicators.

AB  - This study is an attempt to evaluate the relationships between the vegetation and the modem pollen rain as a contribution to palaeoecological research. Pollen analysis of surface moss polsters and floristic records has been undertaken for 51 sampling points distributed all over the study area (Champsaur valley, Hautes-Alpes, France), within different vegetation and land-use types and along a west-east altitudinal transect, ranging from 870 to 2200 in a.s.l. The pollen and vegetation data were analysed independently using numerical methods (clustering and correspondence analysis) to investigate how vegetation is reflected in pollen assemblages.
   There was a good agreement between classifications and ordinations of the two data-sets and a pollen-analytical separation of different types of human activities was found despite the major gradients related to altitude and soil moisture. Both the AP/NAP ratio and the major pollen type percentage ranges given for each vegetation type were however very wide because of the typical fine-scale mosaic of the landscape in this region. Detailed comparisons of the two data-sets showed consistent differences between vegetation and pollen assemblages. Misclassifications of some modem pollen spectra were mainly attributed to differential pollen representation between species, but also to the effect of various land-use practices on flowering and pollination of herbaceous plant taxa. Moreover these differences, as well as discrepancies with earlier published data from lowlands of southern France and other parts of western Europe, are promoted by complex pollen dispersal which characterizes mountain environments. Although an overlap of characteristics thus exists between pollen assemblages, we were able to recognize specific features and indicator pollen taxa have been identified for each natural, semi-natural and human-induced vegetation type.

AB  - Biobeds provide a simple and cheap solution to reducing point- source contamination by pesticides from farm activities. In its original design, the Swedish biobed is a clay- lined pit in the ground filled with a biomixture of topsoil, peat and straw and covered with a grass layer. The straw stimulates the growth of lignin- degrading fungi and the formation and activity of ligninolytic enzymes which can degrade many different pesticides. Here we compared the behaviour of the chlorpyrifos pesticide in two biobeds of different composition: a Swedish biobed composed of 50% v vine straw, 25% v peat and 25% v Swedish soil; and an Italian biobed composed of 40% v vine straw, 40% v green compost and 20% v Italian soil. Microbial biomass was measured in the Italian biomix by the fumigation- extraction method. The microbial activity was estimated by measuring mineralisation of a synthetic lignin, C-14- de- hydrogenative polymerisate (C-14- DHP) in the Swedish biomix. Microbial respiration was followed over time in both biomixes. Our results show that the chlorpyrifos half- lives were similar in both biomixes. The microbial biomass content was reduced by 25 and 50% with, respectively, 10 and 50 mg kg(-1) chlorpyrifos in the Italian biomix. The respiration activity was affected only at 50 mg kg(-1) chlorpyrifos in the Italian biomix. No effect was observed in the Swedish biomix despite the higher chlorpyrifos concentration of 100 mg kg(-1). The mineralisation of C-14- DHP was not affected by the presence of chlorpyrifos in the Swedish biomix. These findings could be explained by the presence of chlorpyrifos- sensitive microorganisms in the Italian biomix and chlorpyrifos-resitant microorganisms in the Swedish biomix. The more robust microflora developed in the Swedish biomix may be explained by its lower nitrogen content, higher C/ N ratio and lower pH, all of which are favourable for the development of lignin- degrading fungi and their activity. In Sweden more than 1000 biobeds are in practical use on farms and they have been shown to be efficient at reducing pesticide water- body contamination. The present study compares the capability of an Italian biomix for degrading pesticides to that shown by the Swedish original biomix in order to introduce this biological system for a sustainable Italian agriculture.

AB  - Today, Sweden enjoys a positive international reputation for its commitment to human rights issues, for instance, in relation to the recent migrant crisis. Abuses committed by the Swedish state against certain ethnic groups within the country are less well known, both within and beyond its borders. These included systematic attempts to curtail the use of indigenous and local languages, thereby causing communicative and ideological rifts between children and their parents. These policies were enacted through the school system from the 1920s until the 1970s, and particularly affected people living in the Arctic region where the national borders are disputed. In this article, we examine two twenty-first-century films set during this era, featuring feisty female characters responding to the school policy. Elina: As though I wasn't there is a children's film created by people "outside" the cultural group represented; and Sami Blood features an adolescent protagonist (and her older self), created by "insiders" of the cultural group represented. In both films, the female protagonists' relative lack of agency within the state school system is contrasted with their powerful connections to the Arctic landscape. We seek to examine how these films contribute to the work of apology, beginning with a public acknowledgement of the wrongs of the past. Whilst one of the films concludes with a celebration of the female protagonists' agency, the other proffers a more ambiguous portrayal of power in relation to culture, nationality, and identity.

AB  - The data bank for species composition and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in the cooling pond of the Leningrad nuclear power plant (NPP), in the Finland Gulf, Kopor Bay, was developed over several years of complex monitoring. Regular observations were carried out, beginning in 1978. The inflow of warm waters from NPP (200 m3/S) and industrial-municipal discharges resulted in rapid reservoir eutrophication. Phytoplankton vegetation is now observed practically for the whole year; the species composition of plankton has gradually changed and blue-green algae now predominate. Mean and maximum indices of phytoplankton concentrations increased significantly. Features of anthropogenic succession are discussed relative to the action of thermal and biogenic loads. Results of correlation analysis of phytoplankton time series and hydrochemical parameters are shown. A mathematical model is developed for describing phytoplankton seasonal dynamics in cooling ponds.

AB  - Background: High-quality clinical practice guidelines are necessary for effective use of resources both at an individual patient- and national-level. Nordic clinical practice guidelines recommendations for orthotic treatment of knee osteoarthritis vary and little is known about their quality. Objectives: The aim of the study was to critically evaluate the quality of clinical practice guidelines in orthotic management of knee osteoarthritis in the Nordic countries. Study Design: Systematic review. Methods: Four national clinical practice guidelines for treatment of knee osteoarthritis were assessed for methodological rigour and transparency by four independent assessors using the AGREE II instrument. Summary domain scores and inter-rater agreement (Kendall's W) were calculated. Results: Domain scores indicate that many guidelines have not sufficiently addressed stakeholder involvement (average score: 55%), applicability (20%) and editorial independence (33%) in the development process. Inter-rater agreement for assessors indicated 'good' agreement for clinical practice guidelines from Finland, Norway and Sweden (W = 0.653, p < 0.001; W = 0.512, p = 0.003 and W = 0.532, p = 0.002, respectively) and 'strong' agreement for the clinical practice guideline from Denmark (W = 0.800, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Quality of clinical practice guidelines for orthotic treatment of knee osteoarthritis in the Nordic region is variable. Future guideline development should focus on improving methodology by involving relevant stakeholders (e.g. certified prosthetist/orthotists (CPOs)), specifying conflicts of interest and providing guidance for implementation.

AB  - Sustainable development of the built environment requires the production of increased quantities of construction materials and energy services, produced within the constraints of natural systems. This paper presents recent findings from Sweden on the intensive use of renewable forest resources within integrated material and energy systems. Production of materials for wood-framed construction uses less primary energy than for comparable reinforced concrete construction. Multiple wood-based products can be co-produced from the forest biomass, increasing the efficiency of raw material use. Biomass by-products from the entire wood product chain, including forestry, wood processing, construction and demolition, can be recovered for use as biofuel. The biofuel energy available over the life cycle of a wood-framed building is greater than the primary energy used to produce the materials. Increasing forest management intensity gives greater energy returns on management energy inputs. Intensive production of forest biomass is maintained by closing nutrient cycles through application of wood ash and nitrogen fertiliser.

AB  - 1. The long-term history of Quercus in southern Scandinavia has received little attention despite its important role in modern conservation. In this study the 4000-year dynamics of Quercus, its habitat and other important taxa were analysed with pollen data from 25 small hollows and 6 regional sites across southern Scandinavia. The aim was to provide a context for understanding the species' current status and managing its future dynamics.
   2. The results indicate that Quercus is much less abundant today than at any time during the previous 4000 years and corroborate the rapid decline reported in 18th- and 19th-century historical records. Modern pollen percentages are 45-60% of 17th-century values and only 20-35% of the maximum values reached in the 3rd century.
   3. A strong positive correlation exists between the abundance of Quercus and the abundance of Tilia, Corylus and Alnus, which also experienced a steady decline across the region in the last two millennia. Climate change is the broad-scale driver of the observed dynamics, but human activity introduced considerable variation in the regional and temporal details of these changes. In the hemiboreal northern part of the study area the decline of Quercus appears to be controlled largely by competition with other tree species ( especially Pinus and Picea), mediated by harvesting. In the temperate south part Quercus forests decreased through deforestation for agriculture.
   4. Multivariate analyses indicate that although substantial phytogeographical variation has existed through past millennia the regional vegetation is more homogeneous today than in earlier periods.
   5. Synthesis. The long-term decline and recent rapid reductions in Quercus populations throughout southern Scandinavia are striking and indisputable. From the perspective of both the populations of Quercus and its associated species of insects and epiphytes, the recent rate of decline is extremely rapid. Given the former abundance, longevity and capacity for persistence of Quercus, current populations of Quercus and its associated species appear to represent biological legacies in the midst of protracted decline. Based on these results, a reasonable conservation goal is to restore the abundance and distribution of Quercus to levels that preceded the drastic decline in the 18th and 19th centuries.

AB  - Population genetic structure and intrapopulation levels of genetic variation have important implications for population dynamics and evolutionary processes. Habitat fragmentation is one of the major threats to biodiversity. It leads to smaller population sizes and reduced gene flow between populations and will thus also affect genetic structure. We use a natural system of island and mainland populations of house sparrows along the coast of Norway to characterize the different population genetic properties of fragmented populations. We genotyped 636 individuals distributed across 14 populations at 15 microsatellite loci. The level of genetic differentiation was estimated using F-statistics and specially designed Mantel tests were conducted to study the influence of population type (i.e. mainland or island) and geographic distance on the genetic population structure. Furthermore, the effects of population type, population size and latitude on the level of genetic variation within populations were examined. Our results suggest that genetic processes on islands and mainland differed in two important ways. First, the intrapopulation level of genetic variation tended to be lower and the occurrence of population bottlenecks more frequent on islands than the mainland. Second, although the general level of genetic differentiation was low to moderate, it was higher between island populations than between mainland populations. However, differentiation increased in mainland populations somewhat faster with geographical distance. These results suggest that population bottleneck events and genetic drift have been more important in shaping the genetic composition of island populations compared with populations on the mainland. Such knowledge is relevant for a better understanding of evolutionary processes and conservation of threatened populations.

AB  - Abstract
   This article examines the concept of governance as a process of making and implementing decisions about the European Capital of Culture (ECOC) mega-event. In considering the actors who prepare and realize the event, as well as the temporary or permanent societal structures formed around it, ECOC governance becomes not merely an issue between the European Union on the one hand, and the 'branded' cities and their relevant national authorities on the other. Rather more creative, mixed partnerships emerge transcending spatial-administrative hierarchies, initiating co-operation along more horizontal, relational networks. Moments of inclusion and exclusion, conflict and cooperation play out in the governance of such mega-events, governance processes which are therefore contingent, emergent and transient. The study is based on ECOC documents, media sources and in-depth interviews with actors engaged in the projects. Through a focus on the Hungarian Pecs 2010 and Finnish Turku 2011 projects ECOC governance is characterized not only by compromises and hard decisions but also by new co-operation, increasing social involvement as well as the emerging and resolved conflicts that ensue. Besides the analytical accounts of the governance of the two projects the research explores the ways and reasons regional governance practices are diversified by dissimilar relational processes.

AB  - This article explores how farming fathers frame fatherhood according to time-specific ideals. Based on interviews with fathers and their adult sons in Norway, findings show clear differences between the two generations concerning how fathers engage with their children and justify their practices. For the older generation, the major frames are complementary gender roles, good farming practices and farm succession. The current generation frames their fathering practices in involved fathering, changing childhoods and intensive parenting. Considering where the frames come from, it is notable that the older generation refers to local cultural accounts of agriculture when justifying their fathering practices, while the frames used by the current generation are not farm related but refer to broader social and cultural accounts of their time. The framing perspective used in this article contributes to understanding the ideological transformation of agricultural fatherhood in a period in which the patriarchal contours of agriculture may be changing.

AB  - Since the 1940s Swedish rural policy has shaped agriculture and food production into a rational, large scale and specialised industry, focused on food hygiene. However, in Jamtland pockets of resistance remained where small-scale farmers continued to produce local cheeses. As rural policy has shifted towards favouring the local and traditional within Geographic Indication frameworks, these cheeses are receiving more attention from policymakers as well as consumers. During the last 10-15 years local cheese making has been revitalised with the introduction of sophisticated techniques and new knowledges on how to work with microbes to create more distinct, local cheeses. Bacteria cultures and moulds are treasured and explicitly considered in ways that were previously tacit. As this paper shows the development of these new cheese-making processes owe a lot to imported knowledge and microbes from France. The paper goes on to discuss how these 'cultural imports' combine with local knowledge and microbes to enable different narratives of locality, 'authenticity', and 'traditional' within contemporary cheese-making.

AB  - Transitioning to sustainable mobility systems is generally thought to require three approaches: avoid, shift and improve. We examine a combination of these in a city at the forefront of implementing transition policies, focusing on how the approaches interact and impact social inclusion. The Norwegian city of Bergen has pursued ambitious targets to reduce car use and promote walking, cycling and public transportation (avoid and shift). National subsidies have achieved more electric vehicles per capita than any other country (improve). Tensions between policies to avoid and displace automobility, and to accelerate electric automobility, center on the relationship between mobility transitions and social inclusion. Based on an in-depth qualitative study during 2020-2021, we analyze key examples of avoid, shift and improve approaches. We show that urban electric automobility risks undermining, not complementing, avoid and shift goals. We further demonstrate how populist politics mobilized around automobility reinforce elite narratives and pose a challenge to the legitimacy of transition planners and policy makers. We recognize different forms of depoliticization and argue that if socially inclusive mobility systems require overcoming the strong vested interests embedded in cultural attitudes around automobility, then depoliticizing an agenda to reduce car dependence - not just cars - can be progressive.

AB  - Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) are commonly found in urban environments. To evaluate human-hedgehog interactions on the northern margin of the hedgehog range, we investigated the causes of mortality, the occurrence of diseases, parasites and bacterial infections, and the diet of hedgehogs (males n = 87, females n = 66, sex unknown n = 100) found dead in Joensuu, Finland, during the years 2004-2005. Hedgehog carcasses were obtained from a radio telemetry tracking study and a traffic mortality survey conducted by us, as well as from local people who provided us with dead hedgehogs. Of the carcasses obtained during the tracking study, 75 % died of human-related causes. The vast majority (97 %) of human-related deaths were road kills, and more than half (56 %) of natural deaths were by starvation. The average number of hedgehogs killed on the roads was 0.65 per 100 km of road transect studied. Purulent and gangrenous inflammation of the limbs was found in 11 adult males (out of 38 collected) in pathological examinations. The Salmonella enteritidis (phage type 20) infections that were found in 57 % of the individuals examined were typically latent and were mainly found in the liver. Lungworms (Crenosoma striatum) were found in 79 % of the individuals examined. Altogether, 92 % of the stomachs contained remains of human foods, especially fish and milk. The hedgehogs' natural diet included invertebrates such as beetles (Coleoptera) and earthworms (Clitellata). Our results show that the main negative anthropogenic impact on hedgehogs is severe traffic mortality. The observed high prevalence of Salmonella calls for appropriate hygienic measures when feeding and handling hedgehogs.

AB  - Stevenage, Tapiola (Hagalund) and Vallingby were the first exponents of the new town concept in Britain, Finland and Sweden respectively, attracting attention not only within their home countries but also widely in Europe. In all three places, general plans were finalized around 1950, testing the latest ideas - such as neighbourhood units, the Radburn concept and community centres. The towns were to be organized in cohesive neighbour-hood areas, each with its own identity and its own community centre. The three towns differ in their morphological character. In Tapiola the scale is modest but the variation all the greater. In Stevenage the single-family house predominates, while in Tapiola there is a mixture of house types. Vallingby is dominated by blocks of flats, though there are also row houses and detached houses. In all three towns resources and interest were invested in achieving a modern main centre, which included cultural and social activities as well as commercial ones. Each town epitomized a new, brighter future, perhaps reflecting an optimism that was stronger in Scandinavia and Britain than elsewhere. The firm faith that characterized the drive to build the three new towns may seem slightly naive from today point of view. Yet it is clear that we can learn a lot from the enthusiasm and fighting spirit of the 1950s, the social commitment, and the desire to create good housing, preferably with ample outdoor environments, affordable to broad groups of citizens.

AB  - Wave power, along with renewable energy-generating sources like tides and streams, is underestimated considering its advantageous physical properties and predictability. This paper examines possible examples of wave power installations in the Baltic Sea and the Danish part of the North Sea. Hindcasting data is used allowing estimations of wave energy generated and results show promising areas in the North Sea, but also several parts of the Baltic Sea are of interest. The study is based upon linear generator technique, placed on the seabed using point-absorbers arranged in arrays of up to several thousand units. The study aims at showing the physical possibilities of wave energy, including economical feasibility and environmental advantages of wave energy even in moderate wave climates. With discussion from two examples in the Baltic Sea, one in the Danish North Sea and a new pilot study site in the Swedish part of Skagerrak, this study show feasible illustrations of wave energy takeouts. Project examples vary in size due to distance to grid, grid voltage, and may thus be economically feasible. Examples also show considerations in societal and nature conservation matters, including aspects such as industrial and military interests, archaeological or marine reserves and local geology. The authors conclude that wave energy electric conversion is an option that needs more attention and which has several advantages compared to conventional renewable sources. Sound engineering, in combination with producer, consumer and broad societal perspective is advised for a sustainable development of wave energy conversion. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article is based on a case study investigating the pattern of communication and participation in Nonvegian forest management. The study concludes that forest management only to a limited extent includes formal public participation. The examples of participation in Norwegian forest management also indicate that formal participation is no guarantee of real influence and that the competence and attitude of key actors may be of great importance. The pattern of communication between key stakeholders in the present forest management system is clearly influenced by the distribution of power and conflicting interests. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Pyhasalmi mine, central Finland, has operated as a deep metal mine since 1967. It currently reaches a depth of almost 1500 m, making it the deepest mining operation in Europe. Around 900,000 m(3) of metal-rich, extremely acidic water are pumped out of the mine each year. The near constant air temperature of similar to 24 degrees C together with exposure of sulfidic rock surfaces to air and water, have created an environment that is highly suitable for colonization by acidophilic mineral-oxidizing microorganisms. Using a combined cultivation-dependent and molecular approach, indigenous bacteria in waters at two depths within the mine, and of an acid streamer sample were identified and isolated. Iron-oxidizing chemolithotrophs (Acidithiobacillus and Leptospirillum spp., and "Ferrovum myxofaciens" Were the most abundant bacteria in mine water samples, whereas the acid streamer community contained a greater proportion of heterotrophic acidophiles (Ferrimicrobium acidiphilum and a gammaproteobacterium related to Metallibacterium scheffleri). The most abundant isolates obtained from both water and streamer samples were all strains of Acidithiobacillus Group IV, a proposed separate species of iron-oxidizing acidithiobacilli that has not yet been classified as such. Archaea were also detected in water and streamer samples using molecular methods, but most were not identified and no isolates were obtained. (C) 2014 Institut Pasteur.

AB  - In the modern forestry paradigm, many factors influence the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD). The present paper analyzes the effects of both local (national) programs (special functions of forests) and European programs (Natura 2000 sites), as well as the individual characteristics of forest stands. The study was conducted on 2,752 sampling plots distributed over an area of about 17,500 ha and located in lowland stands having a species composition typical of large areas in central Europe. Natura 2000 areas contained significantly more CWD (8.4 m(3)/ha) than areas not covered by the program (4.8 m(3)/ha). However, this is due to the fact that Natura 2000 sites involve well-preserved forest areas, such as nature reserves (26.6 m(3)/ha). In the managed forests that have been covered by the Natura 2000 program over the past several years, the volume of CWD has not increased. Forests with ecological and social functions differed slightly in the amount of CWD. More CWD occurred in protected animal areas (8.7 m(3)/ha) than in stands damaged by industry (3.9 m(3)/ha). Intermediate CWD levels were found in water-protection forests and in forests located around cities and military facilities. In managed forests, the lowest CWD volume was observed in middle-aged stands. The species composition of the stand had little effect on the volume of CWD. Only stands with a predominance of ash and alder had higher CWD levels (13.5 m(3)/ha). More CWD was found in stands whose species composition did not represent the potential site quality (6.4 m(3)/ha) than in habitats with the optimum species composition (3.8 m(3)/ha). CWD volume should be systematically increased taking into consideration local natural conditions. Such efforts should be focused on particularly valuable regions, and especially on Natura 2000 sites, where the threshold values reported from other European forests should be reached. Leaving some trees to die naturally and retaining reasonable amounts of such trees ought to be incorporated into CWD management practice in Poland.

AB  - Long-term impacts of climate evolution and agricultural management on soil properties and thus soil functioning must be assessed by modelling studies. We focus on modelling of the clay depth distribution as a result of natural soil formation and agricultural management by using the soil genesis model SoilGen2 with loess-derived Luvisols in northern France. An essential first step is the calibration of the processes concerning clay leaching (lessivage) in this model, for which we propose a reproducible method consisting of a screening for a realistic parameter range, a sensitivity analysis and finally a model calibration. To be able to separate the effects of natural soil evolution and more recent agricultural activities, we calibrated the model firstly on natural soils still under forest. Four parameters were the most sensitive and in need of calibration, representing the volume fraction of the soil in contact with macropores, a filter coefficient and physical weathering producing clay-sized particles. These parameters were successfully calibrated, but independent validations at Belgian and Norwegian sites with Albeluvisols and Stagnosols developed in loess and marine clay did not always show an improvement on earlier calibrations. This can be related to several factors, most importantly the dominance of processes other than lessivage in Albeluvisols and uncertain reconstructions of the climate. After calibration, a functional sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the effect of agricultural management on lessivage. Clear effects on clay loss in the topsoil were found for the length of the crop-cover period and the ploughing depth and to a lesser extent for the intensity of soil mixing and the interception evaporation of the crops. As it is not feasible to reconstruct these factors for the entire period of agriculture in this region (several millennia), further analysis should take the form of scenario studies, but this should be preceded by use of field leaching experiments to calibrate SoilGen2 over short time-scales.

AB  - In the decision-making process that determines timber sales between private forest owners and the Finnish forest industry, opinions frequently conflict about the extent to which the forest landscape should be managed. The objective of this study was to investigate whether it would be useful to develop a landscape visualization tool that would help forest owners understand the consequences of harvesting so they could make a more informed decision on whether to sell their timber. We evaluated responses to a survey sent to forest owners in two regions of Finland to provide insights into owner appreciation of the forest landscape. The 545 forest owners who responded also evaluated the value of computer visualizations and a set of computer-generated images of the landscape. Our analysis concentrated on whether visualizing the landscape would affect sales decisions and - since women are increasingly becoming forest owners - how gender affected perceptions of the landscape and decision making. Visualization proved to be a popular tool for all forest owners. However, male and female forest owners had different perspectives on the forest landscape. Factors that differed between men and women for the statements with the strongest weightings in the principal component analysis explained 26 per cent of the overall variation in perceptions. Women particularly wanted to be able to visualize the post-harvesting landscape and preferred different types of visualization than men. Values associated with forest landscapes and their visualization seem more important to women and may therefore affect their sales decisions more than those of men. Based on these results, it will be useful to design and implement a decision support tool that will help forest owners visualize the consequences of harvesting and help the Finnish forest industry provide a more environmentally friendly service that accounts for the owner's landscape-related goals.

AB  - Supporting migrants in entering host societies is a challenge. In Sweden, influx of migrants resulted in problems with access to in-classroom Swedish language courses for migrants in general, and for health care professionals (HCPs) in particular. Due to its accessibility, mobile technology can be a bridging tool between migrants and host societies, providing an alternative/ complement to classroom teaching.
   This study reports on the non-European HCPs' employability needs, and how these needs can be met by a mobile application. A qualitative methodology based on semi-structured focus group interviews and interactive workshops with HCPs, mentors and language teachers is used to (a) investigate the HPCs' needs; (b) discuss the content and the design of a mobile prototype application (app) for supporting labour market integration of HCPs. Further, based on the findings, a prototype is created for user testing. Thematic content analysis is used for analysis of the data from the focus groups and workshops. Descriptive statistics is used for the analysis of questionnaires for prototype testing.
   The results show that the HCPs need a targeted language and culture training as well as opportunities to develop contacts with Swedish HCPs. Further, a roadmap for the main steps needed to get a medical license is requested. The users are in general positive about the prototype. The results suggest a possibility of cultural impact on design preferences.
   The study gives suggestions for developing a mobile app for enhancing integration of HCPs in the Swedish labor market, which can potentially be further developed for other professional groups.

AB  - Background: There is conflicting evidence that traffic-related air pollution is a risk factor for allergic conditions. Few studies have investigated this in adults. In adults, a high proportion of asthma, rhinitis and eczema is triggered by non-allergic factors. We investigated traffic as a risk factor for allergic versus non-allergic asthma and rhinitis, and eczema, in adults.
   A questionnaire from 2000 (n = 9319, 18-77 years) provided individual data about disease outcome and self-reported traffic exposure. Additional exposure assessments were obtained using Geographical Informations Systems (GIS). Residential addresses were linked to the national Swedish Road Database and to a pollutant database with modelled annual means of NOx (Nitrogen Oxids).
   Results: Living within 100 m from a road with a traffic intensity of > 10 cars/min (24 hour mean) was associated with prevalence of current asthma reported to be triggered by allergic factors (OR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.23-2.72) and with allergic rhinitis (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = (1.05-1.61). No relation was seen with asthma or rhinitis triggered by other factors. Living within 100 m of a road with > 10 cars/min was also associated with hand-eczema during the last 12 months (OR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.19-2.23), but not with allergic eczema or diagnosed hand-eczema. Consistent results were seen using self-reported traffic, but the associations with NOx were less consistent.
   Conclusion: Exposure to traffic was associated with a higher prevalence of allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis, but not with asthma or rhinitis triggered by non-allergic factors. This difference was suggested by the overall pattern, but only clear using GIS-measured traffic intensity as a proxy for traffic exposure. An association was also found with hand-eczema during the last 12 months. We suggest that asthma and rhinitis should not be treated as homogenous groups when estimating effects from traffic in adults.

AB  - In agricultural landscapes, forest herbs live in small, spatially isolated forest patches. For their long-term survival, their populations depend on animals as genetic linkers that provide pollen- or seed-mediated gene flow among different forest patches. However, whether insect pollinators serve as genetic linkers among spatially isolated forest herb populations in agricultural landscapes remains to be shown. Here, we used population genetic methods to analyze: (A) the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of populations of two common, slow-colonizing temperate forest herb species [Polygonatum multiflorum (L.) All. and Anemone nemorosa L.] in spatially isolated populations within three agricultural landscapes in Germany and Sweden and (B) the movement activity of their most relevant associated pollinator species, i.e., the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum (Scopoli, 1,763) and the hoverfly Melanostoma scalare (Fabricus, 1,794), respectively, which differ in their mobility. We tested whether the indicated pollinator movement activity affected the genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of the forest herb populations. Bumblebee movement indicators that solely indicated movement activity between the forest patches affected both genetic diversity and genetic differentiation of the associated forest herb P. multiflorum in a way that can be explained by pollen-mediated gene flow among the forest herb populations. In contrast, movement indicators reflecting the total movement activity at a forest patch (including within-forest patch movement activity) showed unexpected effects for both plant-pollinator pairs that might be explained by accelerated genetic drift due to enhanced sexual reproduction. Our integrated approach revealed that bumblebees serve as genetic linkers of associated forest herb populations, even if they are more than 2 km apart from each other. No such evidence was found for the forest associated hoverfly species which showed significant genetic differentiation among forest patches itself. Our approach also indicated that a higher within-forest patch movement activity of both pollinator species might enhance sexual recruitment and thus diminishes the temporal buffer that clonal growth provides against habitat fragmentation effects.

AB  - Low trophic aquaculture (LTA), such as bivalve farming, offers promising avenues to supply sustainable seafood and aquafeed. While bivalve farming usually occurs in highly productive coastal areas which already support numerous human activities and suffer from environmental pressures, numerical tools offer a promising avenue to explore and assess biomass production potential and associated ecosystemic impacts for further development of the industry and prospection of new exploitation sites. In this study, we coupled an ecophysiological model, the dynamic energy budget theory (DEB), with an ecosystem model (NORWECOM.E2E) to simulate blue mussel Mytilus spp. farming production and effects based on the food web in the mesotrophic Hardangerfjord in western Norway. We tested several levels of fjord-scale farming intensity and assessed 2 production purposes: aquafeed and human consumption. Results suggested the Hardangerfjord could host large-scale mussel farming for both purposes. However, large exploitation schemes displayed detrimental effects on individual mussel growth (39% less wet mass after 2 yr) and especially on secondary production (decrease of 33% after 1 yr) due to acute trophic competition. Simulations showed short production cycles for aquafeed were more efficient to exploit primary production, since young and small mussels have lower maintenance and reproduction costs. Dissolved nutrient inputs from salmonid farms had marginal effects on primary production (<2%). However, salmonid and mussel farming activities could compete for the sites with the highest production potential.

AB  - This article engages with the everyday geographies of mobile pedagogy by exploring Children's Traffic City, a model traffic area for 5- to 10-year-olds that is operated by the Youth Department of Helsinki, Finland. Drawing from the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the article elaborates the notion of pedagogical assemblage to unsettle a series of problematic assumptions about children's mobility in present Euro-American settings, among them the idea that children are inherently unable to understand traffic environments and that these are exclusively dangerous spaces. Rather than conforming to prior pedagogical ideals, the instructors and pupils of Children's Traffic City are playing with alternative styles of learning and teaching mobilities by collaboratively reassembling essential components of traffic, including the multiple rhythms of moving bodies and the shifting materialities of infrastructures. Apart from offering insight into new ways of fostering children's participation in traffic environments, the article argues that such doings point to the role that mobile pedagogy can have in the making and unmaking of mundane habits and practices of movement and transport.

AB  - The Norwegian state has been working for more than fifteen years on various ways of improving accessibility for the general public. An important part of this work has been to develop new legislation and other forms of formal guidelines to reduce physical barriers. The new Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act, Obligation to ensure general accommodation (universal design), came into force January 2009, and introduces some complicated dilemmas, especially when it states: "When assessing whether the design or accommodation entails an undue burden, particular importance shall be attached to the effect of the accommodation on the dismantling of disabling barriers, the necessary costs associated with the accommodation, the undertaking's resources, whether the normal function of the undertaking is of a public nature, safety considerations and cultural heritage considerations." What is an "undue burden" in relation to architectural visual qualities and to the historical heritage expressed in buildings and townscapes? This paper will look into these dilemmas by discussing specific cases from some cities in different countries. What kinds of procedure are suitable and decisive when it comes to these complicated questions? Is this a task exclusively reserved for professionals, or should the voice of lay people be heard and taken into consideration? By presenting examples from architecture and landscape architecture, I will show how universal design even can be implemented in old buildings and environments. The paper will argue for more focus on procedures than just physical solutions. The procedures should be based on accepted principles for changing historical monuments, such as wholeness, readability, reversibility and sustainability.

AB  - A five-stage sequential extraction procedure was used to fractionate heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, As, V and Ba) in a biosludge from the biological wastewater treatment plant of Stora Enso Oyj Veitsiluoto Mills at Kemi, Northern Finland, into the following fractions: (1) water-soluble fraction, (2) exchangeable fraction, (3) easily reduced fraction, (4) oxidizable fraction, and (5) residual fraction. The biosludge investigated in this study is a combination of sludge from the primary and secondary clarifiers at the biological wastewater treatment plant. Extraction stages (2)-(4) follow the protocol proposed by the Measurements and Testing Program (formerly BCR Programme) of the European Commission, which is based on acetic acid extraction (stage 2), hydroxylamine hydrochloride extraction (stage 3), and hydrogen peroxide digestion following the ammonium acetate extraction (stage 4). The residual fraction (stage 5) was based on digestion of the residue from stage 4 in a mixture of HF + HNO3 + HCl. Although metals were extractable in all fractions, the highest concentrations of most of the metals occurred in the residual fraction. From the environmental point of view, it was notable that the total heavy metal concentrations in the biosludge did not exceed the maximal allowable heavy metal concentrations for sewage sludge used in agriculture, set on the basis of environmental protection of soil by European Union Directive 86/278/EEC, and by the Finnish legislation. The Ca (98.6 g kg(-1); dry weight) and Mg (2.2 g kg(-1); dry weight) concentrations in the biosludge were 62 and 11 times higher than the typical values of 1.6 and of 0.2 g kg(-1) (dry weight), respectively, in arable land in Central Finland. The biosludge had a slightly alkaline pH (similar to 8.30), a high loss-on-ignition value (similar to 78%) and a liming effect of 10.3% expressed as Ca equivalents (dry weight). This indicates its potential as a soil conditioner and improvement agent, as well as a pH buffer.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 64 (Proceedings of the 11th International Coastal Symposium), 324 - 328. Szczecin, Poland, ISBN 0749-0208
   As a result of rapid coastal zone urbanization, many sand dunes in Europe are currently at risk of degradation by their overuse, misuse or poor management. In this context, using examples from the coastal zones in Bulgaria and Estonia, the present paper is designed to illustrate and analyze critical problems of dune destruction caused by expanding human impact. Sand beaches and associated dune systems are under increasing pressure as the population along the coastlines of both countries is continuously growing. The primary focus of the study is to assess the current state of dunes in the subject countries and to identify the leading human-induced threats to the natural dune systems. Two case study sites were selected: an area around the Sunny Beach Resort and the Nessebar Peninsula, on the southern Bulgarian coast, and an area of Vosu Resort on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland, northern Estonia. Available data from field surveys, topographic maps, aerial photographs and orthophotos taken at different times were used in order to identify changes in dune landscape. Data processing and analysis were performed in GIS environment. Despite different types of sand dunes and different management measures along the Bulgarian and Estonian coastlines, the results obtained clearly show irreversible alterations to the dune areas and human-induced reduction of the area of dune landscape in general. Nevertheless, the extent of identified damage to the dunes is different in Bulgaria and Estonia. Given the pace and scope of such damage, there is an urgent need to work out recommendations for dune preservation and their proper management in both countries.

AB  - In the context of northern Europe, copper use started early in eastern Fennoscandia (Finland and the Republic of Karelia, Russia), sometime after 4000 BC. This article explores this Stone Age copper use in eastern Fennoscandia in relation to broader cultural developments in the region between the adoption of pottery (c. 5500 BC) and the end of the Stone Age (c. 1800 BC). Stone Age copper use in north-eastern Europe has conventionally been understood in terms of technology or exchange, whereas this article suggests that the beginning of copper use was linked to more fundamental changes in the perception of, and engagement with, the material world. These changes were associated with the Neolithization of eastern Fennoscandia, which started earlier than has traditionally been thought. It is also argued that the adoption, use, and manipulation of new materials played an active role in the emergence of the Neolithic world in north-eastern Europe and beyond. Also, issues related to the Finno-Russian border dividing up eastern Fennoscandia and its effects on the study of early metal use and other prehistoric cultural processes are discussed.

AB  - World meat consumption has increased considerably during recent decades at the same time as questions about the sustainability of livestock systems. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether organic meat production can be more sustainable than conventional meat production. Organic meat production is supposed to use ecological resources, such as natural grasslands and by-products with low alternative value together with fodder that is grown without artificial fertilisers and pesticides. The organic animals are given the possibility of more natural behaviour, for example, they stay outdoors all year in nature and use simple buildings. For organic meat production to expand in a sustainable way, consumers must perceive it as at least as good as conventional production regarding environmental quality and price. Therefore, possible future organic and conventional meat production are compared regarding production costs, land requirements, soil conservation, nature conservation, energy needs, and chemical requirements as well as the discharge of nitrogen and greenhouse gases.
   The results suggest that organic production can be more sustainable than conventional production for beef and lamb, but not for pork. Organic beef and lamb production has advantages compared with conventional pig production regarding soil conservation, nature conservation and independence of chemicals. However, the production costs and discharge of nitrogen and greenhouse gases per kilo of meat are larger than in conventional pork production. Organic production also needs more land, which limits its sustainability if land for food production and energy crops is scarce. When food is scarce, organic meat production should aim to use land and by-products that cannot be used in any other way for food production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sustainability indicators are currently employed by various organizations. This article focuses on the processes where the interpretation over data is created, and thereby the relevant policy messages articulated. The case study under consideration is a sustainability report by the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. This report aims at providing key information on assessing the sustainability of natural resource management. An analytical framework is outlined to capture current practices in interpreting indicators, and the efficiency of information is examined by considering the reformulation of strategic goals. The impact of new information was found to be modest. In general, few strategic changes were introduced, and the changes that had been implemented were only loosely connected to the information of the sustainability report. Restrictions of indicators as a tool are outlined and the need for more flexible ways of using information at policy forums is pointed out.

AB  - This case study increases our understanding of Lean implementation in which value stream mapping (VSM) is used to create an action plan at a small dairy and cattle farm in southwest Sweden. The researchers, the farmer-owner, and farm employees followed a step-by-step approach that resulted in ideas for operational improvements for the dairy activity. Data were collected in interviews with the farmer/owner, researcher participation in workshops, and researcher observations. The results reveal that VSM is an effective way to create a culture of collaboration among the farm staff and to better define their roles and responsibilities as well as improve routines, communications, and task completion. In the two-to-three year period following the VSM project, specific improvements were observed in milk production/quality and animal health. The results also reveal that while Lean principles are relevant given the repetitive nature of agriculture routines and tasks, the VSM element of lead-time reduction is less relevant owing to the unique value adding biological processes in the agriculture sector.

AB  - No-till planting can restrict the growth and productivity of spring grains in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Cooler soil temperatures, compared to conventional tillage, may contribute to lower productivity. Therefore, genotypes bred in cold climates may better adapt to no-till management. Eleven spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes were evaluated for N content and dry matter accumulation under direct drilling at 45 and 90 kg N ha-1. These genotypes originated in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) or the Northern European (Nordic) countries Denmark, Finland, and Sweden. The Nordic genotypes were developed under cooler, wetter soil conditions than the PNW genotypes, and were therefore predicted to be better adapted to no-till management. Barley was drilled into stubble of spring cereals in a Palouse silt loam (fine-silty, mixed mesic Pachic Ultic Haploxeroll). The Finnish genotypes, HJA Potra, HJA 80201, and HJA 78003, generally had greater above-ground dry matter and N content than the domestic genotypes prior to anthesis. These differences were not sustained through rain filling, however, and PNW genotypes accumulated more N and dry matter per unit area by maturity. Steptoe was the only genotype that consistently absorbed N during grain filling, while many genotypes exhibited net N losses. Nitrogen remobilization and N harvest index tended to be greater in 6-row genotypes compared to 2-row genotypes. The PNW genotypes generally outyielded the Nordic genotypes with the exception of 'Nordal'. Nevertheless, if the physiological traits of the Nordic genotypes associated with efficient N uptake during cold soil conditions could be incorporated into an existing PNW genotype, improved N use efficiency may be obtainable.

AB  - Esko Mannikko's The Female Pike (1990-1995) depicts lonely, middle-aged men at their homes in the economically depressed, depopulated rural regions of northern Finland. Initially, the photographic series seems to share the goal that the photographer Bert Teunissen establishes for his ongoing Domestic Landscapes project: to salvage the remnants of cultural particularity before they are obliterated by the homogenizing effects of globalization. However, rather than reproducing or preserving national identity, Mannikko's repetition of a rural iconography weighted with cultural significance in Finland has the effect of hollowing it out, opening a space to rethink it in his subsequent series Organized Freedom, Edition 2 (2001).

AB  - New legislation in Sweden has put further requirements on contract archaeology that the production of knowledge should be relevant for society and accessible to the public. What happens when heritage goals and laws are implemented in real contract archaeology projects? What is the relationship between different actors and stakeholders and the archaeological heritage landscape, and what are the reasons and factors for this? Who is included and excluded? In a case study on a large excavation from 2016 in Hjulsta, Stockholm, this paper will investigate the cultural heritage goals set by the authorities and how well these were implemented. Studying the outreach programme, I look at the relationship between Swedish contract archaeology and the rest of society. I analyse and discuss the success and problems concerning these established links, utilizing the concept of capital, and suggest strategies for improvement. I also discuss the public potential of archaeology in a more general way. In my conclusion I argue that wider inclusion of the public could help to avoid friction and conflict in a contested landscape. The case study is specifically Swedish in context, but the analysis is applicable in many national systems for undertaking archaeological investigations.

AB  - Long-term hydrobiological research has shown that the functioning of the ecosystem of the Neva Estuary, one of the largest Baltic estuaries, has changed greatly since the beginning of the 20th century. Ineffective local water management 111 St. Petersburg during the last twenty years has stimulated the development of a natural 'biological plug' in the salt barrier zone in the inner part of the estuary and has altered the ecosystem's functioning. These changes include an increase in primary production, in the primary production: organic matter decomposition ratio, and in pelagic-benthic coupling. It has also given rise to filamentous algae blooms and intensive secondary pollution in the coastal zone of the Neva Estuary. The primary production of phytoplankton in the inner part of the estuary has reached 2.3 gC m(-2), that of the filamentous algae Cladophora glomerata 5.5 gC m(-2); these figures are much higher than in other regions of the Gulf of Finland.

AB  - Structural Change ill agriculture means a continuous need for investing in farm production. It is essential for the Sustainable operations and the economy of the farm that Such investments are successful. In this research, different stages of the investment process of farms were studied as well as the use of information and the Success perceived during the investment process. The Study was carried Out with mail surveys and telephone interviews oil the Finnish Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) farms. The most challenging investments were in animal husbandry buildings and, as to these investments, the comparison of alternatives was the most challenging stage. For most investments, the planning phase was considered more challenging than the implementation. Before making the decision, farmers acquired information from many Sources, of which the opinion of the main Customer and the experiences of fellow farmers were the most valued. Sonic of the products considered were so new oil the market that it was not easy to get adequate information and, furthermore, the information given by Suppliers was not always accurate. Decision-making was supported by calculations, but qualitative factors had a dominating role. Large basic decisions were made relatively quickly, while details needed a longer time to process. In general, farm managers were satisfied with their investments. Improvements in work quality and quantity were especially mentioned and generally qualitative factors were the ones first in mind when evaluating the Successfulness of the investment.

AB  - Recycling nutrients from renewable sources, like sewage sludge, has been promoted as a step towards a circular economy by decreasing extraction and dependency on inorganic fertilizers. Implementation, however, is often controversial. In 2018, a Swedish governmental inquiry was commissioned to propose a complete ban on land application of sewage sludge to reduce soil pollution and increase phosphorus recovery. In 2020, the inquiry suggested two pathways, one to ban all land application, and one where agricultural land use should continuously be allowed. This paper is based on interviews with experts tied to the inquiry where they reference to sewage sludge, related objects, and future management. The inquiry's inability to propose a coherent suggestion is analysed inspired by the concept of multiple ontology. Several ontological versions of sewage sludge emerge that unveil tensions between concepts of danger and cleanliness, pollution and naturalness, often captured in previous studies of waste. Some versions of sewage sludge conflict, which can explain the difficulty to establish an ontologically singular knowledge base for a transformation of sewage sludge from waste to resource. Though most of the experts agree that circular economy and nutrient recycling are good things, policymaking is caught in an ontological conundrum.

AB  - Due to increasing fragmentation of the boreal forests of Fennoscandia, a number of epiphytic lichens are now becoming threatened. Since these species typically are limited by a poor ability of dispersal, one possible but largely unexplored strategy for conservation is to disperse lichen material artificially into suitable habitats. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate survival and vitality in lichen fragments from Evernia divaricata (L.) Ach. and Ramalina dilacerata (Hoffm.) Hoffm. after transplantation into three different stand types situated in northern Sweden, using different fragment sizes and modes of transplantation. After one year, survival ranged between 85% and 97.5%, and new growth occurred at all transplantation sites. The study has shown that transplantations of small fragments might constitute a resource-efficient option for establishment of new populations of endangered lichen species, or for enlarging their populations at the present sites of occurrence. In addition, the mode of transplantation was of importance for fragment vitality. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to present solutions related to wind energy in EU countries as an alternative to fossil fuels. This article is based on secondary information and statistical data regarding the development of wind power engineering in EU countries for the years 2016-2022. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze of the relations between the development of wind energy in European Union countries and GPD (gross domestic product) per capita and selected factors. The following hypotheses were formulated: H1-There is a statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and the use of wind energy in European Union countries. H2-There is a relationship between the length of the coastline and the use of wind energy in European Union countries. H3-There is a statistically significant correlation between the attitude to uncertainty of the inhabitants of a given country and the use of wind energy in said country. The presented research results support all these hypotheses. The results of the research regarding H2 are as follows: in the case of northern European countries (Ireland and Finland) and the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the development of wind power engineering in the study period was faster than could be inferred from the length of the coastline in these countries. Regarding hypothesis H1, it was concluded on the basis of the analysis that the involvement of countries in the development of wind power engineering is correlated with their wealth. The novelty of this paper emerges from its innovative approach to analyzing wind power engineering, its incorporation of cultural factors, its quantitative assessment of correlations, and its actionable policy recommendations. These elements collectively contribute to a comprehensive and impactful study that advances our understanding of wind energy adoption in the European Union.

AB  - High-relief structures may influence the abundance and diversity of reef-associated fish. We conducted a field experiment to investigate whether the presence of vertical structures ( PVC pipes) affects fish communities on artificial reefs. The effect of the height of the structures ( 1 and 3 m) was also tested. Furthermore, the effects on fish of placing artificial reefs on otherwise featureless bottoms were quantified. Algal and macro-invertebrate colonization of the reefs was also recorded. The experiment was carried out on the west coast of Sweden over a period of 1 year. The vertical structures had a positive effect on fish abundance but not on diversity. The height of the structures did not, however, influence the fish communities. Natural as well as urban vertical structures on the seafloor could have a positive effect on local fish abundance. The positive effects of artificial reefs on total fish abundance and diversity were immediate. Of the 10 species recorded, two, the black goby Gobius niger and the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, dominated over the whole survey period. There were significant temporal differences in fish abundance, and diversity increased with time.

AB  - Eight microsatellite markers for the root vole (Microtus oeconomus) were developed to assess the amount of genetic variation for nine Dutch root vole populations from four different regions, and to evaluate the degree of differentiation and isolation. All eight microsatellite loci were found to be highly variable with observed heterozygosity values ranging from 0.61 to 0.82. These values are similar to those observed for more distant populations from Norway, Finland and Germany. Therefore, the populations seem not particularly depauperate of genetic variation at the microsatellite level. Genetically, the Dutch populations were found to have diverged considerably. Pairwise comparisons of all populations studied revealed Fs, values significantly greater than zero for most comparisons. However the magnitude of these values considerably depends on the compared population pair The level of differentiation between local populations within Dutch regions is generally significantly lower than the differentiation between Dutch regions. The level of differentiation between Dutch regions, however, is not significantly different from that between populations of larger geographical distance. This implies that the regional Dutch populations are both isolated from each other and from other European populations. The observation that even local populations show low but significant genetic differentiation may be indicative for progressive isolation of these populations.

AB  - Triangulating narratives from a prospective mining site in northern Norway, this article works to identify (and render graspable) a particular effect of retroactive shock- tracing its resonance through experiences of chemical exposure, colonial racism, cultural erasure, and destruction of the built environment. Linking these experiences, the argument sets up and explores an analytical space within which the toxic modernity of planetary capitalism can resonate, structurally, with the racist violence of state colonialism: a space that also, the author suggests, describes an important dimension of Anthropocene experience itself.

AB  - Collections of visual symbols are context-specific, and include symbols and signs for example at airports, in hotels, and in traffic. They symbolize our living environments and guide us in different situations. We introduce a pattern recognition system, based on bag-of-features descriptors and support vector machine classifier, for recognizing semantic elements from pictorial symbols. We evaluate our approach by extracting semantic tags from Finnish and Japanese road signs, and by translating their meaning. Our paper demonstrates the idea of a visual dictionary that anyone from any culture can understand in any context of life.

AB  - The initial establishment of Picea abies in Sweden and Norway on a landscape level, between 3000 and 1000 years ago, was often preceded by recurrent fire and thereafter the influence of fire decreased. However, in some swamp forests, the absence of fire over the last 3500 years has promoted the continuous presence of deciduous trees, i.e. Picea has not established although it has been present regionally for over 3000 years. Our objective was to study long-term vegetation development and fire history in a Picea swamp forest located close (c. 600 m) to a deciduous swamp forest with a documented fire-free history in northernmost Sweden. The study included analyses of charred particles, pollen and ignition residues. Principal component analysis was applied to identify major changes in the pollen spectra. Our results showed that the current Picea swamp forest has developed from a deciduous fen and that fires affected the fen between 6700 and 2300 cal. yr BP. Picea abies established on the fen around 2200 cal. yr BP, following the last local on-site fire. The main factors responsible for the local vegetation development have been: fire (6700 to 2300 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes and climate (2300 to 1000 cal. yr BP); autogenous processes or anthropogenic impact (1000 to 300 cal. yr BP); anthropogenic impact through selective cutting and grazing (300 to 100 cal. yr BP); and autogenous processes and grazing (100 cal. yr BP to present). We conclude that fire facilitated the initial Picea abies establishment. Once established, Picea abies created local conditions that in combination with a colder and wetter climate prevented fire and the establishment of other tree species.

AB  - Tourism in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, Norway, has increased significantly in the last decade. Cruise ships make landings all around the archipelago, and there are numerous snowmobile, boat and hiking excursions. We describe disturbance effects on the three geese species that breed in Svalbard: the pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the light-bellied brent goose (Branta bernicla hrota). All three are regarded as highly vulnerable to disturbance. Behavioural responses by geese to humans on foot were analysed by estimating the distances at which geese become alerted, the escape flight distances and the length of escape flights, during pre-nesting, nesting and brood-rearing periods. We evaluate the consequences of human intrusion on the reproductive success in breeding colonies. During all three phases, pink-footed geese responded at longer ranges, and flew/ran longer distances, than both brent and barnacle geese: when disturbed on the nest site, both male and female pink-footed geese flew far away, resulting in a high rate of nest loss to avian predators (35%), compared with the 4 and 0% losses among barnacle and brent geese, respectively. During brood rearing, families of pink-footed geese escaped at an average distance of 1717 m, compared with distances of 620 and 330 m for brent and barnacle geese, respectively. Even though bird sanctuaries have been established on several islets, with no human access during nesting, many core areas for the three species remain without restrictions, such as islets used by brent geese and slopes and valleys with nesting pink-footed geese, brood-rearing areas and moulting grounds for non-breeding geese. We propose regulations of human access to goose concentration areas, and address the need to better protect these significant areas. We also discuss the need for further research on the vulnerability of geese to human activity.

AB  - Background: A review of the international Montreal Process Criteria and Indicators (MP C&I) sustainable forests reporting framework required member countries to benchmark the Indicators against locally held forest values. Children constitute an important subgroup of the local stakeholders in forests: they may respond to forested environments in different ways and may hold values which are unique to their age group. This study reports on the values school children attributed to their local forests, across three New Zealand regions, and details the agreement of these values to the Montreal Process C&I, a values framework developed by international forestry experts.
   Methods: Workshops were held with local school children at three locations neighbouring a forested area (Tapawera, Nelson, South Island; Hunua and Kaiata, Auckland, North Island; and Lynmore, Rotorua, Bay of Plenty, North Island). Workshops were conducted using a similar facilitated structure, tailored to the age group of the children. The workshops used both interactive drawings and dialogue exercises to elicit the features of importance and cultural values the students held for their local forests. Following the workshops, these values were mapped to seven broad categories, and analysed for agreement with the MP C&I.
   Results: Children aged 9-15 years valued forest access and experiences created by visits to their local forest. The children demonstrated an active relationship with their local forest environment, being aware of its landmarks and facilities. Deeper awareness extended across only quite a small geographical area of their forest. They had personal tacit knowledge of the usefulness of the forested environment, as opposed to abstract, generalised ideas, but only indirect allusion was made to legal, institutional and economic topics. Living organisms were by far the most frequently mentioned forest feature. Landscape amenity, also attachment to and identity with their local forest appear to be important to school children. Although the values held by children living close to forests in New Zealand differed across the three regions, they all fell within the purview of the Montreal Process C&I. Conversely, Criteria 5 (Carbon) and 7 (Legal and institutional) were only tenuously held values.
   Conclusions: School children's views and understanding of forests in New Zealand offer an insight into the integration of local communities with forests and forestry, forestry activities and forest amenities. Taking children's values into consideration has broadened our understanding of the comprehensiveness of the Montreal Process C&I. Results from our workshops provided input for New Zealand's contribution to a revision of the Montreal Process C&I because delegates could cross-reference the proposed alterations to the Indicators against the nationally derived values, which included those of school children.

AB  - 1. In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been unsuccessful in halting biodiversity declines to any great extent. Two shortcomings of AES include the low farm uptake and the modest efficacy of many AES options. Partly in response to these shortcomings, initiatives encouraging farmers to take an active role in biodiversity conservation have gained in popularity. However, almost no evaluations of such initiatives exist.
   2. We evaluated uptake of conservation advice on farms in the Swedish Volunteer & Farmer Alliance, a BirdLife Sweden-coordinated project aimed at farmland bird conservation, and the response of farmland birds to those actions using farm-level survey data, in a before-after implementation assessment.
   3. Uptake was higher for unsubsidised (i.e. non-AES) measures than for AES options, and depended mainly on farmers' interest in nature, with farm size and production type having less importance.
   4. In general, abundances of non-crop nesting and field-nesting bird species declined between inventory years (median interval 3 years). Decreases were more marked in agriculturally marginal regions than in more arable-dominated regions, and declines were stronger on organic than on conventional farms.
   5. Negative abundance trends among non-crop nesting species were reduced by an increasing number of conservation measures at the farm, but only in the more arable-dominated landscapes. Changes in field-nesting species, or at species level, did not significantly relate to implemented measures, but the power to detect such effects was generally small due to the small sample size of high-uptake farms as well as high inter-farm variability.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that volunteer farmer alliances and the addition of unsubsidised measures may be successful in changing the local number of non-crop nesting farmland birds, at the farm level, particularly in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Thus, unsubsidised measures can be a useful addition to the set of agri-environment tools, although their effects on breeding bird numbers are (as with agri-environmental schemes) dependent on landscape context, as well as on ensuring high on-farm uptake of different interventions.

AB  - The results of both onshore and offshore monitoring of the coastal zone in the Russian Baltic reveal the high intensity and recent acceleration of coastal dynamics caused by an increasing frequency of extreme hydrodynamic events and anthropogenic impacts on the diverse geology. Stable coasts dominate in the eastern Gulf of Finland, but the local rate of shoreline recession is up to 2.0 m a(-1), reaching 5 m in one extreme storm event. The coastal zone of the Kaliningrad area is diverse. The western coast of the Sambia Peninsula is controlled by anthropogenic influences linked to the exploitation of geological resources. The beaches advance when the supply of artificial sediments from opencast amber mines increases, whereas the shoreline retreat reaches 10-20 m a(-1) when the input is interrupted. Active landslides and beach degradation dominate along the northern coast of the Sambia Peninsula. Large areas of pre-Quaternary deposits, outcrops and boulders in the nearshore provide evidence of sediment deficiency offshore. The coastal geological hazards are dependent on climate. A comprehensive understanding of the main trends in climate change is important for predicting and mitigating future damage to the coastal infrastructure and for selecting adaptation strategies.

AB  - Long-term changes in the development of service establishments in the vicinity of the border crossing points on the Polish-Czech border are discussed in this paper. These changes are the result of the border being opened and subsequent economic integration. A series of panel studies, which took place in 1995, 2000 and 2016, analysed of the locations and types of service establishments located within a half kilometre of 18 Polish-Czech border crossings. Given the increasing ease of crossing the border and the maintenance of passport and customs controls, the number of service and retail establishments increased until 2000. After the abolition of passport control in 2007, this number has decreased at many border crossings, with the most significant decreases in financial, insurance-related and commercial facilities (small shops). Most crossings have become little more than transport corridors that offer no important service functions. The total number of cultural, recreational and tourismrelated establishments, however, has increased, mainly at border crossings located in towns and villages. The most important changes in service developments at the Polish-Czech border are discussed, as well as the probable reasons for these changes. The results may prove useful for spatial planning in municipalities that are located on the borders of countries undergoing political and economic integration.

AB  - We evaluate changes in proximity (in terms of walkability) to essential services in the city region of Gothenburg, Sweden, 1994-2014, when sustainability policy goals were set to promote urban densification and non-motorized mobility. Simultaneously, public services were deregulated, reducing political capacity to control their accessibility. Considering this tension and welfare regime theory, we investigate to what extent typically regulated and deregulated services (libraries, pharmacies, primary schools, and grocery stores) have come closer to the population in areas of different densities and centralities. We draw on unique micro-level data comprising the detailed locations of population and services analyzed using decomposition. Results indicate that services the most (libraries) and least (grocery stores) controlled by public policy decreased in proximity. In contrast, recently deregulated services (pharmacies and primary schools) became more accessible by foot due to disruptive market change. While population relocation reduced the proportion of people living near the services, the changing geography of amenities was a more important driver of proximity change. We argue that sustainability goals to realize proximity have far-reaching repercussions for urban governance, emphasizing the need to assess proximity changes at detailed scale levels.

AB  - The need for methods for sustainable management and use of coastal ecosystems has increased in the last century. A key aspect for obtaining ecologically and economically sustainable aquaculture in threatened coastal areas is the requirement of geographic information of growth and potential production capacity. Growth varies over time and space and depends on a complex pattern of interactions between the bivalve and a diverse range of environmental factors (e.g. temperature, salinity, food availability). Understanding these processes and modelling the environmental control of bivalve growth has been central in aquaculture. In contrast to the most conventional modelling techniques, quantile regression can handle cases where not all factors are measured and provide the possibility to estimate the effect at different levels of the response distribution and give therefore a more complete picture of the relationship between environmental factors and biological response. Observation of the relationships between environmental factors and growth of the bivalve Mytilus edulis revealed relationships that varied both among level of growth rate and within the range of environmental variables along the Swedish west coast. The strongest patterns were found for water oxygen concentration level which had a negative effect on growth for all oxygen levels and growth levels. However, these patterns coincided with differences in growth among periods and very little of the remaining variability within periods could be explained indicating that interactive processes masked the importance of the individual variables. By using quantile regression and local regression (LOESS) this study was able to provide valuable information on environmental factors influencing the growth of M. edulis and important insight for the development of ecosystem based management tools of aquaculture activities, its use in mitigation efforts and successful management of human use of coastal areas.

AB  - Large herbivores can shape young forest stands and determine the successional trajectory of forested ecosystems by selectively browsing palatable species at the sapling stage. Moose (Alces alces) is the dominant vertebrate herbivore in Fennoscandian boreal forests, and high population densities have raised concerns about potential negative effects on ecosystem functioning and properties including biological diversity and timber production. We used 31 herbivore exclosures in Norway to investigate how forests developed after clear-cutting with or without moose present. We tested how tree demography, abundances of understory plant functional groups, community composition, and plant diversity (including bryophytes) across multiple scales varied with moose exclusion. After seven years, the exclosures were dominated by deciduous trees, including many large rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) individuals, a functionally important keystone species. In contrast, the open plots subject to moose impacts (browsing, trampling, defecation) were dominated by economically important coniferous trees and there was next to no rowan recruitment to taller height classes. The biomass of large herbs and ferns was much greater inside exclosures. This study emphasizes the large immediate effect of moose on early successional boreal forest stands. Landscape-level alterations caused by reduced deciduous dominance, and a reduction in large flowering herbs is likely to lead to cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. The management of boreal production forests needs to account for the combined effects of silvicultural practices and ungulate herbivory to ensure ecosystem functioning, but this management goal may be jeopardized in our study regions due to drastically reduced abundance of keystone species.

AB  - Based on original data derived from 257 expert respondents across Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, we investigate the different expectations and visions associated with one form of low carbon transport, electric mobility, inclusive of vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-grid-integration configurations. Utilizing concepts from the sociology of expectation-notably rhetorical visions, ideographs, promise-requirement cycles, and enablers and selectors-we examine how future electric mobility is envisioned. A collection of eight visions is analyzed and then placed into a typology. Some visions see electric mobility as a harbinger of positive social change in terms of ubiquitous automobility or endless innovation, others warn of families literally stranded and freezing to death on mountains and a business landscape marred with insolvent and financially struggling firms. We conclude with insights about what such competing and contradictory visions mean for energy and climate policy as well as sustainability transitions.

AB  - The city of Stockholm has taken the decision to freeze the exhausts of CO2 at the 1990 level up to the pear 2000 and to restrict the CO2 emissions in the long run to achieve a long-term, sustainable development. Transek Consultants was commissioned to carry out an environmental impact analysis of a broad spectrum of possible actions to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector within the city of Stockholm. With a cost-effectiveness analysis it will be possible to address the question: which measures are the most cost-efficient from the environmental point-of-view, i.e. in this case, which measures yield the highest reductions of the carbon dioxide exhausts per Swedish Krona spent? Many measures, whose costs mainly consist of administrative surveillance costs, yield the highest cost-efficiency - and well below the present target of 0.05 ECU per kg of CO2. Such highly cost-efficient measures are: improved traffic signals (highest cost-efficiency of all studied measures); road pricing schemes (of various types); traffic calming measures; car pooling incentives in terms of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.

AB  - Pollution from small historical mining sites is usually overlooked, in contrast to larger ones. Especially in the Arctic, knowledge gaps remain regarding the long-term mine waste impacts, such as metal leakage, on water quality. We study the small copper (Cu) mines of Nautanen, northern Sweden, which had been in operation for only six years when abandoned approximately 110 years ago in 1908. Measurements from field campaigns in 2017 are compared to synthesized historical measurement data from 1993 to 2014, and our results show that concentrations of Cu, Zn, and Cd on-site as well as downstream from the mining site are order(s) of magnitude higher than the local background values. This is despite the small scale of the Nautanen mining site, the short duration of operation, and the long time since closure. Considering the small amount of waste produced at Nautanen, the metal loads from Nautanen are still surprisingly high compared to the metal loads from larger mines. We argue that disproportionately large amounts of metals may be added to surface water systems from the numerous small abandoned mining sites. Such pollution loads need to be accounted for in sustainable assessments of total pollutant pressures in the relatively vulnerable Arctic environment.

   The distribution range of Lactuca serriola, a species native to the summer-dry mediterranean climate, has expanded northwards during the last 250 years. This paper assesses the influence of climate on the range expansion of this species and highlights the importance of anthropogenic disturbance to its spread.
   Location
   Central and Northern Europe.
   Methods
   Data on the geographic distribution of L. serriola were assembled through a literature search as well as through floristic and herbarium surveys. Maps of the spread of L. serriola in Central and Northern Europe were prepared based on herbarium data. The spread was assessed more precisely in Germany, Austria and Great Britain by pooling herbarium and literature data. We modelled the bioclimatic niche of the species using occurrence and climatic data covering the last century to generate projections of suitable habitats under the climatic conditions of five time periods. We tested whether the observed distribution of L. serriola could be explained for each time period, assuming that the climatic niche of the species was conserved across time.
   Results
   The species has spread northwards since the beginning of the 19th century. We show that climate warming in Europe increased the number of sites suitable for the species at northern latitudes. Until the late 1970s, the distribution of the species corresponded to the climatically suitable sites available. For the last two decades, however, we could not show any significant relationship between the increase in suitable sites and the distributional range change of L. serriola. However, we highlight potential areas the species could spread to in the future (Great Britain, southern Scandinavia and the Swedish coast). It is predominantly non-climatic influences of global change that have contributed to its rapid spread.
   Main conclusions
   The observation that colonizing species are not filling their climatically suitable range might imply that, potentially, other ruderal species could expand far beyond their current range. Our work highlights the importance of historical floristic and herbarium data for understanding the expansion of a species. Such historical distributional data can provide valuable information for those planning the management of contemporary environmental problems, such as species responses to environmental change.

AB  - Research of the occupation in the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea areas has been vivid over the last centuries and it has had different perspectives and thematic ranges. In this paper we present a overview of the history of Stone Age quartz research in Finland and general quartz working techniques and, above all, some results considering analysis of the quartz material from the Early Mesolithic settlement site of Helvetinhaudanpuro in Finland. It is surprising how little in archaeology has been paid attention to the changes in the variations of lithic technologies when groups of people moved from one area to another. If there were not any possibilities to use familiar stone materials as a technological starting point, adaptation to new materials was essential. In the lithic material of Helvetinhaudanpuro we detected characteristics connected to adaptation from flint to the local quartz. The shift in raw materials took place within a few hundred years and appears to coincide with the change in social networks related to the break in connections with previous habitation areas. The quartz techniques seen in Helvetinhaudanpuro are similar to those from other Finnish Mesolithic sites; bipolar technique dominates, but platform percussion has also been in use to some extent. There are some aspects in this material that are unusual, even special, and more compatible to flint than quartz technology: Helvetinhaudanpuro-type points, inserts and possible use of pressure flaking in some cases. These tool shapes and technical achievement indicate a deeper socio-cultural background and are a distinctive link between flint and quartz knapping technology.

AB  - The present work provides insights into the N- and S-pollution behaviour at rural and remote sites in Northern Europe. Formation of SO42- and NO3- from their precursor gases receives special attention in order to understand the significance of chemical conversion in shaping the distributions of concentration and deposition monitored at our sites: Saby-on the Swedish west coast, Lista-on the Norwegian south coast and South Uist-on the Hebride Islands in Northern Scotland. Owing mainly to the complexity of the problem, the approach is semiquantitative. Concentration patterns of S- and N-compounds for air mass transport between the sites were investigated for 10 periods (13 d), within continental (6 d) and oceanic (7 d) air masses. The observations spanned over both winter and summer days and conclusions could be drawn in some cases with respect to seasonality. The measurements were performed during the BMCAPE (Background Maritime Contribution to Atmospheric Pollution in Europe) project in 1993 and 1994. S- and N-ratios were used as indicators of air mass age, chemical conversion efficiency and ''en-route'' deposition. The S-ratio is defined as the ratio of particulate S (as SO42-) to total S (as SO2 and SO42-). The N-ratio is taken as the ratio of gaseous HNO3-N over particulate NO3--N. S-ratios at Saby and Lista agreed very well in those cases when no or insignificant precipitation occurred. Higher S-ratios and lower N-ratios were typical for conditions of high relative humidity. It is conceivable that condensed phase chemistry was of major importance in the SO2 oxidation and that HNO3 was absorbed onto the wet aerosol particles. Stagnation of the air masses over source regions of high emission densities and rates resulted in accumulation of pollution, the S-ratios in such conditions being high due to the longer transport time. The S-ratios for marine air flow at Saby and Lista no longer agreed (higher at Lista) as in the case of continental air masses. The reason is likely to be the proximity of the Lista station to the sea. Lista was highly affected by sea spray produced by the strong westerly winds. The N-ratio remained very low in the case of maritime air masses due to unexpectedly high NO3- concentrations. It is conceivable that the high load of NO3- is due to sea spray of surface water. More efficient SO2 deposition over land than over sea has been observed in the westerly airflow by the relative loss of SO2 while the Bow swept over land. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Organic farming is recognised as a potential approach to achieve a more sustainable food system and promote rural development. Thus, many countries have set targets to increase the share of organic cultivated land. In Finland, the target was to increase the share of organic farming to 20% of the total area under cultivation by 2020. Although the share of organic agricultural land has gradually increased, there are still significant regional differences. The aim of our study is to identify the factors that affect these differences. Previous research has generally excluded factors such as subsidies from the analysis; therefore, this study explores the relevance of subsidies, as well as other key factors, within the context of the uneven regional distribution of organic farming in Finland. The data sources include research from the literature, official statistics, and a large survey of organic farmers. Using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), we identify three different pathways that have led to higher organic shares of agricultural land in certain Finnish regions. The three regions with the highest organic shares utilise the first pathway, which includes a long organic heritage, a focus on dairy farming, and an important reliance on subsidies. We conclude that the regional variation in organic farming in Finland is due to a combination of different factors, rather than any single factor. Moreover, subsidies are a key factor that should be considered when reviewing the reasons for regional variations in organic farming.

AB  - Artificial food supplementation of wildlife is an increasing practice for species conservation, as well as for hunting and viewing tourism. Yet, our understanding of the implications of wildlife supplementary feeding is still very limited. Concerns have been raised over the potential negative impact of artificial feeding, but the effects of this practice on animal movements and rhythms of activity are just beginning to be investigated. Here, with the aim of studying whether the artificial feeding of brown bears may affect their behaviour, we analysed (1) the probability and intensity of feeding site use at different temporal scales, (2) how the use of artificial feeding sites is related to the bear's age and sex, main periods of the bear's annual cycle (i.e. mating and hyperphagia) and characteristics of the feeding sites, and (3) how the use of artificial feeding may be affecting bear movement patterns. We analysed the movements of 71 radio-collared brown bears in southern-central Finland and western Russian Karelia. Artificial feeding sites had several effects on brown bears in boreal habitats. The probability of a feeding site being used was positively correlated to the stability of this food resource over time, whereas sexes and bear classes (subadults, adults and females with cubs) did not show significant differences in the use of feeding sites, which were visited predominantly at night and slightly more during hyperphagia. The probability of using an artificial feeding site affected the daily net distance only (bears using feeding sites: 3.5 +/- 4.5 km, range: 0-29 km; bears not using feeding sites: 4.4 +/- 4.9 km, range: 0-47 km). Those brown bears using artificial feeding more intensively moved shorter distances at a lower speed within smaller home ranges compared to bears that used this food sources less. Highly predictable and continuously available anthropogenic food may therefore have substantial impacts on brown bear movement patterns, ecology and health. The recorded changes in movement patterns support the evidence that artificial feeding may have important implications for bear ecology and conservation.

AB  - Infraspecific genetic diversity is generally underestimated in biodiversity assessments. We use haplotype patterns based on the nuclear gpd and plastid rpl16 to examine whether genetic diversity is related to geography, gender, habitat and/or frequency of sexual reproduction in Drepanocladus lycopodioides. This moss is restricted to western Eurasian semi-natural and natural habitats and decreases in frequency in many parts of Europe. Haplotype diversity differs among three regional populations (oland, Gotland, Stockholm archipelago) in its South Swedish Baltic core distribution area and is positively affected by patch size. The regional populations differ from each other genetically and haplotype variation is unequally partitioned between the genders, most likely a result of immigration history and limited equalizing effects of sexual reproduction. In a Holocene context, the regional populations of oland and Gotland display evidence of a decrease or bottleneck, and immigration into both regions. We suggest that higher haplotype diversity in Gotland and oland and lack of migration to the Stockholm archipelago may be an effect of longer colonization history of the former, and niche pre-emption in the natural habitats of the latter. The Baltic population is representative for the genetically relatively homogeneous European population, and D. lycopodioides displays low ITS variation compared with other European mosses. In a conservation context it is relevant that the three regional populations are not interchangeable. It is of concern that three populations within the species' core distribution are vulnerable. Our results strongly suggest that infraspecific genetic diversity must be considered in the management of the species at the continental level.

AB  - Different community groups and members hold varying power positions in tourism development discussions and decision-making. From the sustainable development perspective, tourism planning and management should involve a diversity of voices, including also those with limited political or economic power. This article focuses on relatively little studied young people's views on tourism development. The article uses the concept of social innovation for analysing local youths' needs and propositions for transforming tourism towards sustainability. Empirical data is derived from ethnographic research and a design anthropology-oriented workshop for young adults in Kemi, northern Finland. At the workshop, social innovations were used to imagine alternative futures for local life and the role of tourism in development. The participants co-created three social innovation propositions for enhancing the flow of information regarding tourism, developing activities, liveliness and spaces to hang out, and attracting passing-by visitors. These propositions reflect sustainability transformations that recognise young adults' inclusion in tourism planning, create more inclusive services for locals, and enhance diverse, locally grounded, and socially valuable tourism. Even though the propositions are dependent on existing power structures, they challenge the status quo of tourism planning and development.

AB  - The making of high-stumps in today's forestry is becoming more and more common and several studies of these have shown their high conservation value for many wood living species, especially saproxylic beetles. However, the amounts of dead wood and bark surface on high-stumps are small compared to the amount on the ordinary cut stumps and further there have been no studies on the fauna of ordinary cut stumps.
   By sieving bark from ordinary (low) stumps and high-stumps (at ground level and at breast height) of Norway spruce we investigated whether there were differences in the saproxylic beetle community between low-stumps, high-stumps at ground level and high-stumps at breast height. We also tested whether beetle species showed preferences for any of the three substrate types.
   A total of 10,984 saproxylic beetle individuals divided into 67 species, were collected from 128 low- and high-stumps on 16 clear-cuts in southern Sweden. The number of species found in high-stumps at ground level (53) was significantly higher than the numbers found in high-stumps at breast height (38) and low-stumps (39). Many of the caught species showed substrate preferences and an ordination showed that there are different beetle communities at the tree different substrate types. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Whereas compact cities have long been suggested to be the most sustainable solution for urban development, the health impacts of living in dense urban environments are contested. We present results from a mixed-methods study on the associations between built environment (residential location, neighbourhood density and distance from green space), and general health, back pain, headache, and depressive symptoms in Oslo metropolitan area, Norway. The study indicates that the built environment has some associations with health. However, it does not support claims from an earlier study of aggregate-scale comparisons of geographical districts about the overall negative health impacts of living in the central parts of Oslo. Overall, living close to the main city centre, appears to contribute to better self-reported general health, whereas high local-area density showed a slight opposite association. Otherwise, there were in general few associations between spatial characteristics of the neighbourhood and different health complaints. Based on this and earlier findings, we suggest that the built environment influences residents' health via different mechanisms that are partly counteracting each other. Whereas inner-city dwellers are more exposed to air pollution and noise, they travel more by physically active modes, avoid time-consuming and dissatisfactory commutes, and might benefit from more social arenas.

AB  - On the rocky peaks of the hilly area in north-western outskirts Stockholm, more than forty architects gave their contribution to approximately 2,500 dwelling units comprising the neighbourhood so-called Rodabergsomradet, which corresponds to one of the longest-pondered and biggest housing plans of the 1910s and 1920s, although its knowledge is still limited outside Nordic countries. The shape of the district stems from progressive refinements and conflations: from the first proposal (1906-1909) by the Swedish urban planner Per Olof Hallman, via crucial improvements by the architect Sigurd Lewerentz (1921) down to integrations (1922 and 1928) by the team of the Stockholm City Building Board.
   This contribution sheds new light on urban design history and development of the residential estate via key findings: on the one hand, some drawings and texts from Hallman's collection (Stockholm Stadsarkiv) as well as drawings and photos of the H.S.B. housing cooperative archive (Centrum for Naringslivshistoria), and, on the other hand, the never-discovered four drawings plates of Lewerentz (ArkDes, Stockholm) that for the first time demonstrate how his design inputs affected significantly the district layout. Organic and structured in form, Rodabergsomradet belongs as much to the collective memory and cultural heritage of Stockholm as to the cityscape.

AB  - Recent research has pointed to the need for addressing gender equality in parliaments in a broader perspective, focusing on "gender sensitivity" in parliaments in relation to structures, operations, methods and work. Up to now, however, the question of what it takes for this work to be long-lasting and sustainable has received limited attention. This article seeks to address this gap through a case study assessing the sustainability of the internal work of the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) with regard to gender equality, focusing on the durability and renewal of early initiatives and reforms. On the basis of Riksdag documents and interviews with MPs during the period 1994-2022, we ask: How sustainable is the internal gender equality work of the Riksdag with respect to the three key areas of representation, infrastructure and culture? We find that the Riksdag has managed to conduct sustainable gender equality work over the course of three decades. Major factors in this success are the institutionalization of a Gender Equality Group, the adoption of Action Plans for Gender Equality every parliamentary term and the legitimacy provided by the support of the Speaker of the Riksdag and the Riksdag Board.

AB  - We surveyed the vegetation and bird faunas of forests an 65 islands in the Gwaii Haanas archipelago of British Columbia, Canada, ranging in size from 1 to > 100 000 ha, using point counts at a uniform distance from the shore. Variation in habitat structure was correlated with variation in island area and isolation. Only among the smaller islands did the number of bird species recorded decrease with area. As some species became rarer with deer-easing island size, others became more common. The distribution of bird species among the islands was correlated with the distribution of habitat features that were consistent with the biology and ecology of each species. In only a minority of species was their distribution related to area and isolation per se rather than to habitat features correlated with island size and isolation. Hence, we considered that Variation in habitat structure mediated by area and isolation was the key factor involved in determining the local composition of the bird community. Only for a few species restricted to the largest islands, or missing from the very small islands, were high rates of extinction related to small population size the most parsimonious hypothesis explaining species distribution patterns. Our results emphasise how considering only the relationship between numbers of species and island area can mask all but the roughest species distribution patterns and prevent a deeper understanding of the biology of islands.

AB  - Hunting, an activity conceptualized as part of wildlife management partnership between the state, landowners and hunting communities, is increasingly challenged by a decreasing hunter base. This has ecological, economic and socio-cultural consequences, and the issue of hunter recruitment deserves more scholarly and political attention. In Sweden, the number of individuals taking a hunting proficiency test is high even though the number of hunters has declined during the last few decades although with a recovery the last 12 months, indicating an under-utilized source of potential new hunters. We explore in an interview study with potential new hunters in Sweden what factors affect and motivate individuals to take the hunter proficiency test and to hunt. Our thematic analysis identifies structural, institutional and individual factors influencing hunting participation, such as social networks and access to land, rendering two ideal types of new hunters. We offer suggestions to help curb the negative trend of declining hunter numbers and we identify research gaps for future studies to address.

AB  - The cloud motif, a significant one in the landscape painting of the 1890s and early 1900s, has been usually marginalized by scholars despite the fact that during this (Symbolist) period clouds became independent subjects of landscape painting in many European countries, especially in the Baltic Sea Region. Cloud imagery makes a robust appearance in Scandinavian, Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, and Latvian art during the decades around 1900. The variety of symbolic meanings and possible interpretations of cloudscapes was impacted by cultural and literary associations that emerged with European Symbolism. There is a surprising resemblance of cloudscapes executed within the Baltic Sea Region, an examination of which reveals the complexity of artistic influence and the presence and wandering of motifs among artists.

AB  - The 14th International Congress on Combustion By-Products and Their Health Effects was held in UmeAyen, Sweden from June 14th to 17th, 2015. The Congress, mainly sponsored by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Superfund Research Program and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning, focused on the "Origin, fate and health effects of combustion-related air pollutants in the coming era of bio-based energy sources". The international delegates included academic and government researchers, engineers, scientists, policymakers and representatives of industrial partners. The Congress provided a unique forum for the discussion of scientific advances in this research area since it addressed in combination the health-related issues and the environmental implications of combustion by-products. The scientific outcomes of the Congress included the consensus opinions that: (a) there is a correlation between human exposure to particulate matter and increased cardiac and respiratory morbidity and mortality; (b) because currently available data does not support the assessment of differences in health outcomes between biomass smoke and other particulates in outdoor air, the potential human health and environmental impacts of emerging air-pollution sources must be addressed. Assessment will require the development of new approaches to characterize combustion emissions through advanced sampling and analytical methods. The Congress also concluded the need for better and more sustainable e-waste management and improved policies, usage and disposal methods for materials containing flame retardants.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to discuss the opportunities for and challenges faced in the development of a wine sector in a nascent wine country, as well as the necessary requirements for the creation of sustainable competitive advantages (SCA), using Sweden as an example. Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of previous research based on secondary data; a SWOT analysis of the wine sector in the nascent wine country, Sweden, is provided in connection with a conceptual framework for SCAs. Findings In a nascent wine country such as Sweden, factors such as climate or technical issues regarding wine production are important factors in respect of SCA, but in themselves, do not present insurmountable obstacles to their creation. In reality, structural challenges such as the alcohol monopoly in the retail market, various other legal regulations and restrictions, the lack of marketing and promotion capabilities, limited viticulture knowledge and limited experience of cooperation with the local enterprise are all far more problematic in that they lead to relatively limited demand for Swedish wine. In this context, a marketing management approach becomes a key factor in changing attitudes and approaches. Clearly, it is important to provide potential markets and consumers with relevant marketing information about the nascent wine country and its products. Originality/value Previous research generally focused on the SCA in the established wine countries; the focus of this study is on the SCA in a nascent wine country, a country without any tradition of commercial wine production. This study contributes to the discussion of a new conceptual framework for understanding SCA in the context of nascent wine countries. Furthermore, it suggests that the remaining state alcohol retail monopoly in Sweden provides not only challenges but also opportunities for the development of the wine sector. These findings are valid not only for Sweden but also for other nascent wine countries.

AB  - Among the Maya, the cultural history of steambathing spans more than two millennia. Although it has largely disappeared from the lowlands, household-level steambathing persists in several highland Maya communities in Chiapas, Mexico. In this article, I present an overview of therapeutic steambathing among the Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya. Through an extended discussion of the beliefs and practices surrounding steambathing, I develop several features of highland Maya thinking about physical health and "well-being". In particular, I examine a set of ethnophysiological representations relating to the "thermal" nature of functional bodies, and the relationship of these models to the maintenance and restoration of health. The highland Maya have articulated an elaborate understanding of physical health and well-being coded in an idiom of "vital warmth", and directed toward the preservation and augmentation of the endogenous heat necessary for vitality and vigor. These models simultaneously reflect empirical understandings of bodily states in health and illness, as well as metaphorical assumptions about the thermal nature of functional psychosocial identities. Steambathing draws on and reinforces these models, constituting a core cultural technology for radically altering the thermal state of the patient, an experience which the highland Maya regard as deeply beneficial. The paper closes with a discussion of recent biomedical research into the physiological effects of hyperthermal therapies. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of an alkaline additive on the storage of wood chips from Norway spruce forest residues. Piles of untreated and calcium hydroxide treated wood chips (250 m3) were set up and investigated for four months. It was demonstrated that adding Ca(OH)2 to moist wood chips decreased the dry matter loss by 6%. This was attributed to the increase of the pH to a level of 8, rendering the habitat less suitable for fungal colonisation. The results suggest the set-up storage strategy as a potential alternative method for preserving wood chips when long term storage is required.

AB  - Bio-monitoring of air quality in TehranCity was investigated by analyzing 36 pine tree (Pinus eldarica Medw.) barks. The samples were taken from different locations with different degrees of metal pollution (urban, industrial, highway, and control sites). Then, the concentrations of lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) were measured using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The results of this study showed that the highest and lowest metal concentrations were found in the heavy traffic sites and the control site, respectively. Lead content was found to be the highest in high traffic density areas. The industrial part of the city was characterized by high Zn, Cr, and Ni contents. Variation in heavy metal concentrations between sites was observed and attributed to differences in traffic density and anthropogenic activities. The research also confirms the suitability of Pinus eldarica Medw barks as a suitable bio-indicator of aerial fallout of heavy metals.

AB  - The 2030 Agenda and its integrative and indivisible sustainable development goals (SDGs) challenge traditional ways of governing. Hence, collaboration across sectors, actors, and levels is fundamental in SDG localisation, where subnational levels (actors at regional and local levels) play key roles in forwarding societal transformation. The paper sheds light on the complexity of collaboration by exploring the early stages of developing multi-actor collaboration for SDG implementation at a county level in Sweden. The analyses depart from interviews and observations. One of the main conclusions is that it is important to discuss the involved organisations' understanding and ambitions more in-depth early on in such collaboration processes. To be able to do so, the actors need to have the capacity to see beyond their traditional roles. Moreover, the study indicates that leadership is essential in this context, but this leadership needs to be based on neutrality, which, in practise, is a challenge.

AB  - Pancreas disease (PD) is a viral disease of economic importance affecting farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar L.) and rainbow trout (Oncorhyncus mykiss (Walbaum)) in the seawater phase in Ireland, Norway and Scotland. In this study we used a stochastic network-based disease spread model to better understand the role of vessel movements and nearby seaway distance on PD spread in marine farms. We used five different edge's definitions and weights for the network construction: high-risk vessel movements, high-risk wellboat movements and high-risk nearby seaway distance at < 20 km, < 10 km or < 5 km, respectively. Models were used to simulate PD spread in marine farms as well as to simulate the spread of marine SAV2 and SAV3 subtypes independently and results were compared with the observed PD, marine SAV2 and SAV3 cases in Norway in 2016. Results revealed that the model that provided the best fit of the observed data and, therefore, the one considered more biologically plausible, was the one using high-risk wellboat movements. The marine SAV2, SAV3 and PD models using wellboat movements were able to correctly simulate the farms status (PD positive or PD negative) with the sensitivity of 84%, 85%, 84% and Specificity of 98%, 97% and 94%, respectively. These results should contribute to inform more cost-effective prevention and control policies to mitigate PD spread and to improve the sustainability and long-term profitability of the salmon industry in Norway.

AB  - The city of Oslo is situated centrally in the Oslo-graben, which is a Permian rift basin consisting of different kinds of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. In the summer of 1998, approximately 300 samples of surface soil (2-3 cm) were taken systematically, 1 km(-2). The investigated area covers about 500 km(2). Samples were dissolved in 7 M HNO3 and analysed for 29 elements with ICP-AES, mercury with cold-vapour technique (CV-AAS) and arsenic and cadmium with a graphite furnace (GF-AAS). A factor analysis is frequently used to identify relationships among sets of interrelated variables. To describe the covariant relationships among the elements, a factor analysis has been completed. The first factor contains the elements Sc, Fe, Li, Co, Al, Cr, Be, K, Ni, V, Mg, Y, Ba, Zr, Mn and As (listed with decreasing communality). These elements are typical for the minerals in the area and most of these elements have a near normal distribution. Sources for this factor are probably geological. The second factor contains Cd, Hg, P, Zn, Cu, Ba and Pb. They have a log-normal distribution. Road traffic is probably one of the sources contributing to this factor. In Norway studded tyres are used frequently in the winter season which results in large amounts of road dust. Leaded petrol has been a major source for Pb but is not in use any more. Wear and tear of tyres and brakes contribute also to this factor. Other sources contributing to this factor are probably industry, rubbish incineration, crematoria and release of some of these elements from structural material by fire. Factors 3, 4 and 6 with elements such as Ca, Na, La, Ti and Sr probably have geological sources. They are associated with minerals like amphiboles, pyroxenes and feldspars and some of the elements are from sea aerosols. Factor 5 contains Mn, Cd, Zn, As and Pb. Manganese may be derived from many different sources such as rock weathering, windblown dust, agriculture and traffic. Since As and Mn are placed in both factor 1 and 5 they probably have both geological and anthropogenic sources. Concentrations of the elements in the second factor are much higher in the central parts of Oslo, than in the rest of Oslo. The median value of Hg in the centre is 0.48 mg kg(-1), which is 8 times higher than that in the rest of the city. Also, the other elements have much higher levels in the centre. The industrial district north-east of the centre also has high values. The distribution of arsenic is regular throughout the whole city, but has a slightly higher level in the centre. Norm values for contaminated land used by the Norwegian authorities are 2 mg As kg(-1) and 25 mg Cr kg(-1). Of 297 samples, 61% contain more than 25 mg Cr kg(-1) and 79% more than 3 mg As kg(-1), which is the detection limit of the analysis. These samples will therefore be regarded as contaminated. Factor analysis places these elements in the geological factor. The Norm value of zinc is 150 mg kg(-1), and 40% of the samples contain more than this. The Norm value of lead is 150 mg kg(-1), and 35% of the samples contain. Road traffic is probably the major source for these elements.

AB  - During the autumn of 2015, Europe experienced a sharp increase in refugee influx, and many refugees arrived in the European oresund Region. Refugees travelled through Denmark and over the oresund Bridge, arriving in the third largest city in Sweden, Malmo. Private, public and voluntary organizations in Malmo had to change the way they worked to meet the new entry demands. Flexible adaptations to changing circumstances can be described as resilient performance and are supported or hindered by societal and organizational drivers and barriers. Qualitative interview data from Swedish organizations managing the refugee reception in Malmo were analyzed through the theoretical lens of Resilience Engineering (RE). The analysis results showed that necessary adaptations were not supported by the managerial design of the responsible public organizations. The analysis also showed that preconditions created from societal steering hinders value responsiveness at the public management level, i.e., the public management level has barriers towards becoming familiar with the organization's value structures. Familiarity with the system value and goal structure is essential for an efficient prioritizing of conflicting goals, which is why it is suggested that this aspect be explicitly included in RE principles.

AB  - The demographic value of existing habitat can be affected by changes in predator populations. In Finland, wader populations increased when the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) declined, due to poisoning by agricultural chemicals during the 1960-1970. Following regulation of DDT usage, nesting Peregrine numbers have increased more than tenfold, while wader populations concurrently declined. The "protection" hypothesis states that although top predators may negatively affect populations of primary prey species, they may benefit other species populations by suppressing activities of mesopredators, such as egg and chick predation. We studied diet preferences of Peregrine Falcons in south-west Finnish Lapland during a period of falcon population growth, based on indices of species consumption versus availability. Preferred and optimal sized prey species, excluding ducks, were equally abundant on bogs with and without Peregrines, and neither did the abundance of non-preferred or non-optimal sized birds differ between bogs with and without Peregrines. Thus, the protection hypothesis was supported for ducks. We found that preferred prey species significantly declined in numbers over time, while populations of non-preferred and non-optimal sized prey species declined less or remained stable, as expected if Peregrines would have direct negative effects on prey species. However, local effects were apparent when comparing local versus national trends of suitable and less suitable sized prey for the Peregrines. While the raptors' role in the population declines of wetland species must have increased after their recovery in the 1970s, this effect might be difficult to separate from other concurrent effects of habitat loss.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to help bridge the gap between developers and residents by creating a design criteria checklist for outdoor residential areas and to validate the checklist by means of a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) carried out by the residents in six housing areas. Items addressed in the checklist covered general layout, complexity and coherence, identity and affection, construction materials, greenery, climate, pollution and noise, ecological sustainability, meeting areas, privacy, security and traffic control, and maintenance. The reliability of the expert form amounted to r =. 71 and each expert showed significant positive correlations with the other experts. The agreement between experts was consistently higher for some areas than for others. Based on 406 individuals, a factor analysis was carried out for the POE data, which rendered the following factors: Attachment, Outdoor Enjoyment, Aesthetics, Sustainability, and Social Interaction. The assessments by experts and residents were compared in terms governed by the structure of the factor analysis. The validation showed that POE Attachment was predicted by the total score of the expert form and that specific clusters of expert items predicted Outdoor Enjoyment and Aesthetics. It was not possible by means of the expert form to predict Sustainability and Social Interaction. We suggest that this tool will be useful for design education, for designing new residential areas, and for the assessment of existing residential areas.

AB  - Among plant species introduced to Norway, several are naturalising and spreading in the landscape in an aggressive way. There is an ongoing debate between professionals in nature management and cultural heritage. Policy-makers have selected the year 1800 as a time delimitation: the use of plant species introduced later is to be regulated or even forbidden. Looking back in history, the perception of the introduction of plants between 1750 and 1900 differs from present attitudes. Introduced plants were once regarded as positive contributions that could be used to demonstrate botanic skills and wealth, as well as garden owners' skills in cultivating them. At present, many of the plant species that were once desirable are now regarded as threatening aliens'. This article examines changed attitudes towards introduced plants, with an emphasis on the period 1750-1900, when the majority of new plants arrived.

AB  - The REVEALS model is a tool for recalculating pollen data into vegetation abundances on a regional scale. We explored the general effect of selected parameters by performing simulations and ascertained the best model setting for the Czech Republic using the shallowest samples from 120 fossil sites and data on actual regional vegetation (60 km radius). Vegetation proportions of 17 taxa were obtained by combining the CORINE Land Cover map with forest inventories, agricultural statistics and habitat mapping data. Our simulation shows that changing the site radius for all taxa substantially affects REVEALS estimates of taxa with heavy or light pollen grains. Decreasing the site radius has a similar effect as increasing the wind speed parameter. However, adjusting the site radius to 1 m for local taxa only (even taxa with light pollen) yields lower, more correct estimates despite their high pollen signal. Increasing the background radius does not affect the estimates significantly. Our comparison of estimates with actual vegetation in seven regions shows that the most accurate relative pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) come from Central Europe and Southern Sweden. The initial simulation and pollen data yielded unrealistic estimates for Abies under the default setting of the wind speed parameter (3 m/s). We therefore propose the setting of 4 m/s, which corresponds to the spring average in most regions of the Czech Republic studied. Ad hoc adjustment of PPEs with this setting improves the match 3-4-fold. We consider these values (apart from four exceptions) to be appropriate, because they are within the ranges of standard errors, so they are related to original PPEs. Setting a 1 m radius for local taxa (Alnus, Salix, Poaceae) significantly improves the match between estimates and actual vegetation. However, further adjustments to PPEs exceed the ranges of original values, so their relevance is uncertain.

AB  - Worldwide, the increasing challenges due to stormwater run-off in urban areas are well known. Authorities need to be prepared for emergency situations and have plans for preventive measures to avoid flooded properties and public grounds. Several studies highlight that homeowner's knowledge and awareness of their own flood risk, will lead to better protection and less damage. What is probably less focused is that preventive-measures within your own property will also help to reduce the flood risk for your neighbours settled at a lower site. Stormwater fee derived from the area model can be seen both as an instrument to motivate property owners to manage rainwater in a more sustainable way, and a way of financing public infrastructure related to stormwater. Many cities and states worldwide have already introduced area models as a basis for calculating stormwater fee at property level. There are many models which range from very simple and rough calculations to more complex and detailed. In some countries, e.g., USA, differentiated stormwater fees have been used for decades, while for example in Norway this is still a controversial topic. In this study, we will conduct a literature review of area models, which aim to describe what a single property should pay in stormwater fee. Which model is best, depends entirely on the goals you want to achieve. Based on the literature review, our understanding is that more attention will be paid on area models if there is a clear connection between instrument and goal. In this article we aim to categorize and group the different models and describe for which goals they are best suited.

AB  - Offshore petroleum activities are the focus of highly politicised debates globally. Typically, public debate is sparked by catastrophic events, such as the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and decision-making processes fuelled by the assessment of 'worst-case scenarios'. However, everyday 'routine' petroleum operations also impact the marine ecosystems and adjoining socio-economic sectors, but the extent and severity of the impacts are uncertain. This paper takes as its point of departure routine operations and their surrounding uncertainties. Particularly, it focuses on the debates of whether to extend routine petroleum operations in vulnerable and valuable parts of Norway, such as the Lofoten area and the Sula Ridge. These conflicts draw on important and for some, epistemological uncertainties that surround the impacts of routine operations. The paper argues that it is necessary to first highlight these uncertainties, rather than marginalise them, and second, recognise that uncertainties are not simply a scientific challenge, but can be a powerful political tool. This paper unpacks and explores uncertainties associated with three phases of routine operations, that are used to steer political actions: (i) the impacts of seismic surveys on fish and marine mammals; (ii) the impacts of drilling mud and drill cuttings on benthic communities such as deep-sea coral reefs; and (iii) the impacts of produced water on the marine environment. The paper discusses the importance of transparency in addressing these uncertainties, and emphasises the need to implement the precautionary principle in a more participatory way. It thus proposes participatory exercises in order to allow the recognition of the epistemological nature of uncertainties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Nordic states and the Arctic have recently received increasing attention as a consequence of the rush to excavate newly discovered mineral resources in the Global North. Local land struggles related to the expansion of the extractive industry need to be assessed and constitute the focus of the present article. I examine the deeper levels of conflict between the mineral resource rush and local people. I highlight local people's plural ways of being in relation to the land through an ethnographic exploration of a pivotal mining project in Arctic Finland being resisted by Finns, who live in a pro-mining municipality. These people experience a threat to the continuation of their lifeworlds when large-scale extraction enters their territories. However, achieving legitimacy for their lifeworlds has been difficult. The article suggests that a key reason for this lack of legitimacy is the dominant 'one' world ontology and its 'nature' knowledge practices.

AB  - This article focuses on how the Finnmark Race in Norway, identified by a key moment and four other post moments, shaped by their occurrence, creating new pathways for sport, place and tourism development. The dogsledding race has influenced tourism development and has helped create new tourist products its rural locale. This research uses data from qualitative interviews with 19 informants, connected to the race through different roles-business people involved in tourism, volunteers, former race managers, journalists and mushers (dogsled drivers). The event start-up has contributed to a new 'path-creation', active development of Finnmark as a winter tourism destination, and dogsledding as a new tourism product of the place. A process of path-creation, involving volunteers and lifestyle entrepreneurs, built up a meeting place for the event and for other stakeholders, enabling the sustainable development of attractive, locally-run tourism products.

AB  - We address the general problem of selection bias, an issue endemic to policy analysis when adoption is voluntary, with an empirical application to environmental policies for agriculture. Many voluntary practices for mitigating the environmental impacts of agriculture provide external benefits while lowering productivity. Policy analysis of the productivity consequences is complicated by the fact that decision makers can choose their own policy levers, an action that ruins any notion of random assignment. We introduce an identification strategy to correct this kind of endogeneity, combining classic methods from stochastic frontier analysis and selection models. Applying it to micro-level data from Finnish grain farms, we find that more efficient producers are more likely to enroll in subsidized practices. And, because those practices tend to reduce yield, frontier analysis without the endogeneity correction greatly understates the productivity loss. In other words, naively basing the frontier estimator on the subset of less-productive farms leads to downward bias in the frontier estimates. In fact, average inefficiency more than doubles after the correction in this case. An outlier investigation suggests that the lowest decile of farms are responsible for most of the selection bias in the uncorrected model.

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) progression depends on androgen receptor activity. Cholesterol is required for biosynthesis of all steroid hormones, including androgens. Impact of cholesterol-lowering statins on androgens is unknown. We explored atorvastatin influence on serum and prostatic tissue steroidomic profiles (SP) to expose novel pathways for limiting androgen concentration in men with PCa.
   Methods: This is a pre-planned post hoc analysis of ESTO-1 pilot randomised, double-blinded, clinical trial. Statin naive men, scheduled for radical prostatectomy due to localised PCa, were randomised 1:1 to use daily 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo before the surgery for a median of 28 days. Participants were recruited and treated at the Pirkanmaa Hospital District, Tampere, Finland. 108 of the 158 recruited men were included in the analysis based on sample availability for hormone profiling. Serum and prostatic tissue steroid profiles were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Wilcoxon rank sum test and bootstrap confidence intervals (CI) were used to analyse the difference between placebo and atorvastatin arms.
   Findings: Most serum and prostatic steroids, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, were not associated with atorvastatin use. However, atorvastatin use induced serum SP changes in 11-ketoandrostenedione (placebo 960pM, atorvastatin 617.5pM, p-value <0.0001, median difference-342.5; 95% CI-505.23 -188.98).In the prostatic tissue, atorvastatin was associated with plausible downshift in 11-ketodihydrotestosterone (placebo 25.0pM in 100 mg tissue/1 mL saline, atorvastatin 18.5pM in 100 mg tissue/1 mL saline, p-value 0.027, median difference-6.53; 95% CI-12.8 -0.29); however, this association diminished after adjusting for multiple testing. No serious harms were reported.
   Interpretation: Atorvastatin was associated with adrenal androgen downshift in the serum and possibly in the prostate. The finding warrants further investigation whether atorvastatin could improve androgen deprivation therapy efficacy.

AB  - Palaeoecological analysis of peat deposits from a small bog at Lingarden, southern Sweden, have been used to examine the nature and timing of vegetation changes and anthropogenic activity associated with a nearby rock carving located close to the edge of the wetland. This study is the first of its type to investigate the environmental context of rock carvings in southern Sweden. Debate has tended to focus on chronology and iconography, with little consideration of the environmental relationships of rock carvings and how vegetation may help construct a site within its surrounding landscape. The pollen evidence from Lingarden demonstrates that the rock carving was located in an isolated semi-wooded setting during the late Bronze Age. This is in stark contrast to several other pollen studies from the Bjare Peninsula that record widespread woodland clearance and agricultural activity from the late Neolithic Bronze Age transition. The results of this study support hypotheses that suggest complex rock carvings, such as Lingarden, were separated from settled areas. This sense of separation and isolation is reinforced by the vegetation surrounding the rock carving. This paper also discusses the relationship between charcoal in the pollen sequence and evidence that the decorated outcrop had been burnt. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low levels of oil and hence polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are naturally present in the marine environment, although levels have increased significantly following human extraction and use of oil and gas. Other major anthropogenic sources of PAHs include smelters, the use of fossil fuels in general, and various methods of waste disposal, especially incineration. There are two major sources for PAHs to marine ecosystems in Norway: the inshore smelter industry, and offshore oil and gas production activities. A distinction is generally made between petrogenic (oil-derived) and pyrogenic (combustion-derived) PAHs. Although petrogenic PAHs appear to be bioavailable to a large extent, pyrogenic PAHs are often associated with soot particles and less available for uptake into organisms. There is extensive evidence linking sediment-associated PAHs to induction of phase-I enzymes, development of DNA adducts, and eventually neoplastic lesions in fish. Most studies have focused on high-molecular-weight, carcinogenic PAHs such as benzo[ a] pyrene. It is less clear how two- and three-ring PAHs affect fish, and there is even experimental evidence to indicate that these chemicals may inhibit some components of the phase I system rather than produce induction. There is a need for increased research efforts to clarify biological effects of two- and three-ring PAHs, PAH mixtures, and adaptation processes in marine ecosystems.

AB  - Urban herring gulls (Larus argentatus) are exposed to contaminants from aquatic, terrestrial and anthropogenic sources. We aim to assess if differences in urbanisation affect ecological niche and contaminant concentrations in female herring gulls. Furthermore, we investigated maternal transfer from mothers to eggs for all the target compounds, including chlorinated paraffins (CPs) and cyclic volatile methyl siloxane (cVMSs), which to our knowledge have not been assessed in herring gulls previously. We compare concentrations of legacy and emerging contaminants and metals in blood and eggs between two herring gull colonies located 51 km apart, in the urban influenced Norwegian Oslofjord. While both colonies are within an urbanised area, the inner fjord is more so, as it is surrounded by Oslo, the capital and largest city in Norway Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen indicated a more marine ecological niche in the outer than the inner fjord colony, although with overlap. Persistent organic pollutant (POP) concentrations were similar in the inner and outer fjord colonies, while the short-chained chlorinated paraffins (SCCP), which are recently added to the Stockholm convention and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) varied, with higher concentrations of SCCP and the cVMS decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) in females and eggs of the inner fjord colony. Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) concentrations were higher in the outer fjord colony, likely linked to releases from a point-source (airport and waste management facility with open access to food waste). In blood, chlorinated paraffins contributed most the total lipophilic contaminants (inner: 78%, outer: 56%), while polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were the most abundant lipophilic contaminants in eggs (inner: 62%, outer: 46%). Dechloranes and brominated flame retardants (BFRs) were detected in few samples. Maternal transfer, assessed by egg to blood ratios, of cVMSs were similar to the POPs with mean log ratio 0.39 (D5), while it was lower for SCCPs, with log ratios-0.77. Our results indicate comparable POP exposure of the herring gulls in the inner and outer Oslofjord, likely due to overlap in ecological niches between the colonies and wide distribution of POPs. The differences between the colonies in concentrations of PFAS, cVMS and CPs shows that point source exposures and urban influence may be more important than ecological niche for these compounds.

AB  - The selection of the most sustainable forest management under given site conditions needs suitable criteria and indicators. For this purpose, carbon and economic balance assessment, completed with environmental impact computation using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) were used. The aim of this study was to compare forestry operations and wood production of selected forest stands with different i) tree species composition (Norway spruce - Picea abies and European beech - Fagus sylvatica) and ii) type of felling (chainsaw and harvester). Carbon and economic balance methods consist in the comparison of quantified inputs (fossil fuels, electricity, used machinery, fertilizers, etc., converted into emission units of carbon in Mg of C-CO2-eq. or EUR) with quantified outputs (biomass production in Mg of carbon or EUR). In this contribution, similar forest stands ("forest site complexes") in the 4th forest vegetation zone (in the Czech Republic approximately 400-700 m above sea-level) were selected. Forestry operations were divided into 5 main stages: i) seedling production, ii) stand establishment and pruning, iii) thinning and final cutting, iv) skidding, and v) secondary timber transport and modelled for one rotation period of timber production (ca. 100 years). The differences between Norway spruce and European beech forest stands in the carbon efficiency were relatively small while higher differences were achieved in the economic efficiency (forest stands with Norway spruce had a higher economic efficiency). Concerning the comparison of different types of felling in Norway spruce forest stands, the harvester use proved to induce significantly higher environmental impacts (emission of carbon) and lower economic costs. The comparison of forestry operation stages showed that the main part of carbon emissions, originating from fuel production and combustion, is connected with a thinning and final cutting, skidding and secondary timber transport in relations to different types of felling.

AB  - Broadleaf forests are critical habitats for biodiversity and this biodiversity is in turn essential for their proper functioning. Mites (Acari) are a numerous and functionally essential component of these forests. We report the diversity of two important groups, Oribatida and Mesostigmata, in a broadleaf forest in Eastern Norway which is considered to be a biodiversity hotspot. Eighteen samples, each 500 cm(3), were collected from diverse microhabitats (moss on ground, lichens on tree twigs lying on ground, moss on tree trunks at ground level, moss on tree trunks 1.5 m above ground, moss on decaying stump, moss on decaying log, and decaying wood from trees) from which 10,843 specimens and 95 species from 32 families of Oribatida, and 655 specimens of 34 species from 14 families of Mesostigmata were found. Only 30% of the species were previously recorded in broadleaf forests in Western Norway. Oribatid communities on decaying stump and in lichens were distinct from the other communities, while mesostigmatid communities on tree trunks (both at ground level and 1.5 m above ground) and in lichens differed most from other communities. Over 30% of the species were found in only a single microhabitat. Twenty-three species and the genus Zerconopsis are reported from Norway for the first time. Six records are also new to Fennoscandia, including (Oribatida) Coronoquadroppia monstruosa, Eueremaeus valkanovi, Ramusella furcata, and (Mesostigmata) Dendrolaelaps rectus, D. multidentatus, and D. tenuipilus. In addition, several rare species were detected, e.g., Achipteria magna, Oribotritia berlesei, and Subiasella quadrimaculata, and two were found in their northernmost locality (O. berlesei, E. valkanovi). These results confirm the unique character and high conservation value of the studied forest in Norway, Fennoscandia and at a European scale.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the comprehension levels of highway traffic sign symbols used in different countries, to identify underlying rules that affect comprehension levels, and recommend approaches to deal with the problem. The need for such an evaluation was based on today's travel culture where people are often licensed in one country and then drive--without any further training--in another country. We compared the comprehension levels of different traffic sign symbols in four countries with moderate to high levels of motorization: Canada, Finland, Israel, and Poland. Five different driver populations were sampled in each country: novice drivers, college students, tourists, problem drivers, and older drivers. There were large differences in comprehension among specific sign messages, different countries, and different driver populations. Signs were comprehended best when they were consistent with general ergonomic guidelines for display design as they relate to spatial compatibility, conceptual compatibility, physical representation, familiarity, and standardization. Illustrations of compliance with these principles and violations of these principles are presented, and their implication for traffic safety are discussed. Specific recommendations for sign design that is compliant with ergonomic principles, and for greater international cooperation in sign symbol design are made.

AB  - The "urban transition" agenda is as a conglomerate of ambitions derived from international policy documents and as applied in the Oresund area. Encompassing locally set goals for (i) climate change mitigation; (ii) energy efficiency; and (iii) human wellbeing in the built environment. Its implementation is largely dependent on private sector joining in, since transitioning the building stock is to be financed by the market. This paper explores strategies to meet this agenda in the Oresund area. A particular focus is on the refurbishment of multi-family housing relative to these set goals. The paper finds meaningful differences between Denmark and Sweden. In general, exceptionally high energy standards come at an additional cost that is likely to be incompatible with rational economic behavior. Furthermore, actions appropriate for one goal are likely to have modest effects on ancillary goals. The paper concludes by suggesting to revisit current strategies in the Oresund area to reflect market constraints and to promote more coherent ways to achieve the set goals.

AB  - Universities have an important role in regional innovation systems. In this study, we evaluate and compare two different case regional innovation systems (RIS), one located in the north of Romania, in Bucovina area and the other in Yla-Savo region, in the middle of Finland. Main focus is on how university is contributing to competences of a RIS. We use the A'WOT analysis, which is a hybrid method connecting Multiple Criteria Decision Support (MCDS) methods to SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. The method yields analytical priorities for the factors included in SWOT analysis and makes them commensurable. The research work done was based on experts and actors interviews, which were structured according to principles of the steps of the A'WOT analysis. SMART technique was applied in the A'WOT framework.
   Both case RIS are described and analysed. The main goal is to improve the theoretical and effective knowledge in the innovations and sustainable development field from a country with tradition: how management models are applied in countries with competitive industry; which are the costs of the marketing and management strategy implementation in companies; which are the obstacles for the entrepreneurs' development. The study will conclude by recommendations how to develop RIS competences, and especially the role of universities in this aspect.

AB  - Recent forests may be an asset for green infrastructure and ecological restoration, but studies are needed of the variation in forest biodiversity among sites, and possible reasons for observed patterns. In boreonemoral Scandinavia, reforestation occurs on abandoned agricultural land, and we studied 27 such recent (40?80 years old) mixed forests with temperate deciduous trees and boreal trees including Norway spruce, and their communities of dead wood fungi and vascular plants. By analysing aerial photos from 1960 and 2017, we explored how species richness and composition within sites vary with historical and present tree cover, and separately spruce cover, at site scale (2 ha) and within the surroundings (12.5 ha). Tree cover, and the percentage spruce cover, had increased considerably from 1960 and 2017, while open areas had decreased accordingly, at both scales. We found no significant relationships between species richness of forest plants, or fungi on coarse woody debris, and tree cover at any scale. On the other hand, species richness of grassland plants, and fungi on fine woody debris, showed significant negative correlations with high tree cover, and thus the recent forests with the highest total species richness seem to occur in surroundings with lower tree cover, currently dominated by agriculture. The reason may be a correlation between richer soils and more agriculture; the area with the richest soil have been extensively cleared and cultivated, and therefore currently have lower tree cover and more fragmented forests. Furthermore, ordination analysis showed that several deciduous tree species were negatively correlated with tree cover, locally and in the surroundings, while the tree species preferring rich soil such as Fraxinus and Ulmus (and several associated fungal species), were positively correlated with spruce cover. A possible explanation is that spruce colonize well on abandoned grasslands and therefore tends to be associated with grassland plants and trees requiring the richer soils of these areas. We suggest that recent forests in boreonemoral areas could be used for instance for restoration of temperate deciduous woodland, especially in areas dominated by agriculture, but that recurrent management may be needed to avoid spruce domination.

AB  - This article draws on interviews with customs officers to identify and discuss the intricacies of controlling the illicit trade in cultural heritage objects from a front-line perspective. The complexity of distinguishing illicit from licit trade in cultural objects presents customs officers with unique challenges. The findings reveal a perpetual relationship between several factors: poor knowledge of what is illicit trade among customs officers, few detections and recorded seizures, limited familiarity with the legal framework, logistical challenges in collaborations with cultural institutions and insufficient allocation of resources for capacity building leading to continued marginalisation of the field. Besides awareness building for officers, recommendations to break the cycle and encourage prioritisation include establishing a national, single point of contact to bridge the gap between organisations and a system that recognises impounding of suspected illicit material as well as formal seizures.

AB  - Leaching losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from arable land can be high, with N and P contributing significantly to the eutrophication of lakes and coastal waters. This study examined whether agriculture management and drain repair changed the chemical properties of shallow groundwater and affected nutrient leaching in the field. The hydrology of a subsurface-drained agricultural observation field included in the Swedish water quality monitoring programme was simulated for the period 1976-2006 using the process-based, field-scale model DRAINMOD. On the assumption that the drainage system operated similarly before and after repair, 54% more water was assigned to low-moderate flow events. Measured concentrations of sulphate-sulphur (SO4-S), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl) and potassium (K) were significantly lower in shallow groundwater in the period before drainage system repair (1980-1998) than afterwards (1998-2010). The concentrations were also significantly correlated with the corresponding concentrations in near-simultaneously sampled drain water. A similar connection was not observed for Na and Cl in the period before drain repair. Elevated concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) were recorded both in shallow groundwater and in drainage water from 1998 to 2010, especially after incorporation of chicken manure into the soil in 1998. Based on simulated discharge (assuming a functioning measuring station throughout), estimated flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration in drainage water increased from 5.6 mg L-1 (1977-1998) to 15.7 mg L-1 in the period 1998-2000. Simultaneously, mean NO3-N concentration in shallow groundwater increased from 0.2 to 4.0 mg L-1, and then to 4.8 mg L-1 in the period 2000-2012. It was estimated that after drain repair, a greater proportion of infiltrated NO3-N entered the receiving stream directly via the outlet of the tile drainage system close to the field's monitoring station than was the case before repair.

AB  - Survey data on breeding wader densities and grazing intensity on coastal meadows on the Baltic island of Nand from 1988, 1998 and 2003 were used to evaluate density and density-changes of four common and widespread wader species, lapwing Vanellus vanellus, redshank Tringa totanus, oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula in relation to grazing intensity. Population trends over time and changes in densities in relation to changes in grazing management were evaluated. Both wader densities and the environmental variable grazing intensity demonstrated significant spatial autocorrelation, but all main results were unaffected when accounting for spatial structure in the statistical tests. Breeding densities of investigated species were positively related to grazing intensity and local changes in grazing management affected the local change in wader densities. However, average grazing intensity increased over time whereas wader numbers generally remained constant or declined. Thus, changes in grazing intensity could not explain changes in overall breeding numbers. One explanation for this is probably that grazing mainly affected distribution of birds. Some evidence of a buffer effect was found in the redshank and ringed plover, in which breeding densities declined proportionally more in non-shore than in shore habitat. This was probably due to a redistribution of birds to shore habitat. It is concluded that grazing management is essential for the occurrence of waders, but might not be sufficient to ensure long-term viability of wader populations on coastal meadows.

AB  - Based on qualitative interviews with Swedish forest owners this study focuses on climate change, risk management and forest governance from the perspective of the forest owners. The Swedish forest governance system has undergone extensive deregulation, with the result that social norms and knowledge dissemination are seen by the state as important means of influencing forest owners' understandings and practices. Drawing on Foucault's concept of governmentality this study contributes knowledge on how forest owners understand and manage climate-related risk and their acceptance of advice. From the interview study, three main conclusions can be drawn: (1) forest owners' considerations largely concern ordinary forestry activities; (2) knowledge about forest management and climate adaptation combines experiences and ideas from various sources; and (3) risk awareness and knowledge of "best practices" are not enough to ensure change in forestry practices. The results of this study show that the forest owners have to be selective and negotiate about what knowledge to consider relevant and meaningful for their own forest practice. Accordingly, local forest management can be understood as situated in a web of multifarious interests, claims, concerns and knowledges, where climate change adaptation is but one of several aspects that forest owners have to consider.

AB  - Use of wood frames from sustainable forestry instead of non-wood frames in multi-storey buildings can reduce primary energy use and carbon dioxide emissions in construction. However, construction actors might have different perceptions towards wood frames than towards steel and concrete frames. Such perceptions may influence the actors' decision to adopt wood frames. In this study we use a web-based questionnaire to assess Swedish architects' perceptions, attitudes and interest towards steel, concrete and wood frames in multi-storey buildings (n = 412). Results indicate that the responding architects find concrete the most suitable frame material in buildings of 3-8 storeys, mainly because of the performance of concrete with regards to the engineering aspects (e.g. stability and fire safety) that were considered important in the choice of frame material. Although wood is considered the least suitable frame material, the overall attitude towards, and interest in, using wood is positive and related to the perceived environmental benefits of wood. This may derive from an increased discussion of and information about the environmental impact of buildings. Wood may be perceived as new and innovative while not considered as adequately proven as steel and concrete with regards to engineering aspects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to satisfy the needs of constant economic growth, the pressure to exploit natural resources has increased. Since accessible mineral resources are becoming scarce, the mining industry is constantly looking for novel techniques to allow commercial exploitation of lower-grade deposits. However, mining can have considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems. Here, we present the ecological damage inflicted by mine water originating from the massive Terrafame Talvivaara polymetal mine ( central Finland), where bioheap leaching is being applied to high-sulphur low-grade ore. We found that saline mine water has turned the lake meromictic, and sediment is heavily contaminated. As a result, important zooplankton and phytoplankton groups have been significantly altered. As the exploitation of poor-grade deposits is the future of the mining industry globally, water management should be taken to a higher level in order to proceed towards a sustainable mining sector.

AB  - Advisory services are considered to play an important role in the development of competitiveness and sustainability in agriculture. Advisory services have been studied at policy level, structural level and within case studies, but there is still restricted knowledge about advisors' and farmers' view on advisory services in general. This paper presents the views of Swedish advisors and farmers on advisory services. In a survey-based study, perceptions of farm advisors and full-time farmers in commercial Swedish agriculture on advisory services were identified and statistically analysed, comparing differences between and within the groups. The results are structured around three main themes; motives for a farmer using or not using advisory services, preferred approach by the advisor and future demands on advisory services and their importance today. Possible consequences of differences in perceptions for on-farm service delivery were assessed. Similarities in perceptions on advisory services among advisors and farmers, were found in areas characterised by well-defined questions or production-related issues. Significant differences in perceptions of advisors and farmers emerged in less concrete areas and on topics connected to change, management and strategy. Consequences of discrepancies in perceptions are that advisors may deliver too much, too little or off target, especially when expectations on advisory services are not clearly expressed. A strong and proactive back-office supporting the advisors is needed to prevent these possible consequences.

AB  - Parkway trees in urban environments have a pivotal ecological role, primarily because they modify microclimatological parameters. Norway maple is a suitable species for these purposes since it is very adaptable to city conditions. This characteristic of Norway maple allows urban trees to be used as a basis for biodiversity conservation. Bilaterally symmetrical fruits of Norway maple are particularly convenient for the exploration of developmental stability and the role of genetic and environment in variability of morphological characteristics of Norway maple. Variability change through different conditions could be used for creation of a scale that could serve to predict morphology of Norway maple in different environments. The differences between fruits collected from 4 locations show great variability of the species, but the size and appearance of the fruits are in accordance with literature data and do not deviate in any group of samples. Despite similar normal distributions of groups, the fruits differ significantly, although these variations are not consequences of a cause-and-effect connection between environment and appearance of fruits. Variability of samples taken from the urban environment does not differ from variability of samples taken from natural habitats. The large variability of Norway maple is expected since it has a wide ecological amplitude as well as a small plasticity, which is typical of species adapted to shadowy conditions. The great variability of fruit morphology within each individual is typical of Norway maple, so these could be used as representatives of the population in which they are grown. In this paper it is shown that the differences found between fruits are the result of genetic variations mosaic; that is, they are different ecotypes of Norway maple, since bilaterally symmetrical fruits do not have significantly different left and right sides, which shows the developmental stability of Norway maple.

Both these coastal heritage sites are situated north of the Arctic circle, in the areas most impacted by climate change. Whereas the global temperature increase since 1970 is just above 1 degrees C, in Svalbard the increase is now 4 degrees C. This is the first example of using this specific type of sensors to monitor the ongoing changes and their possible impacts on preservation of heritage sites.

AB  - Although "urban" and "fisheries" are not commonly paired in the analyses of either urbanism or fisheries governance, today's large-scale fisheries are often closely organised in connection with cities. In this paper, I build on a feminist perspective and urban studies to examine the makings of a city through contemporary fisheries. Drawing upon observations and interviews conducted in Tromso, Norway, which is a key site for Arctic fisheries, I review how fish and fisheries are simultaneously made visible and invisible in urban spheres. By analysing the gendered structures and valuations that organise the city-fisheries relations, I introduce three "fishy" windows to demonstrate the kinds of development and future pathways for fisheries that are considered relevant and rational in and for the city. In particular, I discuss how the historical, techno-masculine narratives of mastering Arctic nature frame and legitimise fisheries practices as they expand throughout Tromso. The study builds on the emerging research on Arctic urbanism to highlight the need to better integrate gendered analyses of the "urban" into social science research on natural resource extraction.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to present and analyze approaches for sustainable urban mobility in Poznan and Oslo. The topic of sustainable urban transport as well as green mobility is currently important from formal perspectives, due to European regulations, and because of ecological conditions and resulting climate changes. The research methodology implemented includes analysis of the literature on the research subject; analysis of EU documents and national policies with respect to financing and development of sustainable urban transport (SUT); development of a questionnaire on SUT in Oslo and Poznan, using the questionnaire to collect opinions on SUTs in Oslo and Poznan, and analyzing respondents' answers, defining recommendations concerning future activities for urban sustainability in the surveyed cities. The authors provide a review of the actual sustainable urban mobility situations in Oslo and Poznan, compare government support and sources of funding, identify gaps in terms of EU requirements, and try to compare the residents' expectations with the city's activities in the field of sustainable transport development. The research group includes students residing in both cities. The group constitutes 10-20% of the total number of inhabitants in cities being the subject of research. The empirical part investigates what their preferences are regarding the use of public transport in the context of sustainable development. On the basis of the conducted research, it can be stated that a sustainable urban mobility is one of the key development directions in Poland and Norway. The respondents see opportunities for developing green mobility in their cities as well as municipalities and the national government encouraging a sustainable urban transport. The implementation of the principles of sustainable development and reconstruction of city development strategy can be achieved by the cooperation of all stakeholders (namely: national government, municipalities, public transport providers, city residents).

AB  - Actinomycete bacteria produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities, some of which have been developed for human medicine. Rare actinomycetes are promising sources in search for new drugs, and their potential for producing biologically active molecules is poorly studied. In this work, we have investigated the diversity of actinomycetes in the shallow water sediments of the Trondheim fjord (Norway). Due to the use of different selective isolation methods, an unexpected variety of actinomycete genera was isolated. Although the predominant genera were clearly Streptomyces and Micromonospora, representatives of Actinocorallia, Actinomadura, Knoellia, Glycomyces, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Nonomuraea, Pseudonocardia, Rhodococcus and Streptosporangium genera were isolated as well. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing isolation of Knoellia and Glycomyces species from the marine environment. 35 selected actinomycete isolates were characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing, and were shown to represent strains from 11 different genera. In addition, these isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity and the presence of polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes. This study confirms the significant biodiversity of actinobacteria in the Norwegian marine habitats, and their potential for producing biologically active compounds.

AB  - Deep-sea sharks play a valuable ecological role helping maintain food web balance, yet they are vulnerable to commercial fishing because of slow growth rates and low reproductive capacity. Overfishing of sharks can heavily impact marine ecosystems and the fisheries these support. Knowledge of stock structure is integral to sustainable management of fisheries. The present study analysed vertebral chemistry using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to assay concentrations of Li-7, Na-23, Mg-24, Mn-55, Co-59, Ni-60, Cu-63, Zn-66, Rb-85, Sr-88, Ba-138 and Pb-208 to assess stock structure in a deep-sea shark, Etmopterus spinax, in Norwegian and French waters. Few studies have applied this technique to elasmobranch vertebrae and the present study represents its first application to a deep-sea shark. Three stocks were identified at the regional scale off western Norway, southern Norway, and France. At finer spatial scales there was evidence of strong population mixing. Overall, the general pattern of stock structure outlined herein provides some indication of the spatial scales at which stocks should be viewed as distinct fisheries management units. The identification of an effective multi-element signature for distinguishing E. spinax stocks utilizing Sr, Ba, Mg, Zn and Pb and the methodological groundwork laid in the present study could also expedite future research into stock structure for E. spinax and deep-sea elasmobranchs more generally.

AB  - Cold-water coral reefs are hotspots of biological diversity and play an important role as carbonate factories in the global carbon cycle. Reef-building corals can be found in cold oceanic waters around the world. Detailed knowledge on the spatial location and distribution of coral reefs is of importance for spatial management, conservation and science. Carbonate mounds (reefs) are readily identifiable in high-resolution multibeam echosounder data but systematic mapping programs have relied mostly on visual interpretation and manual digitizing so far. Developing more automated methods will help to reduce the time spent on this laborious task and will additionally lead to more objective and reproducible results. In this paper, we present an attempt at testing whether rule-based classification can replace manual mapping when mapping cold-water coral carbonate mounds. To that end, we have estimated and compared the accuracies of manual mapping, pixel-based terrain analysis and object-based image analysis. To verify the mapping results, we created a reference dataset of presence/absence points agreed upon by three mapping experts. There were no statistically significant differences in the overall accuracies of the maps produced by the three approaches. We conclude that semi-automated rule-based methods might be a viable option for mapping carbonate mounds with high spatial detail over large areas.

AB  - Bergen city centre is prone to both subsidence and flooding. With a predicted increase in precipitation due to climate change, a higher proportion of rainfall becomes surface runoff, which results in increased peak flood discharges. In addition, it has been predicted that sea-level rise and increasing storm surges will result in coastal flooding. In this study, the dual hazards of flooding and subsidence are analysed to exemplify possible risk assessment maps for areas most prone to the combination of both. Risk assessment maps are a support tool to identify areas where mitigation of subsidence and adaptation for surface water management will be most efficient and measures can be implemented. The results show that dual hazard assessment, like that described in this paper, can be a useful tool for decision-makers when prioritizing areas to implement measures such as Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems.

AB  - This study examines domestic media's coverage of foreign wildfires from a climate change perspective. It explores Swedish newspapers' coverage of wildfires in Australia, the Mediterranean region, and the USA during a three-year period (February 2013-March 2016), focusing on how and to what extent climate change is viewed as an underlying cause. A central result is that climate change is mentioned far more often in the case of Australian wildfires than of fires in the other two regions. Another finding is that the climate change issue became more prominent after a severe domestic wildfire in 2014. These observations are also examined qualitatively through a combined frame and discourse study where the importance of foreign news values, the use of foreign sources, cultural proximity/distance, and domestication procedures are analysed. In conclusion, foreign, domestic, and cultural factors in climate change reporting in relation to extreme events are further discussed.

AB  - This study aims to characterize and assess the organizational cultures of two Nordic nuclear power plant (NPP) maintenance units. The research consisted of NPP maintenance units of Forsmark (Sweden) and Olkiluoto (Finland). The study strives to anticipate the consequences of the current practices, conceptions and assumptions in the given organizations to their ability and willingness to fulfill the organizational core task. The methods utilized in the study were organizational culture and core task questionnaire (CULTURE02) and semi-structured interviews. Similarities and differences in the perceived organizational values, conceptions of one's own work, conceptions of the demands of the maintenance task and organizational practices at the maintenance units were explored. The maintenance units at Olkiluoto and Forsmark had quite different organizational cultures, but they also shared a set of dimensions such as strong personal emphasis placed on safety. The authors propose that different cultural features and organizational practices may be equally effective from the perspective of the core task. The results show that due to the complexity of the maintenance work, the case organizations tend to emphasize some aspects of the maintenance task more than others. The reliability consequences of these cultural solutions to the maintenance task are discussed. The authors propose that the organizational core task, in this case the maintenance task, should be clear for all the workers. The results give implications that this has been a challenge recently as the maintenance work has been changing. The concepts of organizational core task and organizational culture could be useful as management tools to anticipate the consequences of organizational changes. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - European populations of many ground-nesting farmland birds have declined in recent decades. Increases in predator populations and nest predation may play an important role in this decline, along with habitat loss. However, the role of various predators has often remained unclear. We conducted a study with artificial nests and wildlife cameras (n=104) in agricultural landscapes during 2015-2016 in South Finland. Our trials formed a 400-m wide gradient from forest to field. The aim of our study was to monitor nest survival and nest predators in a spatial and temporal scale. We tested the effect of distance to the forest and nest visibility to nest predation. During an 8-day period, 39.4% of the artificial nests were predated. Fifty percent of the predators were birds, 40% mammals, and 10% remained unknown. The three dominant predators of our artificial nests were the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) with 11 nests and the hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) and the magpie (Pica pica) with 10 depredated nests each. Our analysis indicates that avian predators preyed upon nests in open fields further away from the forest edge, whereas mammalian predation concentrated closer to the forest edge. Predation occurred more likely at the beginning of the survey and nest survival increased as days passed. Our study highlights the efficiency of using wildlife camera traps in nest predation studies. We also suggest that the ongoing expansion of alien predators across Europe may have a greater impact on ground-nesting bird populations than previously anticipated.

AB  - Purpose Within the ongoing digitalization of society and dimensions of integration, equality, citizen needs, sustainability and quality of life are of increasing importance as driving forces for cities to become smart. The purpose of this paper is to examine participatory management challenges in becoming a smart old town in the context of cultural heritage. Design/methodology/approach An explorative approach was applied on a qualitative single case study including in-depth interviews with 21 stakeholders representing local entrepreneurs, nonprofit organizations, the municipality, politicians, tourism organization and residents of an old town district in a Norwegian city. Additionally, participatory observations and document studies were performed. Findings were continuously validated with the respondents. Findings The present study contributes with stakeholder views on challenges arising from the development of a smart old town and suggests possible innovative solutions for participatory management. The transformation of a city with cultural heritage into a smart city require efforts that go beyond smart ICT implementations into issues of social sustainability. Research limitations/implications The study brings forward the opportunities that lie in the dynamics of interaction between the spirit of cultural heritage and the body of participatory management. It con-tributes by responding to calls for further research to deepen the insights into stakeholder inclusion in cultural heritage-based city transformation. This explorative study has its limitations as it is based on one qualitative single case. Practical implications Participatory management insights and recommendations for smart city transformation are provided. Social implications The study addresses socially sustainable outcomes to create democratic conditions that promote inclusion and community building by understanding what people need and expect from the place where they live and work. Originality/value This study is positioned as unique in terms of its complex nature of transforming an old town to become a smart old town based on cultural heritage and an open and coordinated inclusion of stakeholders. Smartness in context of city transformation is revealed in many dimensions ranging from technology-driven to more participant-driven.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) continue to penetrate passenger vehicle markets worldwide. Most current EV markets remain in nascent stages, with buyers being categorised as early adopters or pioneers. However, if electric vehicles are to successfully contribute to the decarbonisation of transportation, they must reach mainstream consumer segments. To investigate the underlying causes of EV interest and to determine the potential next wave of EV buyers, this study draws data from an original dataset (n = 5067) across the five Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. A machine learning model, based on the k-means method, is used for the analysis, creating six consumer segments around prospective EV adoption. The study finds that three consumer clusters, that account for 68% of the (sampled) population, are primed for EV adoption and represent the near-term mainstream EV market. The findings corroborate that price is a main determinant in reaching these mainstream consumers, while suggesting that vehicle-to-grid can contribute to the attractiveness of EVs and their uptake. The study also highlights that EV deployment strategy should focus on the technological and status aspects of EVs, as opopsed to only their environmental and financial attributes. Finally, the study stresses the importance that policy and industry decision-makers must create an equally competitive market place for EVs developing strategies and policy that considers the characteristics and interests of mainstream EV customers.

AB  - Deposition of large volumes of mine tailings takes place in several Norwegian fjords, but the impacts on marine ecosystems have received relatively little scientific attention. At a 40 + -year old tailing deposition area for a copper mine in the Arctic fjord Repparfjorden, we investigated both short-term colonization of mine tailings-contaminated sediments through a field experiment, and the present faunal state in the old deposit area. Copper-concentrations at the old deposition site were still high (up to 291 mg/kg dry weight (dw)), and exceeded the Norwegian environmental-quality threshold (84 mg/kg dw). Furthermore, copper was identified as a sig-nificant structuring factor for the fauna in the fjord, although faunal diversity was relatively high and the community not severely disturbed. In the colonization experiment, experimental boxes filled with defaunated sediment capped with mine tailings were subject to colonization for 15 months. Benthic macrofaunal commu-nities were successfully established in all boxes, but the boxes with tailings showed lower species richness, abundance and biomass than the controls. Mine tailings continue to have local impacts on seafloor communities decades after deposition, and even low levels of metal-rich sediments can affect faunal recruitment. These results have implications for submarine deposition of mining waste and the impacts they have on coastal ecosystems.

AB  - One of many important features of blue-green infrastructure is the ability to lower flood risks by detention of stormwater. This ability of flood risk reduction has for the first time been evaluated with empirical data in this study. In 2014, Malmo, Sweden, was hit with extreme precipitation corresponding to a return period of 50-200years that led to severe pluvial flooding. This and other large events presented the opportunity to evaluate the efficiency of the 15-year-old stormwater system retrofit in the Augustenborg area (30ha). Blue-green infrastructure is widely promoted for climate change adaptation, making this unique case important in the discussion of the capabilities of the related technical solutions. The long-term trends showed less flood damage in Augustenborg than in similar neighborhoods that have conventional sewer systems (combined or separate), indicating a direct effect of the retrofit with stormwater control measures. Even though a few properties were flooded in Augustenborg, it was shown that the retrofitted stormwater system performed successfully during the extreme event in 2014.

AB  - The objective of this article is to explore the potential for lowering household energy use given existing local support systems, in this case in the Stockholm inner city with the aid of the Dutch energy analysis program (EAP) that was adapted to Swedish conditions and that portrays total energy use for 300 consumption categories. Previously such modeling for Sweden was carried out using only Dutch databases. Our case-study area is well equipped with food stores, local markets, public transportation, and entertainment facilitating some energy-efficient consumption choices. With maintained expenditure levels but changed consumption patterns, current reduction potentials are on the order of 10-20%. Options concerning diet can lower food indirect energy use by up to 30%, whereas options in other areas have a lower potential. Further reductions will require enhanced local support systems, external as well as internal, The Results indicate that it is risky not to use nationally adapted figures for energy efficiency in the production sectors when modeling household energy use, because potential for change may be overlooked. Future work should include foreign energy intensities when modeling imported goods; otherwise, results may be less reliable. The Swedish EAP needs further work before it can be put to use as a modeling tool for everyday behavior, but it is already generating important possibilities for producing reliable data that can be used by local energy counselors.

We begin by arguing for the importance of our particular focus of study, souvenir labels, in the process of global and local tourism, and consequently as evidence of the interplay of languages, politics and economics. We then consider the distinctive features of the local political economy of language in our particular case study, the multilingual Sami village of Inari in Northern Finland. In a related discussion, we describe how Inari functions as a site of experiential cultural tourism, and how the purchase of souvenirs is part of the tourist experience. We then go on to describe a number of practices that we have observed in the choice and use of linguistic and visual resources for the labelling of souvenirs in Inari, the delicate balancing act that takes place in these practices between authenticity and mobility, and how this reflects and is reflected in the local political economy of language.

AB  - Official forecasts for oil revenues and the burden of pensioners are used to estimate forward-looking fiscal policy rules for Norway and compared with permanent-income and bird-in-hand rules. The results suggest that fiscal reactions have been partial forward-looking with respect to the rising pension bill, but backward-looking with respect to oil and gas revenues. Solvency of the government finances might be an issue with the fiscal rules estimated from historical data. Simulation suggests that declining oil and gas revenue and the costs of a rapidly graying population will substantially deteriorate the net government asset position by 2060 unless fiscal policy becomes more prudent or current pension and fiscal reforms are successful.

AB  - The sympatric existence of genetically distinguishable populations of the same species remains a puzzle in ecology. Coexisting salmonid fish populations are known from over 100 freshwater lakes. Most studies of sympatric populations have used limited numbers of genetic markers making it unclear if genetic divergence involves certain parts of the genome. We returned to the first reported case of salmonid sympatry, initially detected through contrasting homozygosity at a single allozyme locus (coding for lactate dehydrogenase A) in brown trout in the small Lakes Bunnersjoarna, Sweden. First, we verified the existence of the two coexisting demes using a 96-SNP fluidigm array. We then applied whole-genome resequencing of pooled DNA to explore genome-wide diversity within and between these demes; nucleotide diversity was higher in deme I than in deme II. Strong genetic divergence is observed with genome-wide F-ST approximate to 0.2. Compared with data from populations of similar small lakes, this divergence is of similar magnitude as that between reproductively isolated populations. Individual whole-genome resequencing of two individuals per deme suggests higher inbreeding in deme II versus deme I, indicating different degree of isolation. We located two gene-copies for LDH-A and found divergence between demes in a regulatory section of one of these genes. However, we did not find a perfect fit between the sequence data and previous allozyme results, and this will require further research. Our data demonstrates genome-wide divergence governed mostly by genetic drift but also by diversifying selection in coexisting populations. This type of hidden biodiversity needs consideration in conservation management.

AB  - In the late century of 1800 till mid-1900s, large predators were eradicated worldwide, and bounties were commonly used to get rid of the predators. In the twentieth century the policy changed, and predators became protected by law. The "return" of the predators has resulted in negative human-wildlife interactions and an increase in social conflicts. Media plays a key role in most social conflicts, as positive portrayals can lead to an increased willingness to conserve the species, as opposed to negative portrayals. We have looked at how Norwegian newspapers portray the large predators from when they were protected by law in the 1970's till today. Our results show that wolves represent the most articles, and the positive mentioning of wolves has decreased, while for bears this has increased. Local newspapers contained more negative portrayals than national newspapers, and changes in wolf establishment, predator management or politics impact on the number of articles. As our findings indicate that negative experiences with predators, in particular in local areas, associate with negative articles in the local newspapers, we believe this could contribute to negative attitudes towards predators among those who are readers of the local newspapers. This is yet to be studied in more detail and would be recommended to better understand the role of media in human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Sulfur has played a central role in the acidification of many lakes in Scandinavia and other regions. As part of the research into sulfur cycling, numerous studies have analyzed the sediment record in order to develop insights into past in-lake cycling of sulfur, particularly in the context of reconstructing past deposition rates. Although many of these studies have shown that it is not easy to interpret the sediment record in terms of past sulfur deposition rates, analyses of sulfur in sediment still provide valuable information on the response of lakes to anthropogenic sulfur deposition. Here, we have analyzed sulfur in top and bottom samples from short surface cores (25-35 cm, representing >= 250 years) as well as bulk cores from similar to 110 lakes located throughout Sweden, which were collected during 1986, as well as in more-detailed profiles from six lakes. The lakes with the highest surface sediment concentrations (9-24 mg S g(-1) dry mass) and the highest calculated inventories of 'excess' sulfur (20-180 g S m(-2)) are found in southern Sweden and around one industrial area along the northeastern coast where sulfur deposition rates and lake-water concentrations have been highest. For many lakes in the central and northern inland region it is common that the sediment cores exhibit either no enrichment or even a decline in sulfur concentrations in near-surface sediments, which we suggest was the pre-pollution norm for lakes. Although interpreting sulfur sediment profiles is problematic for reconstructing deposition, a more-comprehensive spatial sampling approach shows that there is a good geographic agreement between sulfur deposition, lake-water chemistry and sediment sulfur accumulation.

KW  - TYPOLOGY
AB  - The consumption of energy wood in Finland has increased dramatically since the early 2000s, and the region of South Savo is a bellwether for its usage across the country. This increase is partly due to the national policy of sustainable energy, region's wealth of forests but is also dependent on non-industrial private forest owners (NIPF) deciding to sell energy wood. In this study, a survey with a structured questionnaire was conducted among the NIPFs in the region of South Savo to enlarge the understanding of their willingness to sell energy wood in the future and adopt new approaches to forestry that involves energy wood thinning as well as their current production of energy wood. Moreover, the factors influencing forest owner's motivations relating to energy wood thinning as well as information needs were analysed with multivariate techniques. The results show that almost half of the forest owners in the South Savo region had not sold energy wood. However, forest owners within the region generally had positive attitudes towards selling small-sized energy wood and forestry methods that involve energy wood thinning. Moreover, forest owners' willingness to sell different types of energy wood varied, depending on their background. The study suggests that the increase in supply of energy wood presumes both intensified extension services for forest owners and markets that are better organised than at the moment. The results may also prove beneficial in informing policy-makers regarding which specific target group(s) to focus on when promoting energy wood sales among NIPFs and which aspects of energy wood harvesting and sales to promote.

AB  - The world's need for industrial wood is expected to greatly increase in coming decades. Somatic embryogenesis (SE) is a way in which an almost unlimited number of genetically identical plants (clones) can be produced from a single mother plant/seed, and it offers an effective way to convey the genetic gain obtained in breeding to the planting stock. As cultures or methods of SE, for example in Norway spruce (Picea abies), may become the subject of intellectual property rights (IPRs), a legal conflict may arise between the right holder and the rights of the general public covered by the Every man's rights to freely sample, for example, forest genetic resources (FGRs). Various IPR systems may be relevant for the protection of SE material in forestry, but they possibly differ in how well sufficient genetic variation can be encompassed by protection claims. We therefore specifically advocate awareness of genetic variation in future SE-related IPR claims in forestry, and argue that process patents are most applicable. In face of the bioeconomy, it is mandatory to be aware of the possible conflicts between IPRs and rights of the public to FGRs, and the genetic variation of future IPR-protected SE material in forestry.

AB  - Most of the Swedish coastal fisheries are not sustainable from either a social, economic or ecological point of view. We propose the introduction of local fisheries management (LFM) as a tool for restructuring the present large-scale management system in order to achieve sustainability. To implement LFM two questions need to be answered: How to distribute the resource fish among different resource user groups? How to restructure present fisheries management to meet the criteria of sustainability? Starting from these questions we describe possible forms of LFM for Swedish coastal fishery supported by recent research. The biological and social preconditions for restructuring fisheries management are derived from an analysis of the ecological and managerial situation in Swedish fishery. Three types of LFM-owner based, user based, and community based management-are analyzed with regard to the tasks to be carried out in LFM, the roles of management groups, and the definition and optimal size of management areas.

AB  - A new wave of encroachments is unfolding in Northern Sweden on the lands of Indigenous S ' ami reindeer pastoralists. Even if the State and corporations may accept that landscape transformations represent threats to reindeer pastoralists' cultural and livelihood practices, attempts to redress these grievances often involve money to cover costs associated with feeding practices or mechanized transport. This paper considers these landscape transformations as driven by industrial capitalist expansion and underlying colonial relations, examining their broader implications on human-animal relations in pastoral landscapes. We apply an ecologically informed radical geography approach and conduct a content analysis of claims-making instances around the new wave of encroachments and their associated compensation schemes, complemented with basic GIS data. Relying on three cases of public contestations, we argue that encroachments represent threats that disturb, degrade, and destroy pastoral landscapes, and that while counter-hegemonic struggles try to diminish the reach of capital into these landscapes to maintain human-animal relations based on natural pastures, hegemonic actors seek to alter such relations to deepen capital's reach. Although reindeer pastoralists have many allies, we argue that broader coalitions are likely necessary to push for reforms of planning regimes that can enable multi-functionality and sustainability of landscapes in rural areas.

AB  - The involvement of the public in decision-making is established as a key feature of many planning policies. However, there is evidence from the literature of a prevailing gap between participation rhetoric on paper and participation at the operational level. We assess whether this is also the case with landscape policy and review landscape characterization and assessment initiatives in England, Norway, Slovakia and Malta, focusing on five dimensions of good practice: (i) scope of public participation, (ii) representativeness of those involved, (iii) timeliness of public involvement, (iv) extent to which participation is rendered comfortable and convenient for the public, and (v) eventual influence of public input on decisions. Reviewed reporting results indicate weaknesses in the implementation of public participation, with public involvement largely limited to consultation, with few efforts to ensure representativeness of participants, with predominantly late involvement of the public, and with limited influence of the public on outputs. Furthermore, few efforts appear to be made to facilitate participation for the public. Although the cases studied differ, none of them are fully satisfactory in relation to the European Landscape Convention's participatory targets. The reporting of public participation processes thus suggests that practices may fail to match the rhetoric.

AB  - Boathouses have been in use in Norway for at least 2000 years and c. 850 structures pre-dating the 16th century have been recorded. The majority of boathouse remains (at least 500 structures) are found in northern Norway. The limited extent of boathouse excavations to date has severely handicapped attempts at interpreting the function and chronology of these Structures. This paper explores the nature of boathouse use during the Iron Age LIP to the early Middle Ages (c. AD 300-1200) in northern Norway by focusing on archaeological investigations of boathouses on the island of Vestvagoy and the Iron Age chieftain centre at Borg in the Lofoten Islands. Archaeological evidence from recent test excavations at a number of large boathouses, including multiple Cultural layers with hearths and pit features, is Suggestive of seasonal habitation and a range of activities Ear more diverse than those traditionally associated with the storage of boats and related equipment. Radiocarbon dates demonstrate that some boathouses were in use over many centuries thus adding another element of complexity to our Understanding of boathouses as multifunctional components of the Iron Age maritime landscape.

AB  - Here, we develop further the national chemical footprint assessment methods using Sweden as an example to enhance the precision of calculations. First, we integrate grid data on population density and distance-to-seacoast into the analytical framework to better match the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register on the subcompartment level with USEtox toxicity characterisation factors. Second, we use the latest USEtox 2.12 model version and its more punctual North European characterisation factors. Third, we conduct trend and geographic analysis and rank Swedish facilities in terms of toxicity potential. We show that total human toxicity potential in Sweden was smaller than previously estimated when using the North European USEtox landscape settings and sloped downwards over time. We confirm toxicity potential of major pollutants in previous research papers (Zn, Hg, Pb, Ni) and find that Hg's relative human toxicity potential in a longer period can be larger than previously estimated on shorter periods. Human toxicity is estimated to be mostly non-cancer type in Sweden. Results are largely invariant to the choice of air sub-compartments. Companies in the metals manufacturing sector are estimated to have the largest human toxicity potential in Sweden in the period between 2001 and 2017 and companies in the paper manufacturing industry have the largest ecotoxicity potential.

AB  - Municipalities are concerned with addressing social issues such as mobility inclusion and safety by increasing access to transport facilities and services for all groups in society to create equitable and equal access for all citizens. Moreover, the public transportation systems provided in cities have to be inclusive and safe, driven by emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based services that provide personalized recommendation to improve mobility inclusion and safety for all citizens in society, especially vulnerable road users such as senior citizens or older people. But at the moment, there are few studies that have investigated how municipalities can provide inclusive and safe public transportation in general and for senior citizens, particularly those aged 65 and above. Therefore, this study aimed to examine how to provide inclusive and safe mobility for senior citizens to improve out-of-home mobility services for senior citizens towards age-friendly cities and communities. Accordingly, a systematic literature review grounded on secondary data was adopted to investigate inclusive and safe mobility needs for senior citizens. The data were collected from previous research and existing documents, and a descriptive data analysis was carried out to provide insights on urban transportation policies related to senior citizens. Furthermore, case studies were adopted to present polices and strategies employed in Norway, Canada, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Northern Ireland to identify measures employed to address the public transportation needs of an aging society, focusing on the provision of inclusive and safe mobility to senior citizens. Further findings from this study included the possible use of emerging technologies such as AI-based machine learning for inclusive and safe mobility.

AB  - Episodic hydrological events, such as snowmelt during spring, have a marked effect on stream water chemistry. Here we investigated how spring snowmelt affected delta S-34 values of sulfate in six streams situated in northern Sweden. Four streams had high delta S-34(SO4) values during base flow with values ranging from +11.9 to +8.6%. During snowmelt the delta S-34(SO4) decreased to around +6%. In one of the streams and in the forested upper reaches of a second stream, delta S-34(SO4) values were close to +5% during base flow and decreased to about +3.8% during the spring snowmelt. One stream, which drained cultivated postglacial sediments dominated by acid sulfuric soils, was differentiated from the other streams by low delta S-34(SO4) values (-5.0% to -0.5%). We could identify two stream water SO4 sources: sedimentary sulfides and anthropogenic S. Bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction was identified as an important process affecting stream water delta S-34(SO4) values and suggests that in this boreal landscape, peatlands and possibly riparian zones have a large influence on the biogeochemistry of SO42- during base flow conditions. Our results suggest that during the spring snowmelt, snow S and desorbing SO4 of mainly anthropogenic origin are the two major S sources in four of the investigated streams. Two streams in forested areas also indicate that reoxidation of reduced S may be released during the spring flood. The stream in the cultivated area was found to be strongly influenced by the acid sulfuric soils independent of stream flow conditions.

AB  - This paper describes a modelling approach for evaluating the efficiency of different non-structural best management practices for stormwater management. A scenario with a set of source reduction practices was simulated using the substance flow model SEWSYS for an urban catchment in the city of Goteborg, Sweden. The scenario is based on a hypothetical control program that includes prevention, education and regulations. The simulation shows relatively high reductions of copper and PAH, 77% and 50%, respectively. The reduction in copper is mainly due to less copper roof corrosion and brake wear, while reduced road wear has the greatest effect for PAH. An important result from this study is that the nonstructural BMPs applied did not give a sufficient reduction in pollution to meet the desirable environmental quality criteria, To meet these criteria, additional BMPs must be implemented, preferably a combination of both non-structural and structural measures.

AB  - The mitigation of landslide risk to human-valued physical and non-physical assets is a fundamental component in the disaster risk management cycle. The reduction of risk can be pursued through the selection, planning and implementation of suitable mitigation measures and/or actions. The selection of the most appropriate mitigation measures is a complex process which depends on both the characteristics of the expected landslide event and the potential impacts on the physical, economic, environmental, cultural and societal human-valued assets. Each risk mitigation effort is thus markedly case-and site-specific. A web-based portal is in course of development within the Norwegian research project Klima 2050. The project is aimed at reducing the risks associated with climate changes and enhanced precipitation and flood water exposure within the built environment. The portal implements the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate landslide risk mitigation measures based on user inputs and dynamic expert scoring of an extensive set of candidate mitigation measures. This paper outlines the conceptual standpoints and the present and foreseeable future structure of the portal.

AB  - Large amounts of recovered waste wood (RWW) originating from construction and demolition activities (C&DWW) and industrial activities (IWW) are annually generated in Sweden. RWW is also imported for use as an energy source at biofuel boilers. Increased use of biomass is one strategy to decrease environmental impact, in general, and the emissions of green house gases, in particular. This study addresses the environmental and resource implications of metal occurrence in RWW that is used as an energy source at biofuel boilers. RWW contains elevated concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper, zinc, mercury, nickel, lead and possibly cadmium. The metal composition of Swedish and imported RWW differs in that Swedish RWW contains higher concentrations of arsenic, chromium, zinc, nickel and copper, while imported RWW contains higher concentrations of lead, mercury and cadmium. Ashes from combustion of RWW are nowadays generally disposed in landfills due to their elevated metal concentrations. This practice makes it impossible to use these ashes as filler material thereby replacing extraction of raw materials and decreasing the need for landfill space. Furthermore, landfilling leads to accumulation of hazardous heavy metals that poses a future environmental and health problem. If RWW from construction and demolition should contribute optimally to a sustainable energy system, cleaner waste wood flows are a prerequisite. The elementary measure is to track potential pollution sources in this waste stream and find out which are significant. Furthermore, since most of the RWW is untreated and unpolluted wood, there is a great environmental potential to separate this flow through the waste management system. Such an approach might lead to decreased environmental pollution of heavy metals and an improved resource management. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved..

AB  - Forest successional trajectories covering the last 2000 yr from a mixed deciduous forest in Denmark show a gradual shift in dominance from Tilia cordata to Fagus sylvatica and a recent increase in total forest basal area since direct management ceased in 1948. The successions are reconstructed by combining a fifty-year record of direct tree observations with local pollen diagrams from Draved Forest, Denmark. Five of the seven successions record a heathland phase of Viking Age dating from 830 AD. The anthropogenic influence is considerable throughout the period of study even though Draved contains some of the most pristine forest stands in Denmark. Anthropogenic influence including felling masks the underlying natural dynamics, with the least disturbed sites showing the smallest compositional change. Some effects of former management, such as loss of Tilia cordata dominance, are irreversible. Artificial disturbance, particularly drainage, has accelerated and amplified the shift towards Fagus dominance that would have occurred on a smaller scale and at a slower rate in the absence of human intervention.

AB  - We measured nesting success of the Temminck's Stint Calidris temminckii along the Finnish Bothnian Bay coast during 19 breeding seasons (1983-2001) and conducted a population census (1999-2002). We found 105 pairs, showing a marked decline from the previous survey (170 pairs 1987-95). Of the 424 'known-fate' nests, 47% hatched. Depredation caused 79.9% of the nest losses. Nesting failures increased from 1983-91 to 1992-2001 owing to a rise in nest predation. The proportion of failed nests that failed because of predation rose from 48.9 to 87.7%. When only depredated nests were considered as losses, Mayfield nest survival probability over the incubation period dropped from 69 to 31% (461 nests). This pattern emerged both in man-made and in natural habitats. Survival probability was independent of habitat type (natural vs. man-made). In an experiment involving videotaping of dummy nests, Common Gull Larus canus and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres were found to be the most important egg predators.

AB  - We argue that the often-proclaimed disregard of ex-ante assessments of the provision of ecosystem goods and services in policy-making processes is not only due to a neglect or a misinterpretation of the results of such assessments in the relevant political processes, but also due to an inaccurate inclusion of political variables into those assessments. To address this weakness, we combine a model-based scenario analysis with a policy network analysis. Analyzing the structure of the policy network and taking into account the policy preferences of the individual network actors allows us to assess the feasibility and likelihood of policy developments as derived from scenario-based modeling assessments. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in an analysis of potential policy measures aimed at maintaining crucial ecosystem goods and services in Swiss mountain regions, with a specific focus on agriculture, which is arguably one of the most important sectors for various ecosystem goods and services in those regions. Our results show that a production-oriented agricultural policy still has strong political support and, consequently, a status-quo protection scenario is very likely. In contrast, a more environmentally friendly agricultural policy is unlikely if it leads to extensive new regulations for agricultural production. Even with a greening scenario performing best within a set of ex-ante model-based assessments of future policy options, our policy network analysis suggests that changes in agricultural policy would have to reconcile the support of the provision of nonmarketable ecosystem goods and services with market deregulation policies in order to become politically feasible.

AB  - Despite more than 50 years of research and their great potential for sustainable pest management, pathogen suppressive soils remain poorly understood. We conducted a study on suppression of root rot disease symptoms associated with Pythium ultimum in untreated and heat-sterilized soil from ten southern Swedish farms with six different cropping and management regimes. Physical and chemical soil properties, soil nematodes belonging to different trophic guilds, and the predominant soil oomycetes were analyzed for their potential as indicators of soil suppressiveness. Six of the ten sampled soils were suppressive to P. ultimum disease symptoms. Suppressive or conducive properties of the soils from sites with permanent soil cover were related to the presence of live soil biota, while soils from sites with interrupted soil cover had suppressive or conducive effects unrelated to live soil biota. In soils with biologically conducive effects, soils had high or low cation nutrient content, while biologically suppressive soils had intermediate nutrient levels.

AB  - Treeline position, structure, and composition are shaped by natural and anthropogenic factors. At human-disturbed treelines, it is particularly difficult to disentangle the specific role of natural and anthropogenic drivers controlling tree recruitment dynamics following land abandonment. We tested for a possible common regeneration pattern of Pinus nigra Arn. at four upper treeline ecotones in the central Apennines (Italy). The sites were selected based on (1) the occurrence of natural encroachment of P. nigra above 1600 m a.s.l., and (2) the mountain top elevation higher than 2000 m a.s.l. We assessed structure and spatiotemporal patterns of P. nigra advancing regeneration using point and surface pattern analyses. We mapped, measured, and dated 845 trees sampled on a total surface area of 336 ha. P. nigra is the only tree species expanding at high altitude and features a scattered process that started 35-40 years ago, with a maximum recruitment frequency between 1995 and 2003. Pinus regeneration appeared over-dispersed along the slope at a scale range of 12-18 m. We found spatial segregation between saplings and young trees at intermediate distances (8-17 m) and small patches of young trees distributed along the treeline ecotone. The spatial pattern of P. nigra encroachment in the central Apennines revealed a replicable model independent of treeline topography and local disturbance histories.

AB  - Two obstructionist ways of doing politics on contentious wildlife management issues currently reflect a legitimacy deficit in official channels for public engagement. The first is that of a pernicious "directaction" politics, in the form of resort by hunters in rural Sweden to illegal killings of protected wolves over whose policy they contest. The second obstruction is when environmental non-governmental organizations routinely file appeals in higher-level courtrooms contesting democratically mandated wolf cull decisions. Although markedly different when it comes to their categorically deliberative values as well as fidelity to the law, we argue both extra-legal and the litigative phenomena reflect disenfranchisement with the participation channels in which such controversies may be resolved through a public dialogue. We also argue that both possess negative systemic deliberative value inasmuch as they frustrate goals of reaching deliberative consensus, by contributing to a stalled public communication on wolf management. We address this deficit by appeal to recent developments in the theory and practice of mini-publics that promote both the categorical and systemic deliberative value of channeling contestation. In particular, we appeal to a novel conception of hunter-initiated, but citizen controlled, mini-publics as a vehicle for restarting stalled public communication on wolf conservation.

AB  - Climate change may strongly influence species distribution and, thus, the structure and function of ecosystems. This paper describes simulated changes in the position of the upper treeline in the Swedish mountains in response to predicted climate change. Data on predicted summer temperature changes, the current position of the treeline, and a digital elevation model were used to predict the position of the treeline over a 100-year timeframe. The results show the treeline advancing upward by 233-667 m, depending on the climate scenario used and location within the mountain chain. Such changes hypothetically caused a 75-85% reduction in treeless alpine heaths, with 60-93% of the remaining areas being scree slopes and boulder fields. For this change to occur, the migration rate of the trees would be in the order of 23-221 m yr(-1), which is well within published migration rates for wind-dispersed deciduous trees. The remaining alpine areas would be strongly fragmented. These drastic changes would influence all aspects of mountain ecosystems, including biodiversity conservation and human land-use patterns.

AB  - Because of the dynamic nature of many managed habitats, proper evaluation of conservation efforts calls for models that take into account both spatial and temporal habitat dynamics. We develop a metapopulation model for successional-type systems, in which habitat quality changes over time in a predictable fashion. The occupancy and recruitment of the predatory saproxylic ( dependent on dead wood) beetle Harminius undulatus was studied in a managed boreal forest landscape, covering 24 449 ha, in central Sweden. In a first step, we analyzed the beetle's occupancy pattern in relation to stand characteristics, and the amounts of present and past habitat in the surrounding landscape. Managed forest is suitable habitat when >= 60 years old, and immediately after cutting, but not between the ages of 10 and 60 years. The observed occupancy of H. undulatus was positively correlated with the stand's age as habitat. We used a metapopulation model to predict the current probability of occurrence in each forest stand, given the spatiotemporal distribution of suitable forest stands during the last 50 years. Metapopulation parameters were estimated by matching predicted spatial distributions with observed spatial distributions. The model predicted observed spatial distributions better than a similar model that assumed constant habitat quality of each forest stand. Thus, metapopulation models for successional-type systems, such as dead wood dependent organisms in managed forest landscapes, should include habitat dynamics. An estimated 82% of the landscape-wide recruitment took place in managed stands, which covered 87% of the forest area, in comparison with 18% in unmanaged stands, which covered 13% of the forest area. Among the managed stand types, >= 60-year-old stands and 3-7-year-old clear-cuttings contributed to 79% of the total recruitment while 8-59-year-old stands only contributed 3%. The results suggest the following guidelines to improve conditions for H. undulatus and other species with similar habitat requirements: ( 1) the proportion of the landscape constituted by younger stands should not be allowed to grow too large, ( 2) the rotation period of managed stands should not be allowed to be too short, and ( 3) dead wood should be retained and created at final cutting.

AB  - The origin of bromoform in seawater and atmosphere, as well as possible sinks and breakdown mechanisms, is discussed. A bromoform budget is calculated for the Kattegatt area between Sweden and Denmark, where the input of bromoform from a power plant is significant. Both anthropogenically (250 x 10(6) g yr-1) and biogenically (350 x 10(6) g yr-1, 0.016 g m-2 yr-1) produced bromoform is likely to have a great impact locally on the inventory and the release to the atmosphere. Using measured sur-face concentrations of bromoform, the total annual release from the Kattegatt to the atmosphere is estimated to 550 x 10(6) g (0.025 g m-2  yr-1).

AB  - Willow coppice of various Salix spp. has been shown to be a good alternative to fossil fuels both environmentally and economically. Willow stands have also been shown to be adaptable as vegetation filters in order to purify waters and soils. The purification efficiency of willow vegetation filters has been demonstrated in several countries, e.g. Sweden, Poland, Denmark, and Estonia. However, there are still many questions to be answered: for example, what are the mechanisms behind the uptake and allocation of heavy metals and recalcitrant organic constituents, which maximum doses are possible in a particular situation without risks for leakage, and how are hygienic aspects influenced when using vegetation filters. The aim of this paper is to point out some relevant facts concerning willow coppice in general and willow vegetation filters in particular. More specifically, the paper presents and discusses the direct and indirect factors that are improved in such a way that there is a clear benefit of short-rotation forestry. For example, willow cultivations enhance biodiversity compared with conventional agricultural crops and monospecific conifer plantations. They have a pronounced capacity to take up nutrients and heavy metals (including cadmium). The economy is favourable regardless whether the coppice is used as biofuel or as a vegetation filter. The conclusion is that the growing and use of willow coppice is beneficial for the environment and may come to play an important role in a society based on recycling principles.

AB  - Given the drastic changes in the environment, resilience is a key focus of ecosystem management. Yet, the quantification of the different dimensions of resilience remains challenging, particularly for long-lived systems such as forests. Here we present an analytical framework to study the economic resilience of different forest management systems, focusing on the rate of economic recovery after severe disturbance. Our framework quantifies the post-disturbance gain in the present value of a forest relative to a benchmark system as an indicator of economic resilience. Forest values and silvicultural interventions were determined endogenously from an optimization model and account for risks affecting tree survival. We consider the effects of differences in forest structure and tree growth post disturbance on economic resilience. We demonstrate our approach by comparing the economic resilience of continuous cover forestry against a clear fell system for typical conditions in Central Europe. Continuous cover forestry had both higher economic return and higher economic resilience than the clear fell system. The economic recovery from disturbance in the continuous cover system was between 18.2 and 51.5% faster than in the clear fell system, resulting in present value gains of between 1733 and 4535 euro ha(-1). The advantage of the continuous cover system increased with discount rate and stand age, and was driven by differences in both stand structure and economic return. We conclude that continuous cover systems can help to address the economic impacts of increasing disturbances in forest management.

AB  - Soil bacteria and understorey plants interact and drive forest ecosystem functioning. Yet, knowledge about biotic and abiotic factors that affect the composition of the bacterial community in the rhizosphere of understorey plants is largely lacking. Here, we assessed the effects of plant species identity (Milium effusum vs. Stachys sylvatica), rhizospheric soil characteristics, large-scale environmental conditions (temperature, precipitation and nitrogen (N) deposition), and land-use history (ancient vs. recent forests) on bacterial community composition in rhizosphere soil in temperate forests along a 1700 km latitudinal gradient in Europe. The dominant bacterial phyla in the rhizosphere soil of both plant species were Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Bacterial community composition differed significantly between the two plant species. Within plant species, soil chemistry was the most important factor determining soil bacterial community composition. More precisely, soil acidity correlated with the presence of multiple phyla, e.g. Acidobacteria (negatively), Chlamydiae (negatively) and Nitrospirae (positively), in both plant species. Large-scale environmental conditions were only important in S. sylvatica and land-use history was not important in either of the plant species. The observed role of understorey plant species identity and rhizosphere soil characteristics in determining soil bacterial community composition extends our understanding of plant-soil bacteria interactions in forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - For the past decade, the Finnish waste sector has increasingly moved from the landfilling of municipal solid waste towards waste incineration. New challenges are faced with the growing amounts of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash, which are mainly landfilled at the moment. Since this is not a sustainable or a profitable solution, finding different utilisation applications for the municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash is crucial. This study reports a comprehensive analysis of bottom ash properties from one waste incineration plant in Finland, which was first treated with a Dutch bottom ash recovery technique called advanced dry recovery. This novel process separates non-ferrous and ferrous metals from bottom ash, generating mineral fractions of different grain sizes (0-2mm, 2-5mm, 5-12mm and 12-50mm). The main aim of the study was to assess, whether the advanced bottom ash treatment technique, producing mineral fractions of different grain sizes and therefore properties, facilitates the utilisation of municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash in Finland. The results were encouraging; the bottom ash mineral fractions have favourable behaviour against the frost action, which is especially useful in the Finnish conditions. In addition, the leaching of most hazardous substances did not restrict the utilisation of bottom ash, especially for the larger fractions (>5mm). Overall, this study has shown that the advanced bottom ash recovering technique can be one solution to increase the utilisation of bottom ash and furthermore decrease its landfilling in Finland.

AB  - Green-tree retention is an integral part of forest management in the boreal zone. Retention of small spruce mires, proposed as 'key habitats' for many forest organisms, is recommended while logging, but the efficiency of such practices for the maintenance of forest species is poorly understood. Hence, we studied boreal spiders and carabid beetles at I I retained mire patches (up to 0.55 ha) in Eastern Finland during 1998-2001. The adjacent surrounding drier forests of the focal mires were clear-cut during the winter of 1998/1999. We evaluated the importance of micro-habitat type (retention, edge or clear-cut plot), time since logging, and retention-patch size in determining the assemblages of spiders and carabids. Following logging, species associated with forests and mires generally decreased both in the retained mire patches and in their adjacent clear-cuts. In a GLMM, the number of standing trees in a retention patch - a surrogate for retention-patch size - had no significant effect on most of the tested species, but plot type (retention patch, its edge or clear-cut) was significant for many species. Semiopen-habitat species and open-habitat specialists increased following logging, especially in the clear-cut plots but even within the retention patches. In contrast, mature-forest and moist-habitat specialists became significantly less abundant in clear-cuts than in retention patches following logging. Spider assemblages showed pre-harvest differences among the mires, their edges and adjacent drier forests, but the fauna of logged plots rapidly diverged from that of mire and edge plots. However, after a 1-2 summers time lag, the spider fauna of mires and edges changed toward clear-cuts. For spiders, the post-harvest sample heterogeneity was significantly lower in clear-cuts than in retention patches, including their edges. Carabid responses were generally ambiguous. Multivariate regression trees showed that the number of trees in a forest patch better determined the spider assemblage structure than study area, study year or micro-site type (retention patch, its edge or clear-cut), indicating a strong impact of logging. For carabids, however, the study area better determined the assemblage structure; the other factors were of minor importance. Our results suggest that, as the spider and carabid faunas of the retention patches had drastically changed following logging, (i) retention patches should be considerably larger than the studied size range to efficiently maintain a 'mire core' spider and carabid assemblage; (ii) the effect of logging may take years to appear; (iii) spiders were more sensitive to habitat change than carabids; and (iv) harvesting not only changes the relative abundances of forest- and open-habitat associated species but it may also locally decrease the faunal variation.

AB  - In the city of Tromso in northern Norway, invasive Tromso palm (Norwegian: Tromsopalme; English: Persian hogweed) is widespread. Although Tromso palm has negative impacts on biodiversity and contains a phototoxic sap that burns human skin, it is also considered to be a local symbol of Tromso city and is appreciated by many inhabitants. This study examined private landowners' characteristics, perceptions, and landowners' regulation of invasive Tromso palm on their parcels on Tromso Island in 2012 (vegetation season: May-September) to provide information concerning which landowner groups could be assisted by official regulation. Eleven key informants and 17 landowners were interviewed. Afterward, Tromso palm on Tromso Island was mapped using aerial photos and street-level photos from Google Maps (R)/Google Street View (R) and fieldwork verification. This distribution map was superimposed on a property map in a geographic information system to produce a map showing private parcels that contained Tromso palm and associated neighboring parcels that did not contain Tromso palm. Questionnaires were mailed to the 441 owners of the selected parcels, and 199 of the returned questionnaires were analyzed. Tromso palm was more likely to be fully regulated/absent on a parcel that was inhabited (particularly if the owner lived on-site) and less likely to be fully regulated/absent if the parcel was jointly managed by several households. These findings indicate that authorities could focus their management efforts on supporting regulation efforts of those private landowners who own currently uninhabited or rented-out parcels and landowners of parcels jointly managed by several households. Furthermore, those landowners who found regulation measures against the plant on Tromso Island important tended to have partly or fully regulated Tromso palm on their plots. This might imply that information campaigns from authorities might encourage more landowners to regulate Tromso palm.

AB  - Complex and multi-layered socio-economic and cultural challenges face refugee parents resettling in a new country. The aim of this study was to describe refugee mothers and fathers' experiences of parenthood by lifting up their own voices, illuminating the challenges they face and laying the basis for designing interventions to provide well-informed and culturally tailored support pro-grammes for families in need.
   The study combined narrative research with focus group discussions with 50 refugee mothers and fathers in Sweden. Data were analysed inductively using thematic analysis. The main theme identified: Navigating the changing landscape of parenthood, captured refugee parents' experiences of navigating their parenthood through the new socio-political, cultural, and economic setting in Sweden.
   The study results demonstrated how acculturation challenges undermined the role of parents, threatened the family cohesion and led to alienation of children from their parents. Despite the plethora of challenges faced by families, parents struggling to navigate two differing cultural paradigms, envisioned a path of dialogue and reconciliation between newcomers and the host society as a way to foster true integration and understanding between immigrant and native communities.

AB  - All education in Sweden, or the Swedish eduscape, is permeated by discourses of compensation and inclusion, conceptualized in this study as a one-school-for-all ethos or perspective. This ethos contributes to a social-ecological framing, wherein the intentions are a society where everyone can participate as active members. This study scrutinizes the governmental strategy of 2017 to digitalize the Swedish educational system based on a one-school-for-all perspective. The study is framed by SWaSP (Second Wave of Southern Perspective) theoretical ideas, with a special focus on positionings, languaging, timespaces, and epistemological-methodological dimensions, including ethics based on the entangled tenets of sociocultural, integrationist, and southern perspectives. Furthermore, this study is anchored in three research projects and one societal developmental project. Materials - e.g., video recordings, audio recordings, photos, artifacts, fieldnotes - from these projects have been generated through (n)ethnographic methods from different institutions in the Swedish educational landscape i.e., eduscape. These span across compulsory schools to Swedish for Immigrants (SFI), within Municipal Adult Education. Three themes have emerged in the multi-scalar data analysis from across settings: (i) intended inclusion, (ii) unintended exclusion, and (iii) intended exclusion. The first theme highlights how digital tools (DTs) create inclusion for students with special needs, or those who are new to the named-language Swedish, in the classroom community, thus contributing to social-ecological sustainability. The second theme illustrates how DTs intended for inclusion in classroom practices morph into tools of exclusion for individuals in mainstream classrooms. The third theme highlights how students in the Swedish eduscape are intentionally excluded from mainstream classrooms. We argue that a social-ecological sustainable stance troubles the division of eduscapes into "mainstream" and "other" settings in contemporary societies, calling for the inclusion of all students irrespective of their positionalities. Our findings highlight that multimodal use of DTs potentially can facilitate inclusion, by providing tools where individual students can participate in and contribute to teaching and learning-what we frame as a third position of classroom organization.

AB  - The aim of the article is to identify a degree of inclusive growth and to examine the influence of determinants of inclusive growth in the European Union (EU-27) countries, with particular emphasis on factors related to the influence of governments and central banks. The study took advantage of the weight correlation method, which was used to build an inclusive growth measure for the EU-27 for the years 2000, 2008, and 2020. For the construction of the inclusive growth rate, 42 factors were selected that affect inclusive growth in the economic, financial, and non-wage area. These determinants are found in the area of the influence of economic authorities, and mainly in the area of authorities responsible for conducting monetary and fiscal policy and general governance. On the basis of the built-up indicator of inclusive growth, it was noticed that among the 27 EU countries in the studied three years, only four countries distinguished themselves with the highest inclusive growth over the last 21 years, these are: Denmark, Luxembourg, Sweden, and Finland. On the other hand, invariably, three countries recorded the lowest inclusive growth, i.e., Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania. The added value of the structure of the inclusive growth indicator was a possibility to observe which of the three areas: economic, financial, or non-wage, had a significant impact on the position of a given country in the compiled inclusive growth ranking.

AB  - This paper critically engages with the role of ecotourism in the emergent concept of rewilding, by examining the case of Rewilding Lapland, an initiative launched by the Rewilding Europe Foundation in 2015 (Rewilding Lapland was renamed Rewilding Sweden in early 2018). The paper investigates how ecotourism is discussed and approached in the Rewilding Lapland focal area, investigating the conflicts between local views and institutional approaches. There are tensions between local views and institutional approaches to ecotourism. The paper discusses these tensions in the context of the neoliberalisation of nature, and the friction between exclusive ecotourism and the Swedish Right of Public Access. The paper concludes that for respondents, the benefits of rewilding are influenced by the relationship fostered between themselves and the environment. For them, ecotourism offers a medium to engage with the environment, with the medium of engagement greatly affecting the relations that are fostered. The paper presents tensions as arising through the (deepening) neoliberalisation of nature the Rewilding Lapland ecotourism agenda pursues. To be successful, rewilding initiatives like Rewilding Lapland that promote ecotourism ventures must be aware of the types of human-nature relations these ventures foster, and how these may not always be valued by a local community.

AB  - Sediment geochemical techniques were used to assess how the sediment record reflects the loading and land use history of Laajalahti Bay, a semi-enclosed bay adjacent to the city of Helsinki, Finland. A dated sediment core was analysed for concentrations of Al, Ca, K, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zri and total concentrations of C, N and P together with P fractions and biogenic silica (BSi) at intervals of I cm to a depth of 88 cm. Furthermore, five phases of development were identified in the sediment record by using principal components analysis and cluster analysis. The lithology of the core indicates sharp changes in the sedimentation environment in the earlier history of the embayment that are most likely due to isostatic uplift and changes in salinity. The most prominent recent trends were the increasing sedimentation rates and nutrient concentrations towards present. In addition, significant increases were observed in the concentrations of anthropogenic indicators Cu and Zn. In spite of decreased nutrient loading to Laajalahti Bay no significant signs of improvement were observed in the sediment record yet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Given the speed and extent of changes in vegetation as a result of human activity, there is a need to investigate ways in which individual species' impacts on ecosystem processes can be generalized and scaled-up to the community level.
   2. We focus on linking community functional parameters (mean of the traits of the plants in the community, weighted using four different methods) with litter chemistry and decomposition, in a chronosequence of currently managed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands in southern Sweden.
   3. Changes in plant community composition with age since abandonment were reflected in community functional parameters: as expected, aggregated specific leaf area (SLA) declined, and aggregated leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and leaf carbon : nitrogen ratio (C : N) increased with plot age.
   4. Several litter chemistry indices were closely linked with plant traits at the community level; in particular, community aggregated LDMC was correlated with the lignin and fibre content of the community litter.
   5. Aggregated LDMC stood out as the trait most closely linked to community litter decomposition. This relationship was consistent across all three incubation periods (by which time up to c. 70% mass loss had occurred) and as strong as that between the best single chemical index of litter quality (lignin : N ratio) and litter mass loss.
   6. Mass loss of whole community litter, incubated in its plot of origin, was related to mass loss of the same litter incubated under standard conditions, but not to decomposition of a standard substrate, indicating dominant substrate quality control over decomposition.
   7. This study demonstrates the potential of the traits of living plants as a tool to link changes in species composition with ecosystem processes at the community level.

AB  - European agriculture is a sector that is in a decisive moment of transformation. The transition from small farms to viable and sustainable businesses is difficult and often traumatic. One of the ways to face these changes is through the grouping of farmers creating agri-food cooperatives. This model has proven successful in Sweden or Finland but has not been developed equally in all territories. Romania is a country with no deep-rooted cooperative tradition. However, it has exciting and promising initiatives that may represent an alternative development path, especially in rural areas.

AB  - ObjectivesNovel information about the relationships between farmers' job demands, lack of resource, burnout, and ill health is reported based on testing the so-called "health impairment process" of the Job DemandsResources Model (JD-R) on a representative sample of Finnish dairy farmers. The aim was to find out whether two different job demand factors; workload, societal demands and lack of resource; loneliness, were related to the indicators of ill health via burnout. MethodsThe data is based on a postal survey of 400 Finnish dairy farms. Altogether 265 questionnaires were received from 188 farms and included in the analysis. The response rate was 47 per cent among sample farms. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationships between the variables. Explanatory factor analysis was used to group the job demand and lack of resource variables. ResultsWe identified two job demand factors, which we labelled workload and societal demands and one lacking job resource, loneliness. Our theoretical model was supported in that two of the factors, namely workload and loneliness, were related to ill health indirectly via burnout. In addition, workload was directly connected with ill health. Societal job demands were not significantly related to burnout, or to ill health. ConclusionOur results suggest that farmers could benefit from means to reduce workload, especially the physical load. This topic needs further research as the restructuring process has increased farm enterprise sizes. There is a need to develop tools and projects to alleviate loneliness among farmers. Lack of social support, high workload, ill health, and burnout among farmers may have serious direct and indirect negative consequences for the sustainability of farming.

AB  - Forest plantations are still often considered the antithesis of real nature. However, plantations can host many organisms. The problem is that some of the hosted species are regarded ad hoc as pests. The main aim of our paper was to study the carpenter ant (Camponotus ligniperdus) in windstorm habitats. We studied forests in East Bohemia, Czech Republic, and focused on the spatial distribution of snapped trees and the influence of selected forest characteristics on the incidence of ant nests. We found that the nests in the study area mainly occurred in Norway spruce, which is the most commercially important tree in the majority of Central Europe. More than one quarter of the snapped trees were inhabited by the ants. We found that nests exhibited a spatially autocorrelated pattern that differed on spatial scales. The most important characteristic of the host tree for determining carpenter ant nests was the presence of brown rot, and the majority of tree nests were isolated from forest openings. The presence of carpenter ants in forest plantations is, therefore, not harmful. Their presence could be used by forest managers as an indication of unsuitable stand conditions for the successful growth of the Norway spruce and other coniferous plantation trees.

AB  - Background: The 2015 refugee crisis led into a forced migration of millions of people globally. As a consequence, many countries experienced a quick change in the proportion of conflict-area born migrants. This group being stated as an especially vulnerable group for suboptimal maternal health, a timely inspection of preventive maternity care was required. This study investigated prenatal care in terms of gestation trimester at the first prenatal visit, number of check-ups prior to birth, and prepartum hospitalization in conflict-country born migrants and Finnish parturients in Finland.
   Material and methods: Cross-sectional study included all pregnancies of migrants born in conflict-affected countries (n = 3 155) and country-born parturients (n = 93 600) in Finland in 2015-16. The data were obtained through Medical Birth Registry and Population Information System. Statistical analysis employed T-test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were adjusted for sociodemographic and health-related background variables.
   Results: Migrant parturients had a higher probability for delayed enter in prenatal care compared with Finnishborn parturients (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 3.46; 95% Confidence Interval CI 3.06, 3.91). Recommended minimum number of check-ups was participated by 95.3% of the migrant, and 96.4% of the Finnish-born group (P <0.000). Migrants' probability for more than ten visits prior to term birth was significantly lower (aOR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.51, 0.66). No significant differences in prepartum hospitalization yielded between the groups.
   Conclusions: Migrant parturients had significantly smaller number of check-ups and later entry in care compared with the country-born parturients. These findings add to earlier reported challenges in the organizing of conflictaffected country born migrants' prenatal care in a high-income setting, in which the proportion of conflict-area born migrants has risen rapidly and unexpectedly.

AB  - We hypothesized that the responses of boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies) forests to climate change would be region-specific due to regional differences in temperature and water availability. In this context, we analyzed the adaptive effects of varied thinning intensities on the gross primary production (GPP), total stem wood growth, and timber yield over a 100-year period using a process-based ecosystem model. Our simulations represented Norway spruce forests for five different bioclimatic zones spanning southern to northern Finland (61-67(o)N). Ten thinning regimes with thinning intensities ranging from 5 to 50 %, as well as an unthinned regime, were included in the calculations. The results showed that at the southern sites without thinning, the cumulative GPP and total stem wood growth were lower under the changing climate than in the current climate over the simulation period due to greater water depletion via evapotranspiration and reduced soil water availability. At the central and the northern sites, the climate changes increasingly enhanced the GPP and total stem wood growth due to the mitigation of low-temperature limitation and the improved soil water availability. Thinning generally mitigated the soil water deficit by reducing water evaporation and led to a reduction of the natural mortality. At the southern sites, light and moderate thinning intensities increased the GPP and total stem wood growth relative to sites with a changing climate that experienced no thinning. Moreover, moderate thinning resulted in the greatest timber yield. Heavy thinning, in which a large proportion of standing trees were removed, reduced the GPP and total stem wood growth despite allowing increased soil water availability. At the northern sites, all levels of thinning, including light thinning, decreased the GPP and stem wood growth, indicating that soil water availability was not a limiting factor for growth prior to thinning.

KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Through an agreement with EEE producers, Swedish municipalities are responsible for collection of hazardous waste and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). In most Swedish municipalities, collection of these waste fractions is concentrated to waste recycling centres where households can source-separate and deposit hazardous waste and WEEE free of charge. However, the centres are often located on the outskirts of city centres and cars are needed in order to use the facilities in most cases. A full-scale experiment was performed in a residential area in southern Sweden to evaluate effects of a system for property-close source separation of hazardous waste and WEEE. After the system was introduced, results show a clear reduction in the amount of hazardous waste and WEEE disposed of incorrectly amongst residual waste or dry recyclables. The systems resulted in a source separation ratio of 70 wt% for hazardous waste and 76 wt% in the case of WEEE. Results show that households in the study area were willing to increase source separation of hazardous waste and WEEE when accessibility was improved and that this and similar collection systems can play an important role in building up increasingly sustainable solid waste management systems.

AB  - Jellyfish blooms are of increasing concern in many parts of the world, and in Norwegian fjords an apparent increase in mass occurrences of the deep water jellyfish Periphylla periphylla has attracted attention. Here we investigate the hypothesis that changes in the water column light attenuation might cause local retention and thereby facilitate mass occurrences. We use a previously tested individual-based model of light-mediated vertical migration in P. periphylla to simulate how retention is affected by changes in light attenuation. Our results suggest that light attenuation, in combination with advection, has a two-sided effect on retention and that three fjord categories can be defined. In category 1, increased light attenuation turns fjords into dark "deep-sea" environments which increase the habitat and retention of P. periphylla. In category 2, an optimal light attenuation facilitates the maximum retention and likelihood for mass occurrences. In category 3, further increase in light attenuation, however, shoals the habitat so that individuals are increasingly exposed to advection and this results in loss of individuals and decreased retention. This classification requires accurate determinations of the organism's light preference, the water column light attenuation and topographical characteristics affecting advection.

AB  - Values and personality affect food choices, and values are associated with personality. Food values are values that have been developed specifically within a food context. Our primary objective was to investigate the as-sociations between these food values and the Big Five personality traits. An online survey with a choice experiment on food values and questions about socioeconomic characteristics and personality traits were con-ducted in Norway and the US. A latent class logit model was used to segment respondents based on the relative importance they assigned to the different food values. Personality traits and socioeconomic characteristics were used to determine the probability of membership in each segment. A health, an altruistic, a rational, and a hedonistic segment were identified in both countries. In addition, Norwegian natural and welfare segments and US safety and indeterminate segments were identified. Several personality traits and socioeconomic character-istics were significant in defining the segments, and these traits and characteristics can potentially be used for marketing purposes of foods with sustainability-related attributes. Marketing activities can be targeted at seg-ments who emphasize sustainability-related aspects of food consumption such as environmental impact, fairness, and animal welfare.

AB  - Assessments of carbon and economic efficiencies, completed by an environmental load computation using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, could be a useful tool for assessing sustainable forest management (e.g. Berg & Lindholm 2005, Michelsen et al. 2008). The purpose of this study was to compare forestry operations focused on manually operated (chainsaw) and fully mechanized (harvester) felling in Norway spruce monocultures and mixed forests within the Novohradske Mts. (Czech Republic) using the methods of carbon efficiency (including LCA) and economic efficiency. In general terms, these methods consist of comparing quantified human inputs (e.g. fossil fuels, electricity, used machinery, and fertilizers, converted into emission units of carbon in t C in CO2 equivalent or EUR) with quantified ecosystem outputs (biomass production in t C or EUR). Forest operations were modelled for one rotation period. The results showed the main differences in carbon emissions and carbon efficiency related to forest operations with different types of felling. In contrast, the economic efficiency results did not differ much with different types of felling. Differences between Norway spruce monocultures and mixed forests using the same type of felling were relatively small for carbon efficiency but large for economic efficiency (Norway spruce monocultures recorded higher economic efficiency).

AB  - About 12% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions derive from construction of and energy use in buildings. To decrease energy use in buildings, more energy-efficient technologies must be implemented. However, there are barriers to the implementation of energy-efficient technologies. In this study, interviews were conducted with different stakeholders within a city district development project to find barriers towards the implementation of energy-efficient technologies in buildings. First, an investigation of barrier theory followed by three preinterviews was conducted, which helped in forming questions for the interview study, which involved a total of 18 respondents. The respondents were from the client, facility manager, developer, consultants, project planners, contractor, and the local energy supplier. The barriers mentioned in the interviews were connected to different phases of a building project. There is a scarcity of studies where barriers in various phases of the construction process are explored. In conclusion, the most frequently mentioned barriers were connected to the Planning Program phase and the Project Planning phase. Two new barrier categories are suggested: Lack of Knowledge and Fear. The most prominent barriers to implementation of energy-efficient technologies were Inertia, Risk, Access to Capital and Lack of Knowledge. To increase the implementation of energy-efficient technologies in buildings, knowledge needs to be increased throughout the whole industry, and stakeholders need to step out of their comfort zone and not always do as they have done before. A key policy implication is the importance of capacity building in the early phases of the building process.

AB  - Expanding populations of geese feeding on farmland during winter and spring conflict with agricultural interests along their migratory flyway in north-western Europe. In Mid-Norway, farmers scare spring-staging pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus off their land to protect crops, and this has had clear effects on goose distribution. To protect the geese, Norwegian authorities have implemented economic compensation to farmers to discourage scaring, but this has not been prioritised to accommodate the biological requirements and dispersal patterns of the geese, though such an approach is clearly needed. To address this need, we assessed the negative effects of scaring geese during 2004-2007, and built a species distribution model to identify sites suitable for goose foraging. We subsequently combined known foraging sites with sites identified by our model and prioritised these sites according to their connectivity, perimeter area ratio, years of historic use and proximity to roost. By combining historic data on foraging sites, a species distribution model, and a simple, accountable site selection process we demonstrate how the current compensation scheme can be made 10 times more efficient through strategic prioritisation. Our approach has direct implications for alleviating similar goose-agriculture conflicts throughout Europe. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Coastal geomorphology determines the essential environmental characteristics, such as substrate type and stability, terrestrial water regime and underwater hydrodynamics, that form the basic abiotic settings for the biota. While the importance of coastal geomorphology in determining the patterns of biological communities is relatively well studied on the terrestrial side of the shoreline, the respective relationships have been rarely studied seaward from the shoreline. Therefore, we aimed to fill this research gap by relating coastal geomorphology to marine benthic biodiversity. We studied the variability of species richness of macroscopic seabed fauna and flora along different shore geomorphic types in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. The shore was classified into nine geomorphological types. Spatial buffers of sizes 125-1000 m (hereafter "scales") were formed around each segment of shoreline and mean values of faunal, floral, and total species richness were calculated in each segment and scale. ANOVA revealed that biodiversity significantly differed between the shore types. Generally, the biodiversity was the highest among the types "Scraps and steep slopes in sand", "Exposed rocky cliffs with boulder talus base" and "Sheltered rocky rubble shores" and the lowest among the type "Exposed, solid man-made structures". Smaller spatial scales hosted higher biodiversity but the interaction between shore type and scale was not statistically significant. To conclude, the coastal geomorphology reflects the general patterns of underwater biodiversity, and thus, the information of shore geomorphic types can be used in coastal management and oil pollution combating prioritization in the case when the information of underwater biota is not available.

AB  - This paper attempts to assess the role of chemical processes in the weathering, erosion, and denudation of periglacial alpine environments. It draws primarily from detailed chemical studies in the alpine zones of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, the Jotunheimen of Norway, and northwest Swedish Lapland.
   The nature or kind of chemical weathering processes has been found to be the same in periglacial environments as elsewhere. Comparison of weathering rates among various environments reveals periglacial chemical weathering to be generally slower than that in the tropical and temperate latitudes, but overlapping with the lower values reported from such environments. In broad terms, this statement is valid whether assessment is based on bedrock or regolith weathering estimates. Chemical weathering is found to be a substantial, sometimes the dominant, agent of mass removal in periglacial environments.
   Assessment of the role of chemical processes in denudation is complicated by the differing, sometimes conflicting, definitions of the term. It is important to view chemical processes primarily as a component of geomorphic work, rather than as an important land-forming agent, in periglacial environments. Given the intrinsic attribute of long distance transport out of a drainage basin implicit to denudation, chemical solute loads in periglacial river systems must be ranked highly in comparison to the, often dramatic, but nearly always highly localized contribution from alpine mass wasting.

AB  - Geoscientists play an increasingly important role in understanding climate change and its impacts. This is especially the case with adaptation to climate change which cannot be solved in isolated attempts, but calls for international cooperation and integrated approaches. The potential effects of climate change on natural hazards, as well as water and energy resources, are of great concern to geoscientists and stakeholders. Climate change has only recently been incorporated into decision-making processes and spatial planning. In order to facilitate communication of potential impacts of climate change, and to determine strategies and measures to adapt to those, in October 2009 the RIGS Commission on Geoscience for Environmental Management (GEM) established a Working Group on Climate Change Adaptation (http://climate.iugsgem.org/).
   This article presents some results of projects on climate change adaptation in the Baltic Sea Region (conducted by multi-disciplinary project teams under the lead of the Geological Survey of Finland). This paper was elaborated under the auspices of the BaltCICA project and JUGS-GEM

AB  - Within the renewable transport transition, a number of alternative technologies have emerged creating competing visions of how to reduce fossil fuel dependence. This paper examines the dynamics of competing fuels in two Swedish municipalities where electric buses have emerged, threatening incumbent biogas-based bus systems. While in Linkoping, actors are resistant to the promise of electrification, in Malmo the shift to electrify urban buses has already begun. Here, the theoretical perspectives of obduracy and sociotechnical imaginaries are used to analyze obduracy and change in Linkoping and Malmo, showing how the local contexts of these two municipalities influence obduracy or willingness to change. In Linkoping, perceived connections between the biogas-based bus system and local infrastructures of renewable waste management and organic food production cause actors to place biogas buses at the center of a sustainable future region, while in Malmo linkages to the gas network (which also distributes natural gas) cause actors to question the sustainability of the fuel in use and opens up the city to welcome new electric vehicle tests. These examples show how fuel alternatives interact with each other in the wider renewable energy transition.

AB  - Livestock-derived phosphorus (P) loading values are largely based on studies performed in small experimental fields, leading to uncertainties when applying the results at larger scale. This five-year study estimated annual loads of P, nitrogen (N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total suspended solids (TSS) in a small 3.2 km(2) agricultural and forested catchment by monitoring water quality and discharge in four ditches reflecting different land uses. The monitored catchment has intensive livestock production, with proportions of grassland, cereal and forest area typical for east-central Finland. Typically, spring runoff started in early April under snow cover and peaked during snowmelt. There was great variation in the amount and pattern of discharge between years. Mean annual total P (TP) load (+/- SD) from an agricultural sub-catchment was 1.0 +/- 0.37 kg ha(-1). Mean TP load from a forested (PS) sub-catchment was 0.4 +/- 0.17 kg ha(-1) when a point source of pollution (PS) was included and 0.06 kg ha(-1 )when it was excluded. The point source of pollution contributed 12 % of the TP load from the whole 3.2 km(2) catchment. The proportion of dissolved reactive P (DRP) to TP load varied between 34 % and 67 % in the study period (largest for the forested (PS) sub-catchment and smallest for the whole catchment). Observed erosion rates were very low when measured as TSS, with the highest (115 +/- 103 kg ha(-1)) and lowest (3.4 +/- 2.3 kg ha(-1)) mean annual erosion rate in the agricultural and forested (PS) sub-catchments, respectively. In the agricultural sub-catchment, the relationship between TP and DOC tended to be stronger than that between TP and TSS. Mean annual total N load from the agricultural sub-catchment was 19.0 +/- 7.2 kg ha(-1) and from the whole catchment 10 +/- 2.7 kg ha(-1), while mean annual DOC load was 45 +/- 13 kg ha(-1)( )and 92 +/- 28 kg ha(-1), respectively. These results are important in developing, implementing and targeting mitigation measures to control agricultural nutrient losses to surface waters.

AB  - Integrating conservation and sustainable development is difficult, but organisations charged with this mandate must move forward with implementation. Adaptive Co-Management (ACM), an approach that brings together the learning function of adaptation with the linking function of collaboration, has been identified as a promising way to enhance the effectiveness of sustainable development without compromising conservation efforts. We examine four UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BRs) to better understand the extent to which they exhibit characteristics of ACM integrated conservation and sustainable development and gain insights into how they do so. We find that the BRs we studied in Canada and Sweden undertake a substantial number of activities strongly oriented towards integration of conservation and development objectives. These activities involve a wide variety of actors in both on-the-ground implementation efforts and decision-making activities, create novel spaces for interaction among participants which contributes to their bridging ability, and draw on social networks, available assets and individuals' contributions to enable actions in pursuit of their integrative mandate. Insights into these activities and how they were undertaken can offer lessons for future practice and research within the World Biosphere Reserve Network, as well as conservation organisations more broadly. Although we demonstrate that significant efforts are being made towards integration of conservation and development, we nonetheless suggest that further studies should explicitly investigate if and how such integration actually lead to more desirable social and ecological outcomes.

AB  - It is generally recognized that technological fixes alone cannot solve car-induced sustainability problems requiring measures to reduce car use. However, there is a knowledge gap concerning what we can learn from the experience of people who voluntarily refrain from car ownership. This paper aims to explore how everyday life is organized and perceived by voluntarily carless households with complex travel needs, focusing on dual-income families with children living in an urban setting (Gothenburg, Sweden). Through a time-geographical theoretical lens and drawing on eight in-depth interviews with parents, we scrutinize the accessibility strategies of these families and the perceived implications of being voluntarily carless for daily living. We find that these families use largely proximity-oriented strategies and combine various practices in managing time-pressed everyday life. The findings underscore the situatedness of carlessness and the importance of the inherent constraints and fixities of different everyday life projects. Notably, adaptation is considered to be well functioning in the spheres of mandatory activities and bounded routines (related to work, school, and consumption). Regarding free-time activities, carlessness is associated with more friction and perceived inconvenience. Questions are raised regarding the long-term persistence of voluntary carlessness, as family life situations may change. The results merit further consideration in sustainable transport and land use planning as well as regarding the wider organization of society.

AB  - Effects of contrasting climatic conditions and nitrogen (N) deposition levels on streamwater N dynamics are assessed at two small heathland catchments; Dalelva in northern Norway (69degreesN) and circle divideygard in southwestern Norway (58degreesN). The study comprises 11 years of data on climate, hydrology and N inputs/outputs from Dalelva and 8 years of corresponding data from circle divideygard. Both sites are comparable in catchment size, geology and land cover characteristics, but have large differences in climate and N deposition, Dalelva is characterised by a cold, arctic climate and low N deposition (2-3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), whereas the circle divideygard site has a more mild, humid climate with much larger N deposition (13-19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Streamwater nitrate (NO3.)concentrations at Dalelva generally were negligible during the growing season, but showed a steady increase during the dormant season until a maximum of 40-100 mug N L-1 was reached just before snowmelt. At onset of the snowmelt flood, NO3- concentrations decreased momentarily to very low levels, suggesting that N eluted from the seasonal snowpack to a great extent was infiltrated and immobilised in the soils. At circle divideygard, flood peaks occurred frequently during all seasons, and usually there was no distinct spring flood. A lack of clear dilution effects from floods on streamwater NO3- concentrations may indicate a relatively high NO3- leaching potential in this catchment. On average, the annual NO3- export was negligible at Dalelva (<0.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), while at circle divideygard it amounted to 3.0+/-0.3 (+/-1 s.d.) kg ha(-1) yr(-1), or nearly 20% of the annual N deposition, In addition to this relatively high annual N loss, elevated NO,concentrations during the growing season further indicate that the N supply at circle divideygard is in excess of the combined plant and microbial demand.

AB  - Purpose - The paper's aim is to show three different styles local managers around the world use to hybridize global corporations' and local management practices and values.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach is qualitative research based on managers' stories. Findings - The paper provides data of the styles of hybridization of management produced by local managers in Thailand, Mexico, and Israel of two global corporations headquartered in Sweden and the USA.
   Research limitations/implications - Through a focused inspection of 24 managers in three different countries (two offices in each country) this paper attempts to identify local styles of hybridization -obviously, further research is needed to confirm the findings of this research. Managers who were interviewed are in urban sites in Thailand, Mexico and Israel, senior managers with academic degrees in engineering or business, and they manage highly trained workers. The cultural processes this paper develops are most applicable to people like those interviewed.
   Practical implications - Recognizing the styles of hybridization shown in this paper can be of assistance for global corporations in setting the conditions not only for the transfer but also for the appropriate integration and adaptation of their management values and practices to the local.
   Originality/value - The paper suggests seeing local managers of global corporations as acknowledgeable agents who do not absorb the corporations' management forms as they are but use different styles to integrate them in their own.

AB  - In 1988-2009, efforts involving manure regulations, subsidies and advisory work were made to reduce losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from arable land to water in Sweden, especially southern Sweden. To evaluate ensuing long-term trends, nutrients in total and dissolved form were monitored in drainage water from 13 fields under ordinary cultivation. The Mann-Kendall test, adjusted for biweekly sampling, revealed significant decreasing trends (magnitude 3% per year) in nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in two fields. One of these had received no manure and had been subjected to delayed tillage after fallow since 1993, while the other had been frequently cropped with a catch crop combined with spring tillage since 1999. An additional decreasing trend in dissolved reactive P (DRP) was observed over the years from this and another field, both with unfertilised fallow grown as an interior buffer on an area at the field outlet, one in 1999-2010 and the other since 2001. By contrast, there was an increasing trend in DRP in a field with accelerating P loads that included almost yearly manure additions to crops following potatoes and sugar beet. However, the general DRP level in the drainage water was low (4-13 mu g L-1), probably as a result of high P sorption capacity of the topsoil and subsoil. No significant trends in total Pot particulate P were found for any of the fields. The importance of long-term monitoring of nutrients in water leaving agricultural fields in order to estimate trends in nutrient losses is discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to establish the degree of acceptance of organic food production and food in the Finnish food chain. The organic food system in Finland is poorly developed and one of the many reasons is that the food chain stakeholders are not committed and do not share common objectives for organic food and its production. A survey was carried among 1527 respondents from agriculture, industry, retail, catering and consumers to establish their opinions on safety and healthiness of organic food, and ecology and ethicality of organic production as well as the support that their own environment provided to their opinions. The results show that all environments are very positive for all four attributes. The best support for positive opinions on organic food and its production was in retail and catering. The community, as a consumer's environment was the least supportive of positive opinions and did not provide enough information about organic food and its production. To develop the organic food system, there needs to be a common objective among all stakeholders. Safety, healthiness, ecology and ethicality, as commonly accepted attributes, could represent tools for a more sustainable food system. Accepting consumers as co-creators in the food chain would enrich communication and strengthen the positive development of the entire organic food chain.

AB  - This commentary introduces a methodology and theoretical framework for studying how the tourism industry might balance the competing demands of economic growth and environmental governance. We focus on the "balancing act" Svalbard tourism industry must play among sometimes competing demands of climate change mitigation and emissions from tourism, and of strict Norwegian environmental management policy and demands for increased tourism. While these are specific to Svalbard, the balancing act of competing needs is the core challenge of the UN Sustainability Goals giving this research global and pan-Arctic relevance. Through collaboration between two tourism organisations, the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO) and Visit Svalbard and an interdisciplinary team of scientists, we will co-produce knowledge about how to innovate new opportunities while protecting the wilderness, the very backbone of tourism. This collaboration considers how policy, climate change, and local attitudes together may affect the tourism industry and helps to define and develop sustainable tourism operations and products. For instance, tourists may participate in environmental and community-related activities or "micro safaris" rather than a sole focus on charismatic megafauna. Policy discussions about tourism growth need to consider how local and national governments anticipate and navigate rapid social, political, and environmental changes.

AB  - Short rotation forestry (SRF) is regarded as a silvicultural practice employing high-density plantations of fast-growing tree species on fertile land with a rotation period of fewer than 10-12 years. I address the challenges and possibilities of SRF applications under the circumstances of a boreal climate, today as well as after anticipated climate change. The implications of a pronounced winter season for the performance of biomass crops are discussed. Poplars, aspens, and willows are superior in boreal SRF because of their fast growth rate in combination with good cold hardiness. These trees can enrich the coniferous forests of boreal regions and increase biodiversity in open agricultural landscapes of the boreal zone. Further, SRF plantations can serve as tools for the amelioration of environmental problems at local (e.g., phytoremediation) and global (e.g., increased greenhouse effect) scales. The biomass yields achieved in boreal SRF and the appropriate production systems appear do not appear to be principally different from warmer regions, but there are some differences with respect to the importance of fertilization, appropriate spacing, and rotation length. The major barriers for a rapid development of SRF appear not to be climatic, technical, or environmental constraints in many boreal regions.

AB  - Tourism is often understood and experienced as an exclusive activity. In supporting the concept of inclusive tourism, this volume seeks to counter that tendency by seeking out ways in which those who are typically marginalized by, or excluded from tourism can be brought into the industry in ways that directly benefit them, or that they can gain more control over tourism. This introduction to the special issue first presents a conceptual article that defines the concept of inclusive tourism and discusses seven different elements, which may constitute lines of inquiry in investigations of tourism's inclusiveness. It then presents five empirical articles that illustrate some of the ways in which an inclusive tourism approach might inform discussion of the potentials and limitations for tourism to generate wider social and economic benefits. The examples provided are from a wide range of geographical contexts, from Cambodia to Australia, Sweden, Turkey and Spain. Inclusive tourism is offered here as both an analytical concept and an aspirational ideal. We do not ever envisage minimum standards for inclusive tourism. We rather hope that there will be a restless quest to find ways to include new actors and new places in tourism on terms that are equitable and sustainable.

AB  - This article analyzes an "Environmental Education Project" run by the Norwegian state oil company Equinor targeting poor women in the seafood processing industry along the coastline adjacent to Equinor's offshore Peregrino field in Brazil. The project is a prerequisite for Equinor's operating license, as required by Brazilian federal environmental authorities. I analyze the broader sociopolitical territory within which the project is implemented, how it is discursively framed and institutionally implemented within Equinor Brazil, and how this conjoins with the Brazilian state's regulatory framework. I argue that Brazilian legislation and the hands-on approach of authorities uphold Equinor's commitment to the project and bolster Equinor's CSR practitioners' capacity to defend it within the corporate organization. The analysis demonstrates how national legislation and political context shape international oil and gas companies' approaches to CSR.

AB  - Although economic geography has made considerable progress in explaining the emergence of new industrial development paths, a number of issues have yet to be sufficiently explored. The purpose of this article is to contribute to economic geography research on path creation by developing a conceptual framework that specifies key conditions and reinforcing mechanisms for path creation, on the one hand, and barriers to the materialization of such conditions and mechanisms, on the other hand. As such, the framework moves beyond firm-centric perspectives and argues that path creation needs to be understood as a collective endeavor incorporating both firm and nonfirm actors. By implication, this necessitates an understanding of the broader contexts that shape path creation processes, including how the dynamics of an emerging path are affected by the dynamics of established paths. The authors employ this framework to analyze Norway's offshore wind power (OWP) industry. Their analysis reveals that an initial enabling context for OWP path creation turned into more constrained conditions. Similar to findings from a number of other studies, they identify branching between related sectors as a primary path creation mechanism. However, they find that this mechanism is vulnerable to shifting contextual conditions, which for various reasons resulted in the studied emerging path losing resources and legitimacy, thus implying potential negative path interdependence. The authors also identify barriers to path creation in the institutional environment, particularly in terms of lack of policy coherence in support for key resource formation processes that are pivotal for path creation processes to generate sustained momentum.

AB  - Wood fuel production has increased remarkably, but its environmental effects within the forest ecosystem have not yet been studied much. We investigated the immediate effects of two series of forest management treatments, which produce timber and forest chips, on the volume and decay classes of coarse woody debris (CWD). One of the treatment series included logging and residue harvesting (LRH) and mounding (M), while the other series included LRH and mounding combined with stump harvesting (MSH). We hypothesized that, i) LRH reduces CWD, excluding stumps; ii) the more intense the soil preparation treatment is, M vs. MSH, the more CWD is destroyed; iii) both LRH and soil preparation treatments (M and MSH) reduce the occurence of snags, highly decayed CWD and deciduous CWD in particular. Ten sample plots in mature managed Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) dominated forests were located in Southern Finland. The total volume of CWD on the sample plots was measured three times: before and after LRH, and after M or MSH. LRH significantly decreased the volume of snags and the combined volume of snags and logs. MSH significantly decreased the total volume of CWD, while M had no significant effect on the volume of CWD. The middle and highly decayed CWD were destroyed most easily in the treatments.

AB  - Pressing sustainability challenges and increased influence of neoliberal ideas in planning have resulted in strong demands to 'speed up', and increase efficiency in, planning processes. Meanwhile, the reported risks that such emphasis on speed have for participatory decision-making and continuous calls for increased deliberation in planning, following the ideas of communicative planning theory, suggest that planning processes ought to 'slow down'. These dual pressures for swift and slow planning have been discussed within Nordic planning studies as an 'either-or' tension by which decision-making processes are either swift yet exclusive and technical-based and/or market-driven or participatory and deliberative but time-consuming. This paper provides insights into how deliberative planners navigate the double pressure for swift and slow planning in the design of participatory planning processes. It is based on a case study in Uppsala, Sweden where demands for swift decision-making and for participation following deliberative ideals were noticeable. The case study shows planners striving in different ways to balance the contradicting demands for swift and slow planning through their process design choices. These findings provide inspiration to reimagine the deliberative turn in planning as a 'balancing act' between equally important demands for participation and deliberation, and for faster and more efficient planning.

AB  - Extensive use of drainage ditches in European boreal forests and in some parts of North America has resulted in a major change in wetland and soil hydrology and impacted the overall ecosystem functions of these regions. An increasing understanding of the environmental risks associated with forest ditches makes mapping these ditches a priority for sustainable forest and land use management. Here, we present the first rigorous deep learning-based methodology to map forest ditches at regional scale. A deep neural network was trained on airborne laser scanning data (ALS) and 1,607 km of manually digitized ditch channels from 10 regions spread across Sweden. The model correctly mapped 86% of all ditch channels in the test data, with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.78. Further, the model proved to be accurate when evaluated on ALS data from other heavily ditched countries in the Baltic Sea Region. This study leads the way in using deep learning and airborne laser scanning for mapping fine-resolution drainage ditches over large areas. This technique requires only one topographical index, which makes it possible to implement on national scales with limited computational resources. It thus provides a significant contribution to the assessment of regional hydrology and ecosystem dynamics in forested landscapes.

AB  - The opportunities available to start up a successful farm business structure the future of European farming. As fewer farm daughters and sons are projected to take over the family farm, there is increasing policy and academic interest in new entrants and the challenges they meet when they start their farm. This study focuses on new entrants that immigrate to Sweden. This group can be considered an extreme case of new entrants, as key resources (land, local networks, family labour support and farm specific knowledge are usually lacking for these farmers). Based on interviews with immigrant farmers in the M?lardalen region, we present the different ways they get access to economic, cultural and social capital. These insights are valuable for policy aimed at helping immigrant farmers starting up.

AB  - In Central Africa, creating forest roads and skid trails is one of the most costly and environmentally damaging operations for the forest's ecosystem. An optimized road network is essential for reducing construction costs and improving the sustainable management of timber resources. The location of landings is vital in the development of a future forest road network. In this study, a binary integer programming model similar to the uncapacitated facility location problem is formulated to optimize the locations of the landings. The model is applied to selective logging in Central Africa and tested on an annual logging zone in Southeast Cameroon. The results are compared to that of manual road planning, the currently used method. (C) 2011 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged healthcare organizations and puts focus on risk management in many ways. Both medical staff and leaders at various levels have been forced to find solutions to problems they had not previously encountered. This study aimed to explore how physicians in Sweden narrated the changes in organizational logic in response to the Covid-19 pandemic using neo-institutional theory and discursive psychology. In specific, we aimed to explore how physicians articulated their understanding of if and, in that case, how the organizational logic has changed during this crisis response. Methods The empirical material stems from interviews with 29 physicians in Sweden in the summer and autumn of 2020. They were asked to reflect on the organizational response to the pandemic focusing on leadership, support, working conditions, and patient care. Results The analysis revealed that the organizational logic in Swedish healthcare changed and that the physicians came in troubled positions as leaders. With management, workload, and risk repertoires, the physicians expressed that the organizational logic, to a large extent, was changed based on local contextual circumstances in the 21 self-governing regions. The organizational logic was being altered based upon how the two powerbases (physicians and managers) were interacting over time. Conclusions Given that healthcare probably will deal with future unforeseen crises, it seems essential that healthcare leaders discuss what can be a sustainable organizational logic. There should be more explicit regulatory elements about who is responsible for what in similar situations. The normative elements have probably been stretched during the ongoing crisis, given that physicians have gained practical experience and that there is now also, at least some evidence-based knowledge about this particular pandemic. But the question is what knowledge they need in their education when it comes to dealing with new unknown risks.

AB  - There is growing concern about the threat posed by climate change to cultural heritage, notably to World Heritage properties. Climate change is triggering changes in rainfall patterns, humidity and temperature, as well as increasing exposure to severe weather events that can negatively impact on cultural heritage materials and structures by enhancing the mechanical, chemical and biological processes causing degradation. In response to this climate change challenge, the Climate for Culture (CfC) project, funded by the European Commission, investigated the impacts of climate change on the European cultural heritage through the use of a high-resolution regional climate model that projected future changes in climatic conditions, and simulated the future conditions of the interiors of historical buildings and their impacts on the collections they hold using building simulation tools. This paper compares the climate change impacts on cultural heritage identified by the CfC project with semi-structured interviews with experts working on cultural heritage preservation in Norway, Italy and the UK. Hence, the perceptions of the cultural heritage community on the impacts of climate change on heritage assets are first explored, which are then compared with the risk matrices produced by the CfC project as a decision-support tool to inform managers involved in the preservation of cultural heritage. In addition, the learning strategy underpinning examples of climate change adaptive measures applied to cultural heritage is discussed. Through the identification of the current learning strategy in the case study sites, this research highlights the lack of dissemination of the outcomes of scientific research to managers of cultural heritage in the context of adaptation to climate change impacts.

AB  - Species may differ in the relationship between the numbers of breeding pairs present and woodland area, because the proportion of a wood that forms suitable habitat will vary with woodland size. In this paper, we examine the pattern of variation in abundance with woodland area for eight breeding bird species, and also show how this pattern varied between years. During 1990-1997, we made annual censuses of 53-160 woods, of up to 10 ha in size, and fitted a power function to describe the relationships between numbers of breeding pairs and woodland area. Seven of the sight species, blackbird Turdus merula, dunnock Prunella modularis, wren Troglodytes troglodytes, great tit Purus major, chaffinch Fringilla coelebs, robin Erithacus rubecula and blue tit Purus caerleus showed a pattern of proportionally higher numbers in smaller woods. Only long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus occurred in proportionally higher numbers in larger woods. Blackbird and dunnock showed a trend towards lower numbers in large woods during years with low regional population levels: for these species large woods may provide sub-optimal habitat. Great tit, blue tit, chaffinch and robin showed the opposite trend, towards lower numbers in small woods during years with low regional population levels; for these species small woods may provide sub-optimal habitat. Wren and long-tailed tit, which also showed large annual population fluctuations. showed no change in distribution with regional population level. In great tit and chaffinch, the distribution of pairs in any one year may have been influenced by site fidelity producing a lag in the response associated with regional population levels.

AB  - The effect of landscape composition on the breeding success of vole-eating Tengmalm's owl (Aegolius fimereus) was studied in western Finland at five different spatial scales (250-4000 in) around the nests during two consecutive three-year population cycles of voles. Landscape composition had strongest effects on owl breeding in the decrease phase of vote cycles. Significant variation in owl breeding Occurred along the productivity gradient from farmland predominated areas to barren hinterland. Owls tended to produce earlier clutches on territories predominated by agricultural areas in increasing vote years. A similar trend was observed in the decreasing phase of the vote cycled owls breeding on barren hinterland seemed to delay breeding compared to owls breeding near agricultural areas. Surprisingly. nestling survival and fledgling production in the decreasing phase declined steeply with increasing proportion of farmland. Clutch size was not significantly related to landscape composition. The number of fledglings decreased with increases in clear-cut and sapling areas in the decrease phase. During the declining years of vote abundance nestling survival increased from western farmland areas towards the eastern outlying district. These results indicate sudden summer decline of vote Populations on farmland predominated habitats. This is probably due to that the number of vole-eating predators, and hence their impact on vote populations is apparently higher in farmland areas than on forested hinterland. This finding gives Support for the 'spill-over' hypothesis, which states that predators and their exploitation tends to 'spill over' from luxuriant habitats to the barren habitats.

AB  - The paper investigates the association between tourism firms' imitation strategies and the interfirm network structure in which they are embedded. In particular, it analyzes how imitation contributes to (1) tie formation and (2) clustered structures. It also tests reverse relationships; i.e. how tie formation and clustered structures cause imitation. The paper combines network and survey data within and across nine Norwegian destinations. Estimations with instrumental variables show that imitation is an effect, and probably also a cause, of the network structure. More specifically, clustered structures increase imitation, which increases firms' involvement and tie formation activities with other firms in the interfirm network. The study illustrates how the structure agency duality can be addressed in a tourism destination context.

AB  - The simultaneous control of insect pests and compliance of conservation targets in conifer-dominated forests has intensified public debate about adequate post-disturbance management, particularly in protected areas. Hence, mechanical bark treatments, such as debarking, of disturbance-affected trees have been widely promoted as an on-site method of pest control that accounts for conservation targets because woody biomass is retained. However, the effects of debarking to non-target biodiversity remain unclear. We analyzed data from a two-and-a-half-year field survey of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles and parasitoid wasps in twelve artificial windthrows, created by pulling down mature Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) with winches. Each experimental windthrow comprising one control tree, one completely debarked tree and one bark-scratched tree. Insects were sampled using stem emergence traps. Fruiting bodies of wood-inhabiting fungi, number of wood wasp emergence holes, and number of holes made by foraging woodpeckers were assessed by visual counts. We recorded the amount of time needed to complete debarking by machine, bark-scratching by machine and bark-scratching by chainsaw each on 15 separate trees to estimate the economic costs of mechanical bark treatments.
   Our results revealed that both debarking and bark-scratching significantly decreased numbers of the emerging target pest Ips typographus to in median 4% (debarked) and 11% (scratched bark) of the number of individuals emerging from untreated control trees. Compared to control trees, debarking significantly reduced the species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles, and parasitoid wasps. By contrast, bark-scratching did not reduce the overall species density of wood-inhabiting fungi, saproxylic beetles or parasitoid wasps. The time needed for bark-scratching by machine was significantly lower than debarking, whereas bark-scratching by chainsaw needed a similar amount of time as conventional debarking. However, bark-scratching did have some negative effects in common with debarking, such as the significant reduction of wood wasps emergence holes and the reduction of holes made by foraging woodpeckers. Hence, bark-scratching of downed trees, like debarking, might affect higher trophic levels of biodiversity and should be applied only if pest management is urgently needed. We urge policy makers and natural resource managers to rapidly shift current pest management toward new techniques of bark scratching, particularly in protected areas. Such a shift in post-disturbance pest-control will foster ecosystem integrity at lower economic cost compared to debarking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Early diagnostics and documentation fulfill an essential role for an effective planning of conservation and restoration of cultural heritage assets. In particular, remote sensing techniques that do not require the use of scaffolds or lifts, such as fluoresence lidar, can provide useful information to obtain an overall assessment of the status of the investigated surfaces and can be exploited to address analytical studies in selected areas. Here we present the results of a joint Italian-Swedish project focused on documenting and recording the status of some sections of the part closed to the public by using fluorescence hyperspectral imaging lidar. The lidar used a tripled-frequency Nd:YAG laser emitting at 355 nm as excitation source and an intensified, gated 512x512-pixel CCD as detector. The lidar had imaging capabilities thanks to a computer-controlled scanning mirror. The fluorescence characteristics of fresco wall paintings were compared to those of fresco fragments found at the same archaeological site and separately examined in the lab using FT-IR and Raman techniques for the identification of pigments. The fluorescence lidar was also used to remotely detect the growth of phototrophic biodeteriogens on the walls. The fluorescence lidar data were compared with results from biological sampling, cultivation and laboratory analysis by molecular techniques.

AB  - Simple Summary</p>
   Springtails (Collembola) are organisms which mainly inhabit soil and litter layers but may account for around 25% of the canopy fauna. They can be also found in dead wood, which provides nutrients for these detritivores. The springtail, Tetrodontophora bielanensis, dwells in the litter and upper soil layers. In our research, we were focused on the environmental factors influencing this springtail in forests at the landscape and site level. We found that the springtail was positively influenced by the presence of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and with greater abundance in the south-eastern part of Krkonose (Czech Republic). The negative influence of bark coverage, the presence of fungi, and the positive influence of an increasing circumference of tree was observed at the site level.</p>
   The springtail, Tetrodontophora bielanensis, dwells in the litter and upper soil layers. This arthropod mainly inhabits humid litter and soil and prefers a cold climate. We determined the main factors influencing this springtail in forests at the landscape level in Krkonose and site level in Orlicke hory in the Czech Republic. We used passive trunk-tree traps. These traps are highly effective for sampling flightless fauna. We used 128 traps in Krkonose and 17 traps in Orlicke hory. The springtail was significantly positively influenced by the presence of Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the landscape level. Springtails' abundance was, furthermore, influenced by the spatial distribution of the sampling sites. The negative influence of bark coverage and the presence of fungi, and positive influence of an increasing dimension of trees were significant at the site level. We argue for a more diversified management of mountainous forests with respect to forest history. This appears to be also important for mountainous forests in protected areas.</p>

AB  - The Norwegian aquaculture industry faces pressure from stakeholders, the public, and government to ensure sustainable production. Sustainability is closely linked with solving key environmental challenges. Standards such as those created by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) are universal and generally provide what is known as additionality to state regulation, such as more comprehensive requirements, with the goal of enhancing sustainability. Acquiring certification can be expensive, but it has been shown that the industry spends large amounts of time and resources to voluntarily become ASC certified. In this article, we study the motivations for ASC certification. In line with previous work, we find several motivations for obtaining certification, even though it is no guarantee for financial gains like premium prices or better market access. Still, it may be just as valuable for industry actors to use certification to create room to maneuver so as to be prepared for future market claims, changes in regulations, and increased pressure for more sustainable production. Furthermore, certification is perceived as having the potential to improve producers' and retailers' reputation and standing both locally and globally. Certification and the use of labels can be tools in reputational management. By reducing complexity and uncertainty in communication, certification labelling can help consumers improve their product choices in terms of sustainability. Industry actors in this study express approval of certification and desire the potential reputational gain that comes from it; however, our findings suggest that this potential has not been fully realized. The industry experiences challenges in communicating with the local and global public and lacks influence on what is communicated to consumers through retailers. Therefore, it appears that those actually reaping the potential reputational gains of ASC certification are the non-governmental organizations behind the creation of the ASC and the retailers that demand ASC-certified salmon.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) is a major production tree species for the European wood industry. However, it is highly sensitive to bark stripping (BS) by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), which causes large timber losses. Because the red deer population has increased over the last decades, a better understanding of the underlying causes driving BS is urgently needed. BS outbreaks are multifactorial: winter food shortage, local and regional deer abundance and stand properties (thermal and visual cover, and scarcity of herbaceous layers) have been found to drive BS rates. Although the influence of each of these factors is well studied, there is still no consensus on their relative contributions to BS or what mitigation strategy is best. In this study, we made use of a long-term, large-scale BS inventory (13 years over 2570 km(2)) to fill these gaps. We modeled winter and summer BS rates in response to the most explanatory variables, selected from a large set of environmental variables. Our results highlight the prevalence of deer abundance combined with high sensitivity of coniferous thickets and pronounced habitat selection by deer for these stands. Our findings show that the control of red deer populations is a key measure for reducing BS in Norway spruce stands.

AB  - Oribatid mites (Acari) represent a considerable part of the biodiversity in Fennoscandian forests, but our knowledge about their habitat requirements is limited. We studied 10 Carabodes species in the forest floor of seven coniferous forest types, and in dead fruiting bodies (sporocarps) of 6 species of wood-living polypore fungi in southern Norway. The most common Carabodes species in soil were rare in sporocarps, and vice versa. The density of several ground-living species was significantly influenced by vegetation type and soil type. Carabodes willmanni and C. subarcticus were considered as lichen feeders on the ground, and occurred abundantly in Cladonia-rich pine forests. Three species, C. femoralis, C. areolatus and C. reticulatus, seem to be sporocarp specialists. Their relative numbers were rather similar in dead sporocarps of five different fungal species, including annual and perennial sporocarps, soft and hard. This was in contrast to beetles from the same sporocarps, which in a previous study proved to be strongly host-specific. Although being tolerant to different fungal species, the association of certain Carabodes species to dead sporocarps could make them vulnerable in forests with little dead wood and few sporocarps.

AB  - The paper consists of four main parts. The first part gives an analysis of the sustainable tourism discourse. Two main axes of understanding are presented; intensity problems versus volume problems on one axis, and stationary activities versus mobile activities on the other. The prevailing understanding of the concept of sustainable tourism mostly as a matter of stationary activities and intensity problems raises several issues for further analysis and discussion. One is that there is no tourism without travel and transport - or mobility and mobile activities as are the terms applied. This of course also requires a focus on the mobile activities in tourism, not least as transport is a major cause of the most serious environmental problems, both as intensity and volume problems. The second part of the paper elucidates - with Norway as a case - how transport on the one hand and leisure time activities and tourism on the other have grown like Siamese twins all through modem history. The main aspects in the European discourse on sustainable mobility are presented in the third part. Some of the aspects highlighted are the needs to develop public transport in general and rail transport in particular, thus also tourism based on these transport systems. The last part gives a typology of how sustainable transport may become a road to sustainable tourism, and some examples of how this has been carried out in some European countries.

TI  - Simplified analysis of balancing challenges in sustainable and smart energy systems with 100% renewable power supply
T2  - WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
AB  - In a power system, the basic physical law states that the total production is always exactly the same as total consumption. This physical law is always fulfilled no matter the type of power plants in the power system. In a power system with large shares of solar and wind power, this means that the other power plants have to fill the gap between actual solar plus wind power and the demand during each second/minute/hour. However, if there are large amounts of solar and wind power, then sometimes the available power from solar and wind exceeds the demand. In a future system based on large shares of solar and wind power, all these different situations have to be handled, and the question is how to analyze this. Three different methods concerning how to analyze systems with large shares of solar and wind power will be presented. The methods are applied to a Swedish case with close to 100% renewable power based on hydro, solar, wind and, bio-fuelled combined heat and power (CHP). This study shows that there are limited balancing costs for this case. The costs for curtailment of surplus as well as to keep enough capacity to cover a high load combined with low solar and low wind is comparatively small, below 0.3 Eurocent/kWh. However, more detailed studies are needed to quantify the exact cost under different conditions, but this study indicates the size of the challenges.

AB  - A rich structural diversity in forests promotes biodiversity. Forests are dynamic and therefore it is crucial to consider future structural potential when selecting reserves, to make robust conservation decisions. We analyzed forests in boreal Sweden based on 17,599 National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots with the main aim to understand how effectiveness of reserves depends on the time dimension in the selection process, specifically by considering future structural diversity. In the study both the economic value and future values of 15 structural variables were simulated during a 100 year period. To get a net present structural value (NPSV), a single value covering both current and future values, we used four discounting alternatives: (1) only considering present values, (2) giving equal importance to values in each of the 100 years within the planning horizon, (3) applying an annual discount rate considering the risk that values could be lost, and (4) only considering the values in year 100. The four alternatives were evaluated in a reserve selection model under budget-constrained and area-constrained selections. When selecting young forests higher structural richness could be reached at a quarter of the cost over almost twice the area in a budget-constrained selection compared to an area-constrained selection. Our results point to the importance of considering future structural diversity in the selection of forest reserves and not as is done currently to base the selection on existing values. Targeting future values increases structural diversity and implies a relatively lower cost. Further, our results show that a re-orientation from old to young forests would imply savings while offering a more extensive reserve network with high structural qualities in the future. However, caution must be raised against a drastic reorientation of the current old-forest strategy since remnants of ancient forests will need to be prioritized due to their role for disturbance-sensitive species.

TI  - Christianization and state formation in early medieval Norway
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - The article deals with problems and directions If research in the study of the Christianization of Norway. While scholars from the 19th century onwards larger accepted the sagas' account of the Christianization as the work Of two missionary kings in the late tenth and early 11th century, the recent trend has been in the direction of a long and gradual process of Christianization, starting in the late ninth or early tenth century. This interpretation seems to regard the Christianization as the direct consequence Of increasing contact with the new religion, thus neglecting the question of why the conversion took place. The present contribution directly addresses this question. It emphasizes the political aspect of the conversion and the importance of the Viking kings coming from abroad for giving Christianity the religious monopoly. Further, it suggests three lines of investigation for future research: (i) a thorough examination of the rich archaeological material, (ii) a comparison with the whole area of Northern and East Central Europe that was included in Western Christendom in the tenth and 11th centuries, and (iii) a focus not only on the conversion period, but on the gradual penetration of Christianity in the following period and its consequences for state formation, the development Of society, and cultural and ideological transformation.

AB  - Background: The development of knowledge for health promotion requires an effective mechanism for collaboration between academics, practitioners, and policymakers. The challenge is better to understand the dynamic and ever-changing context of the researcher-practitioner-policymaker-community relationship. Aims: The aims were to explore the factors that foster Academic Practice Policy (APP) partnerships, and to systematically and transparently to review three cases. Methods: Three partnerships were included: Power and Commitment-Alcohol and Drug Prevention by Non-Governmental Organizations in Sweden; Healthy City-Social Inclusion, Urban Governance, and Sustainable Welfare Development; and Empowering Families with Teenagers-Ideals and Reality in Karlskoga and Degerfors. The analysis includes searching for evidence for three hypotheses concerning contextual factors in multi-stakeholder collaboration, and the cumulative effects of partnership synergy. Results: APP partnerships emerge during different phases of research and development. Contextual factors are important; researchers need to be trusted by practitioners and politicians. During planning, it is important to involve the relevant partners. During the implementation phase, time is important. During data collection and capacity building, it is important to have shared objectives for and dialogues about research. Finally, dissemination needs to be integrated into any partnership. The links between process and outcomes in participatory research (PR) can be described by the theory of partnership synergy, which includes consideration of how PR can ensure culturally and logistically appropriate research, enhance recruitment capacity, and generate professional capacity and competence in stakeholder groups. Moreover, there are PR synergies over time. Conclusions: The fundamentals of a genuine partnership are communication, collaboration, shared visions, and willingness of all stakeholders to learn from one another.

AB  - Concern for a diminished human experience of nature and subsequent decreased human well-being is addressed via a consideration of green infrastructure's potential to facilitate unplanned or incidental nature experience. Incidental nature experience is conceptualized and illustrated in order to consider this seldom addressed aspect of human interaction with nature in green infrastructure planning. Special attention has been paid to the ability of incidental nature experience to redirect attention from a primary activity toward an unplanned focus (in this case, nature phenomena). The value of such experience for human well-being is considered. The role of green infrastructure to provide the opportunity for incidental nature experience may serve as a nudge or guide toward meaningful interaction. These ideas are explored using examples of green infrastructure design in two Nordic municipalities: Kristianstad, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark. The outcome of the case study analysis coupled with the review of literature is a set of sample recommendations for how green infrastructure can be designed to support a range of incidental nature experiences with the potential to support human well-being.

AB  - Nutrient losses from arable land are important contributors to eutrophication of surface waters, and phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) usually act together to regulate production of Cyanobacteria. Concentrations and losses of both nutrients in drainage water from pipe drains were studied and compared in 15 crop rotations on a clay soil in southwest Sweden. Special emphasis was placed on P and it was possible to evaluate critical components of the crop rotations by flow-proportional water sampling. Total P concentrations in drainage water were generally small (0.04-0.18 mg L-1), but during two wetter years out of six, high P concentrations were measured following certain management practices, including ploughing-in lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and fertilizing in advance without incorporation into the soil to meet the needs of several subsequent crops. This resulted in average flow-weighted concentrations of total P between 0.3 and 0.7 mg L-1. In crop rotations containing green manures, green fallow or leguminous leys, there was also a risk for increased P losses after these crops were ploughed in. The losses increased in the order: cash crops < dairy with grass < dairy with lucerne < monoculture with barley < organic farming with cattle slurry < stockless organic farming with green manure. P balances varied between -9 and +8 kg P ha(-1) and N balances between +4 and +35 kg N ha(-1). The balances were not related to actual leaching losses. Phosphorus losses in drainage from set-aside were 67-82% of those from cash crops grown in ploughed and P-fertilized soil at the same site, indicating a high background P loss from this clay soil.

AB  - Background: Developed in Norway, Sisom is an interactive, rigorously tested, computerized, communication tool designed to help children with cancer express their perceived symptoms/problems. Children travel virtually from island to island rating their symptoms/problems. While Sisom has been found to significantly improve communication in patient consultations in Norway, usability testing is warranted with US children prior to further use in research studies. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the usability of Sisom in a sample of English-and Spanish-speaking children in an urban US community. Methods: A mixed-methods usability study was conducted with a purposive sample of healthy children and children with cancer. Semistructured interviews were used to assess healthy children's symptom recognition. Children with cancer completed 8 usability tasks captured with Morae 3.3 software. Data were downloaded, transcribed, and analyzed descriptively. Results: Four healthy children and 8 children with cancer participated. Of the 44 symptoms assessed, healthy children recognized 15 (34%) pictorial symptoms immediately or indicated 13 (30%) pictures were good representations of the symptom. Six children with cancer completed all tasks. All children navigated successfully from one island to the next, ranking their symptom/problem severity, clicking the magnifying glass for help, or asking the researcher for assistance. All children were satisfied with the aesthetics and expressed an interest in using Sisom to communicate their symptoms/problems. Conclusions: A few minor suggestions for improvement and adjustment may optimize the use of Sisom for US children. Implications for Practice: Sisom may help clinicians overcome challenges assessing children's complex symptoms/problems in a child-friendly manner.

AB  - Service industries as tourism, cultural industries, finance, and retail are considered as under-represented in the trade and industry portfolio. This paper centres on the tourism industry and pay particular attention to Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). The purpose of the project was to identify SMEs' need for research-based knowledge, relevant topics, and to prioritize R&D ideas suitable for innovation and/or as a cooperation between academic and industry partners. Three virtual workshops were arranged in the period May - September 2020. All participants represented Norwegian destination associations, regional businesses, and SMEs. As a result of reflections in groups and plenary, specific tourism challenges and knowledge needs were identified. The tourism industry is characterized by many small businesses with few employees, tight finances, and limited resources for development. Challenges are related to seasonal employment, high workforce turnover, lack of strategically market insight, and limited ability to exploit new technology. Businesses are generally vulnerable to changes in demand from the market, which was reinforced by the outbreak of COVID-19. Three topics were emphasised for developing mutual project concepts and joint applications as a collaboration between the industry and scientific partners: (1) Partnership collaboration, (2) Virtual Tourism, and (3) All-Year Destinations. This paper discusses potential theoretical perspectives and empirical approaches for creation of future joint innovations and studies . Discussions are related to: How suitable are virtual workshops for joint reflection on common challenges and cocreation of prioritized actions? Which challenges and needs are tourism confronted with? What should the tourist industry emphasise in face of the Covidl9 pandemic? An additional result of the workshops is the establishment of a tourism network among the participants, and with an intention to incorporate even more relevant actors. Further, the project has been significant for developing a program for SMB innovations, including both the service industries and additional sectors.

AB  - BackgroundEstablished in 1992, the Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders (The Network) is a clinical research collaboration of specialist mental health and addiction services in Norway. Its primary focus is to facilitate systematic and relevant clinical assessment for patients with personality disorder and evaluate progress in psychotherapeutic treatment. However, large-scale data registers for personality disorder are still unique. This article presents the circumstances that led to the establishment of the Network, and its development and challenges in many areas, and through various phases.MethodsIn the following, we will outline how this close interaction between researchers, clinicians, and well-adapted systems has facilitated cooperation and clinical research. We will highlight some key factors that have been decisive during the network's development, and not least for further adaptation and existence.ResultsThrough 30 years, the Network has succeeded in establishing a large and sustainable clinical research collaboration with a persistent focus on personality disorder and psychotherapeutic treatment. The collaboration has resulted in a broad range of scientific contributions to the understanding of personality disorder, assessment and measurement methods, treatment alliance, clinical outcomes, service utilization, and costs. In addition, The Network has also resulted in a number of synergy effects that have benefited clinicians, patients, and researchers.ConclusionsThe Norwegian Network for Personality Disorders has become an acknowledged institution in the field. Many aspects of its development, organization, maintenance, and solutions to challenges may be relevant to others who plan to establish, maintain, or further develop similar collaborations.

AB  - Reducing or altering meat consumption has the potential to significantly lower the impact humans have on climate change. Consumers, however, are unlikely to break their food habits unless they are aware of the problem and motivated by the solutions. Fear appeals are often used to overcome this, however, their effectiveness in the context of meat reduction and climate change is unclear. Given the widespread use of fear appeals in information policy, it is important to understand more. The aim of this study was to explore fear or more specifically the danger control process in a climate change food context in order to understand the factors which motivate consumers to reduce or alter their meat consumption. Using a stratified random sample of 222 respondents in Southern Sweden, we develop a model for predicting intentions to adopt specific and general actions to reduce or alter meat consumption. Our results suggest that the general key to motivating consumers is through increasing their self-efficacy towards adopting meat alternatives and educating them on the importance their actions have in reducing the threat. We also found that appraising the threat to self (or those close) was significant, but surprisingly the effect size was greater when the threat concerned others (e.g. others in impoverished nations, animals).

AB  - Environmental and climatic changes are inducing population declines in numerous species. However, certain species demonstrate remarkable resilience, exhibiting both population growth and range expansion. This longitudinal study in Sweden carried out over two decades (2004-2023) examines the noctuid moths Mythimna albipuncta and Hoplodrina ambigua. Abundance and phenology data were gathered from three light traps in southeastern Sweden and integrated with distribution and phenology data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. In M. albipuncta, the distribution area expanded from 7 to 76 occupied grids (60 km2) and the abundance increased from 7 to 6136 individuals, while in H. ambigua, the distribution area expanded from 1 to 87 occupied grids and the abundance increased from 0 to 6937 individuals, during the course of the study. Furthermore, a positive yearly association was observed between the number of occupied grids and light trap abundance for each species. We also found significant extensions in the adult flight periods of more than 100 days in both species. Light traps emerged as an effective monitoring tool, with light trap abundance as a reliable proxy for distribution changes. Our findings demonstrate that the studied species cope very well with environmental and climatic changes. Given their role as dominant links between primary producers and higher trophic levels, abundance and distribution shifts of these ecological engineers have the potential to cascade up and down in the ecosystem.

AB  - The four native Missouri taxa of Echinacea were used as a model to test the predictive value of herbarium data with regard to present-day distribution. Specimens with label data considered potentially adequate to relocate the population were databased and the sites in question were visited. Most of the historical populations were not relocated, although a greater percentage of those collected post-1980 were found to still exist. Time since collection significantly affected the probability of relocation of E. purpurea and E. pallida var. pallida, the two native taxa commonly harvested for medicinal products. The collection rate for E. pallida var. pallida remained high over time. However, the collection rate for E. purpurea has been much reduced in recent decades. Few of the historical populations were relocated, and located populations on unprotected public land were very small, perhaps indicating that habitat loss or human activity is causing a decline in Missouri populations of E. purpurea.

AB  - Harbor-estuaries are complex sedimentary environments where both natural and anthropogenic processes influence the distribution and accumulation of sediments, which in turn is of importance for maintenance dredging and pollution control. This paper uses sediment characteristics from the Gota alv estuary, Sweden to evaluate the natural estuarine processes that persist despite the extensive human impact on the estuary and to separate and characterize depositional subenvironments. The most important harbor processes include maintenance dredging and turbulence from ship traffic, and their influence upon shallow stratigraphy and sediment distribution and deposition is significant. Polymodal particle-size distributions are interpreted to reflect the natural estuarine transport processes. Suspension transport is generally predominant, except in the river and inner harbor where bottom transport and selective deposition of sand occur, Particle-size characteristics divide the estuary into four depositional areas: the river and the inner, middle, and outer harbor. The shallow stratigraphy reveals a hiatus between the firm silty clays and the loose recent sediments. The hiatus in the stratigraphy is probably related to dredging in most areas of the harbor. Significant maintenance dredging and turbulence from ship traffic also influence the accumulation (0-61 cm) of recent sediments, during the 20th century.

AB  - BackgroundDecisions about appropriate treatment at the end of life are common in modern healthcare. Non-treatment decisions (NTDs), comprising both withdrawal and withholding of (potentially) life-prolonging treatment are in principle accepted in Norway. However, in practice they may give rise to significant moral problems for health professionals, patients and next of kin. Here, patient values must be considered. It is relevant to study the moral views and intuitions of the general population on NTDs and special areas of contention such as the role of next of kin in decision-making.MethodsElectronic survey to members of a nationally representative panel of Norwegian adults. Respondents were presented with vignettes describing patients with disorders of consciousness, dementia, and cancer where patient preferences varied. Respondents answered ten questions about the acceptability of non-treatment decision making and the role of next of kin.ResultsWe received 1035 complete responses (response rate 40.7%). A large majority, 88%, supported the right of competent patients to refuse treatment in general. When an NTD was in line with the patient's previously expressed preferences, more respondents tended to find NTDs acceptable. More respondents would accept NTDs for themselves than for the vignette patients. In a scenario with an incompetent patient, clear majorities wanted the views of next of kin to be given some but not decisive weight, and more weight if concordant with the patient's wishes. There were, however, large variations in the respondents' views.ConclusionThis survey of a representative sample of the Norwegian adult population indicates that attitudes to NTDs are often in line with national laws and guidelines. However, the high variance among the respondents and relatively large weight given to next of kin's views, indicate a need for appropriate dialogue among all stakeholders to prevent conflicts and extra burdens. Furthermore, the emphasis given to previously expressed opinions indicates that advance care planning may increase the legitimacy of NTDs and prevent challenging decision-making processes.

AB  - In recent decades there has been steady reduction in the rate of increase in cereal yields worldwide. This paper aims to (1) characterise the changes in yield trends of spring (barley, oat and wheat) and winter cereals (rye and wheat) grown in Finland and (2) distinguish between plant breeding achievements and other potential contributors to changes in national yield trends and differences among crops. In this work we used long-term datasets from FAO (FAOSTAT, 2007) (1960-2005) and results from multi-location MTT Official Variety Trials (1970-2005). A mixed model technique was used to divide the yield trends in variety trials into two components: genetic improvements and environmental changes. All trends were characterised using 5 years moving averages. The study period was divided into three agronomically relevant sub-periods: (1) in 1960-1980 agriculture was mechanised and improved basic agricultural practices largely introduced, (2) in 1981-1994 intensified crop management practices were increasingly applied and (3) in 1995-2005 Finland had joined the European Union, which resulted in altered agricultural policies and markets. Plant breeding has successfully increased genetic yield potential of all cereal crops without any indication of reduced rates of improvement. Since 1995 the Finnish national yield trends declined for all crops except wheat, for which the trend levelled-off. The main reasons for this are: cereal production has become less intensive because of (1) application of an environmental programme aimed at increasing the sustainability of agriculture by reducing the environmental load it represents and (2) markedly decreased economic incentives to produce intensively as producer prices for cereals decreased and input prices remained unchanged. National yield trends did not decline because of lack of genetic improvement in yield potential. It is likely that future cereals yield trends will again respond to increasing demand for food, feed, biofuel production and global climate change. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The hypoxic zone in the Baltic Sea has increased in area about four times since 1960 and widespread oxygen deficiency has severely reduced macro benthic communities below the halocline in the Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland, which in turn has affected food chain dynamics, fish habitats and fisheries in the entire Baltic Sea. The cause of increased hypoxia is believed to be enhanced eutrophication through increased anthropogenic input of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. However, the spatial variability of hypoxia on long time-scales is poorly known: and so are the driving mechanisms. We review the occurrence of hypoxia in modern time (last c. 50 years), modern historical time (AD 1950-1800) and during the more distant past (the last c. 10 000 years) and explore the role of climate variability, environmental change and human impact. We present a compilation of proxy records of hypoxia (laminated sediments) based on long sediment cores from the Baltic Sea. The cumulated results show that the deeper depressions of the Baltic Sea have experienced intermittent hypoxia during most of the Holocene and that regular laminations started to form c. 8500-7800 cal. yr BP ago, in association with the formation of a permanent halocline at the transition between the Early Littorina Sea and the Littorina Sea s. str. Laminated sediments were deposited during three main periods (i.e. between c. 8000-4000,2000-800 cal. yr BP and subsequent to AD 1800) which overlap the Holocene Thermal Maximum (c. 9000-5000 cal. yr BP), the Medieval Warm Period (c. AD 750-1200) and the modern historical period (AD 1800 to present) and coincide with intervals of high surface salinity (at least during the Littorina s. str.) and high total organic carbon content. This study implies that there may be a correlation between climate variability in the past and the state of the marine environment, where milder and dryer periods with less freshwater run-off correspond to increased salinities and higher accumulation of organic carbon resulting in amplified hypoxia and enlarged distribution of laminated sediments. We suggest that hydrology changes in the drainage area on long time-scales have, as well as the inflow of saltier North Sea waters, controlled the deep oxic conditions in the Baltic Sea and that such changes have followed the general Holocene climate development in Northwest Europe. Increased hypoxia during the Medieval Warm Period also correlates with large-scale changes in land use that occurred in much of the Baltic Sea watershed during the early-medieval expansion. We suggest that hypoxia during this period in the Baltic Sea was not only caused by climate, but increased human impact was most likely an additional trigger. Large areas of the Baltic Sea have experienced intermittent hypoxic from at least AD 1900 with laminated sediments present in the Gotland Basin in the Baltic Proper since then and up to present time. This period coincides with the industrial revolution in Northwestern Europe which started around AD 1850, when population grew. cutting of drainage ditches intensified, and agricultural and forest industry expanded extensively.

AB  - Understanding how populations are structured in space and time is a central question in evolutionary biology. Parasites and their hosts are assumed to evolve together, however, detailed understanding of mechanisms leading to genetic structuring of parasites and their hosts are lacking. As a parasite depends on its host, studying the genetic structure of both parasite and host can reveal important insights into these mechanisms. Here, genetic structure of the monogenean parasiteGyrodactylus thymalliand its host the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) was investigated in 10 tributaries draining into the large Lake Mjosa in Norway. The population genetic structure of spawning grayling was studied using microsatellite genotyping, whileG. thymalliwas studied by sequencing a mitochondrial DNA gene (dehydrogenase subunit 5). Two main genetic clusters were revealed in grayling, one cluster comprising grayling from the largest spawning population, while the remaining tributaries formed the second cluster. For both taxa, some genetic differentiation was observed among tributaries, but there was no clear isolation-by-distance signature. The structuring was stronger for the host than for the parasite. These results imply that moderate to high levels of gene flow occur among the sub-populations of both taxa. The high parasite exchange among tributaries could result from a lack of strong homing behavior in grayling as well as interactions among individual fish outside of the spawning season, leading to frequent mixing of both host and parasite.

AB  - The 100th anniversary of the Finnish Civil War has made questions about the construction of its heritage and cultural memory topical. Taking the concept of dissonant heritage as a starting point, the paper looks at two monuments in the City of Tampere and their reception and landscape, focusing on recent decades. War monuments are always understood within the framework of current politics, but they are also in continuous dialogue with their physical surroundings and, thus, shape and are shaped by their landscape. In this paper, we look at the statues as arenas for politics of history and cultural memory, and the changes and continuums they carry with them. Monuments are at the core of urban public space and the processes of placemaking. Even when they are distanced from the historical events, they represent and remind us of the historical and political nature of public space.

AB  - One achievement of the UK Land-Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) was to link dynamic biogeochemical models of different domains, e.g. rivers, estuaries and coastal waters, and to use the linked model to investigate possible changes from the current status that might occur in the future, for example as the result of climate change. The Climate, Hydrochemistry and Economics of Surface-water Systems (CHESS) project has taken the LOIS methodology forward by exploring possible impacts of climate change on the water quality of European rivers, with the purpose of informing future catchment management. This was achieved by the application of a standard modelling framework to a set of five European catchments located in Finland (River Vantaa), United Kingdom (Yorkshire Ouse), Belgium (Dender), Italy (Enza) and Greece (Pinios). Baseline conditions were simulated using existing meteorological data from the period 1961-1990, and in all cases the modelling framework was able to reproduce key features of the flow and water quality regimes of the study catchments. The modelling framework comprised two models. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate water and chemical fluxes, primarily nutrients and sediment, generated from diffuse areas and thereby provide sub-catchment inputs to an in-stream water quality model, the Quality Evaluation and Simulation Tool for River Systems (QUESTOR). QUESTOR integrated the diffuse runoff along the channel network, together with point source discharges from industry and sewage treatment works, and water abstractions for public supply, industry and agriculture. The modelling framework has been used for the baseline conditions, along with a set of six climate scenarios. These comprised four scenarios derived from different general circulation models (GCMs) representing the 2050s, and three scenarios from the same GCM representing the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, with one scenario in both groups. Results have been explored using a range of measures to reflect the different stakeholder interests within and beyond the catchment. The results reflect the variability in present day conditions (e.g. climate, soils, agriculture and industry), and the variability in the climate scenarios, both between-catchment and between-scenario. Specific examples are: the loss of the spring snowmelt causing high flows on the Vantaa; a decrease in the already very low summer flows on the Pinios; and significant seasonal changes in nutrient losses, even though the annual change is small.

AB  - The native reserves of phosphorus (P) in Finnish soils are sizeable but poorly available to plants. The P status has been generally poor, but large rates of P applied since the 1940s have substantially enhanced the supply of P from the soil. As a means of optimising P fertilisation of crops grown in the improved soils and promoting agro-environmental sustainability of agriculture, long-term field experiments were established in 1977-1981 on various soil types around Finland, between the latitudes of 60 and 65 N. The experimental sites (8 Cambisols, 9 Regosols, 6 Histosols, 1 Podsol) were moderately acidic (pH(w) 5.6, range 4.6-6.6) and contained 1.6-31.2% organic C, and (mineral soils) 3-74% clay. The concentration of total P was 1.22 (0.66-1.87) g kg(-1), and the inorganic fraction separated with fluoride and hydroxide extractions (AI,Fe-P) was 8.2% (4.5-12.4%) of oxalate extractable Al+Fe (P saturation index). In mineral topsoil the pool of AI,Fe-P was 850 kg ha(-1), which is 300 kg ha(-1) larger than was obtained in the early 1960s and 600 kg ha(-1) larger than found in virgin soils. The soil test P value was 13.1 (3.7-60) mg dm(-3) by the acid ammonium acetate method, 11.5 (1.6-42) mg dm(-3) by a water extraction method (1:60 v/v) and 61 (23-131) mg kg(-1) with a modified Olsen method. The intensity factor of soil P status has remained at a relatively low level in a major part of the cultivated area.

AB  - This study examines the occurrence of saproxylic beetles in woodlands of different size and age and their potential to leave woodland areas and cross open grassland in northern Germany. The beetles were recorded by emergence traps and flight-intercept-traps. The investigated sites were dominated by beech, oak and alder, but other tree species also occurred in low abundance. Species richness showed a positive relation to stand size and age of woods. Both total and rarefaction species richness were the lowest in small and young woods and highest in old and large woods. Species richness decreased asymptotically from the inner-wood habitat to a distance greater than 80 m from the wood margin. 80 species were classified into 46 low mobile species found at a distance < 30 m from wood margins and 34 high mobile species found > 30 m from wood margins. The most mobile species were found the most frequently in all woods; but they contributed less to species richness in wood stands than did the species with low mobility. The contribution of the least mobile species to species richness in wood stands increased with the age and size of the stands, with the effect of stand size being the greater. We conclude that in our study region woods larger than 100 ha are necessary to maintain the highest richness of the least mobile saproxylic beetles.

AB  - Agricultural industrialisation and globalisation have steadily increased the transportation of food across the world. In efforts to promote sustainability and self-sufficiency, organic milk producers in Sweden are required to produce a higher level of cattle feed on-farm in the hope that increased self-sufficiency will reduce reliance on external inputs and reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions. Using data collected from 20 conventional and 20 organic milk producers in Sweden this paper aims to assess the global warming impact of farmyard vehicles and the transportation of feed produced 'off-farm' in order to compare the impact of vehicle-related emissions from the different production methods. The findings show organic and conventional production methods have different vehicle-related emission outputs that vary according to a reliance on either road transportation or increased farmyard machinery use. Mechanical weeding is more fuel demanding than conventional agrichemical sprayers. However, artificial fertilising is one of the highest farmyard vehicle-related emitters. The general findings show organic milk production emits higher levels of farm vehicle-related emissions that fail to be offset by reduced emissions occurring from international transport emissions. This paper does not propose to cover a comprehensive supply chain carbon footprint for milk production or attempt to determine which method of production has the largest climatic impact. However, it does demonstrate that Sweden's legal requirements for organic producers to produce more feed on-farm to reduce transport emissions have brought emissions back within Sweden's greenhouse gas inventory and raises questions around the effectiveness of policies to reduce vehicle-related emissions. Further research is needed into the effectiveness of climate change mitigation on food production policies, in particular looking at various trade-offs that affects the entire food supply chain.

AB  - What are the obstetric and neonatal outcomes of deliveries after oocyte donation (OD) in women with Turner syndrome (TS)?
   Pregnancies among women with TS carry a substantial risk, particularly for hypertensive disorders. Potentially life-threatening complications occurred in 3.3 of pregnancies. The neonatal outcomes were generally reassuring, with similar rates of preterm birth and low birthweight (LBW) as after conventional IVF and better than previously reported in deliveries after OD in women with TS.
   OD pregnancies in women with TS are known to be high-risk pregnancies.
   This retrospective cohort study included 106 women with TS who delivered after OD (n 122 deliveries, n 131 newborns) in three Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, Sweden) between 1992 and 2011.
   Women with TS who delivered after OD in three Nordic countries were identified (n 110). Four women declined to participate or were lost to follow-up, thus 106 women were included in the study. The medical data from fertility clinics, antenatal clinics and the hospitals where the women had been treated and/or delivered were scrutinized.
   In this cohort, the karyotype was 45,X in 44 of the women with TS. Ten women (9.4) had a known cardiac defect before pregnancy. Single embryo transfer was performed in 70.3 of the cases and the multiple birth rate was 7.4. In total, 35.0 of the pregnancies were associated with a hypertensive disorder including pre-eclampsia in 20.5. Potentially life-threatening complications occurred in four pregnancies (3.3), including one woman with aortic dissection, one with mild regurgitation of the tricuspid and mitral valve, one with a mechanical heart valve who developed HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) and one who underwent a post-partum hysterectomy due to severe haemorrhaging. Neonatal outcomes were reassuring, with a preterm birth rate of 8.0 and LBW rate of 8.8 in singletons. Major birth defects were found in 3.8 of the children. The perinatal mortality was 2.3 (3/131), including a set of extremely preterm twins.
   Although this study was performed over a period of almost 20 years in three different countries, with a low drop-out rate and little missing data, much larger series are needed to assess rare events. This study also lacks an appropriate control group.
   This study suggests that cardiovascular evaluation before and during pregnancy may contribute to favourable obstetric outcomes in many cases. Maternal outcomes were in agreement with the literature while neonatal outcomes were generally better than previously reported. The outcomes were consistent across the three countries, supporting generalizability to similar populations.
   No conflict of interest was reported. The study was supported by grants from the Gothenburg Medical Society, the Medical Care Executive Board of the Region Vstra Gtaland, grants from the ALF agreement at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital, the Hjalmar Svensson foundation, NFOG Nordic Fund, the Finnish Society of Paediatric and Adolescent Gynecology and Liv och hlsa Foundation in Finland.

AB  - The fact that indigenous minorities have little contact with the rest of the world has a negative impact on development of local territories of any state. Most countries with the territories of traditional wildlife management face problems of indigenous minorities' social security and their national and cultural features preservation. In Russia, the USA, Norway, indigenous minorities have the rights to preserve and maintain cultural foundations, to use lands of traditional residing and to receive additional financial aid. But the conducted research has revealed that most legislative initiatives are formal and little adapted to real life. One of the specific features concerning indigenous minorities' residing in the territories of traditional wildlife management is their geographical location, which is the reason for various economic and legal problems.
   The current situation has to be drastically changed; we can adopt practices of the developed countries concerning issues of preserving territories of indigenous minorities' traditional wildlife management and traditional way of life. (C) 2017 Published by Future Academy

AB  - We conducted three-visit surveys of 1-km(2) plots and traditional Finnish single-visit line transects (considering only the 50 m wide main belt) to evaluate these methods in censusing of a predetermined set of 23 target species known to prefer old forests in three regions in Finland. The efficiency of the two methods was compared on the basis of the number of territories recorded per hour. An attempt was made to find indicators of the occurrence of suitable habitats for species preferring old forest in general, including the rarest ones, and so also largely indicating total diversity of forest bird fauna of the study area. The total number of pairs observed per hour and the abundance of sedentary bird species were significantly higher in the square surveys than in the main belt of the line transects. There were significant positive relationships between the densities of relatively abundant (density > 1.0 pairs km(-2)) and less abundant target species. There emerged five common forest bird species that seemed to form a suitable set of indicators of the occurrence of habitats for birds preferring old forest in the northern boreal zone: Great Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos major, Mistle Thrush Turdus viscivorus, Willow Tit Parus montanus, Eurasian Treecreeper Certhia familiaris, and Eurasian Bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula. We concluded that sedentary species preferring old forest are good candidates for indicators to characterize some threatened aspects of forest bird diversity.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
KW  - NHS
AB  - Sweden was an important pioneer of market-oriented reform in publicly funded healthcare systems. Yet by the mid-1990s the county councils, which fund and manage most health-care, had substantially scaled back reforms based on provider competition while continuing to constrain health budgets. As policy makers faced new issues, they turned increasingly to longer-term and more cooperative contracts to define relations between hospitals and the county councils. Growing regionalization of government and hospital mergers further reconfigured acute care and limited opportunities for competition between hospitals. We seek to explain this reorientation of market-oriented reforms between 1989 and 1996 in terms of shifts in the positions taken by powerful policy actors, and in particular by county council politicians. During this period, elections moved liberal and conservative politicians, who were the most enthusiastic supporters of market-oriented reform, in and out of control of most county governments. Meanwhile many Social Democratic politicians gradually turned from initial support of competitive reform toward opposition. Politicians and county administrators from all parties were particularly concerned about controlling health expenditures during a period of recession. In addition, the public, politicians in the counties and municipalities, and health professionals resisted steps that threatened health sector employment and would have allowed market mechanisms, rather than governments, to determine the prices and distribution of health services. During the years under study Sweden's market-oriented reforms followed a course of development similar to that taken by other management and policy fashions (Abrahamson E. Management fashion, Academy of Management Review 1996,21: 254-85). At first the reforms enjoyed uncritical support by a broad spectrum of stakeholders. Gradually participants in the reform process recognized inherent tensions among the goals of the reform, conflicts between reform programs and fundamental social and political values, unrealistic assumptions about the effects of competition. technical and organizational obstacles to implementation, and threats to interest groups. Since 1998, there have been indications that Sweden may be entering yet another stage of experimentation with market-oriented reform. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on the evaluation of large-scale public-sector reforms is rare. This article sets out to fill that gap in the evaluation literature and argues that it is of vital importance since the impact of such reforms is considerable and they change the context in which evaluations of other and more delimited policy areas take place. In our analysis, we apply four governance perspectives (rational-instrumental perspective, rational interest-based perspective, institutional-cultural perspective, and chaos perspective) in a comparative analysis of the evaluations of two large-scale public-sector reforms in Denmark and Norway. We compare the evaluation process (focus and purpose), the evaluators, and the organization of the evaluation, as well as the utilization of the evaluation results. The analysis uncovers several significant findings including how the initial organization of the evaluation shows strong impact on the utilization of the evaluation and how evaluators can approach the challenges of evaluating large-scale reforms.

AB  - Species from the steppe region of Eastern Europe likely colonized northwestern Europe in connection with agriculture after 6500 BP. The striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius Pallas, 1783), is a steppe-derived species often found in human crops. It is common on the southern Danish islands of Lolland and Falster, which have been isolated from mainland Europe since approximately 10300-8000 BP. Thus, this species could have been brought in with humans in connection with agriculture, or it could be an earlier natural invader. We sequenced 86 full mitochondrial genomes from the northwestern range of the striped field mouse, analysed phylogenetic relationships and estimated divergence time. The results supported human-induced colonization of Denmark in the Subatlantic or Subboreal period. A newly discovered population from Central Jutland in Denmark diverged from Falster approximately 100-670 years ago, again favouring human introduction. One individual from Sweden turned out to be a recent introduction from Central Jutland.

TI  - Findings from the International Scan on Managing Pavements and Monitoring Performance
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Nine pavement and asset managers from the United States participated in the International Scan on Managing Pavements and Monitoring Performance. The scan team sought input on processes for implementing sustainable performance-based programs; effective communication methods for garnering upper management and legislative support; agency cultures that support performance-based programs; and techniques, tools, analyses, and reporting that support performance-based management. The team traveled to New Zealand, Australia, Sweden, the Netherlands, and England and gathered information from 14 agencies. The agencies selected for consultation had experience with managing their pavement networks under constrained budgets. Although the initial focus of the scan was on pavement management, the team found that some of the agencies conducted pavement management within an asset management framework. The findings are thus equally applicable to assets other than pavements. The key findings are (a) agency culture supports a long-term view toward managing pavements, (b) elected officials understand their responsibilities as stewards of public funds, (c) the road network is managed as a service provided to the traveling public, (d) agency priorities are known and agency personnel are held accountable for their actions, (e) the agencies recognize the importance of building internal capacity and capabilities, and (f) efficiency and value drive program delivery approaches. The scan team selected four implementation strategies for moving scan findings into practice: communicating scan findings, developing guidelines for asset management plans and long-term financial plans, encouraging use of recurring program assessments, and developing agency capabilities in the areas of engineering, contract administration, economics, and accounting.

AB  - The preference for coastal habitats makes the harbour porpoise, Phocoena phocoena, vulnerable to fisheries conflicts and hence prone to die due to entangling in fishing nets. An opportunistic sampling of such casualties (134 individuals) in Norwegian waters was used to assess the genetic population structure of the species by SNP-genotyping at 78 loci. The results of genetic clustering obtained for these individuals failed to identify more than one genetic group. Likewise, the individually-based F did not meet an Isolation-by-Distance pattern, thus supporting the conclusion that harbour porpoise in Norway probably belongs to a single genetic group or population.

AB  - Many European-breeding bird species wintering south of the Sahel region in Africa have been reported to be in decline since the 1970s. However, most studies focus on conditions local to the breeding sites as determinants of population change, despite the potential influence on populations during migration and over-wintering. To investigate the relative importance of climate at the breeding site and during migration and overwintering periods, we studied a Fennoscandian Willow Warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus) population that has been monitored in its subalpine breeding grounds in Norway over the last 45 years (1967-2011). The long-term trend for our population follows a quadratic trend, showing a marked period of decline after the late 1960s, followed by some increase during the last two decades. The most parsimonious model of the annual change in the Willow Warbler population is obtained by combining the mean June temperature and the Sahel spring index. The annual rate of change in the Willow Warbler population was positively related to summer temperatures on the breeding grounds and positively related to Sahel precipitation, although the statistical support is not very strong. Our study shows that climatic conditions at different stages of the annual cycle have influence on the population change. However, the on-going habitat changes in tropical Africa most likely have negatively affected on the overall population size of the Willow Warbler. This habitat loss may prevent many long-distance migratory bird species from returning to their former population peaks, even though the impact from the recent Sahelian drought may have culminated.

AB  - Modern forestry has been evolving towards multiple-use of forests and maintenance of biodiversity. Interest in integrating natural forest dynamics into management planning and silvicultural practices has increased as a result of concerns related to biodiversity values and maintaining ecological functions in managed forests. Taking advantage of naturally formed advance regeneration to create a new forest is one way of emulating natural forest dynamics, especially in spruce forests. However, efficient use of advance regeneration requires knowledge about factors influencing their performance. Light is important for growth and for crown, shoot and needle morphology of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Crown morphology varies from a conical and deep crown form in relatively high-light environments to the typical "umbrella" form in the understorey shade. Shoots and needles developed in shade are flatter and experience less self-shading than those developed in more light. Needle orientation is horizontal in shade and more vertically inclined in light. The number of nodal and internodal branches increases with increasing light. Tree shoot characteristics are strongly correlated and highly dependent on growing conditions, particularly light. There is a correlation between shoot and needle mass and other shoot variables of current and consecutive year's growth. The strongest correlations are between length of the shoot and needle mass of the shoot, and the length of the shoot and number of needles on the shoot. Needle length was not as sensitive to the light environment. However, needle width and thickness increased with canopy openness. This paper presents a review of selected literature on the relationships between different tree variables and ecophysiological factors that influence the response and acclimation of Norway spruce advance regeneration to release. The results indicate that crown, shoot and needle characteristics could reflect the acclimation to light conditions and indicate the performance of advance regeneration after release.

AB  - This article examines why the growing supply of farmed salmon certified by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC), a leading standard for responsibly farmed seafood, has been sold as conventional, unlabeled salmon in some countries. Two countries are examined: Norway, the world's main producer of ASC-certified farmed salmon, and the United Kingdom, a longstanding demand-side market leader on eco-labels. The study finds that unresolved environmental challenges of salmon farming, combined with perceived weaknesses in the ASC salmon standard, have led not only non-governmental organizations but also several major retailers to view the ASC as not setting the bar high enough to enable salmon farming to be defined as "sustainable." Conse-quently, many producers and retailers use ASC certification only on a business-to-business level and have not been incentivized to label salmon products as "responsibly farmed" in supermarkets and other consumer markets.

AB  - The Canadian Birkebeiner Ski Festival emerged as the world's third Birkebeiner cross-country ski loppet in 1985, emulating the Norwegian Birkebeiner and the American Birkebeiner. This study examines the early years of the Canadian Birkebeiner as a heritage sport tourism event with routes near Edmonton, Alberta, that became an annual festival and attraction in western Canada. Invented tradition, sportscapes, and heritage sport tourism are a conceptual frame to analyse how the Festival represented the Birkebeiner legends, how skiers and skiing constituted landscapes, and how the event contributed to sustainability. The Canadian Birkebeiner resulted in a winter sport festival and sportscape that shaped cross-country skiing, trails, and public lands, and was indicative of fluid social relations and rural place making by means of skiing. Based on archival and oral history sources, the study argues the Canadian Birkebeiner was an invented tradition that originated with a ski loppet instrumental in the negotiation of terrain for cross-country skiing that contributed to winter sportscapes and heritage sport tourism in the Cooking Lake-Blackfoot Provincial Recreation Area, and, ultimately, within the UNESCO Beaver Hills Biosphere. It contributes to studies of winter events with local and broader implications for sustainable heritage tourism.

AB  - The dangerous effects of Abandoned, Lost or Discarded Fishing Gears (ALDFG) is documented in the literature. However, there exists an overall lack of understanding in quantifying the pollution loads of fishing gears (FG) in territorial waters or on the beaches. The lack of data on FG life cycle results in mismanagement of one of the troublesome resources across the globe. In the remote and data-less situations, local stakeholders' knowledge remains the only source of information. Therefore, in this article, we propose:
   A methodology to extract fishers' knowledge (FK) for generating evidence on FG handling and management practices in Norway.
   The stepwise approach includes mapping of relevant stakeholders, drafting and finalizing a structured questionnaire using the Delphi method among experts to build the consensus and finally, statistically analyzing the recorded responses from the fishers.
   The questions are designed to extract both qualitative and quantitative information on purchase, repair, gear loss and disposal rates of commercial FGs.
   The responses from 114 Norwegian fishers are recorded, analyzed and presented as a part of method validation.
   The evidence from the survey is then used as an input to coin the regional FG handling and management strategies in Norway. The presented method is proven a robust strategy to retrieve scientific information from the local stakeholders' and can easily be replicated elsewhere to build global evidence around the ALDFG problematic.

AB  - IntroductionHealth inequity within Indigenous populations is widespread and underpinned by colonialism, dispossession and oppression. Social and cultural determinants of Indigenous health and well-being are well described. Despite emerging literature on the commercial determinants of health, the health and well-being impacts of commercial activities for Indigenous populations is not well understood. We aimed to identify, map and synthesise the available evidence on the commercial determinants of Indigenous health and well-being.MethodsFive academic databases (MEDLINE Complete, Global Health APAPsycInfo, Environment Complete and Business Source Complete) and grey literature (Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Google Scholar, Google) were systematically searched for articles describing commercial industry activities that may influence health and well-being for Indigenous peoples in high-income countries. Data were extracted by Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and narratively synthesised.Results56 articles from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden were included, 11 of which were editorials/commentaries. The activities of the extractive (mining), tobacco, food and beverage, pharmaceutical, alcohol and gambling industries were reported to impact Indigenous populations. Forty-six articles reported health-harming commercial practices, including exploitation of Indigenous land, marketing, lobbying and corporate social responsibility activities. Eight articles reported positive commercial industry activities that may reinforce cultural expression, cultural continuity and Indigenous self-determination. Few articles reported Indigenous involvement across the study design and implementation.ConclusionCommercial industry activities contribute to health and well-being outcomes of Indigenous populations. Actions to reduce the harmful impacts of commercial activities on Indigenous health and well-being and future empirical research on the commercial determinants of Indigenous health, should be Indigenous led or designed in collaboration with Indigenous peoples.

AB  - Background: Oat (Avena sativa L.) is an important cereal crop for livestock feed and human consumption. The largest oat-producing countries are located in the Northern Hemisphere with Sweden as the tenth largest producer. Oat production is challenged by different diseases that can lead to significant yield reductions and impaired grain quality. The use of efficient and sustainable plant protection management is of great economic and ecological importance. The systematic map in this study aims to provide a knowledge base inventory and to identify areas that need to be researched in the future in terms of plant disease management for more sustainable oat production.
   Methods: Literature searches were conducted in both academic bibliographic databases and relevant online sources of grey literature. A time-span restriction of 40 years (1978-2018) was applied to the searches. English was used in all searches, and Swedish, Norwegian and Danish languages were used in the grey literature searches. The screening process, which followed a protocol with eligibility criteria, was conducted at three levels: title, abstract and full text. Metadata incorporating bibliographic information, study location, climatic zone, disease name, the common and scientific names of the disease-causing organism, pathogen type, intervention and management methods, diseased plant part, plant stage, and outcome were extracted from the studies and included in the systematic map. The systematic map findings are visualized in figures and tables and described. All included studies can be found in a searchable database.
   Review findings: A total of 58 eligible articles, most (n = 51) from scientific journals published in English, were included in the systematic map. A majority of the studies were conducted in the Northern Hemisphere in temperate climatic zones, where most of the world's oats are produced. The earliest article was published in 1980, followed by an oscillating temporal distribution of articles over the following years. By country, Canada had the highest number of articles, and by region, Europe had the highest number. Fungi were the most studied pathogen type, and a total of 16 different diseases were reported. Fusarium head blight (Fusarium spp.) and crown rust (Puccinia coronata) were the most studied diseases. In total, 17 different intervention management approaches for controlling the diseases were analyzed in the articles, with cultivar resistance and pesticide application as the most studied methods.
   Conclusion: The map highlights the low quantity of available relevant field research on oat disease management. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic map of crop protection. This map provides a database of scientific literature that can be used to develop sustainable disease management strategies. The method used in this study has great potential and can also be used to benefit other crops. Research is often based on the availability of funding, and this map could be a useful tool for researchers and funding organizations to identify relevant research topics that need to be further studied. In addition, this systematic map offers a useful tool for field-based advisors in providing scientifically relevant crop protection strategies for farmers.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity-environment relationships are increasingly well-understood in the context of species richness and species composition, whereas other aspects of biodiversity, including variability in functional diversity (FD), have received rather little rigorous attention. For streams, most studies to date have examined either taxonomic assemblage patterns or have experimentally addressed the importance of species richness for ecosystem functioning.
   2. I examined the relationships of the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates to major environmental and spatial gradients across 111 boreal headwater streams in Finland. Functional biodiversity encompassed functional richness (FR - the number of functional groups derived from a combination of functional feeding groups and habit trait groups), FD - the number of functional groups and division of individuals among these groups, and functional evenness (FE - the division of individuals among functional groups). Furthermore, functional structure (FS) comprised the composition and abundance of functional groups at each site.
   3. FR increased with increasing pH, with additional variation related to moss cover, total nitrogen, water colour and substratum particle size. FD similarly increased with increasing pH and decreased with increasing canopy cover. FE decreased with increasing canopy cover and water colour. Significant variation in FS was attributable to pH, stream width, moss cover, substratum particle size, nitrogen, water colour with the dominant pattern in FS being related to the increase of shredder-sprawlers and the decrease of scraper-swimmers in acidic conditions.
   4. In regression analysis and redundancy analysis, variation in functional biodiversity was not only related to local environmental factors, but a considerable proportion of variability was also attributable to spatial patterning of environmental variables and pure spatial gradients. For FR, 23.4% was related to pure environmental effects, 15.0% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 8.0% to spatial trends. For FD, 13.8% was attributable to environmental effects, 15.2% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 5% to spatial trends. For FE, 9.0% was related to environmental variables, 12.7% to shared effects of environmental and spatial variables and 4.5% to spatial variables. For FS, 13.5% was related to environmental effects, 16.9% to shared environmental and spatial effects and 15.4% to spatial trends.
   5. Given that functional biodiversity should portray variability in ecosystem functioning, one might expect to find functionally rather differing ecosystems at the opposite ends of major environmental gradients (e.g. acidity, stream size). However, the degree to which variation in the functional biodiversity of stream macroinvertebrates truly portrays variability in ecosystem functioning is difficult to judge because species traits, such as feeding roles and habit traits, are themselves strongly affected by the habitat template.
   6. If functional characteristics show strong responses to natural environmental gradients, they also are likely to do so to anthropogenic environmental changes, including changes in habitat structure, organic inputs and acidifying elements. However, given the considerable degree of spatial structure in functional biodiversity, one should not expect that only the local environment and anthropogenic changes therein are responsible for this variability. Rather, the spatial context, as well as natural variability along environmental gradients, should also be explicitly considered in applied research.

AB  - Understanding the distribution and characterization of natural and non-natural materials on the surface and near-subsurface is important for the development of infrastructure projects. This may be a challenge in highly urbanized areas, where outcrops are scarce, and anthropogenic activities have altered the morphological expression of the landscape. This study tests the integration of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), borehole drilling, aerial imagery, geological mapping, and aerial laser scanning as complementary mapping tools for determining the stratigraphy of glacial and post-glacial Quaternary sediments, the depth to the bedrock, and the distribution of anthropogenic material in Mosvatnet, a lake in Stavanger, Norway. The integration proved to be efficient and enabled the generation of a 3D holistic model, which provided a broad understanding of the subsurface geology and the induced anthropogenic changes in the area through time. Bedrock, till, fluvioglacial, and lacustrine geological units were modeled. Accumulations of post-glacial organic matter were mapped, and the distribution of non-natural infill material was determined. The interpreted dataset suggests that the eastern shoreline of Mosvatnet has artificially prograded about one hundred meters westward since the 1930s and the elevation of the corresponding area has increased by about ten meters relative to the lake level.

AB  - Compact settlements take advantage of economies of scale by sustaining a system of high-quality socio-economic services at close proximities. Urban density with a balanced mix of uses also benefits walking and cycling as mobility modes that provide sufficient access to urban amenities, especially when combined with effective public transport. Indeed, walking and cycling can decrease the use of cars for short-distance trips. From this perspective, urban density can help to reduce pollution, optimise energy consumption and decrease infrastructural expenditures while contributing to more attractive urban environments. These ideas have induced a new wave of time geography planning concepts, such as the '10-minute city', to enhance urban sustainability. For these concepts to move beyond visionary narratives, they must be expressed in specific empirical frameworks. Thus, the current research focuses on accessibility to grocery shops, as an essential urban service, in the Stavanger metropolitan area (Norway) using 10 minutes isochrones for walking and cycling. The study integrates open data, GIS network analyses, statistical regressions and bivariate representations of the results. The research estimates the level of serviceability by quantifying the number of shops that are accessible for each location and interrelates this estimation with spatial and population densities. The paper also presents a method to detect spatial inequalities by visualising over/under-serviced areas. This visualisation can become a tool to support strategies to rebalance such imbalances. Moreover, this study offers a practical approach towards the '10-minute city' concept, as it can be adjusted to different isochrones at different spatial scales. In general, this approach can serve both to analyse existing contexts and to model strategies to support sustainability policies, such as urban densification and the promotion of environmental-friendly transport.

AB  - The symposium, Shellfish-Resources and Invaders of the North, took place 5-7 November 2019 in Tromso, Norway. Approximately 110 participants presented and discussed 60 talks and 25 posters. Of these, ten articles are published in this symposium issue. The goal of this symposium was to discuss the role of shellfish, both as harvestable resources and as important ecosystem players in northern hemisphere cold marine environments. To provide perspective for the symposium, the development of four major crustacean fisheries (northern shrimp, snow crab, Homarus, Norway lobster) are reviewed. Our review showed that landings of all these fisheries are still in a state of flux due to inherent population dynamics, fishing, and climate change. The talks and posters covered a broad range of state-of-the-art bioecological knowledge and present challenges in the assessment and management of the most ecologically and/or commercially important cold-water shellfish species belonging to the phyla Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Echinodermata. Various alternative harvesting and management techniques were presented along with perspectives for shellfish aquaculture. Methods and models for stock assessment were thoroughly covered as well as the ecological role of shellfish, their population dynamics, new insights into their biology and genetics, and their changing distribution and significance as invasive species.

AB  - This study focused on tree mortality in spruce-dominated stands managed using the single-tree selection method in southern Finland. Together with regeneration and tree growth, mortality is one of the basic elements of the stand structure and dynamics in selection stands. The study was based on data acquired from a set of 20 permanent experimental plots monitored with repeated measurements for 20 years. The average mortality in the number of stems (N) was 4.45 trees ha(-1)a(-1), in basal area (G) 0.07 m(2) ha(-1)a(-1), and in stemwood volume (V) 0.56 m(3)ha(-1)a(-1). In relative terms it was 0.50% ofN, 0.30% ofGand 0.27% ofV, respectively. Wind and snow were the most common causes of mortality, while deaths by biotic causes (mammals, insects, pathogens) were extremely rare. Some 6-10% of the total loss in the number of stems and volume was attributable to the loss or removal of trees that sustained serious damage in harvesting. Most of the mortality occurred in the smallest diameter classes of up to 20 cm. Such a high mortality among small trees can have an adverse influence on the sustainability of selection structures if not successfully checked in harvesting and management.

AB  - Aim Biotic interactions have a central role in defining species assemblages, realized both through negative and positive impacts. However, forecasts of how these interactions affect biodiversity across landscapes are challenging ( and lacking) because the outcome of interactions depends not only on the identity of the interacting species but also on local environmental conditions. Thus, we study how biotic interactions manifest across a landscape.
   Location High-latitude northern Finland and Norway ( 69 degrees N, 21 degrees E).
   Methods We modelled the influence of a dominant shrub, Empetrum hermaphroditum, on spatial patterns of species richness of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens ( using cover of the shrub as a proxy for the frequency and intensity of interaction with other species) across a topographically variable landscape.
   Results The relationship between the cover of the dominant shrub and species richness differed between guilds, being strongest for vascular plant richness, and varied considerably along environmental gradients. The dominant shrub showed stronger negative impact on vascular plant richness under less abiotically extreme conditions. For lichens, the relationship was the opposite: under mild conditions, species richness increased with the cover of the shrub. Incorporating specific leaf area ( SLA) data into analyses revealed that the dominant shrub affected species with high SLA ( typically competitive species of resource-rich environments) most negatively.
   Main conclusions Our findings show how the impact of a dominant species varies across a landscape, with distinctly different effects on competitive and stress-tolerant vascular plants, and on bryophytes and lichens. Spatial predictions of biodiversity trends under global environmental change could, therefore, critically benefit from accounting for context-dependent impacts of biotic interactions.

AB  - Many global tourist destinations have experienced growth in arrivals. This has triggered various conflicts in destinations and sparked debates as to how to deal with what is increasingly referred to as 'overtourism'. Most Destination Marketing Organisations (DMOs) pursue strategies to stimulate arrivals even further. Pro-growth discourses are reinforced by lead bodies such as the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). However, maximisation strategies based on higher numbers of tourists increasingly cause conflicts with local residents, whereas simultaneously undermining climate change mitigation pledges as negotiated in the Paris Agreement. New approaches to destination management based on optimisation are therefore warranted. Drawing on a survey of international tourists (n = 5,249) in south-western Norway, this article discusses whether 'activities', i.e. the development of local, small-scale and ideally more sustainable experiences, can contribute to economic growth without necessarily increasing numbers of arrivals. Results confirm that destinations should seek to better understand their markets, including length of stay, spending, and/or activity intention, to identify profitable markets. Ultimately, such knowledge may help addressing overtourism conflicts while building tourism systems that are more economically, socially, and environmentally resilient.

AB  - The anthropogenic pollution along the coastline of the eastern Gulf of Finland was studied through a range of methods, including analyses of metal contamination in water, surface sediments, accumulated algal biomass and its correlation with resistant microbiota. According to concentrations, the main pollutants in water were copper and manganese. Influence of Nuclear Power Plant was remarkable in adjacent areas and was expressed in high concentrations of molybdenum, nickel, copper and other elements in the water. Relatively high concentrations of copper, lead and zinc were found in sediments. Microbial tolerance appeared to be correlated with the concentration of the metals in sediments. Higher tolerance levels were found in sediment samples from more polluted stations. Macroalgae, which were massively developed in the coastal zone, had shown high level of metal bioaccumulation. Analyses of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content of algal tissues allowed the estimation of additional nutrient loading from accumulated decaying algal biomass on the coastal zone of the eastern Gulf of Finland. Mass development of algae in coastal area may contribute to accumulation of organic matter and associated metals In our study the highest metal concentrations in sediments were found at the sites with dense and continuous layer of fresh and decaying macroalgal biomass, accompanied by hypoxic conditions. Also our study has shown that accumulated biomass may be a significant source of nutrients in the coastal ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to increase our understanding of the governing of flood risk mitigation in advanced liberal society, through an in-depth Swedish case study. By combining social network analysis and genealogy, this paper investigates who is involved, how they organise, their modes of thinking, how they mitigate flood risk, as well as how such regime of practises have come into being. The findings suggest dominant rationalities that reduce the actual complexity of flood risk in spatial and temporal terms to fit the legal and institutional environment. The resulting fragmentation is associated with a commodification of flood risk mitigation, in which actors expect to be able to procure modules of safety and sustainability on the market. This commodification materialises in a vacuum of responsibilisation, when obligations are imposed without commensurate guidelines. These processes of fragmentation, commodification, and responsibilisation are core constituents of neoliberalisation, which is clearly shaping the governing of flood risk mitigation even in Sweden; a bastion of the strong welfare state. Regardless of the notable individual capacities of the involved actors, systemic constraints in the governmentality have generated these detrimental processes in the face of overwhelming complexity. These systemic constraints must be removed or overcome for the governing of flood risk mitigation to match the complexity of flood risk in the catchment area. This paper thus provides input that can inform policy changes for a more sustainable future in the face of unprecedented change.

AB  - The paper presents the case study of the so called Halland Model, a pioneering example of strategic inter-sector coordination focused upon cultural heritage conservation, which has solved a major structural crisis of the local economy in the early 90s through an original public administration-driven, capability building-centred approach. We argue that this example can be taken as the prototype of a more general, structural approach to counter-cyclic policies that we call Cognitive Keynesianism (CK), and that CK in turn can be usefully read in the context of the more general class of culture-led local development models known as System-Wide Cultural Districts (SWCD). The paper analyses how the Halland model case fits into the CK and SWCD frameworks, and draws implications in terms of directions for future research and policy design in the current context of Europe's low growth trajectories.

AB  - This article discusses an innovative carbon capture and utilization project from societal, economic, and ethical perspectives. UiT-The Arctic University of Norway and the ferrosilicon producer Finnfjord AS, both located in Northern Norway, collaborate to develop sustainably produced fish feed by cultivating microalgae (diatoms) that feed on CO2 from the factory fume. The microalgae biomass, when added to fish feed applied in the aquaculture industry, contributes nutrients that are essential to human and fish health. The project carries the potential to contribute to the operationalization of the Sustainable Development Goals. The present study is intended as a contribution to the literature focusing on CO2 utilization as a means of achieving a sustainable "green" transition in the industry. By viewing the utilization of CO2 through the lenses of biotechnology, a circular economy, ethics and philosophy, our research findings are relevant to sustainability scholars, industrial actors, and policy makers. It also presents future perspectives on how the aquaculture and manufacturing industries can contribute to the operationalizing of the Sustainable Development Goals in a rapidly evolving industrial environment that is now undergoing a paradigm shift.

AB  - Elevated nutrient concentrations in streams in the Norwegian agricultural landscape may occur due to faecal contamination. Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been used conventionally as an indicator of this contamination; however, it does not indicate the source of faecal origin. This work describes a study undertaken for the first time in Norway on an application of specific host-associated markers for faecal source tracking of water contamination. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on Bacteroidales host-specific markers was employed for microbial source tracking (MST) to determine the origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Four genetic markers were used: the universal AllBac (Bacteroidales) and the individual specific markers BacH (humans), BacR (ruminants) and Hor-Bac (horses). In addition, a pathogenicity test was carried out to detect the top seven Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) serogroups. The ratio between each individual marker and the universal one was used to: (1) normalise the markers to the level of AllBac in faeces, (2) determine the relative abundance of each specific marker, (3) develop a contribution profile for faecal water contamination and (4) elucidate the sources of contamination by highlighting the dominant origin(s). The results of the qPCR MST analyses indicated the actual contributions of humans and animals to faecal water contamination. The pathogenicity test revealed that water samples were STEC positive at a low level, which was in proportion to the concentration of the ruminant marker. The outcomes were verified statistically by coupling the findings of major contamination sources with observations in the field regarding local land use (residential or agricultural). Furthermore, clear correlations between the human marker and E. coli counts as well as the ruminant marker and STEC quantity in faecally contaminated water were observed. The results of this study have the potential to help identify sources of pollution for targeted mitigation of nutrient losses.

AB  - Urbanization and an increasingly globalized food system cause growing physical and psychological distances between producers and customers. Alternative distribution initiatives with direct sale to local customers are emerging. This paper reports results of two surveys, one from producers and one from customers, in the newly introduced Norwegian farmers market system. The main aim of the research was to examine attitudes toward local foods and evaluate the potential of this new marketing channel to reduce the distances between farmers and consumers. Results show that producers were more concerned than custorners regarding knowledge on how food was produced, and locally marketed, although customers were also interested in these issues. Both groups regarded as to how food was produced to be more important than where it was produced. Producers were more interested in giving customers information on agriculture than customers were in receiving this information. The attitudes toward food differed between respondents of larger urban cities and smaller cities in Norway. Producers traveled a longer distance (average 79 km) than customers (average 14 km) to come to the markets, but traveling distance differed substantially among the sites owing to market location, number of local farmers and small-scale local processors, and product diversity. Results suggest that the farmers markets have potential to reduce both physical and social distances between producers and consumers, and thereby contribute to the sustainability of local food production. Understanding, farmer and consumer attitudes can contribute to organization and promotion of farmers markets in Norway and elsewhere.

AB  - 1. Population cycles have been observed in mammals as well as insects, but consistent population cycling has rarely been documented in agroecosystems and never for a beetle.2. We analysed the long term population patterns of the cabbage stem flea beetle Psylliodes chrysocephala in winter oilseed rape over 50 years.3. Psylliodes chrysocephala larval density from 3045 winter oilseed rape fields in southern Sweden showed strong 8 year population cycles in regional mean density. Fluctuations in larval density were synchronous over time across five subregional populations. Subregional mean environmental variables explained 90.6% of the synchrony in P. chrysocephala populations at the 7-11 year time-scale. The number of days below -10 degrees C showed strong anti phase coherence with larval densities in the 7-11 year time-scale, such that more cold days resulted in low larval densities. High levels of the North Atlantic Oscillation weather system are coherent and anti phase with cold weather in Scania, Sweden.4. At the field-scale, later crop planting date and more cold winter days were associated with decreased overwintering larval density. Warmer autumn temperatures, resulting in greater larval accumulated degree days early in the season, increased overwintering larval density.5. Despite variation in environmental conditions and crop management, 8 year cycles persisted for cabbage stem flea beetle throughout the 50 years of data collection. Moran effects, influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation weather patterns, are the primary drivers of this cycle and synchronicity. Insect pest data collected in commercial agriculture fields is an abundant source of long term data. We show that an agricultural pest can have the same periodic population cycles observed in perennial and unmanaged ecosystems. This unexpected find- ing has implications for sustainable pest management in agriculture and shows the value of long term pest monitoring projects as an additional source of time series data to untangle the drivers of population cycles.

AB  - Efficient Forest Fuel Supply Systems (ESS) was run as a collaboration program, financed by the forestry sector, the energy sector, and the Swedish Energy Agency. The objective was to enable a long-term, sustainable and greatly increased use of forest fuel by supporting the development of a more efficient production system. The financial framework of ESS was SEK 130 million (approximately CA $ 19.5 million) over eight years, and the program supported approximately 150 research and development projects. Skogforsk administered the program, and was responsible for coordination and disseminating information to the stakeholders. A program board made formal decisions, and a fuel technology collaboration group helped to identify R& D areas. A project pilot was linked to each project to ensure that the focus was on sector needs and interests, and to help the project manager with relevant study objects, networks and updated information. In and around the program, valuable expertise and networks were built up in each sector and in research organisations, both nationally and internationally. Great emphasis was placed on practical demonstration, implementation and communication, in order to disseminate knowledge about new technology and methods and to influence attitudes toward forest fuel harvest. The forestry sector and its contractors gradually strengthened the supply system through improved skills, better organisation, and advanced equipment. The goals were largely attained, and practical aspects relating to forest fuel were implemented, incorporating many of the results.

AB  - Nature-based tourism frequently results in controversies over access rights, but also over how resources should be managed and utilized. In this article, we explore disagreements on management strategies and angling practices, which followed in the wake of the gradual introduction of increasingly strict harvest regulations in salmon angling in the Orkla River of Norway. Different views on what represent the most severe threats to the salmon stock appeared in this case to originate in rather complex patterns with respect to the ways stakeholders related to and engaged with salmon, rivers and nature in general. The identification of incompatible goals and motives of various categories of stakeholders has for long been a dominant approach in research on these types of conflicts. In this contribution, we broaden the scope by exploring how such controversies involve competition for hegemony with respect to how management and angling practices should be discursively framed.

AB  - Increased mortality of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), related to lowered levels of stored energy following the loss of ice cover during winter, has been observed after hydropower development in the subarctic River Alta, northern Norway. Drift samples were compared to examine if drift densities, and thus drift prey availabilities for juvenile salmon, were lower in the ice-free than the ice-covered area. In addition, juvenile salmon stomach contents were compared to benthos and drift in the ice-free area to examine salmon winter feeding habitat. Zooplankton, originating from the reservoir, dominated drift at the ice-free site but had lower densities at the downstream ice-covered site. Excluding zooplankton, Chironomidae comprised most of the remaining drift at both the ice-free and ice-covered site, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Simuliidae. No Trichoptera were found in the drift samples. There was no consistent diel periodicity in drift. Benthos was dominated by Chironomidae, followed by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. Other invertebrates occurred in low numbers. Juvenile salmon demonstrated size-selective feeding and fed mainly on Ephemeroptera, followed by Trichoptera and Plecoptera. No zooplankton and few Chironomidae were found in the stomach samples. Stomach content was more similar to benthos than to drift, indicating a larger extent of benthic than drift feeding. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that lack of ice cover reduced the invertebrate drift or caused diel periodicity in the drift. Differences in drift between areas with and without ice could not account for the observed differences in mortality of juvenile salmon during the winter in these areas.

AB  - The negative impact of maritime traffic in terms of shore erosion in sheltered coastal fairways can be mitigated by sustainable fairway management. Mitigation measures include regulating the ship traffic in terms of speed, routes, or size of ships, but can also involve erosion protection along a fairway. For effective shoreline management of a fairway, it is essential to predict ship waves, to identify sites with potential erosion problems, and to investigate the effectiveness of different measures before implementing them. Several attempts have been made to develop site-specific criteria for managing ship waves. However, few available generic models consider primary waves generated by large ships in confined fairways. Therefore, a tool for supporting decisions in fairway management was developed. The decision support tool is based on simplified formulas for ship-and wind-wave prediction, combined in a framework that enables automatic, rapid assessments on large spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, the tool requires only readily available input data, such as data on AIS, bathymetry, shoreline geometry, wind, fairway centreline, and grain size. The output from the model includes ship and wind wave heights and potential erosion sites. The decision support tool was applied to the Furusund Fairway, Sweden, by simulating one year of ship traffic to validate its capability of identifying potential erosion sites. The simulation demonstrated that the tool was capable of identifying known erosion sites in the fairway. Additionally, scenarios with different speed regulation strategies for the Furusund Fairway were investigated using the decision support tool. Overall, it is concluded that the developed tool enables rapid assessment of ship waves, wind waves, and potential erosion over large areas in fairways.

AB  - Biodiverse semi-natural pastures are threatened because of sub-optimal grazing. The influence of breed on choice of foraging vegetation type, diet and hence pasture management was investigated in dairy cows kept on mountain pastures. Five dairy cows each of the traditional Swedish Mountain cattle breed and the commercial Holstein breed were equipped with GPS receivers measuring animal position for 6 h daily grazing time during 6 days. Plant groups in the ingested herbage were recorded visually for 30 min per cow and day. The grazing area, mapped using infra-red aerial photography combined with field work, consisted of ten vegetation types dominated by bilberry forest (33%), mixed forest (28%) and grass and sedge fen (12%). Although grass-dominated pasture comprised only 0.3% of the area, the cows spent on average 27% of their time there. Swedish Mountain cows spent less time in grass-dominated pasture than Holsteins (24% vs. 31%) but more time in bilberry forest (21 vs. 13%). Swedish Mountain cattle also travelled longer distances during grazing (6.3 vs. 5.0 km). This limited study revealed a general selection of grass-dominated pasture, but indicated that using traditional breeds can result in better management of other vegetation types.

AB  - Purpose This study focuses on the environmental assessment of European copper production. Life cycle assessment is applied to analyse copper cathode production in Sweden, including its mining (an open-pit mine) and refining (pyrometallurgy), and using two combinations of software and databases: SimaPro software with ecoinvent database and GaBi software with GaBi database. The results are compared with results from other case studies from literature. Methods A cradle-to-gate LCA was conducted considering 1 tonne of copper as functional unit. The inventory for the foreground system was elaborated using primary data gathered by the staff from the mine, the concentrator and the smelter. For the background data, LCA databases are used considering datasets for the Swedish market whenever possible. As the smelter has multiple useful outputs, economic allocation was applied at the inventory level. The calculation method CML-IA baseline 3.5 was considered for both combinations of software and database, reporting all the impact categories of the method plus the Cumulative Energy Demand. Results and discussion The inventory of the system and the main environmental hotspots were presented, such as the explosives for blasting (due to their supply chain) or the electricity used in the concentrator. The results obtained with the two combinations of LCA software and databases yield large differences for categories such as abiotic depletion (7.5 times higher for SimaPro and ecoinvent), possibly due to differences in the system boundaries of the databases and the characterisation factors of the method. Although the case study has a relatively high cumulative energy demand (140/168 kMJ/tonne Cu) compared to other mines, its performance in global warming (3.5/4.7 tonne CO(2)eq/tonne Cu) is much better due to the low greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, which shows that the electricity mix is a key aspect. Conclusions The environmental performance of mining depends partially on the specific conditions of the deposit, e.g., the ore grade and the mining type. LCA practitioners should consider the potential different results that can be obtained using different combinations of software and database and exert caution when comparing cases, especially for abiotic depletion, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories. Finally, the use of renewable energies can be key to improve the environmental sustainability of copper production.

AB  - This article explores how locally oriented organic businesses adapt to handle crises during a growth process to build resilience, how these businesses maintain the local orientation when growing and what the implications are for the relationship between territoriality and organic production. We explored four cases of organic businesses in Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria. The cases can be described as Values-based Territorial Food Networks. All cases experienced challenges and crises during their growth processes and sought to provide stability and flexibility in order to deal with change. The restructuration process required internalising learning into their organisations, using diversity in a strategic way and forming long-term partnerships within their value chains. While organic certification was never at stake, the meaning of 'local' shifted in some of the cases.

AB  - Studying ecosystem dynamics is critical to monitoring and managing linked systems of humans and nature. Due to the growth of tools and techniques for collecting data, information on the condition of these systems is more widely available. While there are a variety of approaches for mining and assessing data, there is a need for methods to detect latent characteristics in ecosystems linked to temporal and spatial patterns of change. Resilience-based approaches have been effective at not only identifying environmental change but also providing warning in advance of critical transitions in social-ecological systems (SES). In this study, we examine the usefulness of one such method, Fisher Information (FI) for spatiotemporal analysis. FI is used to assess patterns in data and has been established as an effective tool for capturing complex system dynamics to include regimes and regime shifts. We employed FI to assess the biophysical condition of eighty-five Swedish lakes from 1996-2018. Results showed that FI captured spatiotemporal changes in the Swedish lakes and identified distinct spatial patterns above and below the Limes Norrlandicus, a hard ecotone boundary which separates northern and southern ecoregions in Sweden. Further, it revealed that spatial variance changed approaching this boundary. Our results demonstrate the utility of this resilience-based approach for spatiotemporal and spatial regimes analyses linked to monitoring and managing critical watersheds and waterbodies impacted by accelerating environmental change.

AB  - Continuous and comprehensive monitoring is one of the most important practices to trace changes in the state of the environment and target management efforts. Yet, governmental resources are often insufficient for monitoring all required environmental parameters, and therefore authorities have started to utilize citizen observations to supplement and increase the scale of monitoring. The aims of the present study were to show the potential of citizen science in environmental monitoring by utilising citizen observations of the non-indigenous Harris mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii in Finnish waters, where coastal monitoring is insufficient to estimate the distribution and spread of non-indigenous species. Harris mud crab has shown measurable impact locally and is considered invasive. For reporting the status of invasions to national and European authorities and planning for potential eradication efforts, up to date knowledge on NIS ranges are needed. Citizen observations on the species were collected from the first observation onwards between 2009 and 2018, at first via email and later through an active citizen observation web portal (Invasive Alien Species Portal). The outcomes of the study indicate that species-specific citizen observations can be a beneficial addition to supplement national monitoring programs to fulfil legislative reporting requirements and to target potential management. Recognizable species and geographical areas with low biodiversity provide a good opportunity to utilize citizen observations. Moreover, citizen observations may enable distribution assessments for certain species that would otherwise require excessive resources and sampling efforts.

AB  - Climate protection and other environmental concerns render it critical that diets and agriculture systems become more sustainable. Mathematical optimization techniques can assist in identifying dietary patterns that both improve nutrition and reduce environmental impacts. Here we review 12 recent studies in which such optimization was used to achieve nutrition and environmental sustainability aims. These studies used data from China, India, and Tunisia, and from 7 high-income countries (France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Most studies aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (10 of 12) and half aimed also to reduce >= 1 other environmental impact, e.g., water use, fossil energy use, land use, marine eutrophication, atmospheric acidification, and nitrogen release. The main findings were that in all 12 studies, the diets optimized for sustainability and nutrition were more plant based with reductions in meat, particularly ruminant meats such as beef and lamb (albeit with 6 of 12 of studies involving increased fish in diets). The amount of dairy products also tended to decrease in most (7 of 12) of the studies with more optimized diets. Other foods that tended to be reduced included: sweet foods (biscuits, cakes, and desserts), savory snacks, white bread, and beverages (alcoholic and soda drinks). These findings were broadly compatible with the findings of 7 out of 8 recent review articles on the sustainability of diets. The literature suggests that healthy and sustainable diets may typically be cost neutral or cost saving, but this is still not clear overall. There remains scope for improvement in such areas as expanding research where there are no competing interests; improving sustainability metrics for food production and consumption; consideration of infectious disease risks from livestock agriculture and meat; and researching optimized diets in settings where major policy changes have occurred (e.g., Mexico's tax on unhealthy food).

AB  - Resilience of ecological communities to perturbation is important in the face of increased global change from anthropogenic stressors. Monitoring is required to detect the impact of, and recovery from, perturbations, and before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis provides a powerful framework in this regard. However, species in a community are not observed with perfect detection, and occupancy analysis is required to correct for imperfect detectability of species. We present a Bayesian community occupancy before-after-control-impact (CO-BACI) framework to monitor ecological community response to perturbation when constituent species are imperfectly detected. We test the power of the model to detect changes in community composition following an acute perturbation with simulation. We then apply the model to a study of the impact of a large hurricane on the forest bird community of Sweden, using data from the national bird survey scheme. Although simulation shows the model can detect changes in community occupancy following an acute perturbation, application to a Swedish forest bird community following a major hurricane detected no change in community occupancy despite widespread forest loss. Birds with landscape occupancy less than 50% required correcting for detectability. We conclude that CO-BACI analysis is a useful tool that can incorporate rare species in analyses and detect occupancy changes in ecological communities following perturbation, but, because it does not include abundance, some impacts may be overlooked.

AB  - This paper combines life-cycle analyses and economic analyses for Miscanthus and willow heat and electricity fuel-chains in Ireland. Displaced agricultural land-uses and conventional fuels were considered in fuel-chain permutations. Avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ranged from 7.7 to 35.2 t CO2 eq. ha(-1) a(-1). Most fuel-chain permutations exhibited positive discounted financial returns, despite losses for particular entities at a farm-gate processed-biomass price of sic 100 t(-1) dry-matter. Attributing a value of sic 10 t(-1) CO2 eq. to avoided GHG emissions, but subtracting financial returns associated with displaced fuel supplies, resulted in discounted annual national economic benefits (DANEBs) ranging from -457 to 1887 sic ha(-1) a(-1). Extrapolating a plausible combination of fuel-chains up to a national indicative scenario resulted in GHG emission avoidance of 3.56 Mt CO2 eq. a(-)1 (5.2% of national emissions), a DANEB of 167 Me, and required 4.6% of national agricultural land area. As cost-effective national GHG avoidance options, Miscanthus and willow fuel-chains are robust to variation in yields and CO2 price, and appear to represent an efficient land-use option (e.g. compared with liquid biofuel production). Policies promoting utilisation of these energy-crops could avoid unnecessary, and environmentally questionable, future purchase of carbon credits, as currently required for national Kyoto compliance.

AB  - More and more often, in the context of agriculture, the concept of organic farming is mentioned, which is becoming an object of interest for different groups of experts, and it also becomes a centre of interest for lay society. Organic farming in terms of volume accounts for only a very small part of the overall performance of the agricultural sector, but at the same time, it represents an area, which, even in the current unfavourable economic conditions, can continue to develop very rapidly. Organic farming is an alternative to conventional agriculture, thus offering sustainable development of the entire planet. The growing interest in organic farming and organic food is, among other things, also a reflection of the growing awareness of consumers about the negative effects of conventional farming today and the interest in healthy lifestyle.

AB  - Environmental and social crises in agriculture have led to growing recognition that more ecologically sustainable and socially just food and agricultural systems are needed. This thematic number of the International Journal of Agriculture and Natural Resources gathers the papers submitted by authors who were due to be speakers at the workshop "Challenges for agroecology development for the building of sustainable agri-food systems,"(1) an OECD Co-operative Research Programme-sponsored conference. The aim of the workshop was to promote the transition from conventional agriculture towards agroecology as a science, practice and social movement through sharing the experiences of different OECD countries: Australia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United States. The main topics to be discussed at the workshop included i) agroecology development in OECD countries: local experiences and international collaboration; ii) agroecology as a social movement and related public policies; iii) agroecology education to promote sustainable agrifood systems: and iv) science, innovation and technologies in agroecological systems. While not a comprehensive assessment of the state of agroecology in OECD countries, this thematic number integrates diverse perspectives on some main research and policy advances and uncovers some existing gaps in agroecology practice as an approach for transitioning towards ecologically sustainable and socially just agricultural systems.

AB  - Two prominent features of present-day Estonia are large tracts of formerly productive land laid idle and production buildings of collective farms in ruins. However, in some areas most farmland remains actively used. An investigation of possible 'landscapes of action', both for national decision-makers and single landowners, can help with understanding recent transformations. The article examines local responses to the land restitution and agricultural restructuring measures adopted by the Estonian Government in the 1990s and the resulting effects on the cultural landscape and agricultural development. Restitution was politically necessary, but has had a number of unexpected effects on landscape development and agricultural production. Among the negative effects have been new speculative land-use patterns of urban sprawl around the larger cities. However, where large production units could be converted to capitalist enterprises and where agricultural land is good, agricultural production has been maintained. The article demonstrates how individuals and local communities interpret opportunities and obstacles set by personal ambitions, local conditions, and general policies. Case studies of the former collective farms in Sauga, Surju and Tori municipalities show that the proportion of unproductive agricultural land and recent development of ownership structures show marked differences from case to case.

AB  - Cross-border cooperation is viewed as one of the most recognized models of international cooperation between the countries, a sustainable mechanism of developing the dialogue and current research topic. Neighboring states have managed to build a number of cross-border cooperation models aimed at solving common challenges encountered in the border area. Despite the fact that cross-border cooperation has been addressed in quite a number of research papers, the concrete cooperation tools remain unstudied and deserve special attention. The article considers the Kolarctic European Neighborhood Partnership Programme / ENPI CBC Programme 2007-2013 as an analytical case. The overall Programme objective to reduce periphery of the northern territories of Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden, intensifying cooperation and developing economic, social and ecological potential of the Barents Euro-Arctic Region. The performed analysis of the official documents, statistics obtained and interviews given by experts and projects participants enabled to analyze the priorities and directions of the project cooperation as well as provide complex assessment of the effectiveness of Kolarctic Programme. The case of Kolarctic CBC Programme brings attention of researchers due to its complex effect on various aspects of cross-border cooperation in BEAR and its valued experience in organizing multilateral projects aimed at solving economic, logistic, energy, environmental and humanitarian challenges. The Programme has proved itself as success story and highly effective interregional cooperation tool even in complicated geopolitical circumstances in Europe. The article addresses a number of new challenges of defining priorities of projects based cooperation for future perspective. The results of the study can be utilized in planning further participation of regional organizations in the cross-border cooperation programmes, organizing project work and elaborating and implementing regional development strategies in the areas covered by the Programme.

AB  - Genetic diversity and differentiation were studied in peripheral populations of the recently rediscovered purse-web spider Atypus affinis in Denmark and Sweden using allozyme electrophoresis. Because of the very narrow environmental niche exploited by this species, only a limited number of potential habitats are available. Furthermore, fragmentation has reduced the number and size of potential habitats within the last century. The level of genetic diversity in A. affinis was intermediate compared with other nonsocial spiders, but low compared with invertebrates in general. Significant genetic differentiation was found within distances of only 1-10 km with F-ST estimates ranging from 0.020 to 0.075. Within distances of 30-60 km F-ST ranged from 0.081 to 0.312. Hierarchical F-ST revealed that genetic variability was partitioned at 89.8% within populations, 9.5% among populations within regions and only 0.7% among the four main regions,in Denmark and Sweden. Comparing the result of the genetic analysis with the life history of A. affinis, it is concluded that the level of successful dispersal is low, and that the species has not recently reinvaded northern Europe but prevailed undiscovered for several decades. Finally, it is suggested that the genetic scenario found for A. affinis might represent that for a wide range of other arthropods with similar life history characteristics.

AB  - For centuries, fishing has been an important part of seaside people's history and identity. The geographic features of this area and accessibility created favourable conditions for harbour development. Preserving fishing traditions is important not only in terms of jobs creation for local people but also for their heritage and cultural value. The aim of this paper is to explore the potentials for diversifying sea fishing by connecting it with tourism activities. The ultimate purpose of our study is to find ways to keep local fishing traditions alive in a sustainable manner and to enhance the fishermen's quality of live. The methodology was based on a state-of-art review of research and in-depth interviews with all crucial stakeholders connected to fishing on the Slovene coast. The results show that potentials for fishing tourism development do exist, however, due to differences between stakeholders in terms of their commercial and entrepreneurial strength/competencies at the moment synergies are very weak. Furthermore, there is a lack of will for cooperation among the stakeholders, which is the first precondition for any action. Thus, fishing traditions are currently included in tourism-related activities only sporadically and to a small extent. Representatives of fishermen, tourism associations, hotels and local municipalities indicated that the first necessary step would be to connect all the stakeholders. Presently, the main hindrances seem to be: lack of entrepreneurship and related knowledge, lack of capital, and negative perceptions of the legislation regulating fishing tourism. Possibly, the real, underlying problem regarding the latter is the unsuitable, non-systematic approach to administrative procedures. Namely, stakeholders have insufficient information and knowledge; besides, they are not organized properly. We believe municipalities could play an important role - through tax reliefs, entrepreneurship consultations and permissions issues which would foster fishermen's interests in tourism activities. Finally, perhaps the main overall problem is the lack of vision and strategy how to valorise fishing in tourism. Many good examples can be found in Denmark and Finland, where programs were developed within the fourth axis. These programs managed to preserve fishing, link fishing traditions to tourism and local community and opened additional options of income. Ad hoc and independent actions cannot lead to considerable improvement of the "fishing identity" and a breakthrough in tourism product development. What is needed is a wide perspective and a vision of sustainable fishing, tourism and the whole destination.

AB  - Urban areas are a messy more-than-human interface for humans and synanthropic wildlife. Norms for what constitutes a 'problem' animal to be culled, a displaced animal to be rescued, or a species nuisance whom one simply has to let live, are undergoing rapid change. We investigate the changing expectations that municipal hunters experience that they have from society in relation to managing problem wildlife in cities. Adding to the literature on the constitution of 'problem' animals in human environments, we show what happens to these animals in the practical sense, and what informs this decision. Our point of departure is to ask by what rationales hunters consider lethal interventions in urban nature to be legitimate, and which they find to be morally problematic. In a discussion, we reflect on what this says about, and means for, multispecies coexistence. Through interviews and go-along participant observation with 32 municipal hunters in Sweden, we show how municipal hunters wrestle with growing unease about new custodial roles they are expected to inhabit, as facilitators of the natural order, as garbage collectors of society for unwanted wildlife, and as enforcers of an interspecies code of conduct for the city. Based on this analysis, we discuss the relative standing of reparative, sacrificial, aesthetic, goodwill, practical, categorical and situational rationales for culling. This paints a picture of hunters as more conflicted about their control of urban nature, in challenge with the stereotypical idea of the professional hunter as a 'natural born culler'. It also shows a city of parallel planes of multispecies coexistence, where some species and animals get a pass more than others.

AB  - The global pig production has undergone major changes over the past 30 years with larger farms, more intensified production as well as improved hygiene and biosecurity practices. To investigate whether these changes, along with expanded pig welfare, have had an impact on parasite occurrence, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Sweden on farms where the pigs are always loose-housed, floors are solid and bedding material is provided. A total of 1615 faecal samples were collected on 42 conventional indoor farms from a) post-weaning piglets (n = 337); b) growers (n = 345); c) fatteners (n = 308); d) dry sows (n = 277) and e) pre-partum sows (n = 348). Samples were analysed using centrifugal flotation with a saturated glucose-salt solution and a modified McMaster technique, with a lower detection limit of 50 eggs or oocysts per gram. Samples positive for strongyle-type eggs were cultured to third stage larvae for genus identification. Farms also responded to a questionnaire regarding biosecurity, hygienic measures, and other management routines. Risk factors for parasite occurrence were assessed using mixed-effects logistical regression to account for farm-level clustering of samples. Interestingly, the prevalence of Ascaris suum was reduced compared to a similar investigation in the 1980s. In the present study A. suum was detected only in 43 % of the herds, with the highest prevalence in pre-partum sows (37 %) followed by fatteners (25 %). Small sized farms were associated with higher odds of being positive, compared to large sized farms (OR = 159.1, P = 0.010). Oesophagostomum spp. were detected in 64 % of the herds and again mainly in pre-partum sows (63 %). Trichuris suis was detected in 10 % of the herds but only in <1% of the samples. Moreover, Cystoisospora suis and Eimeria spp. were detected on 60 % and 64 % the farms, with the highest prevalence in post-weaning piglets and sows, respectively. Anthelmintic drugs (ivermectin or fenbendazole) were commonly used and administered mainly to pre-partum sows on 93 % of the farms. Toltrazuril against neonatal coccidiosis was administered to piglets on 14 % of the farms. The use of antiparasitic drugs did not significantly affect parasite prevalence. Overall, it appears that the altered farming routines with focus on improved pig welfare have not solely resulted in a higher occurrence of parasites, most likely due to the adequate biosecurity and hygiene practices instituted. Thus, there seems to be no conflict between implementing measures to promote pig welfare and adequately control the more pathogenic and economically important parasites.

AB  - Two different theories exist relating to preferences for landscapes: 1) people prefer certain types of landscape independent of their cultural and ethnic background-preferences are innate; 2) people prefer landscapes experienced during childhood regardless of their appearance owing to learned conceptions-preferences are determined by culture. Our aim was to evaluate relationships among preferences for landscapes and childhood landscapes. Results are based on a questionnaire sent out at random to 2000 people in Sweden, and on a qualitative study comprising 19 people. They show that people: i) feel more at home in the type of landscape they grew up in and more often choose to settle down in this type of landscape, even if they have moved from their childhood region; ii) prefer qualities connected to childhood landscapes. However, some of these qualities, those suggested to be innate, are more preferred than others. In conclusion, people prefer landscapes experienced during childhood, but seem to attach more easily to qualities that are suggested to have an innate significance.

AB  - Restoration of acidified lakes by liming does not, in many cases, improve productivity to a pre-acidified state. We hypothesize that the poor recovery detected in many of these lakes is due to constrained in-lake phosphorous (P) cycling caused by enhanced precipitation of metals in higher pH, limed waters. Long-term (1990-2012) data for 65 limed, circum-neutral (pH 6-8), and acidified lakes in Sweden were analyzed to determine trends for P and potential drivers of these trends. Limed lakes not only had lower mean values and stronger decreasing trends for total P than non-limed lakes, but they also had the highest percentage of decreasing trends (85 %). A P release factor (Hypolimnetic P/Epilimnetic P) was developed to elucidate differences in internal P cycling between lake groups. Consistently, lower P release factors in limed lakes show limitation of internal P cycling during summer months that may be a factor limiting P bioavailability and thus productivity of these systems.

AB  - This paper discusses the challenge of a regulator being on a position of preventing organisational accidents in high-technology domains when causes are complex, often poorly understood and with an open or hidden expectation of adding values to society. The purpose of the paper is to assess the combination of mixed roles when a regulator combines the task of facilitating resources management along with controlling the accompanied risks - multiple goals that may be in opposition to each other and mixed roles that may serve opposite interests. The roles and goals of Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), divided after 30 years of successful operation, are used as a case study. The analysis shows that separating the mixed roles of NPD seems reasonable. However, multiple goals embedded in the resource development create dilemmas facing institutions in the market as well as the regulating authorities in their effort to realise their purpose. That cannot be suspended by a shortcut redesign or new division of labour in ministries, directorates or agencies. The Janus face is a reminder of risks as essential human and social phenomena, being particularly true in sectors and arenas where economic, social and technological risks being at stake.

AB  - Successful adaptation to global environmental change will require confronting multiple unfolding challenges in concert. Coastal regions vulnerable to sea level rise and tropical storms will likely also be influenced by resource limitation in an uncertain future. In this paper, we explore the interrelated dynamics of coastal population migration, economic instability, and anthropogenic phosphorus (P) flows. Accounting for P flows and improving human P use efficiency are critical tasks given the finite global supply of phosphate rock and widespread eutrophication. We use material flow analysis to examine societal P metabolism in the Upper Pontchartrain Basin in coastal Louisiana, USA for two 5-y time periods (2001-2005 and 2006-2010) to capture the effects of fertilizer economics and population growth partially driven by the impact of Hurricane Katrina in the lower basin in 2005. Mass balances encompass human-mediated P fluxes in food production and consumption subsystems across agricultural, developed, and forested landscapes. Drastic reductions in locally purchased inorganic P fertilizer (78% decline between periods) were correlated to increases in fertilizer prices. Total P input to the study region decreased from 5452 to 3268 Mg P y(-1) between periods. Changes in P flows were primarily driven by fertilizer economics, declining dairy production, and the influx of new residents, which has been characterized by decentralized settlement that limits P recycling. Societal P metabolic efficiency increased from 22% to 32% due largely to reduced fertilizer inputs. Leakage to the Pontchartrain Estuary and the Mississippi River represented 17-23% of total system P input, while the vast majority of P accumulated within soils, wastewater systems, and landfills. We discuss basin trends and management implications. A historic opportunity exists to encourage future coastal development characterized by synergies between local agriculture and human habitation to promote energy efficient nutrient recycling. The effect would be a decreased vulnerability to future fertilizer price spikes, along with the mitigation of current and future eutrophication. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 1955, an experiment was established at Gisburn forest in northern England to compare the performance of pure and mixed plots of four species: Norway spruce (Picea abies), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa). At the end of the first rotation, there was enhanced growth in all mixtures with Scots pine while there was a negative interaction in the Norway spruce/sessile oak mixture. The experiment was felled in 1989 after windblow and replanted in 1991, when Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) was added to the species trialled. After 20 years of the second rotation, patterns of individual species growth were generally similar to those in the first rotation, except that height and diameter growth of Norway spruce and Scots pine was significantly greater (P < 0.01) in mixed plots. Basal area growth of three combinations (Sitka spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/Scots pine; Norway spruce/common alder) was about 40 per cent greater than (and significantly different from) that predicted from performance in pure plots of the same species, evidence of transgressive overyielding. These results indicate that facilitation effects through improved nutrient status can lead to better productivity in mixed-species stands in planted forests. The implications of these findings for policies seeking to diversify single species planted forests are considered.

AB  - In this study, the annual movements of a seabird species, the red-throated diver (Gavia stellata), were investigated in space and time. Between 2015 and 2017, 33 individuals were fitted with satellite transmitters at the German Bight (eastern North Sea). In addition, stable isotope analyses of feathers (delta C-13) were used to identify staging areas during the previous moult. The German Bight is an important area for this species, but is also strongly affected by anthropogenic impacts. To understand how this might affect populations, we aimed to determine the degree of connectivity and site fidelity, and the extent to which seasonal migrations vary among different breeding locations in the high Arctic. Tagged individuals migrated to Greenland (n = 2), Svalbard (n = 2), Norway (n = 4) and northern Russia (n = 25). Although individuals from a shared breeding region (northern Russia) largely moved along the same route, individuals dispersed to different, separate areas during the non-breeding phase. Kernel density estimates also overlapped only partially, indicating low connectivity. The timing of breeding was correlated with the breeding longitude, with 40 days later arrival at the easternmost than westernmost breeding sites. Repeatability analyses between years revealed a generally high individual site fidelity with respect to spring staging, breeding and moulting sites. In summary, low connectivity and the distribution to different sites suggests some resilience to population decline among subpopulations. However, it should be noted that the majority of individuals breeding in northern Russia migrated along a similar route and that disturbance in areas visited along this route could have a greater impact on this population. In turn, individual site fidelity could indicate low adaptability to environmental changes and could lead to potential carry-over effects. Annual migration data indicate that conservation planning must consider all sites used by such mobile species.

AB  - The European electricity landscape is facing an ambivalent situation between: (1) common market platforms; and (2) national and subnational jurisdictions, which impose their specific rules on energy sectors. This particularly affects hydropower, as the latter faces inequalities in the procedures needed for the attribution of water rights. Besides jurisdictional disparities, the European Union requires this attribution to follow competitive processes and the integration of sustainable development goals for energy projects, while other countries connected to the European grid such as Switzerland and Norway still know different procedures and requirements. Therefore, this article addresses concerns regarding the lack of harmonization of water regimes in Europe. Imposing a common jurisdiction to countries connected to the European grid would be politically very challenging. Our approach overcomes this challenge by proposing a process adaptable to specific local rules and allows a comparison of water rights attribution procedures. In this frame, we propose a nine-step process, based on three goals: (1) to enhance competitive access by ensuring the highest rent transfer related to water rights; (2) to prioritize projects closer to sustainability goals; and (3) to ensure the efficiency of the process itself.

AB  - Replacing fossil fuels with sustainably-produced biomass reduces net CO2 emissions. We express the efficiency of this substitution in reduced emissions per unit of used land or biomass. The substitution costs are calculated as the cost difference between a continued use of fossil fuels at current prices and a use of biomass. The biomass technologies are assumed to be implemented when reinvestments are required. Energy inputs to biomass production and conversion are biomass-based, resulting in a CO2 neutral fuel cycle, while CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are estimated from their complete fuel cycles. Using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels in electricity and heat production is, in general, less costly and more resource efficient than replacing gasoline or diesel for transportation. For transportation, methanol or ethanol produced from short-rotation forest or logging residues provide larger CO2 emission reductions than other biomass-based energy carriers, and methanol has the lowest emission-reduction costs. An increased biomass use by 125 TWh/yr would eliminate more than half of the Swedish CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, which were about 15 Mtonnes C in 1992.

AB  - Climate change and rising energy costs have led to increasing interest in the use of tree harvest residues as feedstock for bioenergy in recent years. With an increasing use of wood biomass and harvest residues, essential nutrient elements are removed from the forest ecosystems. Hence, nutrient sustainable management is mandatory for planning of intensive forest use. We used soil nutrient balances to identify regions in Germany where the output of base cations by leaching and biomass utilization was not balanced by the input via weathering and atmospheric deposition. The effects of conventional stem harvesting, stem harvesting without bark, and whole-tree harvesting on Ca, Mg and K balances were studied. The nutrient balances were calculated using regular forest monitoring data supplemented by additional data from scientific projects. Effective mitigation management strategies and options are discussed and calculations for the compensation of the potential depletion of nutrients in the soil are presented.

AB  - Issues such as food safety, quality, health, animal welfare and the environment have become more important for seafood consumers and the general public in recent years, particularly in relation to aquaculture. Moving from monoculture to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA), may remedy some of the concerns held by the public relating to these issues. Early studies from North America have found that consumers, and indeed the public in general, are supportive of more sustainable aquaculture production systems such as IMTA. The study described here adds to our understanding of the general public's perceptions of aquaculture in general and IMTA in particular, providing a European perspective. Furthermore, the study identifies factors which should be considered if advancing public recognition of IMTA. 2520 web-based survey questionnaires were compiled from across five countries (Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway and the UK), aimed at investigating public understanding of aquaculture benefits and impacts, knowledge of IMTA, and also collecting demographic information. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression methods. This study determined that both positive and negative perceptions of aquaculture are held by the European general public and that they are influenced by a variety of geographic and demographic traits. The study also identified a lack of awareness of IMTA along with positive perceptions of the concept of integrated aquaculture, although the latter results should be treated with some caution. Based on the results, we conclude that there is clear scope to advance public awareness of the role of IMTA and this will be necessary to gain mainstream acceptance of this aquaculture practice.

AB  - We investigated possible avoidance behavior of calving semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) near recreational cabins, roads, and power transmission lines in Repparfjord Valley, Northern Norway. The distribution, sex, and general age composition of the reindeer was mapped during the 1998 and 1999 calving seasons (n = 776 and n = 678, respectively) using systematic snowmobile and ski surveys. Mean reindeer density within preferred rugged terrain was 87 % lower in the zone 0-4 km from the tourist resort compared to the zone 8-12 km from the resort (1.47 vs. 11.61 reindeer/km(2), respectively). Mean reindeer density by the power line corridor without traffic was 8 1 % lower in the zone 0-4 km from the power line compared to the zone 8-12 km from the power line. Areas 0-4 km from anthropogenic structures were avoided despite low or extremely low levels of human traffic and a high proportion of preferred habitat. Within snow-free sites available for grazing, there were no significant differences in phenological development of Eriophorum spp., in live-dead ratio of plant material, or in graminoid biomass with distance to the tourist resort. Almost 74% of all available forage was located within the avoided 0-4-km zones from the resort or the separate power line. Our results suggest that power lines, even without human traffic, may result in substantial reductions in the use of foraging areas. The combined actions of power lines and cabins may increase potential avoidance, thereby increasing the use of remaining undisturbed grazing grounds. Possible increased competition for high-quality forage may affect lactation, body condition, and, hence, reproductive success in the long term.

AB  - Background Acutely sick or injured patients depend on ambulance and emergency department personnel performing an accurate initial assessment and prioritisation (triage) to effectively identify patients in need of immediate treatment. Triage also ensures that each patient receives fair initial assessment. To improve the patient safety, quality of care, and communication about a patient's medical condition, we implemented a new triage tool (the South African Triage Scale Norway (SATS-N) in all the ambulance services and emergency departments in one health region in Norway. This article describes the lessons we learnt during this implementation process. Methods The main framework in this quality improvement (QI) work was the plan-do-study-act cycle. Additional process sources were 'The Institute for Healthcare Improvement Model for improvement' and the Norwegian Patient Safety Programme. Results Based on the QI process as a whole, we defined subjects influencing this work to be successful, such as identifying areas for improvement, establishing multidisciplinary teams, coaching, implementing measurements and securing sustainability. After these subjects were connected to the relevant challenges and desired effects, we described the lessons we learnt during this comprehensive QI process. Conclusion We learnt the importance of following a structured framework for QI process during the implementation of the SATS-N triage tool. Furthermore, securing anchoring at all levels, from the managements to the medical professionals in direct patient-orientated work, was relevant important. Moreover, establishing multidisciplinary teams with ambulance personnel, emergency department nurses and doctors with various medical specialties provided ownership to the participants. Meanwhile, coaching provided necessary security for the staff directly involved in caring for patients. Keeping the spirit and perseverance high were important factors in completing the implementation. Establishment of the regional network group was found to be important for sustainability and further improvements.

AB  - Green public procurement can play an important role in reducing the environmental impact of societies. While its uptake is continuously growing, barriers to its use still remain. One barrier previously identified in literature is related to the lack of accessible and easy to use tools that help standardize the development of criteria in green tenders. In this paper, to help overcome this barrier, a method is presented that can be used to develop green public procurement tools that follow previous studies recommendations about including life-cycle assessment-based data and basing procurement criteria on national environmental objectives. The method was then applied to develop a procurement tool for green procurement of public transport services in Sweden based on the Swedish environmental quality objectives. Results from the assessment of 18 pre-defined fuel systems are shown together with an illustrative example of how the tool can be used in the process leading up to procurements to set relevant criteria and during the procurement to adjust incoming tender prices. The results showed that waste-based biomethane and hydrogenated vegetable oil systems were well aligned with the Swedish environmental quality objectives due to being able to contribute positively to several objectives. Crop-based biofuels, on the other hand, performed worse due to negative effects from agricultural practices. The performance of the electric vehicle systems depended in large on how the electricity was generated, where renewable sources and low carbon sources performed better than non-renewable alternatives.

AB  - Alpine valleys are experiencing rapidly changing physical, biological and geochemical processes as glacier masses diminish, snowfall patterns change and consequently as hillslopes and valley-floor landforms and sediments adjust. Measurement and understanding of these processes on a valley, landform and surface scale requires topographic data with sufficient spatial coverage and spatial resolution to resolve sources, fluxes and storages of sediment. Most ideally such topographic data will be of a resolution sufficient to resolve important spatial heterogeneity in land cover, topography and surface texture, for example. This study presents the first high-resolution (1m grid cell size) and freely available topography for the upper part of the Tarfala valley, arctic Sweden. The topography was obtained using terrestrial laser scanning and a bespoke workflow is presented to most efficiently cover a 9.3km(2) area. The unprecedented spatial resolution of this topography, which is 15 times greater than that previously available, reveals a suite of alpine landforms. These landforms span multiple glacier forefields, a variety of bedrock surfaces, various hillslopes and types of mass movement, and valley floor glacial, fluvial and periglacial sediments, for example. Primary and second-order derivatives of this elevation data, and vertical transects are given and will assist future classification of landforms and thus assist future targeted field campaigns. Overall, this study presents (1) baseline data from which future re-surveys will enable quantitative analysis of a dynamic landscape, and (2) an efficient workflow that is readily transferable to any scientific study at any other site. Both of these project outputs will find widespread usage in future alpine studies.

AB  - Aims Disease in farmed Atlantic salmon occurs in all its life stages. Salmon are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases at transition from the freshwater stage to the saltwater stage. Our aim in these studies reported was to investigate the possibility that waterborne delivery of a probiotic comprised of naturally occurring marine bacterial species would reduce the mortality and improve the health and growth of farmed Atlantic salmon.
   Methods and results In three trials at two aquaculture production sites in Norway, isolates of Aliivibrio bacteria were added to the rearing water of Atlantic salmon. The fish were followed in 4-6 months after one single bath with observations and samplings. Growth, ulcers and survival were recorded. At the end of the studies growth was up to 31% larger in the probiotic enhanced groups and in trial 1 both mortality and prevalence of ulcer were significantly lower in the probiotic enhanced group compared to the control. Feed conversion rates were recorded in trial 1 and 2 and were from 9 to 28 % better for the probiotic enhanced groups compared to the control groups.
   Conclusion Bathing of Atlantic salmon with probiotic Aliivibrio strains increased growth, reduced mortality and improved FCR in the postsmolt period.
   Significance and Impact of the Study The study demonstrates the potential to enhance growth, prevent ulcers and decrease mortality in Atlantic salmon after adding probiotic strains of Aliivibrio spp. into the rearing water. The study can have impact on animal welfare, economy and sustainability in the aquaculture industry.

AB  - Background: Approaches to routine vaccine funding and the underlying budget-setting process vary greatly across European countries. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put enormous pressure on healthcare systems, affecting resilience of the overall vaccine ecosystem.Methods: This article reviews how vaccine budgets are structured across 8 European countries (England, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Romania, and Spain). First a literature review of the landscape was undertaken, followed by expert interviews to review the findings and consider policy principles to secure prioritisation and sustainability of routine vaccination budgets post-COVID.Results: The organisation of budgets and vaccine spending varies greatly across Europe. In 2/8 countries (France and Germany) vaccine spending is subsumed into a wider healthcare budget. In 2/8 countries (Italy and Romania) the budget differentiates public health and prevention spending from other areas of healthcare, though there is no standalone vaccine budget. In 4/8 countries (England, Finland, Norway and Spain) there is a standalone vaccine budget, however this may not cover all elements needed for immunisation delivery and is not always transparent.Conclusion: Ensuring adequate and dynamic country vaccine budgets, with horizon scanning approaches like in England and Finland, or flexible vaccines expenditures like Germany, would greatly help the timely availability of public funding for new vaccines and strengthen vaccines supply security in Europe through a more virtuous European vaccine ecosystem.

AB  - Analysis of pollen, charcoal and loss-on-ignition in peat cores from a Picea abies-dominated swamp forest in central Sweden show the vegetation changes and disturbance patterns over 9500 yr. Six major sequences of local vegetation development are identified: (A) Pinus period, ca. 9500 - 7000 cal. BP; (B) Open mire period (ca. 7000 - 4500 cal. BP; (C) Betula period, ca. 4500 - 2300 cal. BP; (D) Picea period (ca. 2300 - 1000 cal. BP; (E) Human impact period (ca. 1000 - 100 cal. BP); and (F) Period of human abandonment during the last ca. 100 yr.
   The swamp forest has been highly dynamic in response to various natural and anthropogenic disturbance agencies. Several fires have heavily influenced the vegetation development. During the last ca. 900 yr human influence has been important, initially from grazing and trampling by domesticated animals (ca. 1000 - 500 cal. BP), and subsequently small-scale cereal growing (ca. 400 - 100 BP). Cutting, burning and animal browsing influenced the structure and dynamics of the swamp forest by creating a more open stand and suppressing tree regeneration. Recent cessation of human impact has led to increased tree regeneration and a denser swamp forest stand.
   The present high biodiversity, and subsequent conservation interest does not result from long-term stability or absence of fire and human impact. However, in spite of repeated disturbances, a continuity of old and senescent trees produced a forest type with abundant dead wood. With the relatively minor importance of fire over long periods of time, the swamp forest developed a structure maintaining a high biological diversity.
   An important issue for maintaining long-term biodiversity in the boreal landscape must be to create a mosaic where different forest types are present, with a variety of structures, substrates and processes, to provide a certain degree of freedom for species to move around in the landscape.

AB  - The introduction of technical solutions and the phasing out of unsustainable technologies in Elverum, a small town in the middle of the Norwegian forest, is the starting point for this discussion about homelife and why it can be resistant to change. Sustainable ambitions, goals, and solutions are inspired by the challenges faced by urban neighborhoods, but rural communities are also dealing with the sustainable transition and require opportunities for change that are relevant within their particular context. This article takes an emic insider view of how innovative, and potentially more sustainable technology, affects homelife by considering four main themes: choosing where to live; relationships with cars; leisure activities; and how Ydalir-a zero-emission neighborhood being planned in Elverum-is understood within this context. Rather than smoothing over variations in needs and preferences inside and outside urban and rural contexts, engaging with differences helps to avoid misunderstandings and disappointments. The goal is to encourage a co-production of meaning when approaching the challenge of achieving goals for sustainable futures. Furthermore, associations between homelife and social sustainability offer a site where the sustainable practice is strong. Many rural communities already possess qualities, such as equity, social engagement, inclusion, social interaction, safety, and security. We propose that starting with social sustainability, rather than technical innovation, has the potential to encourage sustainable practices in rural communities, thereby increasing the appropriation and domestication of sustainable ambitions outside of urban contexts.

AB  - This research provides an overview of the process and results of the development and implementation of the Port Activity Application. The aim of the application is to improve the coordination and information exchange mechanisms between the existing systems of ports and ships during piloting ordering process to ensure their effective interoperability, giving a better understanding of the impact of digitalization on the sustainability of seaports and maritime transport. To implement this concept, a system of step-by-step actions was developed, including determining the current situation, developing a business model and business logic for implementing an appropriate information and communication technology (ICT) solution, analysing the local government structure, analysing intermodal information exchange between stakeholders, developing and testing a new ICT tool. The ports of Rauma, Finland, and Gavle, Sweden, were used as pilot ports. As a result of the study, the main bottlenecks in the process of information exchange in ordering pilotage were identified. An improved business model and business logic, that allows the rational use of resources and reduces CO2 emission and the pressure on the environment, was developed. The testbed was conducted in an environment of real port operations. Currently, the open access source code is available for use for maritime cluster actors.

AB  - Long term effects of partial harvests were studied in seven uneven-aged Picea abies (L) Karst stands in northern Sweden, by reconstructing stand development from increment cores. All stands had been subjected to partial harvests 16-57 years before the inventory. Two 1000 m(2) circular plots were established in each stand. All trees with a diameter at breast height (1.3 m above ground) >= 5 cm were mapped and calipered. Historic stand development was reconstructed backwards in five year intervals to the year of the previous harvest, using increment cores taken from randomly chosen sample trees in each 2-cm diameter class.
   The pre-harvest stem density was restored in all stands but one, at the time of the inventory. Average ingrowth of survived trees was 13 stems ha(-1) yr(-1), but no relation was found between annual ingrowth and standing volume. Only four stands had inversely J-shaped diameter distributions after harvest, but all seven stands did at the time of the final inventory. Standing volume was 34-88 m(3) ha(-1) after harvest and 126-207 m(3) ha(-1) at the final inventory, with an average volume increment around 3 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole observation period. Volume increment increased with standing volume in all stands but one. The shapes of the diameter-height curves were similar for all stands, irrespective of the time elapsed since the harvest. In conclusion, the results from this study indicate that the selection system is a sustainable silvicultural system in uneven-aged sub-alpine Norway spruce forests. These forests have high resilience and a capacity to recreate stable diameter distributions after rather harsh treatments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to study the current international experience and determine the prospects for improving the environmental management of companies in the oil and gas markets based on AI in the interests of sustainable development. Relying on variation analysis and correlation analysis methods, it has been substantiated that environmental management have significant impact on companies from the perspective of social LCA, which has an impact on the competitive ability of companies. Relying on the IPAT-method, it has been proven that technology is a key factor which determines this impact. As a result, it has been proved on the example of the case experience of the largest energy companies in Russia in 2022 that the environmental management of oil and gas companies creates advantages not only for the environment but also for financial efficiency and stability (break-even operation) of these companies (implementation of SDG 8). Using the example of the international experience of energy companies (from the UAE, Sweden, the UK, the USA and Japan), it has been proved that AI can play a much greater role in the oil and gas markets, contributing not only to ensuring a deficit-free energy economy (the implementation of SDG 7) but also to environmental protection (the implementation of SDGs 13-15). The best practices of using AI in each selected sector of the oil and gas industry were studied and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the benefits of AI was carried out. Thirdly, the most promising use of AI in the sector of environmental management for environmental economics and management is substantiated. It is proven that the options for environmental management can be different and specific to a particular object. Thanks to the results obtained in the course of the study, a systematic view of the prospects for the sustainable development of oil and gas markets has been formed, and the importance of AI for this process has been demonstrated. The theoretical significance of the study consists in expanding the existing understanding of the use of AI in the practice of environmental management of energy companies and clarifying its contribution to the implementation of the SDGs.

AB  - The article reveals main tourism trends after the pandemic and analyses the potential for tourism development on the example of the city of Kemi, located in Finnish Lapland. In current conditions of unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, fast developing technology, shift in customer preferences and climate change, it is important to quickly adjust and respond to the new realities in order to ensure a sustainable development at the regional level. This is especially relevant in Lapland, where tourism is a strategically important sector of the economy. The article aims at identifying main tourism trends in post-lockdown era caused by COVID-19 pandemic and determining the potential for regional tourism development of peripheral areas on the example of the city of Kemi. Based on the conducted analysis of recent literature; analysis of statistical data; qualitative sociological study, three priority groups of actions were recommended: enhancing visibility in the market, strengthening image of the city, and developing facilities in the city. Besides the fact that achieved results are important for further research, developed priorities can lead to the development of tourism in the city, attraction of new investments, creation of new jobs and thus development of the economy.

AB  - Natural landscapes characterized by heavy disturbance regimes were displaced in Europe by managed cultural landscapes over the past centuries. The associated loss of biological legacies, such as dead or dying trees, has exposed numerous saproxylic species to high risks of extinction. In contrast, extensive wilderness forests in Northern Mongolia have been sustained owing to significant cultural differences. Here we used saproxylic beetle abundance data gathered during two sampling campaigns in the Mongolian taiga to address whether (1) the saproxylic beetle fauna of the Mongolian taiga is comparable to that of European boreal forests, (2) fires are a natural disturbance regime, indicated by the occurrence of many pyrophilous species, and (3) species rare in Europe are also rare in the Northern Mongolian wilderness. Of 191 saproxylic beetle species identified, 150 (79 %) were also found in Europe. The high number of pyrophilous beetle species (20) indicated that natural species communities are well adapted to this disturbance regime. The species rarity in Germany was significantly positively correlated with the species rarity in Finland, but the species rarity in these two countries was negatively correlated with that in the Mongolian wilderness. Our results indicated that wilderness areas with natural disturbances provide biological legacies important for rare species. Therefore, exploitation of the unique, remaining natural landscapes of the Palaearctic wilderness areas should be stopped. Moreover, we urge conservationists to expand controlled burning for restoration at relict sites of rare boreal species also outside Fennoscandia.

AB  - Within the project Bringing Retrofit Innovation to Application in Public Buildings (BRITA in PuBs) eight demonstration public buildings were retrofitted. The project was part of the EU Eco-buildings programme. The aim of the project was to further increase the market penetration of innovative and effective retrofit solutions to improve energy efficiency and to implement renewable energy technologies. BRITA in PuBs was finalised in 2008. Two of the demonstration buildings are reported in this paper:
   Borgen Community Centre in Norway (conversion from school to community centre)
   Proevehallen in Denmark (conversion from industrial building to cultural centre)
   [GRAPHICS]
   Borgen Community Centre is located in a suburban area in Asker close to Oslo, the capital of Norway. The Borgen School was built in 1970 and has now been retrofitted and converted into the Borgen Community Centre, a centre for the whole neighbourhood. The main building contains a secondary school and facilities for health-care services and leisure-time arrangements.
   Proevehallen (the test hall) is located on the outskirts of Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark. Constructed in the 1930s, Proevehallen was an open factory building consisting of one large hall that has now been retrofitted and converted into a cultural centre.
   The two buildings showed demonstrated that by introducing appropriate energy conservation concepts and renewable energy technologies into retrofitting projects, the resulting energy standard can be considerably higher than required by the current building regulations at reasonable costs and payback time.

AB  - Timber harvest can adversely affect forest biota. Recent research and application suggest that retention of mature forest elements (retention forestry), including unharvested patches (or aggregates) within larger harvested units, can benefit biodiversity compared to clearcutting. However, it is unclear whether these benefits can be generalized among the diverse taxa and biomes in which retention forestry is practiced. Lack of comparability in methods for sampling and analyzing responses to timber harvest and edge creation presents a challenge to synthesis. We used a consistent methodology (similarly spaced plots or traps along transects) to investigate responses of vascular plants and ground-active beetles to aggregated retention at replicate sites in each of four temperate and boreal forest types on three continents: Douglas-fir forests in Washington, USA; aspen forests in Minnesota, USA; spruce forests in Sweden; and wet eucalypt forests in Tasmania, Australia. We assessed (1) differences in local (plot-scale) species richness and composition between mature (intact) and regenerating (previously harvested) forest; (2) the lifeboating function of aggregates (capacity to retain species of unharvested forest); and whether intact forests and aggregates (3) are susceptible to edge effects and (4) influence the adjacent regenerating forest. Intact and harvested forests differed in composition but not richness of plants and beetles. The magnitude of this difference was generally similar among regions, but there was considerable heterogeneity of composition within and among replicate sites. Aggregates within harvest units were effective at lifeboating for both plant and beetle communities. Edge effects were uncommon even within the aggregates. In contrast, effects of forest influence on adjacent harvested areas were common and as strong for aggregates as for larger blocks of intact forest. Our results provide strong support for the widespread application of aggregated retention in boreal and temperate forests. The consistency of pattern in four very different regions of the world suggests that, for forest plants and beetles, responses to aggregated retention are likely to apply more widely. Our results suggest that through strategic placement of aggregates, it is possible to maintain the natural heterogeneity and biodiversity of mature forests managed for multiple objectives.

AB  - The collaborative ecosystem-based management of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden puts a strain on the involved stakeholders. Representatives have to cope with environmental uncertainty and social stress associated with goal conflicts. This article advanced the understanding of representatives' coping strategies in response to perceived challenges and how these coping strategies are associated with social trust, focusing upon salient value similarity. A mixed-method approach, combining a questionnaire survey (n = 624) and interviews (n = 21) among landowners and hunter representatives, was employed. Survey results showed that the presence of emotion-centered coping strategies that involve venting of negative emotions and behavioral disengagement were associated with relatively lower trust, whereas problem-solving centered coping was associated with relatively higher trust. The interviews indicated the importance of appointing group leaders who are skilled at initiating dialogue and working toward decisions and compromises, as this seemed to hinder expressions of emotion-centered coping strategies.

AB  - The application of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology in the mining sector has the potential to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the primary production of metals. As part of a wider project on developing LCA models and methods for mining, life cycle inventory (LCI) data have been collected at two European copper-producing mine sites, Aitik (Sweden) and Cobre las Cruces (Spain). Results from Aitik, including their impact analysis, identify the use of diesel and explosives, the emission of sulfur dioxide, as well as nitrogen and other emissions in the upstream supply chain of explosives and electricity, as significant contributors to the environmental impact. These outputs have influence on the impact categories Climate Change, Photochemical Ozone Formation, Acidification, as well as Terrestrial and Marine Eutrophication. Due to the increasing incorporation of LCA into legislative demands on the mining sector, mining companies need to establish the necessary infrastructure and framework to be able to provide the required data in a fast, transparent and cost-efficient manner. For this reason, some recommendations to improve communication and data management within the companies have been established from the experience gained within this project.

AB  - Allozyme variation in the forest grass Milium effusum L. was studied in 21-23 populations within each of two equally sized densely sampled areas in northern and southern Sweden. In addition, 25 populations from other parts of Eurasia were studied for comparison. The structure of variation was analysed with both diversity statistics and measures based on allelic richness at a standardised sample size. The species was found to be highly variable, but no clear geographic patterns in the distribution of alleles or in overall genetic differentiation were found, either within the two regions or within the whole sample. Thus, no inferences about the direction of postglacial migration could be made. Obviously, migration and gene flow must have taken place in a manner capable of randomising the distribution of alleles. However, there were clear differences in levels and structuring of the variation between the two regions. Levels of variation, both in terms of genetic diversity and allelic richness, were lower in northern Sweden as compared with southern Sweden. In contrast, different measures of geographic structure all showed higher levels of population differentiation in the northern region. This is interpreted as due to different geomorphological conditions in the two regions, creating a relatively continuous habitat and gene flow in the southern region as compared with the northern region where the species, although common, is confined to narrow and mutually isolated corridors in the landscape.

AB  - Even if pursuing a doctorate is both emotionally challenging and rewarding, empirical research focusing on doctoral students' academic emotions is limited. Therefore, in this study we have contributed to bridging the gap in the research on the doctoral experience by mapping the emotional landscape of doctoral experience. In addition, we have shed light on potential invariants and socio-cultural characteristics of the emotional landscape by doing a cross-country comparison between Danish and Finnish doctoral students. A total of 272 doctoral students (Danish: 145, Finnish: 127) from the field of humanities and social sciences responded to the Cross-cultural Doctoral Experience Survey. The data were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed, using a mixed methods approach. The results showed that the doctoral students experienced a wide range of both positive and negative emotions embedded in various activities of the doctoral experience, including supervision, scholarly community, doctoral research, development as a scholar and structures and resources. The results revealed some associations between the emotions that were experienced as well as differences between the countries.

AB  - Genetic diversity the variety of genes and alleles within a species constitutes the most basic level of biodiversity, and is an important prerequisite for productivity and sustainability in agricultural production systems. We have developed and applied various methods to determine genetic diversity on farms in Europe, Ukraine and Uganda. A questionnaire-based survey conducted on a total of 203 farms has shown that the genetic diversity of crops and livestock varies greatly between different regions, and depends upon the prevailing production systems. In order to obtain a more accurate insight into the genetic diversity of grassland, we studied 60 populations of orchard grass from Bulgaria, Norway and Switzerland with molecular genetic markers. In doing so, we learned that although this species exhibits a very large variability within the populations, the differences between the populations tend to be minor.

AB  - This paper discusses different approaches of how visual impact on cultural heritage can be methodologically improved within Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). During the recent decade, visual impact on cultural heritage and heritage sites has become a more frequent but contentious issue in public and academic discussions. Yet, within EIA issues relating to heritage sites and visual impact are rarely debated or critically reflected upon. Today most methods and theories on visual impact and cultural heritage within EIA are transferred from disciplines such as landscape architecture, architecture and geography. The article suggests how working with the concepts and definitions of site and setting can be a methodological tool for delimiting and clarifying visual impact on cultural heritage sites. The article also presents ways of how public participation can be a tool to start exploring the field of what the visual impact on cultural heritage implies and how it effects upon our understanding and appreciation of heritage sites. Examples from a Norwegian case are taken as illustrations to highlight these issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A bottom gravity current model, including chemistry, has been used to study the behaviour of heavy, CO2-enriched seawater released on a sloping seabed. The model has been fitted to the emission of CO2 from a 2 GW gas power plant, and the CO2-enriched seawater is released at a depth of 300 m. A plume is modelled for three different areas; the Norwegian Sea, the north Atlantic and the north Pacific. Temperature and salinity profiles have been used to simulate the vertical density gradient for each of the areas. The numerical values of the different model parameters are discussed, and special attention is paid to the bottom friction parameter. It is argued that natural bottom gravity currents need a bottom friction parameter between 0.01 and 0.1, which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the drag coefficient commonly used in tidal modelling. It is shown that a friction parameter near 0.01 leads to quick dilution of the plume, but that the plume may reach the deep ocean if the friction parameter is near 0.1. Furthermore, it is shown that the density profiles in the Atlantic and Pacific tend to reduce the excess plume density, whereas a plume released at 300 m depth in the Norwegian Sea may transport CO2 to great depths.

AB  - The rapid decarbonisation of transportation is critical if global efforts to mitigate the worst possible impacts of anthropogenic climate change are to be successful. Transportation is a leading sectoral contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, and demand for transportation continues to grow globally. Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) powered by fuels such as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels promise to mitigate the environmental impacts of automotive transportation, including urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. However, multiple barriers to AFV diffusion exist, including low consumer acceptance, high vehicle costs, and a lack of refuelling infrastructure, meaning that sophisticated policies and strategies will be needed to achieve an AFV market transition that is both ecologically and economically sustainable. While more EVs were sold in 2018 than ever before, these sales were the result of aggressive policy support in places such as China and Norway, and it is not clear that EV sales would persist at this level if these policies were removed. In this paper, we present and make freely available a generalised model of AFV diffusion that is flexible for the exploration of these critical policy questions, building on recent AFV diffusion literature from system dynamics and related fields. We demonstrate using illustrative scenarios the fragility of AFV diffusion, with a range of behaviour modes possible depending on the structure of the market and the actions of stakeholders. Finally, we identify a number of contemporary research topics of interest to automotive manufacturers and policymakers that can be addressed using the model.

AB  - Russia sees the need to increase wood production. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of barriers and bridges in social and ecological systems for intensification of wood production in NW Russia. This requires that past development trajectories are understood. Using a local logging frontier in Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we employed an environmental history approach to: (1) recreate the wood harvesting history for the period 1719-2014, (2) identify the main actors that produced this history, and (3) analyse what ideologies influenced decision making. First, after a long history of selective harvesting before the Russian Revolution in 1917, forests were rapidly clear-felled during the Soviet period 1921-1991. Following general economic deceleration, and thus severely reduced harvesting activities during 1992-1997, the rate of logging has increased slightly again. To conclude, barriers in ecosystems to intensification include Soviet legacies of large-scale harvesting, which resulted in a very uneven age distribution, limited and poorly conducted silviculture, as well as insufficient transport infrastructure. Additionally, social system barriers are a conservative mind-set at the policy level, unpredictable conditions for forest use rights and ownership, and limited value-added production at local level. Developing predictable rules and norms, forest zoning at local to regional scales, and the emergence of place-based multi-level collaborative learning concepts like Model Forest provide opportunity for bridging the observed barriers.

AB  - The business opportunities in the Finnish biogas branch were studied through policy document analysis, analysis of the financial performance, and interviews of the biogas companies (in industrial and farm scales). Although our study focuses on the case of Finland, many identified features of biogas production can be recognized at least on a European level. The analysis of national policy documents (related to biogas and renewable energy) revealed that even if biogas production and utilization is encouraged, all objectives and measures are rather cautiously formulated and tend to remain on a general level. In addition, economic arguments in policy documents (cost-effectiveness, commercial and business potential, market principles) are emphasized as common criteria for renewable energy technologies, biogas included. The financial performance was studied during 2011-2017 when biogas production more than doubled in Finland (from 52 000 m(3) to 110 000 m(3)). While biogas production is not, in fact, economically very lucrative (the return on investment (ROI) of the studied companies has decreased from 10% to 5% during 2011-2017), there are other partially nonmarket benefits that support biogas production. The larger scale industrial plants' performance was more stable, most probably due to the gate fees which they obtained from waste treatment. Based on the interviews, the farm-scale plants gained also nonmarket cobenefits from the biogas plant on the farm, such as improved manure management. In addition, both the industrial and the farm-scale plants saw new business opportunities in the future, such as biogas use as traffic fuel and recycling nutrients. Biogas technology also has potential to mitigate climate change and eutrophication. Future policies should more specifically take these benefits and possibilities into account. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Science-stakeholder collaboration is becoming an increasingly common way to address mismatches between the knowledge needs of stakeholders and the research being done by scientists. This kind of mismatch is clearly evident in the field of climate change adaptation, arguing for the design and application of user- and decision-driven, coproduced climate services. Science-based participatory processes have shown clear benefits in establishing arenas for joint knowledge production on climate change and adaptation. However, multiple challenges remain. This paper presents and discusses findings from an assessment of a participatory climate services process conducted as part of a research program on climate change adaptation in the Swedish forestry sector. We identify enablers and barriers to successful science-stakeholder collaboration and put forward recommendations for more stakeholder-driven, participatory coproduction processes. Our analysis offers insights that could help achieve more informed decision-making and policy development and ultimately climate action under the Paris Agreement.

AB  - AimsClimate change is known to drive both the reshuffling of whole assemblages and range shifts of individual species. Less is known about how local colonizations and extinctions of individual species contribute to changes at the community level. Our aim was to estimate the contribution of individual species to a change in community composition attributed to climate change and to relate these species-specific contributions to species' commonness, climatic niche characteristics and life history traits most likely to influence species sensitivity to climate change.
   LocationSweden.
   MethodsFocussing on birds, we analysed changes from 1998 to 2012 in the Community Temperature Index (CTI), a measure of the average climatic niche of a community. Using a jackknife approach we assessed the contribution of individual species to the temporal trend in CTI in four different regions across Sweden, controlling for habitat distribution. We further tested whether species contribution was related to population trends and rarity to identify species most vulnerable to climate change.
   ResultsCommunity Temperature Index had increased over time with the greatest gains occurring in the north of the country, reflecting the larger temperature increases in this area. Changes in the regional CTI were driven both by warm-dwelling species colonizing new sites and by extirpations of cold-dwelling species. Furthermore, the community changes were influenced by both rare and common species. At the same time, the distribution changes of a large number of species were seemingly unaffected by climate change.
   Main conclusionsBoth range expansion and contractions contributed to the relative increase of warm-dwelling species in Swedish bird communities. We successfully identified the climatic impacts on some of Sweden's rarest species, including cold-dwelling species in the mountainous north. Our approach may be an efficient tool to use when characterizing the impacts of climate change on species and communities.

AB  - Pollen analysis is the main method to obtain information on human impact on the vegetation through time. In this study, pollen records from one large lake, Kalandsvatn (inner coast), and three small lakes, Heroyvatn (outer coast), Fitjar (inner coast) and Herandsvatn (inner fjord) in Hordaland County, western Norway are investigated. The three small sites reflect different vegetation, climate and landscape types, resulting in different cultural landscapes. A recently developed approach, the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA), is used to reconstruct regional and local vegetation cover in five hundred year time intervals, on a gradient from the coast to the inner fjord of western Norway. The regional estimates of vegetation cover as well as local differences between the sites are clearly demonstrated. The coast has been more open than the inner region in all time periods, with less than c. 70% tree cover prior to 5700 cal. BP. On a regional scale the tree cover was c. 90% in the same time period. Gradual opening of the regional forest started between 5700 and 5200 cal. BP. Forest disturbances, probably related to agriculture, are found both at the inner coast and in the inner fjord prior to 4200 cal. BP. Marked openings of the forests took place c. 4200 cal. BP at the outer coast, and c. 3700 cal. BP at the inner coast and inner fjord. From this time, heathlands dominated the open landscape at the coast. In the inner fjord region, grasslands in combination with cereal cultivation characterized the landscape. The inner coast area shows mixed vegetation cover with heathlands, grasslands and cultivated fields. Implementation of LRA suggests a stronger west east vegetation gradient than indicated in the pollen percentage diagrams. The results show the potential of the LRA-approach in archaeological research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fishways have historically been constructed to restore and preserve the ecological connectivity for fish in fragmented rivers. However, the fishways are often selective on species due to different size and swimming capacity. As the proportion of dammed rivers is still increasing, there is a growing need for more information on wild fish and their migration potential. In this study, we compared the swimming capacity of wild caught brown trout (Salmo trutta) and European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) until the fish were exhausted in a critical swimming speed (U-crit) test, under three different naturally occurring stream temperatures in Norway: 1.7, 5.5 and 10 degrees C. The results indicated that trout swim better at the warmer temperatures than at colder temperatures. The grayling showed consistent swimming patterns with little variation across all tested temperatures. The results therefore signify the need to have operational fishways already early in the spring when the grayling migration starts and highlight the need for more studies on fish migration abilities across a wider range of species and seasons.

AB  - Assessments of human environmental perceptions are partly based on visible features, roles and functioning of the environment, and partly on personal, cultural, social and experience-based values. Assessment research has often been done by showing photos of the environment to respondents, although in situ visits are considered more reliable in reflecting the true characteristics of the environment. We tested the similarity of attractiveness perceptions of 110 respondents between surveys based on photos and field visits in Eastern Finnish managed Scots pine forests. We found a strong correlation between photo and field views of matching forests. Outdoor NGO members gave on average higher scores than other respondents in photo than in field assessments. Moreover, respondents having a neutral or a positive attitude to forest management gave higher scores in photo than in field assessments, whereas respondents with a negative attitude evaluated the environments in the opposite way. The scores based on walk-through visits to gap-felled stands fell between snapshot scores for gaps and retained parts of these same stands. In conclusion, photos seem to accurately reflect the characteristics of structurally simple pine forests, but in more complex stands, several photos or other assessment techniques are required. We conclude that, in general, photos can be used in forest preference assessments, but evaluations of structurally complex environments would benefit from advanced 3D illustration technologies. Management implications: We assess the similarity of attractiveness perceptions of citizens obtained using photo and field surveys, and examine the role of forest-stand complexity in determining the attractiveness experience. Our paper is methodological. Assessments of human environmental perceptions are based on visible features, roles and functioning of the environment, and personal, cultural, social and experience-based values. Assessment research has often been done by showing photos of the environment to respondents, whereas in situ visits are considered more reliable in reflecting the true characteristics of the environment. We tested the similarity of attractiveness perceptions of 110 respondents between surveys based on photos and field visits in Eastern Finnish managed Scots pine forests. We found (1) a strong correlation between photo and field views of matching forests; (2) outdoor NGO members gave on average higher scores than other respondents in photo than in field assessments; (3) respondents having a neutral or a positive attitude to forest management gave higher scores in photo than in field assessments, whereas negative respondents evaluated the environments in an opposite way; (4) the scores based on walk-through visits to gap-felled stands were intermediate between snapshot scores for gaps and retained parts of these same stands. Photos seem to accurately reflect the characteristics of structurally simple pine forests, but in more complex stands, several photos or other assessment techniques are required. At a general level, photo-based assessments of aesthetic perception can be applied in forest-use research.

AB  - Quantitative reconstruction of the area cleared of forest in the past is essential to assess the possible indirect anthropogenic impacts on the past environment of Europe, including past climate. We apply a simulation model of pollen dispersal and deposition (1) to re-examine the relationship between pollen and landscape openness, often uncritically inferred from non-arboreal pollen (NAP) percentages done, and (2) to predict the relevant source area of pollen, the smallest spatial scale of vegetation that can be reconstructed from pollen records. The simulations use landscapes simplified from the modem open agricultural and semi-open forested regions in southern Sweden where traditional cultural landscapes still remain. The model is appropriate, because the simulated pollen assemblages resemble the pollen assemblages observed in each of the two landscape types, and because the simulated relationships between NAP percentages and percentage cover of open land within 1000 m agree with the empirical relationships. The simulated relevant source area of pollen is the area within 800-1000 m from both small hollows and 3-ha ponds. NAP percentages give only a rough first approximation of the percentage cover of open land. More comprehensive methods will be required to obtain quantitative estimates of open land from fossil pollen.

AB  - Trace metal composition of winter snowpack, snow-melt filter residues and top-soil samples were determined along three transects through industrial towns in the Usa basin, North-East Russia: Inta, Usinsk and Vorkuta. Snow was analysed for Ag, Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn using ICP-MS (Ca and K by F-AAS for Vorkuta only), pH and acidity/alkalinity. Filter residues were analysed for: Al, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sr and Zn using F-AAS and GF-AAS; top-soil samples were analysed for Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, Zn using F-AAS. Results indicate elevated concentrations of elements associated with alkaline combustion ash around the coal mining towns of Vorkuta and Inta. There is little evidence of deposition around the gas and oil town of Usinsk. Atmospheric deposition in the vicinity of Vorkuta, and to a lesser extent Inta, added significantly to the soil contaminant loading as a result of ash fallout. Acid deposition was associated with pristine areas whereas alkaline combustion ash near to emission sources more than compensated for the acidity caused by SO2. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Improved understanding of temporal and spatial Phosphorus (P) discharge variations is needed for improved modelling and prioritisation of abatement strategies that take into account local conditions . This study is aimed at developing modelling of agricultural Phosphorus losses with improved spatial and temporal resolution, and to compare the accuracy of a detailed process-based model with a rainfall-runoff coefficient-based model. The process-based SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was implemented for five river basins in central Sweden, and results compared with the rainfall-runoff coefficient-based model WATSHMAN (Watershed Management System) for one of these river basins. Parameter settings and attribute values were adapted to Scandinavian soil conditions, crops and management practices. Model performance regarding flow dynamics was overall satisfactory. Comparable results were achieved at several scales. The modelled P load was of high accuracy for the days when monitoring data were available for validation, generally once a month. Modelled monthly P load did not fit as well with averaged monthly monitoring load values, mainly since monthly monitoring often partly or entirely misses the peak flows. The comparison of SWAT and WATSHMAN gave slightly better results for the process-based model (SWAT). Better spatial resolution for input data such as Soil-P content and agricultural management practices will be required to reach modelling results that enable identification of measures adapted to local conditions.

AB  - Eco-certification has become an increasingly popular market-based tool in the endeavor to reduce negative environmental impacts from fisheries and aquaculture. In this study, we aimed at investigating which psychological consumer characteristics influence demand for eco-labeled seafood by correlating consumers' stated purchasing of eco-labeled seafood to nine variables: environmental knowledge regarding seafood production, familiarity with eco-labels, subjective knowledge, pro-environmental self-identification, sense of personal responsibility, concern for negative environmental impacts from seafood production, perceived consumer effectiveness, gender and education. Questionnaires were distributed to consumers in Stockholm, Sweden, and the data were tested with multiple regression analysis using linear modeling and model averaging (n = 371). Two variables were the best predictors of stated purchasing of eco-labeled seafood: (i) recognition and understanding of eco-labels for seafood (Marine Stewardship Council, Fish for Life, Aquaculture Stewardship Council and KRAV); and (ii) concern for negative environmental impacts associated with seafood production. Meanwhile, consumer environmental knowledge was a weaker predictor. Results from this study suggest that strengthening the emotional component of consumer decision-making and improving the level of consumer familiarity with seafood eco-labels could stimulate more pro-environmental seafood consumption.

TI  - Circular Economy in the Built Environment in Finland - A case example of collaboration
T2  - SBE 19 - EMERGING CONCEPTS FOR SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
LA  - English
CP  - Sustainable Built Environment Conference (SBE)
AB  - Circular Economy in the building and construction sector is challenging the conventional habits and models of work. It demands comprehensive collaboration between stakeholders and collaborations even with unconventional partners. Nevertheless, circular economy model can give remarkable opportunities to tackle the climate change with the help of building and construction sector and helps to find sustainable solutions to the growing urbanisation and to expansion of the cities.
   Very crucial obstacle in order to implement circular economy into building and construction sector's processes is the sector's difficulties to adopt new methods. This includes difficulties to use new recycled materials and building components, legislation obstacles, contract models do not support circular economy solutions etc. Often these obstacles are result of absence of life cycle thinking and coordination. Key to solve these kinds of situation where no stakeholder alone can take the responsibility is to gather all the stakeholders together and boost them to solve these cross sectoral obstacles.
   To support the adaptation of circular economy into Finnish building and construction sector, The Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra launched a project "Circular Economy in the Built Environment" in the beginning of year 2018. The coordinator of this project is the Green Building Council Finland. Target of this project is:
   1. To increase the knowledge on circular economy on the construction and building sector
   2. Define how we can support circular economy in building and construction sector and what indicators we can use to authenticate this development
   3. Create new collaboration between different stakeholders
   4. Develop the procurement and designing processes
   The project started by identifying key persons that can advance circular economy in Finland in the building and construction sector. These key persons were asked to point out more circular economy professionals. The project succeeded to collect a network with hundred professionals. With this network and workshops, we defined what circular economy means in build environment and what is our common targets in the implementation of it.
   As a result, in the project we defined seven imperative targets that must happen in the building and construction sector. These targets are:
   1. Construction and building sector have a common goal to advance circular economy
   2. Norm and regulation steer strongly to circular economy
   3. Renewing the habits
   4. Life cycle thinking is the starting point of all planning and design
   5. Areal planning advances circular economy
   6. Procurement support circular economy
   7. All spaces and locations are in maximal use
   In the project we also defined action proposals how to achieve these targets.
   As a conclusion we argue that achieving circular economy targets and actions that the whole sector is ready to implement willingly demands common work and the will to work together must come from the stakeholders themselves. Different stakeholder has different motives, but this does not prevent collaboration if there is a neutral platform where to co-work with colleagues.

AB  - AimThe aim of this study was to gain deeper understandings of nurse-patient relationships in the New Public Management era, by exploring beliefs and practices of nurses and patients in Norwegian public home care.
   BackgroundOrganization of Norwegian home care services is based on New Public Management-ideologies, which have led to a rigidly formalized and task-oriented nursing practice that may jeopardize individual nursing care. Nurse-patient relationships have several positive effects on patients' health and well-being, but organizational boundaries and time pressure affect the quality of relationships.
   DesignFocused ethnography.
   MethodsData were collected between November 2015-July 2016 using participant observation and semi-structured interviews with 10 nurses and eight patients in six different home care areas, in two Norwegian municipalities. Data analysis was based on Roper and Shapiras framework.
   FindingsFindings demonstrate the continued importance of nurse-patient relationships in contemporary home care, while identifying extensive variations in the degree of closeness and emotional involvement. Organizational boundaries, time constraints, high workload, and disharmony between nurses competence and patients complex illnesses, influence practice in ways that reduce the significance of nurse-patient relationships and affect conditions under which they develop and evolve. Facing a system nurses perceive to function suboptimal, they govern practices based on their own professional assessments, and findings indicate cultural patterns in the way both nurses and patients prioritize to safeguard nurse-patient relationships.
   ConclusionHome care cultures based on traditional nursing values continue, despite New Public Management influences, but a transition into New Public Management culture may, over time, influence the quality of nurse-patient relationships and meanings attributed to them.

T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Sustainable development as a process towards sustainability requires collaboration among societal actors and stakeholders at multiple levels. A key issue is to provide them with that they have comprehensive and transparent knowledge base representing the state and trends of different dimensions of sustainability. This study addresses the need to analyse and present data of sustainability as a foundation for the sustainable development process within municipalities, and among them. As a case study, we focus on 18 municipalities in the crisis-struck Bergslagen region in Sweden and compare them with 101 surrounding municipalities. Data from 2001 and 2006 on 15 indicators representing ecological, economic and social sustainability criteria were transformed to a common scale through normalization around the median, and summarized. Bergslagen region municipalities performed poorer than the surrounding ones for all dimensions in 2006. The change from 2001 to 2006 was positive for economic and social criteria, while the ecological dimension developed negatively in all municipalities. We stress the need for municipalities to collaborate with each other and other actors both at municipal and regional levels, and to use sustainability indicators as a base for informed planning processes. We propose visualization of indicators using maps to support decision-making and social learning.

AB  - The Great Snipe Gallinago media is considered to be an endangered species. This paper examines its food and habitat use on a sub-alpine/low-alpine breeding area in central Norway. It was estimated that earthworms constitute more than 90% of Great Snipe food (by weight). Feeding birds selected the low herb willow scrub vegetation community and to a lesser degree eutrophic fen. Birds did not selectively feed on eutrophic dwarf birch/juniper heath despite it being the third most used vegetation community by virtue of its extent. Although soil penetrability, vegetation cover and earthworm density varied across vegetation communities, Great Snipe selected sites with similar habitat characteristics in different vegetation communities. Great Snipe seemed to select for an optimal combination of soil penetrability and earthworm density, and for medium scrub cover. Nests were found in a broad range of vegetation communities, but only low herb willow scrub was selectively used. However, an equal number of nests was found in eutrophic fen due to its larger extent. Dense vegetation cover around nests and short flushing distance of incubating females indicate low sensitivity to disturbance. We consider the Great Snipe to be a food and habitat specialist, requiring habitats rich in sub-surface invertebrates to breed. This may explain its scattered distribution in Scandinavia, and may render it vulnerable to habitat modification and loss.

AB  - Fluctuations in sulphur (S) content in tree rings were analysed for a 93 years long period (1915-2007) by laser ablation system coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer from three Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) trees grown in the Rachitis Cirque, Calimani Mts, Eastern Carpathians. Investigated domain envelops the period of degraded climatic sensitivity of pines' growth. Chemical data were standardized for sapwood and heartwood separately. The averaged sulphur record calculated from the three individual records unequivocally presents anomalously high S content for the tree rings dated to 1970s and 1980s. Ring-width fluctuation portrays changes of summer temperature but from 1966 to 1986 pines produced apparently larger rings than the corresponding summer temperatures can explain. This deviating interval coincides with the period of exploitation in the nearby sulphur mine. The elevated S content in tree rings refers probably to the dispersion of S-rich dust around the mine owing to the opencast type of exploitation. The divergent growth trend and degraded climatic signal likely due to the anthropogenic altered nutritional status of the site, as residues from nitrogen fertilizer, applied as a compound of explosive in the opencast sulphur exploitation, could be deposited on the surrounding forest.

AB  - Data on the impact of forest management practices on ectomycorrhizal community structure remains fragmentary and mainly originates from studies in northern coniferous forests. This study focuses on a comparison of ectomycorrhizal communities between canopy gaps and closed canopy areas within natural and managed beech-dominated forests at four locations in Europe. We used high resolution rDNA techniques to identify ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi and attempted to extract potential stand-, gap-, soil-, and selected environmentally derived variables by applying multivariate analysis and ordination for pooling of ecological groups of ectomycorrhiza. A significant reduction of diversity indices, ectomycorrhizal and fine root dynamics, in gaps in comparison with closed canopy stands indicates an effect of forest management practice and the high importance of maintaining and protecting natural forest areas for conservation of soil biodiversity and forest genetic resources. The ordination analysis revealed three groups of ectomycorrhiza correlated with changing environmental conditions. The litter and soil pH, number of beech seedlings, and presence of a gap had a pronounced effect on the ectomycorrhizal community. Combined analysis of ectomycorrhiza and environmental factors using correspondence analysis provided an insight into the ecological preferences of the analysed species and confirmed that environmental factors drive ectomycorrhizal community changes.

AB  - Meeting targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture will require the implementation of effective mitigation measures. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently recognised that to succeed we need to understand more about the conditions within which mitigation measures are applied, and for this, they note, we need insights from social science disciplines including sociology. We addressed this knowledge gap by using the concept of path-dependency and lock-in to explore barriers to change in dairy/beef systems in Norway. A qualitative survey of 29 farms found that changing parenting, recreational and spousal role expectations are driving farmers towards intensification (and thus higher emissions) in order to purchase milking robots, which, in turn, provide increased time for the expected role changes. Structural change is thus predominantly directed towards farm continuity which is making it increasingly difficult to meet mitigation targets in the future. The study illustrates how mitigation measures might be made more effective by understanding and addressing the broader cultural/structural environment within which farmers and their families operate.

AB  - The effect of storage on the fuelwood properties of Norway spruce logging residue were studied. The characteristics under study included moisture and needle content, and elemental composition. Storages included uncomminuted residue piles on the clear-cut left by single grip harvester, uncomminuted residue in large windrows at road side landing and as a third alternative a comminuted, compacted and non-compacted residue piles at a terminal. The initial moisture content of fresh residue was 56% on green weight basis. After one-year storage the residue at the clear-cut had reached an average moisture content of 28.5 and 42.2% at the landing. The moisture content of comminuted material had risen to 65.3% during nine-month storage. The original needle content of fresh logging residue was 27.7% and one year later it had decreased to 6.9% on the clear-cut and to 18.9% on the landing. The carbon content of the comminuted material had increased significantly from 50.0% to 51.1-51.3%. Simultaneously hydrogen content had decreased from 6.6 to 5.7%. Compaction had no significant effect on the carbon-hydrogen ratio. However, compaction did decrease pile temperature indicating lower dry matter losses in the compacted pile. The release of nutrients from the needles is dow. From the soil nutrition point of view, the shedding of needles is a more important factor than release of nutrients from the needles intact.

AB  - Detailed planning for housing development is the responsibility of the respective municipalities in Sweden. Further, an ambition to develop sustainable building solutions based on wood is combined with each municipality's building requirements, which increases complexity in the public process. Public actions leading to increased construction of wooden multi-family houses are important for all actors in this process, which is managed by municipalities through the Public Procurement Act or the land allocation process, depending on their development plan and strategy. The aim is to shed light on how the land allocation process is currently performed, to improve efficiency and provide transparency and structure between developers and municipalities. The study uses the public procurement process as a conceptual model to structure the various activities in the land allocation process based on the similarities between the two processes. Thereafter, it is applied to the tender-based land allocation process to provide a transparent process for municipalities to follow. The results display discrepancies in perception of the land allocation process and the level of competence displayed by municipalities when managing this process. This hinders the development of wooden multi-family houses in Sweden.

AB  - Little is known about dispersal in deep-sea ecosystems, especially for sponges, which are abundant ecosystem engineers. Understanding patterns of gene flow in deep-sea sponges is essential, especially in areas where rising pressure from anthropogenic activities makes difficult to combine management and conservation. Here, we combined population genomics and oceanographic modelling to understand how Northeast Atlantic populations (Cantabrian Sea to Norway) of the deep-sea sponge Phakellia ventilabrum are connected. The analysis comprised ddRADseq derived SNP datasets of 166 individuals collected from 57 sampling stations from 17 different areas, including two Marine Protected Areas, one Special Area of Conservation and other areas with different levels of protection. The 4,017 neutral SNPs used indicated high connectivity and panmixis amongst the majority of areas (Ireland to Norway), spanning ca. 2,500-km at depths of 99-900 m. This was likely due to the presence of strong ocean currents allowing long-distance larval transport, as supported by our migration analysis and by 3D particle tracking modelling. On the contrary, the Cantabrian Sea and Roscoff (France) samples, the southernmost areas in our study, appeared disconnected from the remaining areas, probably due to prevailing current circulation patterns and topographic features, which might be acting as barriers for gene flow. Despite this major genetic break, our results suggest that all protected areas studied are well-connected with each other. Interestingly, analysis of SNPs under selection replicated results obtained for neutral SNPs. The relatively low genetic diversity observed along the study area, though, highlights the potential fragility of this species to changing climates, which might compromise resilience to future threats.

AB  - In this study, the WOFOST crop simulation model was used together with comprehensive empirical databases on barley Hordeum vulgare L. to study the contributions of different yield-determining and -limiting factors to observed trends of barley yield in Finland from 1988 to 2008. Simulations were performed at 3 study sites representing different agro-ecological zones, and compared with the data from experimental sites and that reported by local farmers. Yield gaps between simulated potential yields and farmers' yields and their trends were assessed. Positive observed yield trends of Finnish barley mostly resulted from the development and usage of new, high-yielding cultivars. Simulated trends in climatic potential and water-limited potential yields of individual cultivars showed a slight declining trend. Yield gaps showed an increasing trend in 2 out of 3 study areas. Since the mid-1990s, a major reason for this has been the lack of market and policy incentives favouring crop management decisions, i.e. annual fertilisation, soil maintenance, drainage and crop rotation decisions, aiming for higher yields. The study indicates potential options for increasing or maintaining barley yields in the future. The breeding of new climate-resilient cultivars is the primary option. However, this needs to work alongside overall adjustments to farm management and must be supported by financial incentives for farmers to increase yields.

AB  - Birds breeding in urban environments have lower reproductive output compared to rural conspecifics, most likely because of food limitation. However, which characteristics of urban environments may cause this deficiency is not clear. Here, we investigated how tree composition within urban territories of passerine birds is associated with breeding probability and reproductive success. We used 7 years of data of breeding occupancy for blue and great tits (Cyanistes caeruleus; Parus major) and several reproductive traits for great tits, from 400 urban nest boxes located in 5 parks within the city of Malmo, Sweden. We found that tits, overall, were less likely to breed in territories dominated by either non-native trees or beech trees. Great tit chicks reared in territories dominated by non-native trees weighed significantly less, compared to territories with fewer non-native trees. An earlier onset of breeding correlated with increased chick weight in great tits. Increasing number of common oak trees (Quercus robur) was associated with delayed onset of breeding in great tits. Notably, as offspring survival probability generally increased by breeding earlier, in particular in oak-dominated territories, our results suggest that delayed onset of breeding induced by oak trees may be maladaptive and indicate a mismatch to this food source. Our results demonstrate that tree composition may have important consequences on breeding success of urban birds, but some of these effects are not consistent between years, highlighting the need to account for temporal effects to understand determinants of breeding success and inform optimal management in urban green spaces.

AB  - Sewage management exhibits all characteristics of a 'wicked' problem: it is framed as a technical problem even though it is surrounded by scientific uncertainties, and the framing hides both value-frameworks and the unequal distribution of risks and benefits. In this study, we analyze how uncertainties and the limits of scientific knowledge are approached and communicated in two jurisdictions that presently are in the process of revising their regulatory frameworks pertaining to land application of the residuals remaining after sewage treatment: Sweden, which Is governed by the EU Directive 86/278/EEG, and the Canadian province of British Columbia, which draws heavily on the US EPA503 Rule. We find that the two Jurisdictions take very different approaches to uncertainty and ignorance: The BC framing rests on the presumption that no evidence of harm can be taken as evidence that the practice is safe and draws on a persuasive narrative to that end. In contrast, the Swedish narrative rests on the presumption that absence of evidence cannot be taken as evidence of absence and that it therefore is better to hark on the safe side, when it is technically possible. The BC framing is indicative of a classic risk assessment approach and public acceptance is addressed as a knowledge deficit problem. The pursuasive tone and lack of transparency appears to negatively impact residents' trust in regulatory agencies. The Swedish framework takes a more precautionary approach, combining risk assessment with hazard determination and uses a deliberative and transparent approach, seemingly producing more socially 'robust' knowledge. Even though Sweden pays considerable attention to the challenges involved in making assessments based on limited data, the limits of science-based knowledge is not touched upon. In fact, Sweden and BC signal a similar view on humanities' ability to create reliable knowldge: given sufficient time, it will eveutally be possible to close the knowledge gaps and develop reliable (technical) solutions. We argue that treating the problem as if it is a technical challenge at its heart hides social aspects and forward that the value judgements that underlie hazard determinantions and risk assessments must be transparently identified and communicated, including the assessment of uncertainty and the limits of science, to avoid increased polarization and thus hardened conflicts.

AB  - Accommodation businesses are increasingly dependent on a limited number of reservation platforms. A significant feature of these platforms is guest evaluations, which are transformed into ratings and rankings. As the positioning of the business in comparison to competitors determines customer demand, accommodation managers have considerable interest in maintaining or improving their online reputation. One response may be to engage in manipulation strategies. This paper presents the results of a survey including 270 hotel managers in five countries, Germany, Israel, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Managers confirm growing competition as a result of ratings and rankings, and they report that guests are increasingly aware of the importance of reviews. To avert negative online feedback impacts, managers intervene strategically. The paper discusses new market pressures, emergent consumer judgement culture and consumer citizenship, opportunities for legal redress and the emerging importance of reputation management strategies.

AB  - Energy transitions are in many respects past the early exploration stages and moving towards the urgently needed mass market take-up. We examine the Finnish energy transition regarding how solutions - heat-pumps, deep retrofits and new district-wide solutions - that have demonstrated economic benefits and reasonable payback times have faced slow uptake and slow market development. We focus on the difficulties that suppliers and adopters face in establishing the value and singularization of goods when adopters need to act as calculative agents in the market. When the intermediation processes needed for market development do not cover the all the needed aspects, these market difficulties can persist until late in the transition process. We further elaborate how the intermediation takes place in ecologies of actors that become complex once the complexity of goods grows and the intermediation becomes tied to formalized arenas such as those found in urban development. Periodic assessment of the effectiveness of markets and ecologies of intermediation can inform policy interventions on market development.

AB  - The main aim of the study was to investigate whether attitudes toward traffic safety, risk perception, worry, risk tolerance, safety priority, and accident involvement are associated with cyclists' risk-taking behaviour. Two types of cyclists' risk-taking behaviour were studied: (1) 'violation of traffic rules, and (2) 'conflicts with other road users when cycling'. The study was based on a questionnaire survey carried out in 2017 among regular cyclists in Norway (n = 426). The results revealed that cyclists' risk-taking behaviour was influenced by their attitudes, risk perception, and accident involvement. Pragmatic attitudes toward traffic rule violations and safety priority were found to be important predictors of the frequency of rule violations when cycling. Attitudes towards the enforcement of traffic rules for cyclists and dissatisfaction with the traffic rules for cyclists were found to be important predictors for the frequency of situations involving conflicts with other road users. Risk perception and accident involvement were found to be associated with conflicts with other road users, but not with rule violations when cycling. The findings show that risk perception and attitudes toward traffic safety are important for cyclists' risk-taking behaviour in traffic. The road infrastructure and the traffic regulations are primarily planned for car drivers and pedestrians. If cyclists' attitudes are to be changed, the cycling infrastructure and traffic rules for cyclists would need to be adjusted to cyclists as road users. When building new infrastructure and implementing new safety measures for cyclists, it is important to include attitude campaigns, as well as communications to the public about safety and the risks linked to cycling. Attitude campaigns could be used to strengthen the authorities' communications that cyclists are prioritized as road users. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Organic matter (OM) is a key component of lake sediments, affecting carbon, nutrient, and trace metal cycling at local and global scales. Yet little is known about long-term (millennial) changes in OM composition due to the inherent chemical complexity arising from multiple OM sources and from secondary transformations. In this study we explore how the molecular composition of OM changes throughout the Holocene in two adjacent boreal lakes in central Sweden and compare molecular-level information with conventional OM variables, including total carbon, total nitrogen, C:N ratios, delta C-13, and delta N-15. To characterize the molecular OM composition, we employed a new method based on pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), which yields semiquantitative data on > 100 organic compounds of different origin and degradation status. We identify large changes in OM composition after deglaciation (circa 8500 +/- 500 B.C.), associated with early landscape development, and during the most recent 4050 years, driven by degradation processes. With molecular(-)level information we can also distinguish between natural landscape development and human catchment disturbance during the last 1700 years. Our study demonstrates that characterization of the molecular OM composition by the high-throughput PyGC/MS method is an efficient complement to conventional OM variables for identification and understanding of past OM dynamics in lake-sediment records. Holocene changes observed for pyrolytic compounds and compound classes known for having different reactivity indicate the need for further paleo-reconstruction of the molecular OM composition to better understand both past and future OM dynamics and associated environmental changes.

AB  - This article is based on a study that investigated social cognitive psychological factors associated with economic thresholds related to using public or other sustainable transport modes. A survey was conducted using a random sample of the Norwegian population living in the six largest urban regions (n = 1039). The respondents were asked to indicate the monthly increase in car taxes and fees that they would perceive necessary to make them use sustainable transport modes instead of their private car. The findings revealed that those who perceived themselves as definitive car users (strongly reluctant to change transport mode) reported low tolerance of push measures, low awareness of and ascription of responsibility for the consequences of car use, and weak environmental norms. Environmental norms, attitudes towards transport and push measure tolerance were the strongest predictors of the respondents belonging to either the lowest or the highest threshold groups. The authors conclude that measures aimed at increasing the costs of car use and improving the accessibility of public transport in urban areas could be supplemented by social cognitive factors.

AB  - Translocation experiments can be used to study the factors limiting species' distributions and to infer potential drivers of successful colonisation during range shifts. To study the expansion dynamics of the butterflyPyrgus armoricanusin southern Sweden and to find out whether its distribution was limited by climate, translocation experiments were carried out within and 50-60 km beyond its natural range margin. Populations were monitored for 8 years following the translocation. Although most translocation attempts failed,P. armoricanuswas able to survive in two sites north of its current range limit. One of them eventually led to expansion and establishment of a viable metapopulation. Translocation success appeared to be independent of latitude, suggesting that climate is not the main factor determining the current northern distribution limits of this butterfly. Population growth and secondary spread in the expanding population were positively related to patch area and connectivity, while local habitat quality seemed to be less important. The successful translocation and the importance of a well-connected patch network suggest that the current distribution ofP. armoricanusis limited by its low dispersal ability combined with the fragmentation of its habitat, making it unlikely to track its changing climatic niche. Assisted migration could be an effective tool for such species, but long-term evidence for its effectiveness is not yet available.

AB  - Spiders were sampled from spruce branches during late winter in northern Sweden, to investigate the effects of forestry on the community structure of al boreal spiders. Five lichen-rich, natural spruce Picea abies forests and adjacent mature, selectively-logged lichen-poor forests were selected as sample sites. Lichen-rich forests had over three times more spiders on the branches than the lichen-poor forests. The spider community was dominated by web spinners, i.e. the Families Limyphiidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Theridiidae. Hunters, i.e. Philodromidae and Clubionidae, comprised <3% of the individuals and >82% of all spiders were juveniles.
   Among the dominant species. only the orb-weaver Araneus nordmanni was found in all sites whereas the sheet-web spider Lepthyphantes suffusus was found in all Ave lichen-rich forests but only in two of the lichen-poor. Both species composition and dominance differed from spider communities in southern boreal spruce canopies. Small pr ey items, severe abiotic conditions and high predation pressure from birds are possible reasons why web spiders dominate the arboreal community in northern Sweden. These factors could also explain the observed shift in dominance From sheet-web spiders with large body size to those with a small body size, compared with arboreal spider communities in southern boreal forests.
   Diversity indices (jack-knifing of Simpson index and Q statistic) showed a higher diversity of spiders in lichen-rich than in lichen-poor forests. The richen-rich forest had more species and less dominance, in both rank abundance and the Berger-Parker index of dominance. However, rarefraction plots indicated no differences besides lower abundance of spiders on sampled branches in lichen-poor forests. It is suggested, that habitat structure (branch size and epiphytic lichen abundance) could be an explanation for the greater number of spiders in old, lichen-rich spruce forests.

AB  - This study examined predator faunas of artificial ground and shrub nests and whether nest predation risk was influenced by nest site, proximity to forest edge, and habitat structure in 38 grassland plots in southcentral Sweden. There was a clear separation of predator faunas between shrub and ground nests as identified from marks in plasticine eggs. Corvids accounted for almost all predation on shrub nests whereas mammals mainly depredated ground nests. Nest predation risk was significantly greater for shrub than for ground nests at all distances (i.e. 0, 15 and 30 m) from the forest edge. However, nest predation risk was not significantly related to distance to forest edge, but: significantly increased with decreasing distance to the nearest tree. Different corvid species robbed nests at different distances from the forest edge, with jays robbing nests closest to edges. We conclude that the relationship between the predation risk of grassland bird nests and distance to the forest edge mainly depends on the relative importance of different nest predator species and on the structure of the forest edge zone. A review of published articles on artificial shrub and ground nest predation in the temperate zone corroborated the results of our own study, namely that shrub nests experienced higher rates of depredation in open habitats close to the forest edge and that avian predators predominantly robbed shrub nests. Furthermore, the review results showed that predation rates on nests in general are highest <50 m inside the forest and lower in open as well as forest interior habitats (greater than or equal to 50 m from the edge).

AB  - In forestry, it is still common to plant the seedlings of and cultivate Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) at lower altitudes; however, the climatic change that has been occurring increases evaporative demands in these areas. As a result, the spruce evidently suffers from drought, withers and loses its power to grow, thus, influencing stem thickness and tree-height growth, as well as biomass production. Therefore, the growth and biomass production of young (5-, 15- and 25-year-old) Norway spruce stands at these altitudes (i.e., from 200 to 500 m a.s.l.) was surveyed, as a case study, across the Training Forest Enterprise "Masaryk Forest" Krtiny. There, 48 stands with a varied representation of spruce (i.e., up to 30%, 31%-60%, 61%-90% and over 91%) were analyzed. In each stand, 12 trees were sampled across all social status classes (i.e., sub-dominant, co-dominant and dominant) in detail. Basic dendrometric parameters (such as the total tree height, height of the crown base and stem diameter at breast height) and the amount of the above-ground tree organ biomass (i.e., stem, branches and needles) were investigated. Based on the trends found in the biomass production here and climate change predictions, we recommend that Norway spruce be cultivated only in zones from an altitude of ca 400 m a.s.l., with an annual precipitation of 700 mm and an average annual temperature of 7 degrees C, and its percentage representation in the stand be no more than 30%.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization are two major challenges when planning for sustainable energy transition in cities. The common approach for energy demand estimation is using only typical meso-scale weather data in building energy models (BEMs), which underestimates the impacts of extreme climate and microclimate variations. To quantify the impacts of such underestimation on assessing the future energy performance of buildings, this study simulates a high spatiotemporal resolution BEM for two representative residential buildings located in a 600 x 600 m2 urban area in Southeast Sweden while accounting for both climate change and microclimate. Future climate data are synthesized using 13 future climate scenarios over 2010-2099, divided into three 30-year periods, and microclimate data are generated considering the urban morphology of the area. It is revealed that microclimate can cause 17% rise in cooling degree-day (CDD) and 7% reduction in heating degree-day (HDD) on average compared to mesoclimate. Considering typical weather conditions, CDD increases by 45% and HDD decreases by 8% from one 30-year period to another. Differences can become much larger during extreme weather conditions. For example, CDD can increase by 500% in an extreme warm July compared to a typical one. Results also indicate that annual cooling demand becomes four and five times bigger than 2010-2039 in 2040-2069 and 2070-2099, respectively. The daily peak cooling load can increase up to 25% in an extreme warm day when accounting for microclimate. In the absence of cooling systems during extreme warm days, the indoor temperature stays above 26 degrees C continuously over a week and reaches above 29.2 degrees C. Moreover, the annual overheating hours can increase up to 140% in the future. These all indicate that not accounting for influencing climate variations can result in maladaptation or insufficient adaptation of urban areas to climate change.

AB  - Using data collected during 2006-2008 from a monitored segment (18 vessels) of the Norwegian coastal fleet (vessels <15 m) of gillnetters targeting monkfish and cod, we used general additive models (GAMs) to derive bycatch rates of harbour porpoise. These bycatch rates were then applied to fishery catch data on the target species to estimate the total number of porpoise taken by the coastal gillnet fisheries. The two best models estimated bycatches of 20,719 and 20,989 porpoises during 2006-2008, with CVs 36% and 27%, respectively. Thus, about 6900 harbour porpoises are taken annually in the coastal monkfish and cod gillnet fisheries. Although no abundance estimate is available for the coastal harbour porpoise population, this annual bycatch is likely not sustainable according to the management objectives defined by ASCOBANS. In the cod gillnet fishery, harbour porpoise bycatch rates decreased rapidly with increasing depth to 50 m and then levelled off. In the monkfish gillnet fishery, bycatch rates decreased linearly with increasing depth throughout the depth range fished. To reduce harbour porpoise bycatches, we recommend that large mesh nets associated with the monkfish fishery to be prohibited at depths less than 50 m. We also recommend to conduct experiments using Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDS or 'pingers') on nets set deeper than 50 m. If these devices prove successful in reducing porpoise bycatch, we propose that ADDs should be implemented in the Norwegian coastal gillnet fisheries for cod and monkfish. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many studies have explored how the tourism sector and tourism policies understand and relate to the concept of sustainable development. A common conclusion is that tourism concentrates on economic and social viability at the expense of environmental sustainable development. This paper considers if and how the concept of environmental policy integration (EPI) could improve sustainable tourism policy implementation. It defines EPI, and explores both the three-level (co-ordination, harmonization and prioritization) and four-level (inclusion, consistency, priorities and reporting) EPI approaches. It notes that there is both strong and weak EPI, and both political systems and policy analysis approaches. The paper then describes Norway's post-2007 adoption of sustainable tourism as a central part of its national tourism development strategy, with 10 defined principles, and suggested defined development standards, and assesses the implementation of the national strategy through the lens of the EPI concept. While there are now 18 pilot sustainable tourism destinations, with 44 criteria and 108 indicators, there remain many difficult issues to address. A series of suggestions are made, the chief of which is the need for a politically strong central authority that has been entrusted with having environmental concerns within the tourism sector as its key mandate.

AB  - The role of transportation in the economic process is central. Transportation's benefits, however, can be dampened because of its environmental and social cost. A central question then arises as to the degre of sustainability of a national transportation system. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model to define and assess national transportation sustainability. The model relies on a number of indicators encompassing environmental impact, efficiency, safety, and economic contributions. Statistical data manipulations and fuzzy multistage reasoning result in an overall sustainability index over [0, 1]. A sensitivity analysis uncovers those indicators with the highest potential for improving transportation sustainability. Thirty European countries are ranked and the most important indicators for each country are pinpointed. It is demonstrated that greatest improvement will be achieved with the reduction of passenger car use, road freight transportation, and fatal accidents. Counterintuitively, Norway, Austria, Denmark, and Luxembourg rank at the bottom of the list together with Bulgaria, Greece, and Malta. This is due to their poor environmental performance and their small sustainability progress over 2010-2020.

AB  - The global biodiversity is in decline because modern societies are organized for that purpose. The design, implementation and enforcement of international, regional and national environmental policies have not helped to reverse the trend. In our paper, we analyze the hardship of protecting the gray wolf in Finland, the big-leaf mahogany in Peru, and the Amur tiger in Russia. Our comparative approach is based on the old institutional economics, and our key concept - the unit of analysis - is a transaction, i.e. enactment, practice and transfer of formal and informal rights to future benefits. Transactions challenge, disturb and re-organize the existing institutional scaffold. William Connolly (The Fragility of Things, 2013) and Terrence Deacon (Incomplete Nature, 2012) have recently argued that teleodynamics, the purposeful and end-directed behaviors and the reactions and disturbances in other related ententional behaviors are key to understand not only the dynamics of institutional change per se but also, and especially so, the emergent patterns of behavior resulting from resistance and adaptation. These teleodynamic consequences reveal the problems in institutional fit, i.e. how the institutional arrangements, particular customary circumstances and habitual actors fit together. We abduct three types of emerging order springing from the reactions to national biodiversity policies: (i) the practice of faking the institutional fit, (ii) the practice of disobedience; and, (iii) willingness to take part in the making of new institutional arrangements. These vary according to the purpose, working rules (set of rights) and motivation. We explain the interrelated meaning of purpose, working rules and motivation in the context of institutional fit in detail. In our cases, the fit is not exactly the one envisioned through the authoritative rules and the purpose of institutional conservation, but it is an order nevertheless, and that order is not necessarily good for endangered species.

AB  - We investigated physiological responses of 7-week-old Norway spruce seedlings to water deficits of different intensities. Hydroponically grown seedlings were subjected to mild (-0.15 MPa), strong (-0.5 and -1.0 MPa) and extreme (-1.5 MPa) water deficit induced by polyethylene glycol 6000, and their growth parameters, water status and physiological activity were analyzed. Seedlings effectively restricted water loss under drought, and even under extreme water deficit, shoot relative water content did not fall below 85%. Water stress induced substantial decreases in the osmotic potentials of root and needle cell sap, up to 0.3-0.4 MPa under extreme water deficit, though this did not result from water loss or accumulation of K+ and Na+ ions. Seedling growth was very susceptible to water stress because of poor capacity for cell wall adjustment. Water stress injured seedling roots, as evidenced by the loss of root cell physiological activity estimated by the ability to hydrolyse fluorescein diacetate and by increased root calcium content up to 8-10-fold under extreme water stress. At the same time, root hair growth was enhanced, especially under mild water deficit, which increased the root water-absorbing capacity. In summary, seedlings of Norway spruce were characterized by high susceptibility to water stress and concurrently by pronounced ability to maintain water status. These characteristics are fully consistent with spruce confinement to moist habitats.

AB  - Human disturbances in the alpine region can have long-lasting ecosystem effects because biological recovery in harsh environments proceeds slowly. As a by-product of the exploitation of hydroelectricity, surplus masses from tunnel excavations are deposited as spoil heaps in the alpine landscape. The typical management goal for such spoil heaps is that their species composition converges towards that of their undisturbed surroundings. At present we lack knowledge of the rate as well as the direction of these successions. We examined the species composition of five alpine spoil heaps in western Norway at two points in time, after 6-16, and 24-34 years of succession, with regard to vegetation cover, species richness, species composition and soil conditions. We also compared the vegetation of spoil heaps with that of their surroundings. After ca. 30 years, bryophyte and lichen cover and species richness were similar to those of their surroundings, while cover of vascular plants and species richness recovered more slowly. The vegetation development of spoil heaps appears safe-site limited rather than dispersal limited. Topsoil development was slow, but some accumulation of organic matter was observed. The species composition followed a successional trajectory in direction of the vegetation of the surroundings. Estimated linear successional rates indicate that 35-48 years are needed from construction of spoil heaps till a species composition more or less similar to their surroundings has been reached. However, these estimates are likely to be over-optimistic because successional rates tend to decrease with time. Based on our results we propose three changes to the current spoil-heap construction practice that will improve their restoration: (1) to increase surface unevenness, by which the number of safe sites will increase and germination and establishment success will be enhanced; (2) to increase substrate variability, by adding more of fine-grained materials more species will establish in shorter time; and (3) to use seed from local sources or to let the spoil heaps regenerate naturally.

AB  - The first aim of the present study was to investigate the applicability of the three-factor structure (aggressive violations, ordinary violations, and errors) of the Manchester Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and then to compare these driving behaviours across the six countries (Finland, Great Britain, Greece, Iran, The Netherlands, and Turkey). The third aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of driving styles in the relationship between traffic cultures (countries) and the number of traffic accidents utilizing a mediational framework. The fourth aim of this paper was to investigate the relationship between the three factors of DBQ and the number of traffic accidents in each country. Two hundred and forty-two drivers were chosen from each of the six countries, matched for age and sex. The results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that the fit of the three-factor model of DBQ was partially satisfactory in each country. Exploratory factor analyses together with target (Procrustes) rotation and factorial agreement indexes showed that the "ordinary violations" factor was fully congruent and the "errors" factor was fairly congruent across countries. Reliabilities of the scales were at the same level as in the original British data. ANOVA results revealed differences between drivers from "safe" Western/Northern European and Southern European/Middle Eastern countries on DBQ items and scales. Results demonstrated that driving style mediates the relationship between traffic culture (i.e. country) and the number of accidents. Poisson and negative binomial regression analyses also showed that the importance of driver characteristics and behaviours in predicting the number of traffic accidents varies from country to country.

AB  - The northern pike is a species of eco-evolutionary and socio-economic importance, originally freshwater but adapted to the conditions of brackish bays, lagoons and rivers flowing into seas. It was widespread along the entire coast of the Baltic Sea. A drastic decline in the stocks of Baltic pike in the 20th century caused large-scale stocking activities in the area, often based on non-native material from more abundant freshwater pike pop-ulations. Research into the genetic variation and structure of this species in the Baltic Sea is necessary as part of the key knowledge required for the management and conservation of the species. Applying eleven microsatellite markers, we analysed the genetic structure of 495 Baltic Sea pike sampled along the Polish coastal waters and including distant Danish population, collected in Pr AE sto Fjord, in south-eastern Zealand Island. Using traditional F-statistics and a Bayesian approach we confirmed the presence of genetic structure within the analysed region. It was most likely the result of both evolutionary forces and anthropogenic factors. The analyses showed that genetic differentiation observed for the Danish and the others populations generally increased with the geographical distance, populations from the Puck Bay were distinct from the other, and the populations related to the Vistula delta and the Vistula itself form a strong common cluster. Our results contribute to current knowledge on the population genetics of Baltic Sea pike in a previously unstudied area and are in line with calls for on-going conservation, management and restoration activities for coastal Baltic pike to preserve existing genetic differences between different populations and avoid activities that potentially increase genetic homogenization.

AB  - Competition is, in many ways, a source related to quality in the sense that less competitive firms will be outdistanced through a balance in supply and demand. In high-risk industries, however, safety must be balanced with production, which is not always an easy choice. In the rider training industry, driving schools and instructors teach others how to behave and think in and relate to a complex road traffic system while being vulnerable on a powered two-wheel (PTW) vehicle. Knowing which training is optimal is not easy, but the Norwegian learner curricula and regulations serve as guidelines. However, in competition with other driving schools, this training might be adjusted because of competitive elements in addition to the intentions of the curricula. Thus, our research question is 'How can competition affect the quality of the rider training system and thus road safety in Norway?' For this research, sixteen interviews were conducted, and thematic analysis was used for analysing the data. The findings in this study were that competition affects three factors of the rider training system related to safety. These were (1) course-related training, (2) less strict assessment, and (3) test-oriented training. The conclusion is that competition partly has a negative effect on safety in the rider training industry in Norway.

AB  - The growing demand for aquaculture products can only be maintained by increasing the production of lower trophic species such as bivalves and tunicates. Low trophic species avoid the energy losses during trophic transfers to build animal protein, making them ideal candidates to exploit available resources in coastal waters. In the particular case of fjords, forced upwelling of deep nutrient-rich waters can promote phytoplankton growth, or in other words, the growth of bivalve and tunicate food. However, the density at which bivalves and tunicates are cultured can compromise phytoplankton populations and consequently, marine food chains. A highly configurable environmental model was constructed to study the ecosystem effects and potential biomass production of hypothetical bivalve and tunicate aquaculture scenarios in a Norwegian fjord under forced upwelling conditions. The simulations objectively determined the level of aquaculture development that maximizes the sustainable utilization of resources towards bivalves and tunicates biomass production. The model also highlighted the positive effect of the forced upwelling on both cultured production and phytoplankton abundance under aquaculture scenarios. Finally, the model predicted that tunicates would be more efficient than mussels at extracting resources due to their lower metabolic cost and higher filtration capacity. Although a full economic analysis would be required to decide on the preferred species to be cultured, these results encourage current pilot studies in which tunicates are explored as a sustainable way to efficiently exploit marine resources for aquafeed production.

AB  - Diffuse phosphorus losses from arable land contribute significantly to eutrophication in many regions. To enable the most efficient measures for reducing P losses to be identified, it is important to quantify the contributions from different sources and the effects of various scenarios aimed at reducing these losses. To account for transport to tile-drains through macropores, we extended the field-scale simulation model ICECREAM with descriptions based on mixing layer and dual porosity concepts. For losses of particulate phosphorus (PP) to tile-drains, a new description of particle generation and detachment was included. The model was applied on a 6-year field experiment on a structured clay soil in south-west Sweden and simulation results were compared with measured water flow and losses of suspended particles (SP), PP and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) to tile-drains. After calibration of parameters related to macropore flow and transport, and to particle generation and detachment, the model could describe the extremely episodic losses of SP, PP and DRP reasonably accurately. However, some short-term fluctuations were not captured (model efficiency during the validation period -2.1 for PP and 0.43 for DRP). Thus, further development and testing are required before the model can be used with confidence for predictive applications or management purposes. Based on this application, we suggest that direct leaching from non-decomposed plant material and infiltration in partly frozen soil be included in the ICECREAM model. We also suggest that the controls on the sorption distribution coefficient for partitioning between DRP and labile phosphorus (PL) and the effects of using the 'storage routing' equation for calculation of soil water content instead of the Richards equation be further investigated.

AB  - The environmental impacts of 16 different contaminants originating from the E18 Highway (17,510 annual average daily traffic) were studied over the initial months of the highway's operational life. Investigative methods used included electrical resistivity surveying, water chemistry analyses, soil analyses, distribution modeling, and transportation modeling of contaminants. The study conclusively showed a year-round infiltration due to melting of the snowpack from road salt, and a strong preferential, anthropogenic pathway due to increased hydraulic conductivities of road construction materials relative to in situ soils. The resistivity surveys produced values well below the expected values for the highway materials, indicating increased ionic content within the unsaturated zone. Time lapse resistivity modeling showed a clear downwards spreading of contamination from the roadway to subsurface distances greater than 5 m. Elevated concentrations of nearly every studied contaminant relative to baseline values were observed, with many metal concentrations within the snow pack averaging values in excess of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency's groundwater limitations. Distribution modeling demonstrated a potential offset of peak values from the road surface due to plowing and splash transport processes, and indicated different distribution behavior during winter months than during summer months. One-dimensional transport modeling demonstrated the importance of adsorption and other retentive factors to the migration of contaminants to groundwater and provided an estimate for potential long-term contaminant concentrations.

AB  - It is imperative for cities to develop sustainable water management and planning strategies in order to best serve urban communities that are currently facing increasing population and water demand. Water resources managers are often chastened by experiencing failures attributed to natural extreme droughts and floods. However, recent changes in water management systems have been responding to these uncertain conditions. Water managers have become thoughtful about the adverse effects of uncertain extreme events on the performance of water supply systems. Natural hydrologic variability and inherent uncertainties associated with the future climate variations make the simulation and management of water supplies a greater challenge. The hydrologic simulation process is one of the main components in integrated water resources management. Hydrologic simulations incorporate uncertain input values, model parameters, and a model structure. Therefore, stochastic streamflow simulation and prediction, and consideration of uncertainty propagation on performance of water supply systems (WSSs) are essential phases for efficient management of these systems. The proposed integrated framework in this study models a WSS by taking into account the dynamic nature of the system and utilizing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to capture the uncertainties associated with hydrologic simulation. Hydrologic responses from the results of a rainfall-runoff model for three watersheds of Karaj, Latyan, and Lar in Tehran, Iran, as the case study are used as inputs to the reservoirs. Results confirm that uncertainties associated with the hydrologic model's parameters propagate through the simulation and lead to a wide variation in reservoir storage and WSS performance metrics such as vulnerability and reliability. For example, water storage simulation in the Karaj Reservoir can vary up to 70% compared with the observed values. This causes contradiction and conflict in the management of reservoirs and water systems and decision making. The results emphasize the importance of analyzing WSS performance under uncertain conditions to improve the simulation of natural processes and support water managers for a more efficient decision-making process.

AB  - In gentrifying cities, entrepreneurial strategies often conflict with the interests of citizens. Cities deal with this differently. Participatory democracy is one method to avoid conflict through increased responsiveness to citizens. Participatory processes are nevertheless particularly challenging in central neighbourhoods where the problems of gentrification are most acute. The present study explains how these participatory processes play out differently depending on the participatory system, the economic situation and the local capacity for collective action. Towards this goal the article compares two deprived neighbourhoods that face these types of problems in the north and south of Europe, Oslo, Norway and Madrid, Spain.

AB  - Information about game population states and hunting regulation are important prerequisites in ensuring the sustainability of populations. Voluntary game monitoring has a potential of being an important factor in addition to the monitoring made by professionals. The main method in the monitoring of many game species in Finland is the wildlife triangle scheme (WTS), providing abundance estimates of about 30 species. The WTS is largely carried out by voluntarily participating hunting teams. Regardless of the long traditions in the hunters' monitoring activity and hunting regulation, very little is known about the characteristics of the hunting teams that have been active in the WTS. To gain more insight into the characteristics of the hunting teams at a national and regional scale, we analysed quantitative questionnaire data on various activities of hunting teams collected by the Hunters' Central Organization. A typical team carrying out censuses has a large number of members and large hunting grounds, and its monitoring activity is also associated with the voluntary regulation of the hunting of grouse as well as other management actions. The findings indicate that especially large hunting teams are active in voluntary game monitoring in Finland, but also small groups of motivated individuals can successfully participate in the WTS.

AB  - The amount of large and old trees has decreased in the boreal forests during the last centuries of forestry. Such trees are important habitats for epiphytic lichens and there is a growing concern for lichen species that are associated with large and old trees. However, only little is known about the relative importance of tree size versus age as determinants of lichen diversity. Here we have determined the size, age and growth rate of 157 Norway spruce trees and recorded the occurrence of epiphytic lichen species on their branches and lower stems. The study includes crustose lichens and was done in two old-growth forests in SE Norway. Tree age and tree size were the parameters that explained the largest part of epiphytic lichen diversity. Only the growth rate of the most recent time period, i.e. 1984-2004, showed a statistically significant relationship to diversity. There was no indication of a stabilising species number with increasing tree age. Slow-growing and old trees were, however, mainly of importance to the lichen species growing on stems, and this set of species were in general adversely affected by a large amount of branches. The opposite was the case for the species that were confined to branches as their diversity increased when the amount of branches increased. Our study adds empirical data to support the importance of large and old trees as bearers of biodiversity in boreal forests. Site preservation and patch retention of groups of old and large trees is recommended as measures to maintain epiphytic lichen diversity.

AB  - Background The regular addition of plant-available nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, either as manufactured fertilisers or animal manure, to agricultural soils is needed for global food security. Increased recycling of nutrients back to agriculture from organic waste streams is necessary for increased rural-urban sustainability. Anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and agricultural wastes is widely applied to stabilize the substrate and also capture its energetic value via biogas production. The liquid phase of anaerobic digestate is a concentrated source of nutrients to which nutrient recovery technologies can be applied. Two such promising technologies that could increase nutrient recycling from e.g. wastewater and thereby contribute to environmental amelioration are struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping. By combining anaerobic digestion and nutrient recovery technologies on the digestate, a treatment process that provides both renewable energy and plant nutrients is achieved. This review will examine the effectiveness of ecotechnologies for the recovery and reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus from anaerobic digestate with the aim of reducing the impact of waste on the environment. Methods We will search for both academic and grey literature published after 2013. English language searches will be performed in 4 bibliographic databases, and Google Scholar, while searches in 41 specialist websites will be performed in English, Finnish, Polish and Swedish. Eligibility screening will be conducted at two levels: title and abstract and full text. Included eligible studies will be subject to a critical appraisal that will assess external and internal study validity. We will extract information on study characteristics, intervention, comparators, effect modifiers, and measured outcomes. Data synthesis will involve narrative synthesis of each included study of sufficient validity. Quantitative synthesis (i.e. meta-analysis) may be possible in cases where a sufficient number of studies report similar types of outcomes.

AB  - A common management aim is to keep large herbivore densities at sustainable levels. However, measuring grazing pressure is difficult. We seek combinations of herb species and morphological traits that serve as indicators of grazing pressure in alpine areas of Scandinavia. In a fully replicated, landscape-scale experiment with three replicates of each of three levels of sheep density (zero, low, and high), we measured grazing frequency (numbers of plants eaten, as a proportion), flowering frequency, and plant height for 17 common herb species for two consecutive grazing seasons. For eight species, grazing frequency varied significantly between treatments, and for four of these species there was additional strong between-year variation. The estimate for total grazing frequency of herbs decreased when more species of decreasing preference were included, and it was significantly lower in the second grazing season. There were large between-year differences in plant height probably related to weather patterns. A grazing treatment effect on plant height was found only for two species. Flowering frequency in selected species changed even at low sheep densities and was thus not considered suitable except for indicating ungrazed areas. Grazing frequency of three herbs, Saussurea virgaurea, Rumex acetosa, and Pyrola minor, provided a useful indicator of total grazing pressure, as these species were grazed only at high sheep density. Our study area is likely to be representative of alpine areas in southern Norway, but we advise careful calibration using monitoring procedures before similar management decisions on stocking rates can be fully implemented in other ecosystems.

AB  - Robotic milking or automatic milking systems (AMS) are becoming increasingly popular in Norway as well as in the other Nordic countries. To explore what motivates farmers to invest in AMS and what the consequences for farmers' lifestyle and management are, we (the researchers) visited and interviewed 19 dairy farmers in Southern Norway. Fourteen of the farmers are situated in a region of Norway (Jaeren), where the adoption rate of AMS is significantly higher than in the rest of the country. Therefore our main interest was to explain the high adoption rate Jaeren. The findings suggest that to succeed with AMS farmers must be motivated, behave proactively and adapt the new technology to their specific needs. Saved time on milking, more interesting farming, more stable treatment of the cow and less need for relief are some of the advantages. Farmers experience to be constantly on call and information overload as the greatest disadvantages of AMS. The main reasons to invest in AMS are increased flexibility and reduced workload, and AMS has allowed a more modern lifestyle. The high adoption rate of AMS in Jaeren can be explained by human and social capital, socio-cultural factors and the well-developed agricultural knowledge system in the area. Close relations with the farm machinery industry in the area, a strong belief in technology, high wage rates and difficulties of getting skilled labor are other factors which can explain the high adoption rate of AMS.

AB  - Rye (Secale cereale L.) was for centuries the economically most important crop in Fennoscandia (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden). Historical records tell of a range of different types adapted to climate and varying cultivation practices. Genetic analyses of genebank maintained landrace rye have yet failed, with a few exceptions, to detect differentiation between rye types. Concerns have been raised that genebank material does not truly reflect the historical variation in landrace rye. In this study, we have therefore genotyped old and historical samples of rye as well as extant material. Two historical seventeenth century samples were obtained from a grave and a museum archive respectively, and 35 old samples were taken from 100 to 140-year-old seed collections and museum artefacts made of straw. We could confirm the results of previous studies suggesting Fennoscandian landrace rye to be one major meta-population, genetically different from other European rye landraces, but with no support for slash-and-burn types of rye being genetically different from other rye landraces. Only small differences in genetic diversity and allele distribution was found between old landrace rye from museum collections and extant genebank accessions, arguing against a substantial change in the genetic diversity during twentieth century cultivation and several regenerations during genebank maintenance. The genotypes of the old and historical samples suggest that the genetic structure of Fennoscandian landrace rye has been relatively stable for 350years. In contrast, we find that the younger samples and early improved cultivars belong to a different genetic group, more related to landraces from Central Europe.

AB  - This paper describes the background, instrumentation, goals, and the regional influences on the HUMPPA-COPEC intensive field measurement campaign, conducted at the Boreal forest research station SMEAR II (Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relation) in Hyytiala, Finland from 12 July-12 August 2010. The prevailing meteorological conditions during the campaign are examined and contrasted with those of the past six years. Back trajectory analyses show that meteorological conditions at the site in 2010 were characterized by a higher proportion of southerly flow than in the other years studied. As a result the summer of 2010 was anomalously warm and high in ozone making the campaign relevant for the analysis of possible future climates. A comprehensive land use analysis, provided on both 5 and 50 km scales, shows that the main vegetation types surrounding the site on both the regional and local scales are: coniferous forest (Scots pine and/or Norway spruce); mixed forest (Birch and conifers); and woodland scrub (e. g. Willows, Aspen); indicating that the campaign results can be taken as representative of the Boreal forest ecosystem. In addition to the influence of biogenic emissions, the measurement site was occasionally impacted by sources other than vegetation. Specific tracers have been used here to identify the time periods when such sources have impacted the site namely: biomass burning (acetonitrile and CO), urban anthropogenic pollution (pentane and SO2) and the nearby Korkeakoski sawmill (enantiomeric ratio of chiral monoterpenes). None of these sources dominated the study period, allowing the Boreal forest summertime emissions to be assessed and contrasted with various other source signatures.

AB  - How do urban voids affect the formation of urban identities? Holes and voids in the urban landscape are not just a result of geographical dimensions. They intrude into the contours of the city pattern or exist as its basis and organize the place around. Mental mapping allows us to draw invisible borders of urban areas that acquire independent significance because of these gaps. The aesthetics of urban lost spaces have their own background, especially when it comes to the cultural memory intrinsic to this landscape. However, has meaningful mnemonic experience always taken a place within these mental boundaries? Can we talk about the Petersburger's regional identity in connection with neogenic territories?
   The paper uncovers the locus with zero level of cultural memory - the current entry of the Smolenka River into the Gulf of Finland in the Northwestern part of Vasilievsky Island. The Smolenka River mouth and the area around it are considered as one of the St. Petersburg "non-places" (in Marc Auge's terminology), i. e. places deprived of personal history and not defined through identity and cultural relations. The draft of a nonexistent park and the channels surrounded by wastelands are not only a physical gap in city blocks, but also the embodiment of emptiness as a clean slate of cultural memory. At the same time, the Smolenka mouth is one of such territories that are quickly filled with related cultural meanings and stylistic allusions, which leads to the emergence of a new symbolic landscape.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are already responding to changing environmental conditions that are driven by increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These developments affect how societies can utilise and benefit from the woodland areas in the future, be it for example climate change mitigation as carbon sinks, lumber for wood industry, or preserved for nature tourism and recreational activities. We assess the effect and the relative magnitude of different uncertainty sources in ecosystem model simulations from the year 1980 to 2100 for two Finnish boreal forest sites. The models used in this study are the land ecosystem model JSBACH and the forest growth model PREBAS. The considered uncertainty sources for both models are model parameters and four prescribed climates with two RCP (representative concentration pathway) scenarios. Usually, model parameter uncertainty is not included in these types of uncertainty studies. PREBAS simulations also include two forest management scenarios. We assess the effect of these sources of variation at four different points in time on several ecosystem indicators, e.g. gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration, soil moisture, recurrence of drought, length of the vegetation active period (VAP), length of the snow melting period and the stand volume. The uncertainty induced by the climate models remains roughly the same throughout the simulations and is overtaken by the RCP scenario impact halfway through the experiment. The management actions are the most dominant uncertainty factors for Hyytiala and as important as RCP scenarios at the end of the simulations, but they contribute only half as much for Sodankyla. The parameter uncertainty is the least influential of the examined uncertainty sources, but it is also the most elusive to estimate due to non-linear and adverse effects on the simulated ecosystem indicators. Our analysis underlines the importance of carefully considering the implementation of forest use when simulating future ecosystem conditions, as human impact is evident and even increasing in boreal forested regions.

AB  - Ecological protection approaches are important in achieving sustainable productivity growth in agriculture. Based on an unbalanced panel dataset for 2010-2016, we used stochastic frontier analysis-based Malmquist total factor productivity index to estimate total factor productivity change of Swedish crop production and its components (efficiency change, technical change, scale change). We then examined the effect of ecological protection approaches on total factor productivity change. The empirical results demonstrated that ecological protection approaches such as organic farming, mixed cropping or integrated farming could hamper total factor productivity growth. The results also indicated that average total factor productivity change in the study period was positive and average technical efficiency of the Swedish crop production was 71%. Among the components of total factor productivity change, average scale change was positive. Average technical efficiency change and average technical change were both negative. If technical efficiency and technological progress can be improved, that would increase the positive change in total factor productivity. This suggests that policies on compensation or insurance against productivity loss are required to encourage mainstreaming of ecological protection approaches among farmers.

AB  - Development of coastal local municipalities is related to economic benefits and environmental issues. Increasing human populations, development of marine infrastructure and traffic, etc., have led to significant increase of anthropogenic pressure on the coastal environment of local municipalities in the St. Petersburg and Leningrad region. On the other hand, designating new protected areas can provide means to reduce negative impacts of human activities in coastal environments. Coastal local municipalities within these regions were compared in spatial and temporal scales, based on an integrated indicator approach. Trends of anthropogenic pressure were shown and environmental protection actions to mitigate the negative impacts of this pressure in the Eastern Gulf of Finland were discussed. The integrated indicator approach is based on socio-economic and environmental aspects. Dimensionless indicators, which are calculated for coastal local municipalities of the Leningrad region and for four coastal municipal regions of St. Petersburg, provide an opportunity to compare and analyze trends of municipality conditions on a comparative basis. In this paper, results of calculation and assessment of environmental and economic indicators for coastal local municipalities are made for the period between 2008 and 2016.

AB  - Exposure to nocturnal freight train vibrations may impact sleep, but exposure-response relationships are lacking. The European project CargoVibes evaluated sleep disturbance both in the field and in the laboratory and provides unique data, as measures of response and exposure metrics are comparable. This paper therefore provides data on exposure-response relationships of vibration and sleep disturbance and compares the relationships evaluated in the laboratory and the field. Two field studies (one in Poland and one in the Netherlands) with 233 valid respondents in total, and three laboratory studies in Sweden with a total of 59 subjects over 350 person-nights were performed. The odds ratios (OR) of sleep disturbance were analyzed in relation to nighttime vibration exposure by ordinal logit regression, adjusting for moderating factors common for the studies. Outcome specific fractions were calculated for eleven sleep outcomes and supported comparability between the field and laboratory settings. Vibration exposure was significantly associated with sleep disturbance, OR = 3.51 (95% confidence interval 2.6-4.73) denoting a three and a half times increase in the odds of sleep disturbance with one unit increased 8 h nighttime log10 Root Mean Square vibration. The results suggest no significant difference between field and laboratory settings OR = 1.37 (0.59-3.19). However, odds of sleep disturbance were higher in the Netherlands as compared to Sweden, indicating unexplained differences between study populations or countries, possibly related to cultural and contextual differences and uncertainties in exposure assessments. Future studies should be carefully designed to record explanatory factors in the field and enhance ecological validity in the laboratory. Nevertheless, the presented combined data set provides a first set of exposure response relationships for vibration-induced sleep disturbance, which are useful when considering public health outcomes among exposed populations.

AB  - At present, the Baltic Sea coastal regions have characterized by differential factors of socioeconomics, business, historical development and culture that determine the possibilities of specific development and growth rates. Studies on sustainable development of regions show different information in regard to the impact of clusters on the region. The aim of this article is to provide information on the implemented cross-border project research on the possible establishment of tourism recreation clusters in coastal territories. For fulfilment of the set aims in the initial phase of the research, the regions for research were defined in the Baltic Sea coastal region in the Baltic States: in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, as well as in Finland and The Russian Federation. A set of research tools has chosen for the research focus group interviews, surveys, seminars in municipalities, analysis (interviews) of opinions of leading specialists of development departments at state and municipal institutions. For the study of mutual interaction of region clusters and regional growth and development, induction methods, dynamic row analysis and mathematical statistics analysis methods had applied. For identifying the strong industries in the regions shift-share analysis had implemented, but for identifying industries forming the clusters a Location Gini coefficient calculation has used. Based on the research data, this article presents examples that already show particular trends for the establishment and development of tourism recreation clusters in coastal territories.

AB  - We investigated whether the establishment of forests on organic grassland soils leads to significant losses in soil carbon, due to the site preparation for the planting of trees and other disturbances. We also investigated whether subsequent biomass accumulation over two consecutive rotations separated by a clearfell leads to a recovery in the initial soil carbon losses.
   Soil respiration, soil carbon stocks and annual litter fall were measured, while allometric equations were used for the estimation of above and belowground biomass, in a replicated forest chronosequence of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) on peaty gley soil, in Harwood Forest (NE England). The sites chosen were: 40-year-old first rotation stands, 12, 20 and a 30-year-old second rotation stands, one 18-month-old clearfelled site and unplanted natural grassland sites. The soil carbon stock of the first-rotation 40-year-old stands was 140 +/- 15 t C ha(-1), far lower than in the surrounding unplanted grasslands (274 +/- 54 t C ha(-1)), while clearfelling caused a further decline (100 +/- 13 t C ha(-1)). Soil carbon accumulated again as the forest grew during the second rotation (147 +/- 8, 181 +/- 17 and 249 +/- 40 t C ha(-1) at the 12, 20 and 30-year-old stands, respectively). Soil respiration was the highest at the grassland site year possibly due to high respiration by the grasses. After forest establishment, soil respiration was: 2.3 +/- 0.9, 2.2 +/- 0.7, 5.4 +/- 0.7 and 5.0 +/- 0.4 t C ha(-1) year(-1) at the age of 12, 20, 30 and 40 years, while in the clearfelled site soil respiration was 5.6 +/- 1.6 t C ha(-1) year.
   The inputs and outputs of carbon into the soil were combined to evaluate the long-term effects of forest management on soil carbon dynamics. It was concluded that the establishment of coniferous forests on peaty gley grassland soils in the uplands can lead to a net accumulation of soil carbon during the second rotation.

AB  - The weed flora in conventionally and organically grown spring cereals was investigated in southern and central Finland during 2007-2009. The survey was conducted in 16 regions, 283 farms and 595 fields (72 organically cropped and 523 conventionally cropped fields, of which 503 were treated with herbicides). The occurrence of weeds was assessed in late July-early August. Altogether 148 weed species were identified, of which 128 were broad-leaved and 20 grass species. In organically cropped fields, the average species number per field was 21 and the most frequent species were Chenopodium album 96%, Stellaria media 94%, Viola arvensis 94% and Elymus repens 89%. In conventionally cropped fields, the average species number was 12 and the most frequent weed species were Viola arvensis 83%, Stellaria media 65%, Galeopsis spp. 59% and Galium spurium 59%. The average density of weeds was 160 m(-2) (median = 112) in sprayed conventional fields and 519 m(-2) (468) in organic fields. The average air-dry biomass of weeds was 167 kg ha(-1) (median = 82) and 775 kg ha(-1) (563), respectively. Elymus repens, the most frequent and abundant grass species, produced the highest proportion (about 30%) of the total weed biomass in both cropping systems. The frequency of Galium spurium in conventional cropping and Fumaria officinalis in organic cropping had increased substantially since the previous survey in 1997-1999. The average size of the weed seedbank in the 5 cm surface layer was about 1 700 seeds m(-2), the most predominant seeds being of C. album. Although the weed flora in Finnish spring cereal fields consists of numerous species, only a fraction of them severely threaten crop production in terms of their frequency and abundance. Weeds in conventional cropping were effectively controlled with available herbicides whereas weed management in organic cropping calls for urgent measures such as direct mechanical weed control in crop stands, which was not practised at all in survey fields.

LA  - English
AB  - Today's environmental problems are associated, to a great extent, with the industrialized world's consumption of goods and services. Consumption leads to different kinds of environmental impacts from all parts of a product's life cycle: raw material extraction, production, use, recovery, and final disposal, including transportation throughout the cycle. Working with products embraces many different environmental problems, instruments and mechanisms, stakeholders, various policy areas, etc. The current structure of industry and the considerable amount of international trade requires a strategy that takes these conditions into account in advancing sustainable production and consumption. The European Union has developed an Integrated Product Policy, built on life cycle thinking, in order to reduce resource use.
   The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) was commissioned by the Swedish Government in 2001 to develop the Integrated Product Policy (IPP). The aim of IPP is to minimize the impact of products on human health and the environment throughout their life cycles, from cradle-to-grave, to improve sustainable production and consumption, and advance the government's environmental quality objectives. SEPA studied how instruments and mechanisms can work together and be made more effective, and what new instruments and mechanisms might be needed to achieve the goals laid down in IPP. This paper presents the results of the study.

AB  - In order to adequately monitor biodiversity trends through time and their responses to natural or anthropogenic impacts, researchers require long time series that are often unavailable. This general lack of datasets that are several decades or longer makes establishing a background or baseline of diversity metrics difficult - especially when attempting to understand species composition changes against a backdrop of climate and ecological variability. Here, we present an analysis of a community of juvenile nearshore fishes based on nearly 8 decades of highly standardized Norwegian survey records. Using multivariate statistical techniques, we: (i) characterize the change in taxonomic community composition through time, (ii) determine whether there has been an increase in warm-water affinity species relative to their cold water affinity counterparts, and (iii) characterize the temporal change in the species' functional trait assemblage. Our results strongly indicate a shift toward a novel fish assemblage between the late 1990s and 2000s. The context of changes within the most recent two decades is in stark contrast to those during the 1960s and 1970s, but similar to those during the previous warm period during the 1930s and 1940s. This novel assemblage is tightly linked to the warming temperatures in the region portrayed by the increased presence of warm-water species and a higher incidence of pelagic, planktivorous species. The results indicate a clear influence of ocean temperature on the region's juvenile fish community that points to climate-mediated effects on the species assemblages of an important fish nursery area.

AB  - The circular economy operates as an umbrella concept for attempts to find sustainable alternatives to linear ?take-make-dispose? production and consumption systems. Making a circular economy transformation has sparked interest in business models as means to decouple value creation and the use of virgin raw materials. However, so far, little attention has been given to the differentiating capacities of business models to enhance circularity. Using Finnish biogas production as a case study, this paper shows how business models operating within a single economic domain and within uniform institutional conditions differ in terms of how they organise material circuits. Four business models are differentiated based on what wastes and side-flows they enable to be recovered, and how. Because the business models co-evolve, their potentials are analysed in relation to the business model ecosystem. An emerging business model competes with the dominating model. The newcomer would help to generate more closed material loops, but the existing institutional landscape fails to provide support for its emerging modes of value creation and value capture. Two other business models qualify as niche solutions coexisting with the other models. Knowing the business model ecosystem opens up prospects for policy revisions that can foster a more circular economy.

AB  - Insect groups are declining worldwide; Lepidoptera are among the taxa most affected in terrestrial ecosystems. The main drivers of these declines are a diverse set of factors relating to environmental change including habitat loss, pollution, and climate change. In 2019 and 2020, we surveyed 118 and 90 islands, respectively, in southern Finland's archipelago for occupancy of Parnassius apollo larvae and counted the abundance of their host plant Hylotelephium telephium. Compared with historical data (1997-2003), the occupancy of Apollo butterfly larvae has decreased remarkably from about 75% to about 20% of islands and abundance declined as well. However, the abundance of their host plant has not changed. Occupancy models showed that the present occupancy probability is not affected by host plant numbers, and shows substantial colonization-extinction dynamics making the population vulnerable to stochastic extinction. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that this Apollo butterfly population is declining, and conservation actions are needed.

AB  - Cities - and, in general, urban agglomerations - have in recent years become foci of social science research and policy interest. Prominent attention has been given to agglomeration advantages, mobility patterns, urban decay, inequity problems, residents' quality of life, safety and crime, labour and housing markets, public amenities, and urban planning issues. Less attention however, has been paid to the basic question: what makes the city a 'real' and attractive city? This question prompts essentially a research challenge on the 'raison d'etre' of cities, in particular on the residential satisfaction and quality-of-life motives of urban inhabitants. The present paper aims to pinpoint attractiveness characteristics of cities based on perceptions of urban quality by residents and their affinity with city life. This paper offers a micro-based (individual) assessment of motives and appreciations of citizens, in terms of their love for the city. A typological distinction will be made between the 'soul' of the city (its spirit, history, cultural identity, ambiance, social capital, etc.) and the 'body' of the city (its built environment, infrastructure, public amenities, supply of housing, green areas, etc.). The empirical analysis - applied to the four largest cities in Sweden (Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmoe and Umea) - will be undertaken in two steps: (i) an exploratory statistical analysis of the findings from an extensive micro-based survey questionnaire among inhabitants in these four urban agglomerations; (ii) an explanatory evaluation of the individual appreciation scores using a regression approach. Our results show that the 'City Love Index' is a useful construct that can be decomposed into 'soul' and 'body' aspects of the city. Our multivariate regression analysis demonstrates clearly that both factors matter. More detailed results suggest that it is the perceptions regarding the city's 'walkability' and 'vibrancy', both part of the 'soul' of the city, that have a significant influence on the City Love Index -for all cities studied.

AB  - In Finland, all fatal on-road and off-road motor vehicle crashes are subject to an in-depth investigation coordinated by the Finnish Crash Data Institute (OTI). This study presents an exploratory and two-step cluster analysis of fatal pedestrian crashes between 2010 and 2019 that were subject to in-depth investigations. In total, 281 investigations occurred across Finland between 2010 and 2019. The highest number of cases were recorded in the Uusimaa region, including Helsinki, representing 26.4% of cases. Females (48.0%) were involved in fewer cases than males; however, older females represented the most commonly injured demographic. A unique element to the patterns of injury in this study is the seasonal effects, with the highest proportion of crashes investigated in winter and autumn. Cluster analysis identified four unique clusters. Clusters were characterised by crashes involving older pedestrians crossing in low-speed environments, crashes in higher speed environments away from pedestrian crossings, crashes on private roads or in parking facilities, and crashes involving intoxicated pedestrians. The most common recommendations from the investigation teams to improve safety were signalisation and infrastructure upgrades of pedestrian crossings, improvements to street lighting, advanced driver assistance (ADAS) technologies, and increased emphasis on driver behaviour and training. The findings highlight road safety issues that need to be addressed to reduce pedestrian trauma in Finland, including provision of safer crossing facilities for elderly pedestrians, improvements to parking and shared facilities, and addressing issues of intoxicated pedestrians. Efforts to remedy these key issues will further Finland's progression towards meeting Vision Zero targets while creating a safer and sustainable urban environment in line with the United Nations sustainable development goals.

KW  - WELFARE
AB  - This article uses the concept of maternalism to discuss workhouse management, which in late nineteenth-century Finland was entrusted to women. The article looks at the ways in which maternalist discourse manifests in the development of a workhouse matron's leadership position, how the said discourse became further manifest in the guidelines given to matrons by the state poor relief officials and how the boundaries of a matron's authority were defined in conflicts with both male agents in poor relief and the paupers themselves. Ultimately, the article illuminates the contemporary understanding of feminine and masculine duties in society, which were inextricably linked to perceptions of social class. In addition, it explores the transfer of ideas from the more central regions of Europe to a Northern periphery by contrasting the Finnish development with that in England. The article suggests that as a workhouse matron's position was built on the ideal of normative womanhood, it was not emancipatory per se. However, the article also shows that only those elements of normative womanhood that were relevant to a matron's mission of converting the paupers to respectable citizenship were to be included in her leadership as a whole. These restrictions marked professionalisation inside the contemporary maternalist discourse and the feminine sphere of society.

AB  - The forest industry continues to be men dominated, dependent on forest owners' supply of raw material and of significant importance to the national and local economy and economic development in Sweden. The interconnection between masculinity and the work, knowledge, forest owners and professionals in the sector contributes to exclusion of women. In response to this, women forest owners have formed networks in different local areas. Through focus group interviews, this study examined the strategies, functions and positions of these networks, both in their individual locations and the overall policy processes of gender mainstreaming of the sector, to scrutinise the reproduction of gender inequities and the gendered notion of forestry. The results show how the networks are acting to expand the discursive space, establish alternative publics and empower their members by inventing and circulating counterdiscourses. The different strategies adopted by the networks appear to have emerged in response to contemporary political processes. The conclusion is that one single public sphere cannot encompass the diversity of the contemporary forestry sector, indicating a need to contain a multiplicity of publics, both to challenge the modes of deliberation that mask domination and to facilitate transformative processes.

AB  - We examined the occurrence of carabid beetles along a forest succession gradient in central Finland (forest age classes: 5, 10, 20, 30 and 60 years since clear-cutting). Species richness of carabids was higher in the two youngest age classes, while no clear differences were detected in carabid abundance. The high species richness in the young, open sites was due to invasion of open-habitat species. Many forest species were absent from or scarce in the young sites and became gradually more abundant towards the older forest age classes. The catches indicated a drastic decrease and assemblage-level change in concert with canopy closure, i.e. 20-30 years after clear-cutting. Some forest specialists with poor dispersal ability may face local extinction, if the proportion of mature forest decreases further and the remaining mature stands become more isolated. We recommend that, while harvesting timber, connectivity between mature stands is ensured, mature stands are maintained close (a few tens of metres) to each other and the matrix quality is improved for forest species by green tree retention.

AB  - Causes of mortality were described for 245 radio-marked Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in five different Scandinavian study areas. Further-more, the survival rates and the population growth rates were estimated for three of the study areas where 202 lynx were followed for a total of 314 radio-years. The main causes of mortality in adult Eurasian lynx in all our study areas were overwhelmingly anthropogenic, with starvation, vehicle collisions, intra- and interspecific killing and disease only having a minor role. The mean mortality rates for adults increased from 2% to 17% when hunting and poaching were included, i.e., an increase by a factor of eight. This in turn had a large impact on population growth rates, which changed from more than a 20% annual increase to only a 2-4% when hunting and poaching were included. Poaching accounted for 46% of the mortality in adult lynx. Poaching and legal harvest appear to be primarily motivated by conflicts; lynx depredation on semi-domestic reindeer in northern Scandinavia, competition with hunters for roe deer in southern Scandinavia, and depredation on free-ranging domestic sheep in all Norway. The lowest poaching rate was found in the Hedmark study area in Norway, which also had a high legal harvest. The poaching rate was higher in one of the Swedish study areas (Sarek) where legal hunting was lower than in other areas. on the other hand, both the poaching rate and the legal harvest were high in the Akershus/Ostfold study area in Norway. Thus, there does not seem to be a simple relationship between an increased legal harvest and decreased poaching as is commonly expected. The most important conservation actions are to combat poaching through both law enforcement and measures designed to increase tolerance. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholarship within green criminology focusing on crimes and harms against nonhuman animals has been increasing. Little attention, however, has been directed at the gendered aspects of these crimes. For example, why is it that the great majority of offenders involved in wildlife trade and the illegal killing of endangered predators are male? The aim of this article is to fill the gap in the literature, relying on confiscation reports from Norwegian Customs of nonhuman animals-most of whom are listed in CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora)-as well as an analysis of verdicts in cases in Norwegian courts of "theriocides" (animal murders) of large predators. This article will assess the number of men and women involved in these crimes and harms, and will present some trends of theriociders. This article will employ ecofeminist and masculinities theories to better understand the gendered dynamics involved in wildlife trafficking and the theriocides of large carnivores.

AB  - Previous research has shown that it is possible to decarbonise Sweden's road transport sector. This study develops a scenario based method and analyses the influence of external factors on energy security, focusing on passenger and freight transport. It does so by analysing the vulnerabilities and capabilities of five different climate mitigation strategies, investigating previous security scenarios and identifying uncertain drivers. These are used to develop four consistent exogenous scenarios using cross impact balance analysis. The vulnerabilities and capabilities of the five different strategies are then compared with the challenges faced in the scenarios and the robustness and adaptive capacity of the resulting systems is analysed.
   The results shows that strategies which reduce the use of energy (increase efficiency or conservation) are robust, but that demand restrictions are perceived as undesirable by some interest groups. Biofuels perform poorly if too many other countries increase their use of biofuel, whereas electrification performs best when many other countries implement this technology. The strategies are not mutually exclusive and simultaneous implementation of some provides synergies for national energy security. Some directions for further research are suggested, such as framing energy security as subjective, i.e. a result of material and contextual factors that co-evolve. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chemical pesticides are widely used in modern agriculture but their potential negative impacts are seldom considered in environmental assessments of food products. This study aims to assess and compare the potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts due to pesticide use in the primary production of six food products: chicken fillet, minced pork, minced beef, milk, pea soup, and wheat bread. The assessment is based on a detailed and site-specific inventory of pesticide use in the primary production of the food products, all of which are produced in Sweden. Soybeans, used to produce the animal-based food products, are grown in Brazil. Pesticide emissions to air and surface water were calculated using PestLCl v. 2.0.5. Ecotoxicity impacts were assessed using USEtox v. 2.01, and expressed in relation to five functional units. The results show that the animal-based food products have considerably larger impact potentials than the plant-based food products. In relation to kg pea soup, impact potentials of bread, milk, minced beef, chicken fillet and minced pork are ca. 2, 3, 50,140 and 170 times larger, respectively. All mass-based functional units yield the same ranking. Notably, chicken fillet and minced pork have larger impacts than minced beef and milk, regardless of functional unit, due to extensive use of pesticides, some with high toxicity, in soybean production. This result stands in sharp' contrast to typical carbon footprint and land use results which attribute larger impacts to beef than to chicken and pork. Measures for reducing impacts are discussed. In particular, we show that by substituting soybeans with locally sourced feed crops, the impact potentials of minced pork and chicken fillet are reduced by ca. 70 and 90%, respectively. Brazilian soybean production is heavily reliant on pesticides. We propose that weak legislation, in combination with tropical climate and agronomic practices, explains this situation.

AB  - Road safety policy rules us in both visible and invisible ways and prioritising one mode often means downgrading another. It has been argued in previous research that road safety policy prioritises car traffic and in that way sustains the automobility norm. This paper focuses on the automobility norm that permeates Swedish road safety policy and how this hampers planning for cycling. It aims to contribute to ongoing debates about the need for a radical change in road safety policy towards the inclusion of broader societal and policy goals. The theoretical foundation for this paper is found in the mobilities approach, which acknowledges that (im)mobility and safety are subject to discursive power struggles and differentiated depending on, for instance, modes, groups, age, origin, and gender. The paper aims at obtaining a broader understanding of how mobility and safety are understood in Swedish road safety policy and secondly at identifying windows of opportunity for a change towards a road safety policy that facilitates and encourages cycling. These aims are achieved by a focus on the conceptualisations of problems - instead of on solutions - and a cross-cultural comparison with Dutch road safety policy. In the concluding discussion, it is argued that road safety policy should embrace more goals besides safety, that the discourse around cycling has to be disrupted and that feelings of unsafety and fear need to be problematised.

AB  - Agriculture faces many challenges to maximize yields while it is required to operate in an environmentally sustainable manner. In the present study, we analyze the major agricultural challenges identified by European farmers (primarily related to biotic stresses) in 13 countries, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, UK and Turkey, for nine major crops (barley, beet, grapevine, maize, oilseed rape, olive, potato, sunflower and wheat). Most biotic stresses (BSs) are related to fungi or insects, but viral diseases, bacterial diseases and even parasitic plants have an important impact on yield and harvest quality. We examine how these challenges have been addressed by public and private research sectors, using either conventional breeding, marker-assisted selection, transgenesis, cisgenesis, RNAi technology or mutagenesis. Both national surveys and scientific literature analysis followed by text mining were employed to evaluate genetic engineering (GE) and non-GE approaches. This is the first report of text mining of the scientific literature on plant breeding and agricultural biotechnology research. For the nine major crops in Europe, 128 BS challenges were identified with 40% of these addressed neither in the scientific literature nor in recent European public research programs. We found evidence that the private sector was addressing only a few of these neglected challenges. Consequently, there are considerable gaps between farmer's needs and current breeding and biotechnology research. We also provide evidence that the current political situation in certain European countries is an impediment to GE research in order to address these agricultural challenges in the future. This study should also contribute to the decision-making process on future pertinent international consortia to fill the identified research gaps.

AB  - Insect outbreaks and wind storms are the most common natural disturbances affecting the northern slopes of montane Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) forests in the European Alps. The combined effects on stand dynamics, including tree regeneration, of these natural disturbances and an anthropogenic (i.e., salvage logging) disturbance were studied to assess the role of post-disturbance management practices. The study areas were in two adjacent inner valleys of the Aosta Valley Autonomous Region (western Italian Alps). Les Combos study area experienced an insect (Lymantria monacha L) outbreak that affected 91 ha in 1984-1990, while a wind storm impacted 70 ha in the other valley (Parriod study area) in 1990. Salvage logging took place in both study areas 2 years after the natural disturbance occurrence (i.e., in 1991-1992 in Les Combes, and in 1992-1993 in Parriod), and only dead trees were salvaged. Site characteristics, overstory and understory trees, and coarse woody debris (CWD) data were collected during the summer of 2010 in 90 plots randomly distributed within disturbed portions and in control stands of the two study areas. The variability of natural regeneration structure and composition in relation to environment, forest structure, type of disturbance, and salvage logging were analyzed by univariate (i.e., ANOVA and correlations) and multivariate (i.e., MRPP, PCA, and RDA) analyses. Regeneration structure and composition were clearly different for the two disturbance types. Individuals originated mainly from seed after the insect outbreak, while an important role was played by advance regeneration in the windthrow area. Regeneration was more abundant and rich in shade tolerant species (i.e., Abies alba Mill.) after the insect outbreak, while Larix decidua Mill. and light demanding broadleaves were dominant after the windthrow. The two major factors influencing post-disturbance regeneration were the amount of the residual overstory and the amount and distribution of CWD. The presence of residual forest patches facilitated regeneration establishment by reducing herb and shrub competition, and regulating the light that penetrates to the ground. Woodpiles had a negative influence on regeneration in terms of abundance and also influenced composition. On the contrary, scattered CWD facilitated the establishment of new individuals by reducing competition with herbs and shrubs, reducing the impact of browsing, and improving substrate moisture, especially for Norway spruce.

AB  - The microclimate of streamside habitats are protected from the effects of logging with buffer strips of retained trees. However, these buffer strips are often narrow due to their financial loss. Wider, selectively logged buffers might protect the microclimate while providing the same economic return. This study investigates the effects of logging on the microclimate and the growth of the bryophyte Hylocomium splendens on two streamside buffers: a standard unlogged narrow buffer (similar to 15 m) and a wider buffer (similar to 30 m) selectively logged with decreasing intensity towards the stream. The study was conducted in Central Finland on eight sites where the two buffers were logged next to each other. The near-stream change in air temperature and relative humidity was measured from pre-logging to post-logging. Additionally, post-logging microclimate gradients and the growth of H. splendens was measured on a 30 m transect away from the stream. The results showed no significant differences in the ability of the two kinds of buffers in maintaining streamside microclimate, and neither buffer seems to protect the microclimate from the negative effects of logging. The growth of H. splendens also decreased in both buffers. We conclude that wider, unlogged buffer strips are required to protect riparian forest microclimate.

AB  - In 1994, we studied predation oil domestic sheep using mortality radiocollars in an area in central Norway inhabited by brown bears (Ursus arctos). The total loss among 234 radiocollared ewes in 3 herds released on summer pastures was 54, and 5 1 (94.4%) were due to bear predation. Among 337 radiocollared lambs, 37 were known to have died, 14 (42.4%) due to bear predation. Bears selected ewes over lambs, consistent with optimal foraging theory. Ewes with bells had a higher risk of being killed than ewes without bells. Selection of young ewes with male-dominated litters in spring and small lambs can partly be explained according to parental investment theory and selection for individuals that are last in the flock when attacked or chased by bears.

AB  - In order to predict and control possible negative impacts of dredging on coastal ecosystems on the new ports construction sites, the maps of ecological sensitivity of the Eastern Gulf of Finland are constructed. Phytoplankton, zooplankton, macro-algae, higher aquatic vegetation ("macrophytes"), benthic invertebrates (macro-zoobenthos), fish (eggs, young, adults), birds and marine mammals (seals) are considered as the basic components of the coastal ecosystems. Data on spatial and seasonal distribution of the groups of organisms listed above were used to assess the integral sensitivity of the coastal zone of the Eastern Gulf of Finland to dredging. According to the research results, the main types of dredging impacts on coastal ecosystems are: (1) direct soil motion (excavation and dumping of dredged material), and (2) increase of the concentration of suspended material in the water. The general analysis of the constructed maps has shown that the sensitivity of the Gulf of Finland to dumping and dredging is higher in Spring than in Summer. Obtained data allows assessing the impact of dredging work on the environment in coastal areas contributed to sustainable management of the Eastern Gulf of Finland due to modernization of port territories and navigation channels and creation new artificial territories for further construction works.

We also measured soil-atmosphere fluxes of CH4 and N2O and the CO2 sink of the growing tree stand in order to assess the current greenhouse gas impact of the study sites.
   The soil was, on average, a CO2 source of +190 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1) at the fertile Herb-rich and Vaccinium myrtillus type sites, but a CO2 sink of -70 +/- 30 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Dwarf shrub type sites. The source increased at the fertile and the sink decreased at the poor sites as the water table deepened. The source at the fertile sites also increased by increasing temperature sum, the highest CO2 sources being around +1000 g m(-2) year(-1) at well drained sites in Southern Finland.
   Both fertile and poor sites had a climate cooling impact. The sink in CO2 equivalents at the fertile sites was -690 +/- 90 g m(-2) year(-1) and at the poor sites -540 +/- 70 g m(-2) year(-1). The greater sink at the fertile sites was due to clearly better tree growth, their tree stand CO2 sink being -880 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) compared to the -490 +/- 60 g m(-2) year(-1) at the poor sites.
   Ditching-based forestry can be climatically sustainable at nutrient-poor boreal peatlands since the peat soil continues to be a CO2 sink even after drainage. At the fertile sites, forestry will inevitably lead to loss of carbon in the long term, unless the tree biomass is stored after cuttings, for example in wooden buildings or as biochar in agricultural soils.

AB  - Summer farming was formerly an important part of Norwegian husbandry and mountain areas have been used for grazing for hundreds of years. A decline in summer farming practices, during the twentieth century, has caused a large-scale encroachment of trees and shrubs leading to extensive landscape changes and decreased biodiversity. Therefore, in order to maintain the biodiversity in summer farm mountain areas, it is now necessary to detect, map and monitor remaining species-rich fragments, i.e. key habitats. It is also important to identify still grass- and herb-rich areas that can be successfully restored for grazing because of a new interest for summer farming. Field surveys in the re-growing mountain areas are extremely time consuming, as the concomitant terrain renders movement by foot arduous. A method was thus developed for detection of key-habitats and other grass and herb-rich habitats in such areas based on interpretation of coloured infrared aerial photographs (CIR). In addition, black-and-white aerial photographs, taken nearly 40 years ago, were used to identify past open land and pastures and thus in combination with the modern ones allow the identification of areas that exhibit a continuity in grazing. Interpretation keys were developed and vegetation maps were constructed. The interpretation from the aerial photographs was compared to detailed field control and the method was found to be efficient and accurate. The method gave useful information about the landscape history and continuity of grazing. The cattle's movements were traced by GPS equipment mounted on a collar on the leading cattle, and their movements were later transferred to a map and analysed together with the vegetation map in a GIS. The results show that the cattle preferred to graze in the areas identified as most valuable and species rich. The developed method also makes it possible to identify areas for which pasture-restoration might be successfully achieved. Furthermore, the study revealed that there is a high correspondence between key habitats in the summer farming areas and grazing preferences of the cattle. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Previous publications have reported two conflicting patterns describing the relationship between income and suicide in Sweden; positive and negative. Methodologically the studies have differed, and the analysis has been limited to a few areas. To better understand the relationship, a nationwide, cross-sectional, ecological study of the 290 municipalities in Sweden was planned. OLS regression analyses showed the overall and female suicide rates were negatively related to income, while the effect on male suicide rates was not statistically significant. The results confirm earlier findings of a negative relationship between income and suicide.

AB  - This study explores the role of the Swedish Sports Confederation (SSC) in its pursuit of supporting sports in socioeconomically deprived areas, specifically targeting ethnic minorities. This is no easy task, seeing as the SSC does so through 'steering' voluntary sport clubs towards social policy goals. Utilising multiple qualitative sources from 35 SSC representatives, this study examines the practices of the SSC according to Bronfenbrenner's Process-Person-Context-Time approach. The results show that the SSC foreground their practices by initiating inter-sectoral collaborations to ensure sustainable funding to clubs and that the 'principle of closeness' permeates the practices; every link in the process is locally embedded and builds upon the strength of the clubs. The sport club consultant, acting as the direct link between exo-level directives and the clubs' micro-setting becomes a key factor whose individual characteristics become a decisive factor. In conclusion, the SSC works in a complex collaborative sphere in which specific individuals become central in reaching the clubs. Importantly, the SSC adopts a bottom-up approach, recognising the strength and resourcefulness of the locals. The results have implications for federations that work under the governance of neoliberal result-oriented regimes - if sport clubs should carry out this work, the federations need to understand how they must accommodate and assist these sport clubs adequately.

AB  - Finnish lace artist Tarmo Thorstrom redefines the conventional understanding of lace, conceiving it as an absence rather than a presence - a philosophical stance that permeates his innovative bobbin lace creations. His artistic repertoire interlaces disparate themes, transgressing the boundaries of traditional lace artistry. The city of Rauma, located on Finland's western coast, serves as both muse and canvas, showcasing Thorstrom's evocative works in its urban landscape and holding annual bobbin lace festivals to commemorate this living tradition. Thorstrom's engagement extends beyond artistic production, encompassing pedagogical and research endeavours that traverse the fields of craft education and studying materials. This multifaceted involvement is underscored by his publications, notably a work on bobbin lace crafting, highlighting its significance within the continuum of cultural heritage. Moreover, Thorstrom's artistic praxis embodies sustainability imperatives, evident in his repurposing of discarded materials, such as reclaimed bobbins and threads. This ethos aligns with broader discourses on sustainable crafting practices and material ecologies. Beyond craft, Thorstrom's artistic output serves as a locus for profound philosophical contemplation on the nature of existence and humanity's relationship with the cosmos. This portrait article situates Thorstrom's original approach within the larger discourse on materiality and artistic practice, shedding light on the transformative potential of lace as a medium for philosophical and artistic expression.

AB  - A growing body of literature argues that subjective factors can more accurately explain individual adaptation to climate change than objective measurers of adaptive capacity. Recent studies have shown that personal belief in climate change and affect are much better in explaining climate awareness and action than income, education or gender. This study focuses on the process of individual adaptation to climate change. It assesses and compares the influence of cognitive, experiential and structural factors on individuals' views and intentions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study comes from a survey with 836 forest owners in Sweden. Ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to test hypotheses about the different factors. Results show that cognitive factors-namely personal level of trust in climate science, belief in the salience of climate change and risk assessment-are the only statistically significant factors that can directly explain individuals' intention to adapt to climate change and their sense of urgency. Findings also suggest that structural or socio-demographic factors do not have a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among Swedish forest owners. The study also offers valuable insights for communication interventions to promote adaptation. Findings strongly suggest that communication interventions should focus more strongly on building trust and addressing stakeholders' individual needs and experiences.

AB  - This paper characterizes changes in Norway's civil protection and emergency preparedness five years after the Oslo and Utoya terror attacks. Data from 48 interviews conducted in the period 2014-2016 with civil servants within different levels of the justice sector were qualitatively analyzed. The inductive analysis shows four main changes made related to Norway's civil protection and emergency preparedness within the Ministry of Justice and Public Security: (1) a change in risk perception regarding awareness of security-related risks; (2) the generation of several plans and measures; (3) structural changes at various levels within the justice sector; and (4) increased resources allocated to societal safety and security. The changes following the Oslo terror attacks were not solely in response to the terror attacks, but also the result of previous and subsequent events and reports. The current organization of public administration, however, still fosters siloed thinking and turf wars around the principle of responsibility and each sector's respective area of expertise. Most of the implemented changes can be characterized as structural; diagnoses made after the terror attacks pointed at cultural aspects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Continuity of cardiac care after hospital discharge is a priority, especially as healthcare systems become increasingly complex and fragmented. There are few available instruments to measure continuity of cardiac care, especially from the patient perspective. The aim of this study was (1) to translate and adapt the Heart Continuity of Care Questionnaire (HCCQ) to conditions in Norway, and (2) to determine its psychometric properties in self-report format administered to patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
   Methods: The HCCQ was first translated into Norwegian from the original English version, following a widely used cross-cultural adaptation process. Data were collected before hospital discharge and in a follow-up after 2months. To assess psychometric properties, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed and three aspects of construct validity were evaluated: structural validity, hypotheses testing and cross-cultural validation. Internal consistency of the HCCQ subscales was calculated using Cronbach's alpha, while intra-class correlation (ICC) was used to assess test-retest reliability. Additionally, socio-demographic and patient-reported data were collected to correlate with HCCQ scores.
   Results: Of those included at baseline, 436 (76%) completed the questionnaires after 2months. CFA suggested that the fit of the HCCQ data to a 3-factor model was modest (RMSEA = 0.11, CFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.90). However, convergent validity was satisfactory, based on existing research. Internal consistency was good, as indicated by its Cronbach's alphas: total continuity of care (0.95); informational (0.93), relational (0.87), and management (0.89) continuity. The ICC for the total HCCQ score was 0.80 (95% CI [0.71, 0.87] p<0.001). As indicated by negative care experiences (rated as 1 or 2 on the five-point scale), patients seemed to have limited knowledge about medical treatment, lifestyle modification and follow-up after PCI. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation and longer consultations with the general practitioner after hospital discharge were positively correlated with better continuity of care.
   Conclusions: Implementation of the HCCQ will likely support healthcare providers and researchers in identifying problem areas of continuity of cardiac care and in evaluating interventions aimed at improving continuity of care.

AB  - Market segmentation techniques were applied to identify and describe potential consumer clusters with highest hypothetical willingness to pay (WTP) for certified wooden furniture. Representative samples of the British and Norwegian population were surveyed by telephone and asked to choose between two profiles of wooden furniture, where one was eco-labeled and more expensive. The eco-labeled would certify that the wood originated from sustainable forestry. The survey data allowed for substantiating the attribute segmenting with the hypothetical choice behavior between eco-labeled and unlabeled wood and logit model estimates of WTP. The statistical method to identify the segments was k-means cluster analysis, principally using stated importance of product attributes and estimated WTP for eco-labeling as grouping variables.
   One segment profiled as an "eco-segment" was confirmed by placing a higher value on the dimensions (values) of environmentalism-trusting environmental and outdoor organizations regarding information about forestry and environment, and having a higher rate of membership in environmental organizations. This "eco-segment" amounted to more than (1)/(4) of the samples. The British eco-segment could be described as relatively "greener" than the Norwegian. The British also had higher estimated WTP for eco-labeling compared to the Norwegians. The eco-segments had their media interest directed more towards intellectual issues than the other segments. Demographically, the eco-segments did not differ significantly from the other segments, except that the British had a greater female majority.

AB  - Serbian spruce (Picea omorika [Pancic] Purk.) is a Balkan endemic coniferous species, the expansion of which is restricted by limited knowledge. This literature review paper compiles findings from 176 scientific papers and presents a summary of research results that pertain to the Serbian spruce potential in general, with a specific focus on European forests from 1951 to 2022. It summarizes the importance of its taxonomy, biological and ecological characteristics, site demands, production and silviculture, risks and pests, as well as the potential of this tree species in relation to global climate change. Serbian spruce is very resistant to the negative effect of air pollution and extreme heat waves compared to other spruce species, especially the most economically important spruce species in Europe-Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.). Moreover, its radial growth shows highly balanced annual increments, and the density and technical parameters of the wood are comparable with Norway spruce. On the other hand, the highest weakness may be the limited genetic variability. Despite its rather limited natural range, Serbian spruce can be considered one of the most adaptable spruces to anthropogenic factors and climate change, and a valuable tree species for urban landscapes. Its production potential of wood on acidic, dry and extreme sites makes it attractive for forestry, through its introduction.

AB  - What is the role of time-constraints in determining geographical variation in the resource use of organisms? One hypothesis concerning phytophagous insects predicts a local narrowing of host plant range at localities where a short development time is important (because an additional generation per season is only just possible), with increased specialization on host plants permitting fast development. To test this hypothesis, populations of the polyphagous comma butterfly (Nymphalidae: Polygonia c-album) from five European areas (localities in Norway, Sweden, England, Belgium and Spain) were sampled and the preferences of laboratory-reared female butterflies were investigated, by a choice test between Salix caprea and the fastest host Urtica dioica. The results suggest that females of both of two northern univoltine populations (time-stressed from Norway and time-relaxed from Sweden) accept the slow host S. caprea to a higher degree than females of more southern populations with partial additional generations (time-stressed). We thus found partial support for the tested hypothesis, but also conflicting results that cast doubt on its broad generality. Moreover, a split-brood investigation on Swedish stock demonstrated that larval performance is similar on S. caprea and U. dioica early in the summer, but that later in the season S. caprea is a much inferior host. This is reflected by a seasonal trend towards specialization on U. dioica and also provides a simpler explanation than the time-constraints theory for avoidance of S. caprea (and other woody hosts) in areas with two or more generations of insects per year, illustrating the importance of plant phenology as a constraint on resource use in phytophagous insects. Absolute and relative larval performance on the two hosts varied little among populations across Europe, but lower survival on S. caprea in the populations most specialized on U. dioica and related plants may be indicative of performance trade-offs.

AB  - Transformation towards more sustainable construction calls for actions from representatives of different sectors and societal levels. Previous studies have investigated companies and national policies as promoters of change, but neglected municipalities as relevant actors. Municipalities influence construction as they are trailblazers when realizing their own building projects, as well as regulators, whose planning decisions affect local and urban development. We investigate the role of municipalities in driving sustainability transformation in construction, in particular, in relation to wood construction. The empirical study relies on data collected in Finland through a comprehensive survey among municipalities and qualitative interviews. Key factors in municipal considerations are energy efficiency and carbon neutrality goals. Regulations and norms related to construction influence municipal activities as well. We find various drivers (e.g. supportive planning) and barriers (e.g. cost concerns) to wood construction. National programmes promoting wood construction have induced gradual changes and led to some municipal pilot projects. Despite these positive examples, it seems to take time before municipalities adopt wood construction more extensively. Simultaneously, their position at the intersection of different actors and activities involved in construction provides a fruitful base for promoting sustainable construction.

AB  - Cellular agriculture and its products, such as cultured meat, are suggested to have the potential to advance the sustainability of current food systems. Instead of engaging in current debates concerning the anticipated benefits and challenges of cellular agriculture, it is more useful to identify potential pathways leading to food system transitions. Our study aims to compare Finnish and German political stakeholders' (n = 25) perceptions con-cerning cultured meat and to analyse its potential transition pathways utilising the multi-level perspective (MLP). Data were collected via semi-structured theme interviews in early 2020. Results show that the participants acknowledge that landscape-level pressures, such as climate change or finite resources, are challenging current food systems. The food regime's position is perceived as somewhat uncertain. The current practices of livestock agriculture, strong food traditions and multiple interest groups' aspirations are anticipated to both hinder and advance a transition to cellular agriculture. On the niche innovation level, cultured meat was perceived as a promising yet technocratic solution. Cultured meat may be an option for continued meat consumption without feelings of guilt but with preconditions such as guaranteed safety, affordable prices and an authentic meat taste similar or better compared with conventionally produced meat. Our article concludes with three potential transition pathways for cellular agriculture. The "technocratic stagnation" pathway is characterised by perceived threats and stakeholder unwillingness to accept cultured meat. The "promising circumstances" pathway is emphasised by positive societal conditions for cultured meat development and stakeholders' incremental adaptation to it as an additional food product on the market. The "rapid advancement" pathway is characterised by technological breakthroughs and high acceptance of cultured meat, which could lead to radical changes in the current food system.

AB  - [1] Total suspended particulate matter was collected in two Portuguese urban areas (Lisbon and Aveiro) and in a Finnish forested site. Samples were sequentially extracted with dichloromethane and water. The solvent extract was separated by flash chromatography into aliphatics, aromatics, carbonyls, alcohols, and an acidic fraction, and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. An organic/black carbon analyzer was used to evaluate the carbonaceous matter in filters, the water-soluble fraction, solvent extractable material, and the content of different organic classes. Results showed that the common simple extraction with dichloromethane is able to dissolve less than 50% of the particulate organic material. The successive extraction with water removes an important quantity of the leftover organic polar compounds. The sum of both extractions recovers between 70% and 90% of the organic carbon present. The amount of oxygenated compounds is frequently more than 70% of the extracted material, with a large predominance of organic acids and alcohols, especially for particles with diameters less than 0.49 mum. The organic compounds identified in the extractable atmospheric particulate matter are represented by primary compounds with both anthropogenic and biogenic origin, which mainly derive from vegetation waxes and from petrogenic sources. Secondary products resulting from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds were also detected. The water-soluble fraction contains essentially oxocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, and cellulosic constituents. In accordance with the anthropogenic characteristics of the sampling sites, nonpolar fractions constitute up to 24% of the extracted organic carbon in Lisbon and present high levels of petroleum markers, while in the forested station these compounds represent 8%. The oxygenated organic compounds account for 76-92% of the extracted carbon in samples from Aveiro and Finland. Owing to favorable photochemical conditions during the sampling campaign, secondary organic constituents present higher levels in Aveiro. The forested site is the one where the water-soluble components show greater variability and concentrations.

AB  - Animal locations estimated by Global Positioning System (GPS) inherently contain errors. Screening procedures used to remove large positional errors often trade data accuracy for data loss. We developed a simple screening method that identifies locations arising from unrealistic movement patterns. When applied to a large data set of moose (Alces alces) locations, our method identified virtually all known errors with minimal loss of data. Thus, our method for screening GPS data improves the quality of data sets and increases the value of such data for research and management.

AB  - The Growth Processes activity had four participating countries, Finland, Sweden, UK and USA. The overall objective of the activity was to investigate growth processes of greatest importance in species used and leading to improvement and sustainability in short rotation forestry biomass production. The areas of interest agreed by the participants as topics for further research and information exchange were: canopy dynamics, mixed clonal plantations, coppice biology with root/shoot interactions, water-use efficiency in coppice and growth models of coppice growth processes and systems. The activity arranged four meetings during four years, each with a separate theme in agreement with the programme of work. The meetings were joint meetings with other IEA-activities and also with other organisations such as FAO/IPC and IUFRO. A number of scientific presentations from the activity meetings were published in peered journals. A separate study on water-use efficiency and drought tolerance in selected willow clones was undertaken in co-operation with the University of Toronto. A research collaboration on translocation of nutrients and carbon allocation in coppice was carried out with the USDA Forest Service in Rheinlander, WI., USA to provide data for a growth model of physiological processes in coppice systems presently under development as an international/IEA co-operation project. Two literature reviews have also been carried out, one dealing with the importance of reserve nutrients for resprouting in willows and the other reviewing existing growth models of fast-growing trees that served as a basis for a modelling workshop held as a joint meeting of this activity, SUAS and New Cultural Treatments and Yield Optimisation activity.

AB  - The world of online news is a world where news consumers must make choices among a plethora of different news sources. Previous research points towards a fragmentation of news consumption across the citizenry. However, not enough attention has been paid to class, in particular cultural capital, and how it shapes how groups in society develop preferences for different categories of online news. Drawing upon a representative national survey in Sweden (N=11,108), a country historically known for its egalitarian news consumption, we show that cultural capital engenders patterns of taste and distaste for different online national news providers. This is manifested in that those rich in cultural capital are more inclined to consume quality' news and to neglect popular' news. A relative lack of cultural capital is associated with a somewhat reverse pattern. News consumption in the online media landscape is a matter of cultural distinction.

AB  - Adaptive and flexible approaches based on implementing different measures as new information emerges have been proposed as a way of enabling robustness towards uncertain future climate change. However, the success of flexible approaches in practice depends on the stability of the relevant organizational landscapes. In this paper, we draw upon key insights from the institutional theories of organizations and research on public administration and climate adaptation in Sweden. We argue that potential organizational instabilities pose a substantial challenge for the mainstreaming of flexible approaches to climate adaptation. Given the unstable character of the relevant organizational landscape in a very stable country such as Sweden, it seems reasonable to also seriously doubt the capacity of the relevant authorities in less stable countries to carry out a great number of monitoring-intensive, and hence attention-demanding, adaptive governance processes over time. Based on our results we argue that it is perilous to simply assume that flexible approaches to climate adaptation will lead to greater robustness.

AB  - Although knowledge of seabed properties is of high importance in selecting sites and determining technical designs and solutions for renewable energy offshore installations, it is often overlooked in marine spatial planning, owing to the absence of appropriate spatial analysis of these conditions. Identification and quantification of seabed conditions and geotechnical properties in finding safe and environmentally sustainable areas for installations of offshore renewable energy are therefore presented, using information produced in marine geological mapping. Six seabed environmental and 13 geotechnical parameters, which can be extracted from existing marine geological information and are of importance in analysing environmental conditions and planning designs are identified and presented, in addition to the suitability of various installation techniques for different areas on the Swedish seabed. Geographical information systems (GIS) are used to geo spatially evaluate the different parameters in finding suitable locations and cable routes for a wave energy plant with gravity and/or suction caisson foundations. The presented categories and ranges of the environmental and geotechnical values for the various parameters have the possibility to be improved as new data are produced from future mapping. The parameters identified and presented here are valuable as they can be incorporated into multi-parameter evaluations for optimal site selection of different offshore installations.

AB  - The widespread practice of applying sewage sludge to arable land makes use of nutrients indispensable for crops and reduces the need for inorganic fertilizer, however this application also provides a potential route for human exposure to chemical contaminants and microbial pathogens in the sludge. A recent concern is that such practice could promote environmental selection and dissemination of antibiotic resistant bacteria or resistance genes. Understanding the risks of sludge amendment in relation to antibiotic resistance development is important for sustainable agriculture, waste treatment and infectious disease management. To assess such risks, we took advantage of an agricultural field trial in southern Sweden, where land used for growing different crops has been amended with sludge every four years since 1981. We sampled raw, semi-digested and digested and stored sludge together with soils from the experimental plots before and two weeks after the most recent amendment in 2017. Levels of selected antimicrobials and bioavailable metals were determined and microbial effects were evaluated using both culture-independent metagenome sequencing and conventional culturing. Antimicrobials or bioavailable metals (Cu and Zn) did not accumulate to levels of concern for environmental selection of antibiotic resistance, and no coherent signs, neither on short or long time scales, of enrichment of antibiotic-resistant bacteria or resistance genes were found in soils amended with digested and stored sewage sludge in doses up to 12 metric tons per hectare. Likewise, only very few and slight differences in microbial community composition were observed after sludge amendment. Taken together, the current study does not indicate risks of sludge amendment related to antibiotic resistance development under the given conditions. Extrapolations should however be done with care as sludge quality and application practices vary between regions. Hence, the antibiotic concentrations and resistance load of the sludge are likely to be higher in regions with larger antibiotic consumption and resistance burden than Sweden.

AB  - Biodiversity can insure ecosystems against declines in their functioning by increasing the mean level of ecosystem processes and decreasing the spatial or temporal variance of these processes. On this basis, mixing tree species is expected to be an effective management strategy to reduce the risk of planting failure in young plantations. We examined the effects of biodiversity insurance on sapling survival in three tree diversity experiments across Belgium. Based on the survival scoring of 89254 saplings, planted in 126 plots with up to four-species mixtures, we tested two hypotheses: (i) variability in plot-level survival is lower for mixtures compared to monocultures due to compensation among the species (i.e. buffering effect) and (ii) mean survival is higher due to facilitation (i.e. performance-enhancing effect). Variation in plot-level survival decreased strongly with diversity, indicating a buffering effect. The risk of severe planting failure was reduced in mixtures because species exhibit different survival rates; therefore, mixing ensures that not all trees in the plantation are equally susceptible to environmental stressors. In contrast, the mean plot-level survival did not increase with diversity, and thus, an overall performance-enhancing effect was lacking. However, species-level analyses did show performance-enhancing effects, where some species profited from mixing while others did not.Synthesis and applications. We conclude that biodiversity through mixing tree species insures young experimental plantations against planting failure and is therefore highly recommended as a planting management strategy. The risk of large mortality gaps is reduced if tree plantation saplings are mixed at the scale of individual trees or small cells of trees.

AB  - From being mainly a question of energy efficiency, new technology and high density, the discussion on sustainable housing today also includes social issues, such as the relationship between the dwelling and its environment and the possibility to participate in and take responsibility for one's own situation. My presentation here takes social sustainability as a point of departure when discussing area planning within the Sami society of Kautokeino, Norway. What different conditions form the basis for sustainable village development in rural areas? The paper starts with a brief presentation of the community, focusing on area planning from its introduction in 1970 until 2000. Much importance is placed on the local adaptations, introduced during the 1990s. The empirical data is a result of my own work as an area planner in Kautokeino during the 1990s, in addition to the fieldwork in connection with my doctoral dissertation in 2003.

AB  - Most of the anthropogenic air pollution sources are located in urban environments. The contribution of these sources to the population of atmospheric particles in the urban environment is poorly known. In this study, we investigated the aerosol particle number concentrations in a diameter range from 1 to 800 nm at a street canyon site and at a background station within 1 km from each other in Helsinki, Finland. We use these number size distribution data together with complementary trace gas data and develop a method to estimate the relative contributions of traffic and atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) to the concentrations of sub3 nm particles. During the daytime, the particle concentrations were higher at the street canyon site than at the background station in all analyzed modes: sub-3 nm particles, nucleation mode (3-25 nm), Aitken mode (25-100 nm), and accumulation mode (100-800 nm). The population of sub-3 nm and nucleation mode particles was linked to local sources such as traffic, while the accumulation mode particles were more related to non-local sources. Aitken mode particles were dominated by local sources at the street canyon site, while at the background station they were mainly influenced by non-local sources. The results of this study support earlier research showing direct emissions of the sub-3 nm particles from traffic. However, by using our new method, we show that, during NPF events, traffic contribution to the total sub3 nm particle concentration can be small and during daytime (6:00-20:00) in spring it does not dominate the sub-3 nm particle population at either of the researched sites. In the future, the contribution of traffic to particle number concentrations in different urban environments can be estimated with a similar approach, but determining the relationships between the gas and particle concentrations from observations needs to be conducted with longer data sets from different urban environments.

AB  - Four decades of U ore production in Hungary provides an opportunity to study the possible environmental effects of mining. The study reveals significant changes in chemical composition of a stalagmite (cave deposit). The good fit between U content changes in the studied deposit and the U ore production rate support the assumption of the relationship with mining activity. An independent chemoenviromental archive, living pine (Pinus sylvestis) trees were also investigated. Data on pine tree cores collected from the same region show different levels of pollution (Cu, Zn, Mn, U) after the 1950s and 1960s, linked to the opening of mines and subsequent dust fallout around the site. Elevated concentrations of detritally derived elements (Si, Al, Th) coupled with a rise in U concentration and change in delta U-234 values of the stalagmite suggest increasing amounts of mine-derived dust from 1 to 3 km distance that settled and washed into the karst system. The combined usage of different proxies not only provides historic records for the anthropogenic impact in the environment, but also allows the timing of U concentration increases within the stalagmite and the identification of elemental behavior from the pollution. This study shows that complementary geochemical archives such as stalagmites and tree rings used together can enhance understanding of past environmental contamination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Home energy management systems (HEMS), providing energy feedback and smart features through in-home displays, have the potential to support more sustainable household decisions concerning energy consumption. However, recent findings from European smart metering trials have reduced the optimism, suggesting only modest savings from energy feedback. In this paper, we investigate the potential of HEMS to foster reductions in energy use, focusing on a population segment of particular relevance; high-income and highly educated households, considered as early adopters of smart grid technologies. Covering 154 households participating in a field trial in a sustainable city district in Stockholm, Sweden during one year, this study draws on the analyses of smart meter electricity and hot tap water data and in-depth interviews to provide an increased understanding of how feedback and features are perceived, used, and acted upon, and resulting effects on awareness, behavior, and consumption. Our results show that impact on energy consumption varies widely across individual households, suggesting that households respond to energy feedback highly individually. Although HEMS may lead to increased awareness of energy consumption, as well as increased home comfort, several obstacles for energy consumption behavioral change are identified. Drawing from these findings, we suggest policy implications and key issues for future research.

AB  - The evolution of drug resistant parasitic sea lice is of major concern to the salmon farming industry worldwide and challenges sustainable growth of this enterprise. To assess current status and development of L. salmonis sensitivity towards different pesticides used for parasite control in Norwegian salmon farming, a national surveillance programme was implemented in 2013. The programme aims to summarize data on the use of different pesticides applied to control L. salmonis and to test L. salmonis sensitivity to different pesticides in farms along the Norwegian coast. Here we analyse two years of test-data from biological assays designed to detect sensitivity-levels towards the pesticides azamethiphos and deltamethrin, both among the most common pesticides used in bath-treatments of farmed salmon in Norway in later years. The focus of the analysis is on how different variables predict the binomial outcome of the bioassay tests, being whether L. salmonis are immobilized/die or survive pesticide exposure. We found that local kernel densities of bath treatments, along with a spatial geographic index of test-farm locations, were significant predictors of the binomial outcome of the tests. Furthermore, the probability of L. salmonis being immobilized/dead after test-exposure was reduced by odds-ratios of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.42-0.86) for 2014 compared to 2013 and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36-0.42) for low concentration compared to high concentration exposure. There were also significant but more marginal effects of parasite gender and developmental stage, and a relatively large random effect of test-farm. We conclude that the present data support an association between local intensities of bath treatments along the coast and the outcome of bioassay tests where salmon lice are exposed to azamethiphos or deltamethrin. Furthermore, there is a predictable structure of L. salmonis phenotypes along the coast in the data, characterized by high susceptibility to pesticides in the far north and far south, but low susceptibility in mid Norway. The study emphasizes the need to address local susceptibility to pesticides and the need for restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy.

AB  - Purposeful transformative change on a level of societal systems, structures and practices is called for in response to contemporary sustainability challenges. Sustainability transition labs and arenas represent a particular set of governance innovations seeking to foster systemic change based on deliberate engagement of multiple actors around complex issues of concern. Most labs aim for long-term contributions in addressing persistent societal challenges and transitioning into sustainability, yet are seldomly evaluated on whether, how and to what extents such contributions become realised in practice. In this paper, we further an analytical framework for comparatively analysing sustainability transition labs and arenas with emphasis on their processes, effects and impacts. The framework is applied on two cases: Energy Futures Lab initiated in Alberta, Canada and the arenas for a Fossil Independent West Sweden -Climate 2030. In particular, the comparison showcases how contextual difference in terms of urgency and turbulence may influence lab activities and how ownership and governance conditions may influence the various directions outputs, effects and wider impacts took. The comparison further illuminates how backcasting and the multi-level perspective may serve as complementary frameworks and tools in lab processes, whose respective role may depend on aspiration and context. We end the paper by providing a series of key considerations in furthering the comparative analytical framework and its application in practice. They orient around the three guiding questions on the why's, what's, and how's of doing comparative research on sustainability transition arenas and labs across their processes, effects and impacts.

AB  - One of the most southern European occurrences of Potamogeton praelongus is in the Czech Republic (CR), with only one native population in the Orlice River floodplain in Eastern Bohemia, the only surviving site from 10 Czech localities known 45 years ago. This species is critically endangered in the CR and needs to be actively protected with a rescue program. The number of P. praelongus sites increases along a latitudinal gradient, from Central to North Europe (CR, Poland, Sweden, and Norway), and correlates with improving conditions (water transparency and nutrient content in water) for this species along this gradient. Although differences in site conditions between Central and North Europe were caused by changes in landscape geomorphology and vegetation during the glacial and postglacial eras, presently, anthropogenic impact is primarily observed.
   The Czech sites for P. praelongus have distinctly lower water depth and transparency, and conversely, higher conductivity, temperature, and shade levels than the Nordic ones these extreme conditions in most biotopes of this light-demanding and mesotrophic species in the CR result in lower fitness and different morphological parameters in the Czech populations. These changes lead to decreased competitive ability against filamentous algae and more competitive aquatic plant species and increase the impact of animals.
   The Nordic nonintensively managed landscape provides numerous large, deep lakes, which are optimal for this aquatic species. In the CR, P. praelongus can currently only survive in rivers and their oxbows, but these are heavily influenced by intensive landscape management and fishing. Comparison of the populations and their site conditions in the CR and other European countries showed that all Czech native and artificially established sites are exposed to eutrophication and its consequences, which are the most important factors affecting the survival of P. praelongus.

AB  - This is the first article in a Series on collaborative projects between European countries, relevant for general practice/family medicine and primary healthcare.
   Telemedicine, in particular the use of the Internet, videoconferencing and handheld devices such as smartphones, holds the potential for further strides in the application of technology for the delivery of healthcare, particularly to communities in rural and remote areas within and without the European Union where this study is taking place. The Northern Periphery Programme has funded the 'Implementing Transnational Telemedicine Solutions' (ITTS) project from September 2011 to December 2013, led by the Centre for Rural Health in Inverness, Scotland. Ten sustainable projects based on videoconsultation (speech therapy, renal services, emergency psychiatry, diabetes), mobile patient self-management (physical activity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease) and home-based health services (medical and social care emergencies, rehabilitation, multi-morbidity) are being implemented by the six partner countries: Scotland, Finland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway and Sweden. In addition, an International Telemedicine Advisory Service, created for the project, provides business expertise and advice. Community panels contribute feedback on the design and implementation of services and ensure 'user friendliness'. The project goals are to improve accessibility of healthcare in rural and remote communities, reducing unnecessary hospital visits and travel in a sustainable way. Opportunities will be provided for comparative research studies. This article provides an introduction to the ITTS project and how it aims to fulfil these needs. The ITTS team encourage all healthcare providers to at least explore possible technological solutions within their own context.

AB  - It is shown that countries, regions, cities, corporations and universities are actively developing their environmental policies. This is facilitated by modern innovative technologies, such as alternative energy, energy-saving equipment, new motor vehicles, processing of wastes into useful goods, and many more. Countries have to adapt to the global climate change, which is accelerating at an unprecedented speed. One of the most sensitive places in terms of global warming is Siberia. This territory as a unique natural mega-construction largely regulates the carbon cycle and the climate of the planet. Environmental policy is on the agenda in almost all countries of the world, but in some countries, such as France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, it is given priority. Russia began to develop an environmental policy on its territory. As known, Russia made 2017 the year of ecology. Environmental friendliness is incorporated into the engineering and infrastructure solutions of a number of new cities. The most striking examples of such cities are the eco-cities of Songdo and Masdar. The cities are provided with solar energy, have a pneumatic system of waste collection, have mostly electric public transport. Traditional cities are also shifting to new ways of saving energy and creating a clean infrastructure. In the world, there has been a mass policy of transition to the design of offices based on environmental principles. Such giants of the hi-tech industry as Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, etc. set fashion in this area. Russia has a rating "Green Offices in Russia". Three criteria are analyzed: non-toxicity, energy efficiency and low carbon living. The most active in the ranking of 2017 were representatives of the IT industry.
   The world's leading universities are actively implementing the environmental component in their development along with educational programs and research projects. The concept of a green university involves the use of environmental innovation in the university. Innovations include landscaping, organization of a separate waste collection system, energy efficiency. Campuses have park areas, water bodies, buildings with "zero heat emission", and more. Students of such universities participate in projects and actions, are engaged in research and project work, make business plans taking into account environmental protection. Taking into account that green universities actively cooperate with municipal, city and regional management structures and business partners, this can ensure the improvement and green development of their district, city and region as a whole.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to summarize results of two research projects implemented as collaborative actions of Joint stock company "Latvijas Valsts mezi" (LVM), SKOGFORSK, The Forestry Research Institute of Sweden (Skogforsk), Latvian State Forestry Research Institute "Silava" (Silava) and State limited company VSIA "Vides projekti" (Vides projekti). The first project, "Forest energy from small-dimension stands, infrastructure objects and stumps" (LVM, Skogforsk and Silava), has the aim to estimate productivity and prime costs of stump extraction in Latvian conditions; the second project, "Biomasas izmantosanas ilgtspejibas kriteriju pielietosana un pasakumu izstrade" (Application of sustainability criteria of utilization of biofuels and elaboration of preventive actions to secure sustainable use of biofuels, Silava and Vides projekti), besides other tasks has targeted to estimate environmentally sustainable resources of stumps for biofuel in Latvian forests. The results of the first project demonstrated, that harvestable amount of stumps in calculation to dry tons is 12% of harvested volume of roundwood in cubic meters under bark. This assumption corresponds to average Swedish and Finnish conditions, but it should be evaluated further in Latvia, taking in account different dimensions of trees and composition of forest stands. The productivity of two key elements of stump harvesting, extraction and forwarding is, respectively, 5.2 and 5.1 t(dry) E-0-h (dry tons per efficient hour) with one way terrain transport distance 500 m. The total time consumption to produce and supply 1 LVm(3) (LV - loose volume) of stump chips is about 12 minutes in calculation to E-0-h, if one way terrain transport distance is 500 m, road transport distance of stumps -7 km and road transport distance of chips -50 km. The prime cost of stump biofuel production under the same conditions is 4.89 LVL LVm(3) in calculation to current fuel price. This cost includes soil preparation for forest regeneration. The total potential of stumps in clear-cuts according to the Forest inventory data about harvesting in 2007 was 1350 th.t(dry). A part of those stumps are located in poor forest types on sandy soils, where stump extraction is not recommended, therefore, from environmental point of view the available resources are about 1228 th.t(dry). Taking in account technological losses, technically available resources reduce to 737 th.t(dry) yearly corresponding to about 3903 th.MWh of net energy. It should be taken in account, that no technical or economical limitations are included in this estimation. The total carbon (C) emissions during harvesting and supply of stump biofuel as well as utilization of wood ash as a compensatory fertilizer corresponds to 5.6 % of carbon content in biofuel.

AB  - Little information exists on the history and ecology of free-living colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in Europe, including its dark north-western subspecies (Apis mellifera mellifera). Our aim was to investigate the presence of colonies of free-living, native honey bees (A. m. mellifera) during the last two centuries in Sweden. For this we examined systematic interviews of beekeepers (176 answers from 158 questionnaires) performed in the years 1928-1981, with information dating back to the early 1800s. An overwhelming majority of answers (96%) confirmed the past presence of free-living colonies of honey bees in Sweden. While some stated that free-living colonies were simply absconded swarms from managed hives, the majority of interviewees (69%) believed that free-living colonies were of a truly wild origin. A decreasing trend in first-hand accounts of free-living colonies suggests that free-living populations underwent a dramatic decline at the end of the 19th century. This was also expressed in words by many interviewees, who in 14 cases stated that the loss of old forests and tree-cavity nest sites at the end of the 1800s was the primary cause of the decline. Direct accounts of perennial, free-living colonies, combined with detailed descriptions of the collection of large free-living colonies and/or wild honey, is strong evidence of free-living honey bees being well adapted to winter survival. These accounts contradict the officially supported view that the honey bee is a recently imported, domesticated, non-native species in Sweden. The results give a scientific underpinning and provide inspiration for the restoration of native forests which could facilitate populations of free-living colonies of A. m. mellifera exposed to natural selection. This could potentially lead to its return as a fully wild species. In an uncertain future, allowing for a natural lifestyle could increase resilience and reinstate characteristics that are otherwise lost in honey bees due to the increasing effects of artificial trait selection.
   Implications for insect conservationOur results present strong evidence for populations of free-living colonies of A. m. mellifera in the recent past, which calls for a revised look at its conservation status and management. Allowing and supporting free-living colonies of this subspecies should be evaluated as a method for conservation.

AB  - Children's early engagement in design of outdoor spaces can form the basis of later attitudes and responsible action for sustainability. The present study is part of a participatory action research project in an urban multi-ethnic preschool in Sweden, involving children, parents, preschool staff and management with a focus on improving the preschool playground. The methodology involved children taking pictures of the outdoor space, informal participant observation by one researcher and conversations with children and teachers. Analyses completed of selected fieldwork excerpts focus on learning opportunities for children and adults, children's participation, cooperation and leadership for sustainability. Deeper awareness and confidence, and practical pedagogies for staff in preschools are required for effective sustainability education. A joint frame of reference on pedagogical practices and processes for reflection is needed within and across early childhood institutions. More continuous training of staff and preschool leadership would be of benefit. However, such commitment is ultimately a matter of policy to invest in giving preschools the means to develop and realise ambitions for environmental and sustainability education.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper was to assess the economic impact of investment in different animal welfare-enhancing flooring solutions in Swedish dairy farming.Design/methodology/approachThe authors developed a bio-economic model and used stochastic partial budgeting approach to simulate the economic consequences of enhancing solid and slatted concrete floors with soft rubber covering.FindingsThe findings highlight that keeping herds on solid and slatted concrete floor surfaces with soft rubber coverings is a profitable solution, compared with keeping herds on solid and slatted concrete floors without a soft covering. The profit per cow when kept on a solid concrete floor with soft rubber covering increased by 13%-16% depending on the breed. Practical implicationsPromoting farm investments such as improvement in flooring solution, which have both economic and animal welfare incentives, is a potential way of promoting sustainable dairy production. Farmers may make investments in improved floors, resulting in enhanced animal welfare and economic outcomes necessary for sustaining dairy production.Originality/valueThis literature review indicated that the economic impact of investment in specific types of floor improvement solutions, investment costs and financial outcomes have received little attention. This study provides insights needed for a more informed decision-making process when selecting optimal flooring solutions for new and renovated barns that improve both animal welfare and ease the burden on farmers and public financial support.

AB  - There exist numerous ecotechnologies for recovery and reuse of carbon and nutrients from various waste streams before they are lost to runoff. However, it remains largely unknown how growing implementation of such ecotechnologies affect nutrient emissions to surface waters at catchment scale. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed by application of SWAT model in three case study catchments draining to the Baltic Sea: Vantaanjoki (Finland), Fyrisan (Sweden) and Slupia (Poland). Sustainability analysis with Multi-Criteria Analysis was applied in the stakeholder workshops in the case study areas to assess different ecotechnology alternatives. The following ecotechnologies received the highest sustainability scores: in Vantaanjoki anaerobic digestion, based on mostly agricultural residues; in Fyrisan source-separation of wastewaters; in Slupia nutrient extraction within the wastewater treatment process. The effect of application of digestate on agricultural soils in the Vantaanjoki catchment was simulated by adjusting the model parameters describing the organic carbon content and physical properties of soil. The results showed small reductions of nutrient loads to the Gulf of Finland. Larger reductions of nutrient loads to Lake Malaren in Sweden and the Baltic Sea in Poland were achieved as a result of the wastewater treatment upgrades. In the Fyrisan catchment, higher relative reductions were simulated for TN than TP, and in dry years than in wet years. Although the studied ecotechnologies did not show as high effectiveness in nutrient load reduction as combinations of traditional Best Management Practices reported in literature, they do have other multiple benefits including crop yield increase, electricity, heat and bio-based fertilizer production.

AB  - Justice in sustainability transitions requires states to design transition policies that 'leave no-one behind'. Emphasising fairness, however, may entail slowing or scaling down the impetus of sustainability transition. To examine this risk empirically, we analysed how stakeholders frame justice in deliberating policy measures needed to support just transition in agricultural land use and dietary changes, the cornerstones of building healthier and climate friendlier food systems in Finland. The results show that justice frames focus on the potential impacts of transition, largely ignore global scale, and prioritise social justice claims at the cost of environmental ambition. To create just and environmentally effective policies, policymakers need to consider justice at the level of policy-mixes combining environmental and social policies. Furthermore, they need to acknowledge systemic injustices present in existing systems while striving towards just transition.

AB  - Restoration of semi-natural grasslands by cattle grazing is among the most practical options for reversing the decline of northern European floristic diversity, but no studies on this subject are available. In this work the success of restoration of abandoned, privately owned mesic semi-natural grasslands by farmers receiving support from the EU agri-environmental support scheme was studied in southwestern Finland. Three kinds of grasslands were compared: old (continuously cattle grazed), new (cattle grazing restarted 3-8 years ago) and abandoned pastures (grazing terminated >10 years ago). Plant species composition of the three pasture types was floristically different in multivariate analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling). Total species richness, richness of grassland plants, indicator plants and rare plants were highest in old and lowest in abandoned pastures in all studied spatial scales (0.25-0.8 ha, 1 and 0.01 m(2)). The results were congruent with different scales and species list definitions, suggesting that species density scale (1 m(2)) can be used as a partial surrogate for large scale species richness. Species richness of new pastures was 20% higher on 0.25-0.8 ha, 40-50% higher on 1 m(2) and 30% higher on the 0.01 m(2) scale compared to abandoned grasslands. Rare species showed insignificant response to resumed grazing. Despite problems in management quality, this study showed promising results of restoration of abandoned grasslands by cattle grazing on private farms. However, populations of several rare grassland plants may not recover with present cattle grazing regimes. Management regulations in the agri-environmental support scheme need to be defined more precisely for successful restoration.

AB  - More and more, society's expectations of rural landscapes are rising and farmers are increasingly stimulated to incorporate 'green services' into their operational management. This assumes matching perceptions of the landscape between farmers, landscape experts and the general public. A method based on a picture enquiry was used to measure landscape perception in the 'Pajottenland', a central Belgian, rural area. Additional questions assessed the importance of meanings and functions of the landscape and revealed differences in perception among three target groups (farmers, landscape experts and country-dwellers). The results confirmed that the three groups look at landscapes in a different way, attaching importance to different landscape features and finding different functions appropriate for the considered landscapes. As a consequence, policies concerning landscape servicing by the farming community should incorporate appropriate incentives of communication and generate modes of understanding between different stakeholders.

AB  - In the light of declines in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks, we sought to determine 14 the extent to which stream crossings along a newly constructed section of the Trans Labrador Highway (TLH Phase II) in southern Labrador accorded with government regulations for fish habitat protection. We surveyed crossings of permanent streams over a 210 km road segment, containing 4 bridges and 47 culverts. Fifty-three percent of culverts posed problems to fish passage, due to poor design or poor installation. We conjecture that cost and inadequate environmental oversight in the field explain the weak compliance with the relevant fisheries guidelines. Our research has prompted the federal regulator to instigate remediation of problems with the Phase II part of the highway. In addition many of the planned stream crossings for Phase III of the TLH were re-designed, and a commitment to careful monitoring of the installations has been made by the federal regulator in cooperation with the indigenous inhabitants.

AB  - Background and Aims White clover (Trifolium repens) is an important component of sustainable livestock systems around the world. Its exploitation for agriculture in the northern, marginal areas is, however, currently limited by the lack of cultivars that combine persistence and high production potential. The aims are to investigate whether it is feasible to create breeding material of white clover for these areas by combining winter hardiness of northerly populations with good yielding ability of more southerly cultivars.
   Methods A total of 166 crosses of 14 different parental combinations between winter-hardy, low-yielding populations of northern origin and high-yielding commercial cultivars of more southerly origin were tested under field conditions in Iceland and Norway and the parental populations were compared in Norway. Spaced plants were transplanted into a smooth meadow grass (Poa pratensis) sward. Dry matter yield was estimated for 2 years after planting in Norway and morphological characters associated with yielding capacity were measured at both sites.
   Key Results The results showed that southerly cultivars had larger leaves and higher yielding potential than northern types but suffered more winter damage. Significant variation was found between full-sib families within the different parental combinations for all morphological characteristics measured in all three trials. However, it was difficult to detect any consistent morphological patterns between progeny groups across trial sites. No significant correlations were found between leaflet area and survival.
   Conclusions The present study has confirmed that it should be possible to simultaneously select for good winter survival and larger leaves and, hence, higher yielding ability under marginal conditions.

AB  - A circular city (CC) presents opportunities to address the urban nexus of citizens and material flows in a circular economy (CE). Still, the role of the citizen in shaping both CCs and CE is understudied. We start with a conceptual review of how the role of the citizen has been studied for CCs. There, we identify acknowledgment of the citizen as a political actor and subject to behavior change. We further investigate the role given to and expected from citizens in the case of the city of Trondheim in Norway, where the agendas and discourses of CE are already widespread. In this city, the role given to citizens is oriented towards commercial or political activity, with the local government playing a role in enabling citizens' agency. We conclude that the local government can leverage a more politically oriented citizenship to support the public services and infrastructures needed.

AB  - This study aimed at comparing the composition, the structure and the organisation of con ticolous bryophyte assemblages (recorded within a 400 m(2) plot) between three silvicultural managements widely conducted in Europe: Even-Aged pure beech Forest (EAF), Coppice With Standards system (CWS) and Selective Cutting systems (SC). The stands used for the study were located in two neighbouring regions of northern France. Comparisons were performed using a functional approach based on species' ecological requirements and life traits combined with multivariate analyses. Along the silvicultural cycle of the EAF, stand age and canopy opening were the main ecological factors influencing corticolous bryophyte assemblages. Old stands with a low canopy cover contained all the functional groups, with a preponderance of late successional and obligatory shade species. The regeneration stage appeared to be an outlier because of its lowest species richness. Although the same functional groups occurred in CWS and SC as in EAF, the bryophyte assemblages shared compositional and structural characteristics similar to those of EAF early and middle successional stages. This indicates that successional processes are not maintained by these management types and that the latter do not seem to favour late successional-obligatory shade species. EAF successional stages, CWS and SC did not exhibit differences in the relative species richness (i.e. the ratio between the number of species within the 400 m(2) plot (SR) and the richness of the local species pool) except for EAF regeneration stands.
   The results are used to propose practical ecological background information for the elaboration of forest management policies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The traditional use of piped systems for stormwater management is increasingly criticized as being unsustainable'. These systems are part of the water domain where much research has focused on sustainable development indicators to support decision-makers in selecting systems that are more sustainable. However, the interest in sustainable development indicators is low. This paper identifies conditions to engage the practitioners to inform their actions in regard to sustainable stormwater management. Empirical evidence has been obtained from interviews with water professionals from Swedish municipalities. The environmental-technical discourse of sustainable stormwater development is a strong barrier in the change process, to the neglect of the social aspects. In the interviews, reframing the discourse was possible in visions of future sustainable stormwater systems embracing green infrastructure. In action, primary conditions can support sustainable pathways in realizing this vision. The paper suggests further incentives for increased implementation of non-structural measures by developing the identified conditions.

AB  - The population of barnacle geese wintering in Denmark has shown a steep increase during the last decades, prompting a parallel escalation of agricultural conflicts. In Denmark, economic compensation to farmers suffering goose damage to crops is not practiced, but despite that the barnacle goose is fully protected, landowners can obtain a permit to undertake so-called derogation shooting (lethal scaring) to reduce local damage to agricultural crops where other means of scaring have been insufficient. Here, we describe the development in numbers and derogation efforts of barnacle geese in Denmark in the period 2010/11 - 2018/19. We demonstrate that differences in the number of issued derogation permits across the country is primarily explained by differences in barnacle goose abundance, and secondarily, by prevalence of vulnerable crops and differences in crop productivity. Hence, derogation efforts are highest in areas with many geese, high proportions of crops vulnerable to goose grazing and high crop yields. Our analysis indicates that the level of conflict, and probably the economic impact of affected farmers, is proportional to the abundance of geese present locally. While the increasing derogation shooting may be a temporary solution to individual farmers, current unorganised practice might only redistribute geese locally and increase energy demands of the affected birds. Currently, there is a lack of alternative and undisturbed accommodation areas in the Danish agricultural landscape for the displacement of geese to achieve a satisfactory effect of derogation shooting.

AB  - Quantitative estimates of cadmium (U), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) flows in percolating soil water and in surface run-off on arable land are rather scarce. Such information is essential for establishing reliable mass balances of trace metals, e.g. on field level, due to the fact that the trace metal outputs in water are quantitatively significant in field balance calculations. The aim of this study was to quantify trace metal leaching and surface run-off for a 5-year period at sites representing different soil types (Eutric Regosol, Thionic Gleysol, Dystric Cambisol) at the Ojebyn experimental farm in Northern Sweden. The metal outputs in water were estimated by combining chemical analysis of elements in soil water with simulations of water flow using the hydrological SOIL model. Average Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations (for three soils and 5 years) in soil water at 50 cm depth were 0.10, 21 and 11 mu g L(-1), respectively. However, there was a large variation between years and soil types. The relative variation (coefficient of variation) between soil types for average Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations was in the range 20-60% depending on year. The average Cd, Cu and Zn output by leaching were 0.22 +/- 0.20, 50 +/- 33 and 24 +/- 20 g ha(-1) year(-1), respectively, while the average outputs by surface run-off were 0.13 +/- 0.09, 43 +/- 18 and 16 +/- 9 g ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Both the simulated amount of water run-off and metal concentrations in the soil water had a significant impact on the variability of the metal flows. In this study the differences in metal concentrations in soil water due to differences in farming practice were much less important than the inter- and intra-field differences and temporal variability. The definition of the lowermost soil layer boundary of the system was found to have a great influence on the resulting metal mass balance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With an increasing demand for forest-based products, there is a growing interest in introducing fast-growing non-native tree species in forest management. Such introductions often have unknown consequences for native forest biodiversity. In this study, we examine epiphytic lichen species richness and species composition on the trunks of non-native Pinus contorta and compare these to the native Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies in managed boreal forests in northern Sweden across a chronosequence of age classes. Overall, we recorded a total of 66,209 lichen occurrences belonging to 57 species in the 96 studied forest stands. We found no difference in species richness of lichens between stands of P. contorta and P. sylvestris, but stands of P. abies had higher total species richness. However, species richness of lichens in stands of P. abies decreased with increasing stand age, while no such age effect was detected for P. contorta and P. sylvestris. Lichen species composition progressively diverged with increasing stand age, and in 30-year-old stands all three tree species showed species-specific assemblages. Epiphytic lichen assemblages in stands of 30-year-old P. contorta were influenced by greater basal area, canopy closure, and average diameter at breast height, P. abies stands by higher branch density and canopy closure, and stands of P. sylvestris by greater bark crevice depth. Differences in lichen species richness and composition were mainly explained by canopy closure and habitat availability, and the greater canopy closure in mature P. abies stands promoted the colonization and growth of calicioid lichen species. Our results indicate that the non-native P. contorta have similar species richness as the native P. sylvestris. The main difference in lichen species richness and composition is between P. abies and Pinus spp. in managed forests of boreal Sweden.

AB  - Environmental assessment needs of Decision Support Systems (DSSs) able to consider several aspects in a unique analysis framework. The complexity of interaction among ecological, economic and political variables and a widespread lack of data availability lead to difficulty in bringing together large scale analysis and local planning systems. This loop can be solved through flexible tools able to relate large scale environmental assessment with medium and small scale DSS, useful for local decisions makers.
   The present research aims at creating a spatial model, based on Geographic Information Systems (GISs), capable to quantify the potential amount of woody biomass from forest sector at several evaluation scales, to consider the theoretical impact of biomass removal on forest multifunctionality and to estimate the potential trade-off between forest functions in case of bioenergy chain development.
   The model is carried out basing on multifunctionality aspects and their potential relationship with biomass energy production. The forest functions considered in the model are: (i) soil and water protection, (ii) biodiversity and habitat conservation, (iii) fire risk prevention, (iv) tourist and recreational function and (v) economic evaluation related to timber and bioenergy processing. The structure of the model is based on sub-models that enable biomass chain analysis from large scale to small scale. Large scale analysis is developed using forest yield data, protected areas and main and forest roads localization, geomorphological variables and fire risk maps. An increase of input data (economic and logistic variables) is requested for medium and small scale analysis. The model is tested from national (Italy) to regional (Tuscany region in Central Italy) and provincial scale (province of Trento in North-Eastern Italian Alps). Results stress how the model can be able to depict territorial differences in several contexts and to consider respective influence on estimation of biomass availability. Finally, the Compromise Programming (CP) methodology permits defining the optimal quantity of residues removal in different compartments according to priority forest function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Great concern has been expressed about the rapid increases in anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions. Taxation of CO2 emissions and carbon capture are two ways of reducing the emissions. We analyse these two measures in the context of a case study of an extension of a small industrial park in Norway. Natural gas is the major input factor for the production in the park and the CO2 emissions are therefore a concern. A decision support model for investment analysis of industrial parks is established. In this paper we will have a particular focus on the carbon capture facility, which handles flexible and dynamic operation in terms of varying volume and concentration of CO2. The carbon capture plant may capture CO2 emissions from all, some or none of the other plants in the park. The results from the case study indicate that if emissions from the power plant are the only emission taxed, it is not profitable to build a carbon capture plant. This changes however if all plants are subject to CO2 taxes. We also find that emissions from the power plant are the least cost efficient plant to capture CO2 from in the industrial park. This is due to the high volume of exhaust gas and low concentration of CO2. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The processes limiting the population recovery of the kelp Saccharina latissima after recent large-scale loss from the south coast of Norway are poorly understood. Previous investigations do, however, suggest that the impacts of biotic interactions (epibiosis and competition) and increased water turbidity are important. We investigated the depth-related patterns of growth, epibiosis, and mortality in two sample populations of kelp, from the south and the southwest coast of Norway. The investigations were performed over a period of seven months, in a crossed translocational study, where kelps were mounted on rigs at six depths (1, 3, 6, 9, 15, and 24 m). In a second experiment, the amounts of light blocked by different epibiont layers growing on the kelp frond were investigated. While growth decreased with depth in spring and summer, the kelp grew faster at 15 m than at shallower depths in fall. Survival was low both in shallow water and below 15 m depth. Epibionts covered the kelp growing at depths from 1 to 9 m, and the laboratory study showed that the coverage may have deprived the individuals of as much as 90% of the available light. Although the depth-related results we present apply-in the strictest sense-only to kelp translocated on rigs, we argue that the relative patterns are relevant for natural populations. Growth and survival of S. latissima is likely to be reduced by heavy loads of epibionts, while depths where epibionts are sparse may be close to the lower limit of the kelps depth distribution along the south coast of Norway. This suggests that a vertical squeeze, or narrowing of the distribution range of kelp forests may be occurring in Norway.

AB  - Strategic spatial planning is important for developing long-term visions and strategies towards regional and local sustainability. This paper explores if and how strategic spatial planning could be useful for overcoming some barriers related to new sustainable ways of heating residential areas, using district heating systems based on industrial excess heat. This longitudinal study builds on interviews with municipal and private actors in six Swedish municipalities. It highlights that important barriers can be overcome by influencing the design and location of residential districts and industrial activities. Further, it identifies missed opportunities in local spatial planning practice as stakeholders are involved late in the planning when much is set, leaving little space for stakeholders to have an impact. Consequently, there might be a lack of knowledge and expertise in how such issues could enhance planning. Strategic spatial planning could facilitate conditions for excess heat-based systems of district heating as it implies a broader systems perspective which could enhance a broader planning scope. Plan programs could bring about more strategic spatial planning processes as these require early stakeholder involvement. If taking stakeholder involvement one step further to stakeholder collaboration or co-production, an even broader planning scope would be achieved.

AB  - An integrated process-based model was used to study how the changing climate affects the availability of water and nitrogen, and consequently the dynamics of productivity of Norway spruce (Picea abies) on sites with different initial soil water conditions in southern Finland over a 100-year period. The sensitivity of the total stem volume growth in relation to short-term availability of water and nitrogen was also analyzed. We found that a high proportion (about 88-92%) of the total precipitation was lost in total evapotranspiration (incl.canopy evaporation (E-c), transpiration (E-t) and ground surface evaporation (E-g)), under both current and changing climate. Furthermore, under the changing climate the cumulative amount of E-c and E-g were significantly higher, while E-t was largely lower than under the current climate. Additionally, the elevated temperature and increased expansion of needle area index (L) enhanced E-c. Under the changing climate, the increasing soil water deficit (W-d) reduced the canopy stomatal conductance (g(cs)), the E-t, humus yield (H, available nitrogen source) and nitrogen uptake (N-up) of the trees. During the latter phases of the simulation period, the canopy net photosynthesis (P-nc) was lower due to the reduced N-up and soil water availability. This also reduced the total stem volume production (V-s) on the site with the lower initial soil moisture content. The growth was slightly more sensitive to the change in precipitation than to the change in nitrogen content of the needles, when the elevated temperature was assumed. According to our findings, drought stress episodes may become more frequent under the changing climate. Thus, adaptive management strategies should be developed to sustain the productivity of Norway spruce in these conditions, and thus, to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.

AB  - Major efforts to improve the governability of coastal and marine regions, in Europe and the world, are currently under way, with regionalization as a new entry point. This article reconsiders the potential contribution of pre-modern fisher organizations to these processes. Pre-modern organizations have deep historical roots, and anthropologists have highlighted their existence and features in various parts of the world, including Europe. The move toward regionalization raises new queries about the utility of pre-modern organizations in a modern setting. We consider four cases, located in Poland (maszoperias), Spain (cofradias), Norway (fisher cooperation Lofoten Islands), and India (uur panchayat system). Our argument is that pre-modern organizations are relevant and adaptive to new challenges and provide important lessons for regionalization in the modern era. They contribute local knowledge, create social order, solve conflicts, and assist in regulating fishing effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While we often have detailed information about the foundation species, we know less about its associated species. We explore such a situation, comparing the responses of lichen species associated with different tree taxa, which differ in successional strategy, to the environmental change that takes place when the surrounding trees are clear-cut. Location Boreal forests in Sweden. Methods We illustrated general differences in lichen species composition among four tree taxa and three stand categories using ordination of species occurrences. To analyse responses to clear-cutting we modelled the occurrence probability individually for 144 epiphytic lichen species from the lower 2 m of 2,400 tree trunks of four tree taxa in 130 stands, and compared trees in closed-canopy forests with those retained in logged stands, using Bayesian hierarchical models. Results The composition of lichens on aspen trees deviated clearly from that on the other tree species. Also lichen responses to logging differed among main host tree taxa, where lichen species associated with birches, European aspen, and Scots pine increased in probability of occurrence on trees in logged areas compared to intact forest, while lichen species associated with Norway spruce decreased. We found that time lags for changes in occupancy existed primarily in the increase, but not in the decline, of the groups of lichens associated with different tree taxa. Conclusions Lichens associated with different tree taxa vary in their response to the environmental change brought about by logging, but in a way that differs from the differences in species composition among host trees. Our results highlight the importance of considering the taxa of trees in forest management for the conservation of their associated lichen species. The extent to which the ecology of foundation species influences their associated species merits further inquiry, since such knowledge may facilitate predictions of responses of associated species also in other species-rich communities.

AB  - Most of the analyses related to eutrophication focus on cyanobacterial blooms or increased primary production. However, eutrophication may also lead to disappearance of species, which is a real risk to the ecosystem. In this paper, we introduce a prototype of a decision assessment model that takes into account the biodiversity risks of eutrophication. The model was developed within the EVAGULF project and it also includes a Bayesian classification tool for water areas, needed in the implementation of the EU water framework directive. Existing monitoring databases, results from published literature and expert knowledge have been integrated and analyzed by Bayesian risk assessment methodology. The selected computational methods enable combining data that are of different nature as well as concrete elucidation of benefits and risks associated with alternative management decisions. The preliminary results enable evaluation of the country-specific abatement measures: eg. which areas and populations can be managed only by national management actions and in which cases international co-operation is needed to achieve the objectives. The role of the global climate change is also considered. This kind of knowledge is essential for more cost-effective use of the financial resources available for the protection of the Gulf of Finland.

AB  - Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, their relationship to each other (DIN/DIP) as predisposing (nutrient) factors, as well as prevailing weather as a triggering factor all work together to induce the primary production and hence the eutrophication (hypertrophication) process in surface waters.  Sulfate likewise is a decisive predisposing factor influencing the eutrophication process by reducing N availability but increasing P availability and thus acting towards an N limitation of the primary production.  This is one of the reasons why marine (coastal) waters and estuaries often exhibit N limitation with respect to primary production, while freshwater ecosystems often tend to exhibit P limitation.
   Within the N and P balance of agriculture of some countries of Western Europe (Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, FRG, UK and Sweden for N, resp. Netherlands, FRG and GDR for P) more the level than the efficiency of the N and P applications indicates the extent of the nutrient surplus.  Despite 59-73% N utilization in plant production, the rate of 13-23% for agriculture as a whole equals to the 12-21% efficiency of N use in animal production.  The varying N surplus in agriculture in the separate countries of 124 to 465 kg N ha-1 a-1 is determined almost exclusively by the level of the N application and not by its efficiency.  The situation is similar for P:  In spite of P utilization in plant production of 59-76%, P utilization in total agriculture is only 11-38%, or comparable to the P efficiency within animal production of 10-34%.  The differing P excess balance of 55 to 88 kg P2O5 ha-1 a-1 is influenced by the level of the P application.  The N and P efficacy of total agriculture hence is determined almost completely by that of animal production, since 83-95% (N basis) and 76-94% (P basis) of the total plant production (on top of the nationally varying levels of N and P use via imported feeds) are fed to animals - with the low N and P utilization cited above.
   Agriculture's share of the N and P emissions into surface water of several countries/regions in Western Europe (FRG, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Switzerland, Norway) ranges from 37 to 82% resp. 27 to 38%.  Its share in the flus into the North Sea catchment basin will be about 60% for N and 25% for P related only to the anthropogenic material carried by the rivers.  Agriculture's share in the atmospheric N emissions into the North and Baltic Seas can be estimated at about 65% or 55%, resp. while the remaining approx. 35% or 45%, resp. are traceable primarily to anthropogenic burning processes.
   For agriculture the priority lies in limiting N emissions into surface water caused by leaching, erosion and NH3 emissions, and reducing P emissions mainly through soil conservation (protection against erosion) and water protection.  As regards N this means a demand for comprehensive protection of groundwater and atmosphere differentiated according to the potential for losses or the risk of losses on a site, also outside the protection zones.  As regards P only those areas can be included in the demand for reduction of emissions that are actually threatened by erosion or surface runoff.  Plenty of short-term and long-term measures are available to agriculture to reduce N and P emissions.  Especially the long-range measures (such as creating nutrient balances on farms and fields, the integration of animal and plant production, maintaining maximum livestock densities according to the ability of areas to absorb nutrients, altered feeding programs in animal nutrition, changes in livestock keeping (slurry --> deep litter), increasing the internal and external recycling of N and P) are capable of bringing about a satisfactory degree of success within the next 20 to 30 years.

AB  - The aim of this study was to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which tree species and their mixtures change the soil underneath the trees. Interest towards mixed-species forests has increased in northern countries since mixed forests are potentially superior to monocultures with respect to biodiversity and risk management, for example. Little information is available on the soil effects of mixed-species stands in boreal regions and the mechanisms behind the effects are not well understood. The specific aim of this study was to compare the long-term response of forest soil C and N cycling processes for birches and conifers growing alone in single-species stands and together in mixed-species stands. Furthermore, the aim was to relate this response to changes in the soil composition of terpenes and phenolic compounds, groups of compounds in laboratory experiments shown to affect soil C and N cycling processes. One tree-species experiment, located in middle-eastern Finland, had 45-year-old tree stands, with two replicate plots of single-species silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and two spruce plots with birch admixtures (23% and 37% of stem number), all growing on originally similar soil. With most of the humus layer parameters, the measured values in the mixed-species treatment were close to the expected values, which were calculated based on the proportions of each tree species (birch or spruce) from the total stem number in the mixed treatment and the corresponding single-species treatment values. However, net N mineralization was more stimulated by the birch admixture, whereas both the concentrations of volatile monoterpenes and ammonium were lower than expected. In the second tree-species experiment, located in middle-western Finland, the responses of soil properties to single-species stands of silver birch, Norway spruce and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were compared after 20 years to the responses of mixed-species stands containing these species. All tree-species treatments had three replicate plots. In this experiment, the organic matter properties in the humus layer of the mixed-species treatment resembled those of the conifer treatments, probably due to the overdensity of the mixed-species stands. This study showed that mixing tree species may lead to the expected soil properties based on the proportion of each species from the total stem number but not necessarily for all soil properties. Mechanisms based on the chemical composition of organic matter, i.e. C-to-N ratio and concentrations of mono- and diterpenes and condensed tannins, may provide some explanations to soil N cycling processes.

AB  - In the face of the climate crisis, cities have committed to ambitious sustainability targets. The UN Agenda 2030 and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a globally shared language for decision-makers and policymakers regarding their sustainability objectives. Espoo, Finland's second-largest city, has become a pioneer in implementing the Agenda, not least due to its recent nomination as 'Europe's most sustainable city'. This article investigates the use of the Agenda in strategic governance in Espoo with the aim to identify challenges and opportunities of SDG localisation. Although the Agenda has affected many aspects of policymaking in Espoo and ambitions have been high to shine as an SDG pioneer, a systematic integration of sustainability concerns into policymaking is not yet achieved. Moreover, there is a need to question the reliance of the Agenda framework on the ecological modernisation paradigm, which does not see economic growth and ecological sustainability at odds.

AB  - The Swedish forest industry sector produces timber, energy and other commodities, but has to consider the vested interests of other parties. This paper adopts a perspective whereby the modem forest industry sector is regarded as a system for the production of energy products, and where traditional forest industry products are seen as commodities that are released as energy at the end of their lives. Assisted by a review of the literature, the market forces affecting forest fuels are assessed from the perspectives of forest owners, machine contractors and purchasers of forest fuels.
   Present-day forest operations are highly efficient in terms of invested and inherent energy in harvested timber. There are also markets, methods and technology for the production of biofuels. However this harvest entails economic and environmental costs. The markets for biofuels seem to be growing, and bioenergy from forests competes with energy produced by other actors. Designing systems that provide a profitable flow of bioenergy from forestry without risking the sustainable use of forests as regards the long-term supply of nutrients and maintaining biological diversity constitutes a challenge for scientists and practitioners working in the sector. The author suggests existing systems for environmental and forest certification as a means of safeguarding and confirming that the harvest and trade of forest fuels comply with standards for ensuring sustainable forestry (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Unaccounted mortality caused by discarding or pre-catch losses is a major challenge for fisheries management. In pelagic fisheries, a considerable proportion of catches may be lost due to intentional release of unwanted catch (slipping) or net bursts (fishing net tears due to the weight of the catch). Here we review and estimate ranges of discard and pre-catch mortality for two important pelagic fisheries, the Northeast Atlantic (NEA) mackerel and Norwegian spring spawning (NSS) herring, and explore the effects on stock estimates and catch advice. We show that mortality caused by discarding, slipping, and net bursts is unknown but probably corresponds to a considerable percentage of total registered catches. Including estimated unaccounted mortality into assessment models leads to underestimation of the stock levels by 3.7-19.5% and 2.8-6.8% for NEA mackerel and NSS herring, respectively, corresponding to up to several million tonnes of fish that die annually due to fishing without being landed. If discard and pre-catch mortality were eliminated, allowed catches could increase by 10-20%. We demonstrate that unaccounted mortality in pelagic fisheries may be substantial, affecting stock estimates and catch advice. This may undermine the sustainable management and efficient use of pelagic resources.

AB  - Climate change (CC) is one of the most urgent threats to modern societies, having direct and indirect consequences on the rapid growth of urban areas. Cities are attempting to both reduce their impact on the environment and build resilience to be able to face the irreversible effects of CC through plans and strategies. However, barriers, such as the fact that cities are complex systems and the uncertainty posed by CC have led to less engaged and committed city stakeholders, which have hampered the operationalisation of city resilience. In this context, developing city stakeholders awareness has been demonstrated to be an effective way to put an end to passive behaviour and help transform cities so they are more climate-resilient. Thus, we posit that developing city stakeholder awareness leads to more effective implementation of CC resilience-building plans. To that end, this paper presents a framework that defines the awareness-development process and combines it with an educational simulation tool that facilitates understanding of the theory presented in the framework. Finally, the paper presents a pilot test in the city of Kristiansand, Norway, to show the contribution of the simulation tool in improving city stakeholder awareness.

AB  - Over the last decades, a dense population of the deep-sea/oceanic scyphozoan jellyfish Periphylla periphylla has established itself as top predator in the Trondheimsfjord in Norway, which has caused the traditional fisheries in this fjord to suffer. This was, however, not the first fjord this jellyfish invaded, and data suggest that it will not be the last one, either. With warmer temperatures, the jellyfish is moving northward in Norway, but not all fjords are created equal, and it is not thriving or taking up residence just anywhere. The current article explores three fjords in which Periphylla periphylla has become the top predator and outcompeted former ones. The main question of interest is why the jellyfish becomes dominant in one fjord and not another. The next question is which other Norwegian fjords further north exist with similar characteristics where we therefore would expect Periphylla periphylla to proliferate in the future. The latter is important from a policy and adaptation perspective for the local community of people, since the proliferation of the species unmistakably leads to fewer fish for commercial harvest and potentially less attractive waters for tourism purposes. Results show that three northern fjords, the Skjerstadfjorden the Holandsfjorden, and Stordjupna in the Vestfjord appear to be particularly vulnerable to a future Periphylla periphylla invasion.

AB  - The 1.5 degrees C target for global warming calls for evaluating short-term (30-50 years) climate change mitigation with different forests usage. In the current scientific literature and in the public debate, there are contrasting views on how forests should be managed to maximize total climate benefit, including the use of products and changes in carbon pools. Three major factors influence the conclusions in different studies: (a) time horizon, (b) site productivity, (c) substitution calculations. Here we show the dependency among these factors by an analysis of four harvest scenarios: 95%, 60%, 40% and 0% of growth, which are compared to a business as usual scenario (80%). The analyses are made for five counties in Sweden, which covers a wide range in forest productivities, from 2.5 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) (north) to 11.5 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) (south). The results show: (a) Reduced harvest levels provide increased climate benefits on short time scales (at least 50 years). (b) Increased harvesting from current level is counterproductive on both short and long term. (c) The potential effect on the carbon balance of a no-harvest scenario in the five counties, is larger (1.1-16 times) than the expected emissions from all other anthropogenic activities until 2045. (d) Short-term climate benefits of reduced harvesting are largest in highly productive forests. Smaller but more long-lasting benefits can be obtained by aiming at harvest reductions in less productive forests. (e) Strategies focused on short-term benefits need to be adapted to the future development of substitution factors and forest growth. If substitution effects become higher, increased harvest levels will be beneficial after 2050 in high productive forests. However, if future substitution effects decrease, which is a plausible and desired development, low harvest strategies are preferred in both short- and long-term time perspectives. We conclude that even moderate reductions of harvest levels would provide substantial climate benefits.

AB  - Climate change has been shown to cause poleward range shifts of species. These shifts are typically demonstrated using presence-absence data, which can mask the potential changes in the abundance of species. Moreover, changes in the mean centre of weighted density of species are seldom examined, and comparisons between these two methods are even rarer. Here, we studied the change in the mean weighted latitude of density (MWLD) of 94 bird species in Finland, northern Europe, using data covering a north-south gradient of over 1000km from the 1970s to the 2010s. The MWLD shifted northward on average 1.26kmyr(-1), and this shift was significantly stronger in northern species compared to southern species. These shifts can be related to climate warming during the study period, because the annual temperature had increased more in northern Finland (by 1.7 degrees C) than in southern Finland (by 1.4 degrees C), although direct causal links cannot be shown. Density shifts of species distributed over the whole country did not differ from shifts in species situated on the edge of the species range in southern and northern species. This means that density shifts occur both in the core and on the edge of species distribution. The species-specific comparison of MWLD values with corresponding changes in the mean weighted latitude using presence-absence atlas data (MWL) revealed that the MWLD moved more slowly than the MWL in the atlas data in the southern species examined, but more rapidly in the northern species. Our findings highlight that population densities are also moving rapidly towards the poles and the use of presence-absence data can mask the shift of population densities. We encourage use of abundance data in studies considering the effects of climate change on biodiversity.

AB  - The concept of Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) has the potential to help break away from the current automobility system of private car ownership towards a more sustainable 'post-car' system. While technology undoubtedly plays an important role in the development of MaaS schemes, coordinating the various stakeholders, from different levels of decision-making, seems to be an equally, if not even greater challenge. Building on a case study that focused on the development of the very first MaaS commercial solution in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area, this paper uses the multi-level governance (MLG) analytical framework to discuss which governance mechanisms are most likely to support the full realization of the MaaS potential. Findings indicate that while Type II governance processes (horizontal development of a MaaS network, unfolding of several MaaS initiatives in parallel, informal lobbying from local government) undoubtedly played a role in the emergence of the solution, it is mainly thanks to Type I mechanisms (strong visions from public authorities, development of a dedicated legislation) that MaaS could finally move forward in the Finnish capital region, and exit the institutional dead-end in which it was trapped. By shedding light on the governance of Mobility-as-a-Service, this paper contributes to the growing MaaS literature that has paid so far little attention to the nuts and bolts of MaaS development, and contributes in further using the MLG in transport studies. The paper ultimately concludes by highlighting the need to conduct more research on the governance of MaaS in order to ultimately develop a more holistic understanding of the role that public authorities are playing in its development.

AB  - The link of mercury (Hg) pollution to Hg mining is rarely made, although Hg primary production presently is as large as global Hg emissions from coal combustion. Here we present historical comparisons on global, continental and national scales, covering up to five centuries of Hg production and consumption. Nearly half of the historical consumption has been pre-industrial, notably for silver and gold mining by amalgamation. More than half has been mined in Europe and one quarter in the Americas. Four economic periods with different control of global Hg price and production were discerned. The Hg price rose sharply after 1830 when Spain no longer controlled the Hg market and when consumption started to shift to gold mining in North America and later on industrial uses. In the 1970's, however, the price as well as quantities consumed plunged as a result of rising health and environmental concerns. In Sweden, per-capita consumption has recently dropped below pre-industrial levels, exemplifying a successful implementation of environmental policy. The chlor-alkali industry is still the globally dominating Hg consumer, and large stocks to be decommissioned in industrialized countries need political guidance to avoid transfer of Hg and related risks to other countries, a potential transfer to small-scale miners favoured by low Hg prices.

AB  - In five out of twelve Swedish agricultural rivers examined during the period 1993-2004, significant trends for decreasing concentrations of reactive inorganic nitrogen (RIN) were indicated after flow normalisation. These decreases were constant (equal to 2-4% per year), most apparent in the Scania region, and weakly correlated to reductions in livestock density (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.825). The number of grazing cattle livestock units per unit area of arable land decreased on average by 14% and that of non-grazing cattle by 17% during 1985-2003. Based on estimates of root-zone leaching, increased area of set-aside and recent EU subsidisation of catch crops (with/without spring tillage) were suggested to be additional substantial causes but these changes were only rapid very recently (years 2000-2001).
   A significant and constant decrease in reactive phosphorus (RP) (3% per year) was observed in one river, mainly during the season of low flow, with reduced load from point sources suggested to be the main reason. Significant and constant reductions equal to 3-8% per year in concentrations of non-reactive phosphorus (NRP) were calculated for five rivers. These improvements were weakly correlated to the length of grassed buffer zones along the watercourses in arable parts of the river basin (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.845). Establishment of such zones also took place more recently, and together with constructed wetlands represent on average 0.5% of the agricultural area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract
   The diversification of farming towards more service-intensive businesses enables innovation and competitiveness within the farming sector. However, running a hospitality and tourism business significantly differs from farming and requires different competencies. It entails face-to-face customer relationships and creating experiences based on the identity of the place and the entrepreneurs. By inviting in guests/customers, the farm is transformed from primarily an agricultural production place to one that produces experiences and services. This paper aims to analyse and discuss how women engaged in farm tourism perform rural and gender identities by producing experiences and services, and how these performances may reproduce or challenge traditional rural and gender identities. The study is based on interviews with women in the two regions Dalarna and Uppland who run tourism businesses on working farms. The interviews show that the entrepreneurs must cope with tensions and conflicts between agricultural production and tourism at the farms in terms of not only practical work and duties, but also how gendered farming identities are performed.

AB  - Although metapopulation theory is widely used in basic and applied ecology, there are still few empirical studies that explore the relationships between dispersal, patch size, and the persistence of natural populations. Here, we reanalyzed data from a six-year study of a spatially structured field vole (Microtus agrestis) metapopulation in the Tvarminne archipelago, Finland. Our goal was to address several issues relevant to metapopulation studies: (1) the relationships between within-subpopulation dynamics, dispersal behavior, habitat quality, and metapopulation dynamics; (2) the generality of one of the most common conclusions of metapopulation theory-that smaller and less frequently inhabited islands are less important for metapopulation dynamics; and (3) the comparison of different methods for understanding and predicting dynamics in "metapopulation-like" systems. Our results suggest that this vole metapopulation is driven by extinctions and colonizations of island subpopulations. However, contrary to expectation, colonizations by voles from tiny, ephemeral skerry subpopulations were about as important for metapopulation persistence as were colonizations from the more persistent subpopulations on large islands. This pattern resulted from less stable vole densities on smaller islands, combined with increased emigration preceding subpopulation extinctions. Either spatially implicit Levins models or incidence function models provided reasonable predictions of the structure and function of this metapopulation, but parameters fitted to incidence functions varied dramatically among years. Our results suggest that models of real metapopulations need not become highly detail oriented or spatially complicated to provide good predictive power. However, applications of metapopulation theory require careful consideration of how underlying ecological and behavioral mechanisms will shape metapopulation dynamics of particular species and situations.

AB  - There is academic, political and industry consensus that tourism should achieve greater sustainability, a process requiring stakeholder involvement on various levels. It is less clear how significant actor numbers can be mobilized to pro-actively work towards sustainability goals, achieving significant systemic change. This paper explores the transition management literature to provide a theoretical framework for stakeholder involvement and policy implementation processes in sustainable tourism. A selection of sustainable tourism initiatives by global tourism and transport organizations are reviewed and discussed with regard to the mechanisms and approaches used to involve stakeholders, and their success or otherwise in achieving change. This is compared to the results of a national tourism sustainability initiative by the Norwegian government initiated in 2010. The initiative brought together 62 leading stakeholders from all tourism interests, except airlines, for a series of six intensive discussion and goal setting sessions. Evaluation shows that stakeholder awareness and knowledge appear to have improved substantially, and potential government policy initiatives legitimized - though few tangible results can yet be seen. Overall results suggest that transition management provides a valuable theoretical framework to understand change processes, while the dialetics of stakeholder involvement and policy implementation are an essential precondition for successful governance.

AB  - The conversion of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst.) stands into more site adapted mixed stands is the main silvicultural goal in Germany and many other European countries. The conversion will primarily be achieved with the help of selection cutting, removing single target diameter trees and creating small gaps. At sites highly susceptible to windthrow, however, small scale clear cutting (up to 1 ha) might be an appropriate alternative. Both selection and clear cutting will affect the understorey vegetation, an important component of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Thus, with the help of a BACI-experiment (before-after/control-impact), the short-term effects of selection and small scale clear cutting on the herb and shrub layer vegetation were studied at two sites in the Solling Hills (Lower Saxony, Germany). Both treatments led to an increase in herb and shrub layer species numbers, due to persistent and invading (mainly pioneer tree species and indicators of disturbance) species and to a shift in plant traits. Most responsible for the changes in vegetation was a higher light availability, and to a lesser degree soil disturbance. The number of annuals and ruderals, however, increased only immediately after clear cutting, whereas on selection cutting plots the numbers remained high. Gaining in number and coverage were competitive perennials (Epilobium angustifolium, Juncus effusus, Rubus idaeus) especially on the clear cuttings, fulfilling a nutrient retention function. The competitives did not deter tree species from regenerating in the clear cut plots, whereas on selection cutting plots the large expansion of R. idaeus appeared to be hindering tree colonisation. Suffering under clear cut conditions were predominantly shade-tolerant, closed-forest species, but no loss of these species could be detected. This indicates the potential for a fast recovery of these forest species, as soon as, pioneer trees expand.
   Although the vegetation changed in similar directions at both study sites, differences in species numbers and composition were found, indicating the importance of site conditions in the beginning of succession.
   In conclusion, our study shows no overall negative effects on shrub and herb layer biodiversity and trait composition after clear cutting. It is suggested that small scale clear cutting may be considered an appropriate alternative to silvicultural methods which cause a moderate rate of disturbance, to reach the goal of Norway spruce forest conversion.

AB  - Potential reasons for the drastic intensification and step-like nature of coastal erosion in the Neva Bay area (to the east of the cape Peschany-Lebyazhye line), the easternmost part of the Gulf of Finland, are analysed based on field observations and hydrometeorogical data from adjacent areas. Beaches in this area consist of easily erodible Quaternary deposits that evolve under overall sediment deficit and are relatively vulnerable with respect to changes in the external forcing factors. It is demonstrated that the most extreme erosion events occur when high waves excited by long-lasting western or south-western storms attack the coast during very high storm surges in the absence of stable sea ice. Since 2004 the frequency of occurrence of such combinations has increased mostly owing to, late freezing of the bay and an increase in the number and severity of extreme erosion events in the future is likely. The coasts are also under gradually increasing anthropogenic pressure. Submarine mining operations in the nearshore and construction of large-scale coastal engineering structures such as the Flood Protection Facility may have considerable impact upon the coasts.

AB  - Questions: How do species composition and abundance of soil seed bank and standing vegetation vary over the course of a post-fire succession in northern heathlands? What is the role of seed banks-do they act as a refuge for early successional species or call they simply be seen as a spillover from the extant local vegetation?
   Location: Coastal Calluna heathlands, Western Norway.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation and seed bank along a 24-year post-fire chronosequence. Patterns ill community composition, similarity and abundances were tested using multivariate analyses, Sorensen's index of similarity, vegetation cover and seedling counts.
   Results: The total diversity of vegetation and seed bank were 60 and 54 vascular plant taxa, respectively, with 39 shared species, resulting in 68% similarity overall. Over 24 years, the heathland community progressed from open newly burned ground via species rich graminoid- and herb-dominated vegetation to mature Calluna heath. Post-fire Succession was not reflected in the seed bank. The 10 most abundant species constituted 98% of the germinated seeds. The most abundant were Calluna vulgaris (49%; 12018 seeds m(-2)) and Erica tetralix (34%; 8414 seeds m(-2)). Calluna showed significantly higher germination the first 2 years following fire.
   Conclusions: Vegetation species richness, ranging from 23 to 46 species yr(-1), showed a unimodal pattern over the post-fire succession. In contrast, the seed bank species richness, ranging from 21 to 31 species yr(-1) showed no trend. This suggests that the seed bank act as a refuge; providing a constant source of recruits for species that colonise newly burned areas. The traditional management regime has not depleted or destroyed the seed banks and continued management is needed to ensure sustainability of northern heathlands.

AB  - A proper recognition of the pollutant sources in atmospheric deposit is a key problem for any action aiming at reducing their emission, being this an important issue with implications both on human health safeguard and on the cultural heritage conservation in urban sites. This work presents the results of a statistical approach application for the identification of pollutant sources in deposits and damage layers on monuments located in different European sites: Santa Maria del Fiore, Florence (Italy), Cologne Cathedral, Cologne (Germany), Ancient ramparts, Sale (Morocco), National Museum, Cracow (Poland) and National Gallery, Oslo (Norway). For this aim, the surface damage layers on monuments and historical buildings of the selected sites were collected and analyzed, in terms of ionic and elemental composition, through application of ion chromatography and induced coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. The achieved results were processed by multivariate analyses such as correlation matrix and principal component analysis in order to identify the possible origin of pollutants affecting the state of conservation of the monuments. This allowed us to assume that in all case studies the traffic emission is the main pollutant source. In the case of Ancient ramparts, Sale (Morocco), and National Gallery, Oslo (Norway), the surfaces are also under influence of marine aerosols. Moreover, concerning the Cologne Cathedral, the strong impact of the pollutants emitted by railway station was also revealed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are hundreds of scientific papers dealing with the issues of biodiversity and extinction debt in temperate forests, both of which are partly related to the absence of deadwood. Some studies have derived habitat thresholds for deadwood (according to species, size, spatial distribution) as baselines for management recommendations. But a majority of studies have one important knowledge gap how long does it take for deadwood to decompose? To derive the residence time of deadwood, we used a 40-year time series of 4 censuses in European lowland hardwood temperate forests. The deadwood residence of 2252 logs of 5 main tree species was calculated using Bayesian Survival Trajectory Analysis. Pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) had the longest residence time, with the largest logs decomposing for an average of 62 years. Next was narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia) with a residence time of about 42 years. Field maple (Acer campestre) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) had a similar residence time - with the largest logs averaging 37-39 years. Elm (Ulmus sp.) had the fastest decomposition of large-sized logs - estimated at 24 years. Generally, small-sized logs of all investigated species decomposed quickly. Conversely, large-sized logs of hornbeam and ash decomposed as quickly as their intermediate-sized logs. Large-sized logs of elm decayed even faster than intermediate-sized logs. An analysis of the position of field maple logs during decomposition showed that those decomposing in the air or in water decomposed slower than logs "on the ground", with a half-life of 40 years (compared to 28 years on the ground) and a residence time of 54 years (44 years on the ground). Our results suggest that the management of deadwood should focus on (i) leaving the largest logs, which took the longest time to reach advanced decay stages, and (ii) a diversified approach regarding the individual residence time of different tree species.

AB  - Growing of economics and new technologies has caused the environment pollution and more intensive use of natural resources. The principles of stable and balanced forestry became more and more important. Ecologization forests economy directly and indirectly impacts environment, water, air, landscape. It is not allowed to use chemicals in ecological farms. In Lithuania the number of ecological farms is growing that is why the new effective ecological methods are needed to protect seedlings from weeds. Alternative to mechanical control of weed is to use high temperature. In ecological farms weed control after sowing time is pursued in mechanic, and recently in thermal way. In thermal weed control the surface of soil remains mechanically undisturbed, the roots of cultural plants remain undisturbed, too. These features are very important in forest nurseries, where different kinds of tree species are growing. Seedlings are very small at the beginning of growing, so mechanical weed control is difficult. Thermal weed control could be a good alternative. Comparable data of 2009-2011 thermal weed control research in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) nursery is given. The efficiency of destroyed 16 weed sorts using thermal and mechanical ways of weed control is given. Thermal weed control for short age weeds is 20.3% more effective in comparison with mechanical way. Mechanical way is 35.2% more effective for perennial weeds. It was detected that in order to control weeds of different growth stages, it is necessary to use different treatment time of damp water stream.

AB  - A 336-year floating varve chronology from Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Western Germany) covering the recent period has been established by microfacies analysis of thin sections. This sequence terminates 23 cm below the core top. In the top 23 cm, the varves are disturbed. By means of linear regression, the varve sequence was dated to the period AD 1607 - 1942. The influences of climatic variability and anthropogenic activities in the lake's catchment (e. g., forestry, agriculture) on lithology, fabric, and microfossil content of the varve sublaminae could be discriminated by applying statistical analyses (ordination and clustering) to the combination of the sublaminae in the varves and their thickness. Four clusters are obtained. Cluster 1 indicates cold springs, and shorter, cooler summers reflected primarily in below-average varve thickness (VT) for two stable phases: from AD 1650 - 1700 (during the Maunder Minimum) and from AD 1750 - 1785. Cluster 2 indicates years with conditions transitional to that indicated by cluster 1, characterized by vigorous and prolonged spring circulation with massive blooms of the nordic-alpine Aulacoseira subarctica. The samples assigned to Cluster 3 and Cluster 4 show the imprint of anthropogenic influences. Cluster 3 (AD 1795 - 1815 and AD 1825 - 1885) is characterized by above-average VT due to high detritus input throughout the year. The increased soil erosion can be linked to anthropogenic deforestation as a consequence of the production increase of the Eifelian iron industry at the end of the 18th century. This input dampens the climatic signal of a colder Dalton Minimum, which is reflected in a short drop in VT centered around AD 1810. At about AD 1885, Cluster 4 conditions, characterized by increased nutrient concentrations, low detritus input, and longer periods of stable summer strati. cation, become the stable state in Lake Holzmaar. They indicate the response of the lake to natural reforestation and the use of artificial fertilizers in the catchment, which began, according to historical records, in the 1850s in the Eifel region. The prolonged, stable summer strati. cation periods may be the first indication of the modern warming trend. A drop in VT centered around AD 1890 and recurring cluster-1 conditions may indicate the Damon Minimum.

AB  - We seek to examine the manner in which either the EU member states of France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Sweden or parts of them, such as the country of England in the UK or the Flemish Region in Belgium, deal with the distributional effects of the flood risk management strategies prevention, defense, and mitigation. Measures carried out in each of these strategies can cause preflood harm, as in the devaluation of property or loss of income. However, different member states and authorities address this harm in different ways. A descriptive overview of the different compensation regimes in the field of flood risk management is followed by an analysis of these differences and an explanation of what may cause them, such as the geographical differences that lead to differences in the way that they interfere with private rights and the dominant legal principles that underlie compensation regimes. An elaborated compensation regime could lead to more equitable and legitimate flood risk management because the burdens are fairly spread and all interests-including those of injured parties-are considered in the decision-making process. Our aim is to stimulate the hardly existent discussion on the financial harm that is caused by measures to prevent floods (preflood), in addition to the already existing discussion on the ex post flood distributional effects.

AB  - Repeated climatic and vegetation changes during the Pleistocene have shaped biodiversity in Northern Europe including Denmark. The Northern Birch Mouse (Sicista betulina) was one of the first small rodent species to colonize Denmark after the Late Glacial Maximum. This study analyses complete mitochondrial genomes and two nuclear genes of the Northern Birch Mouse to investigate the phylogeographical pattern in North-western Europe and test whether the species colonized Denmark through several colonization events. The latter was prompt by (i) the present-day distinct northern and southern Danish distribution and (ii) the subfossil record of Northern Birch Mouse, supporting early Weichselian colonization. Samples from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Slovakia were included. Mitogenomes were obtained from 54 individuals, all representing unique mitogenomes supporting high genetic variation. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis identified two distinct evolutionary linages in Northern Europe diverging within the Elster glaciation period. The results of the two nuclear genomes showed lower genetic differentiation but supported the same evolutionary history. This suggests an allopatric origin of the clades followed by secondary contact. Individuals from southern Denmark were only found in one clade, while individuals from other areas, including northern Denmark, were represented in both clades. Nevertheless, we found no evidence for repeated colonization's explaining the observed fragmented distribution of the species today. The results indicated that the mitogenome pattern of the Northern Birch Mouse population in southern Denmark was either (i) due to the population being founded from northern Denmark, (ii) a result of climatic and anthropogenic effects reducing population size increasing genetic drift or (iii) caused by sampling bias.

AB  - Globally, we face grand challenges such as poverty and climate change. In response to such challenges, previous research claims that strategy research should address the "major challenges of contemporary society" this article examines a strategy adopted in Gothenburg, Sweden in an attempt to create an inclusive city through various actions in vulnerable areas. Using the concepts of strategizing and strategifying, the study shows how an attempt to address this challenge put pressure not only on the organization adopting the strategic document, but also on collaborating organizations. This illustrates how a strategic approach to a common challenge can create new organizational solutions and strengthen collaborating networks, although this might also lead to tension between organizations.

AB  - Environmental management, similar to public management generally, is increasingly challenged by an ever more complex society. Generally, in scientific literature, participatory features are presented as solutions for adapting centrally steered management to local circumstances and for mitigating conflicts. This article argues that local realities and transformations are easily neglected in environmental management due to unsuccessful implementation of its own participatory ideals. By studying the management of cormorant-human conflicts in Finland, the article identifies critical features that can be implemented to overcome the gap between participatory ideals and the reality of environmental management. By interviewing locals and civil servants and by directing questionnaires to fishers, the article presents how management and science look for dependencies between cormorants, fish stocks, and water nutrition, although fishers and locals are primarily concerned with the combination of seal- and cormorant-induced damages, the changed behaviour of fish, and reduced recreational possibilities. Narrow scientific approaches and the national interpretation of the EU Birds directive thereby impede the management system from perceiving the complete local impact of a growing cormorant population. This article identifies obstacles hindering a balanced environmental management policy and concludes that there is a need to reinforce (a) social scientific approaches; (b) vertical negotiations at the local, national, and supranational level; and (c) the training of civil servants as facilitators of communication.

AB  - The MAGIC model of the responses of catchments to acidic deposition has been applied and tested extensively over a 15 year period at many sites and in many regions around the world. Overall, the model has proven to be robust, reliable and useful in a variety of scientific and managerial activities. Over the years, several refinements and additions to MAGIC have been proposed and/or implemented for particular applications. These adjustments to the model structure have all been included in a new version of the model (MAGIC7). The log aluminium - pH relationship now does not have to be fixed to aluminium trihydroxide solubility. Buffering by organic acids using a triprotic analog is now included. Dynamics of nitrogen retention and loss in catchments can now be linked to soil nitrogen and carbon pools. Simulation of short-term episodic response by mixing fractions of different water types is also possible. This paper presents a review of the conceptual structure of MAGIC7 relating to long-term simulation of acidification and recovery, describes the conceptual basis of the new nitrogen dynamics and provides a comprehensive update of the equations, variables, parameters and inputs for the model.

AB  - Learning is commonly presented as one of the key premises of transitions governance. Empirical literature on learning in a sustainability transition context often remains on a generic level, without an in-depth analysis of what is learned and by whom. In this article, we address the study of learning in transition-related multi-party processes. We analyze a transition arena specifically designed to support the participants' learning and the possibilities to study it. Its focus was on urban citizen energy, increasing renewable energy production via solar panels, heat pumps, and other on-site solutions in detached apartment buildings. We investigate the process through the learning levels (learning loops) framework within which we were able to examine if and what kind of learning can be inferred to have happened and show what kind of data and analysis such inferences minimally require. Our results demonstrate that all participants reported learning from the arena process. This learning was predominantly first-order learning within participants' already pro-transition orientation. Half of the participants also reported some second-order learning, changing one's interpretative framing about citizen energy. Overall, the multi-party envisioning process supported participants' ongoing transformation efforts more than it resulted in transformative learning. Our results provide a basis for further development of a learning-sensitive approach enabling identification and consideration of methodological challenges involved in inferring learning in transitions research.

AB  - The proliferation of sea lice from aquaculture may substantially aggravate the decline in marine survival of wild salmons. In some countries, this risk has motivated regulators to adopt more precautionary policies; in other countries, however, regulators have disputed the need for stricter regulation. This article compares the sea-lice regulations of Norway, Scotland, Ireland, and Canada (British Columbia), showing how varying interpretations of the science on farm-wild interactions have shaped efforts to scale up regulatory measures for mitigating health hazards and mortality risks for wild salmon. In Norway and Scotland, scientific consensus has expedited cooperation between research and governing institutions and facilitated ambitious policy reforms. In Ireland and Canada, by contrast, scientific controversy around the scale of farm-lice impacts on wild salmon populations has led to conflict and disagreement between researchers and policymakers, and to failure of reform attempts desired by wild salmon stakeholders.

AB  - This paper deals with some aspects of the effects of human activities on soil-lipid composition. There are several ways to characterize or classify changes in soils due to the impact of human activities. Until recently, the organic part of the soil has been analysed as a total organic content only. The main purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the possibilities of further analysis, using experience from fields such as organic geochemistry and chromatography. Included are decomposition of organic matter in soil, turnover time in natural strata, effects of human activities such as agriculture, dwelling and food handling, and some examples from Vendel par., Uppland, Sweden.

AB  - This paper addresses the need to transform tourism practices with others. Its contribution is a critical conceptualization of how collaborative tourism design can facilitate sustainable transformation. Recognizing SDG #17 to "Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development" we argue that collaboration - not only partnerships and cooperation - should be a central tenet for intentional change. Collaboration rests on the hypothesis that the sum is more than its individual parts. We introduce how the collaborative design (co-design) of tourism contributes a unique range of processes, methods, tools and notably an attitude of mind that enables its practitioners to, with others, explore, reveal, encompass and address issues and nuances in an overall sustainable tourism co-design process. This understanding deliberately challenges the notion that a sustainable development process can be planned and micro-managed with pre-determined outcomes. Examples from Denmark and Norway illustrate how sustainable tourism co-design intentionally aims to transform human relations, encourage stewardship and demonstrate how such a practice does not reach for quick-fix solutions. Findings indicate that we have yet to realize the power of collaboration, stewardship and "other-regarding" ethics to guide actions underpinning SDG#17 for more sustainable and resourceful futures.

AB  - Poplar (Populus spp.) species are currently not widely grown in Sweden but offer interesting options for future large-scale biomass production for bioenergy. This study assesses the average annual net energy yield and the ratio between the gross energy yield and the total primary energy input for well-managed current commercial poplar production systems in Sweden, with and without fertilization with mineral nitrogen (N). The two systems perform similarly, mainly because the yield response to fertilization is estimated to be small. The average annual net energy yields with and without fertilization are estimated at 190 and 179 GJ ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The corresponding energy ratios are 32 and 34, i.e., the total primary energy inputs correspond to only ca. 3% of the gross energy yield, in both cases. Therefore, improving the net energy yield by increasing the harvest level may be considered the most important objective from an energy performance point of view. To do this, more research is needed in order to develop poplar clones that are better adapted to the Swedish climate and identify in which situations poplar responds well to fertilization. At the same time, by reducing the energy inputs associated with the most fuel-intensive activities (wood-chip transportation, chipping, harvesting, forwarding, and stump lifting), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The results should be interpreted with caution since several parameters, especially the yield response to fertilization and fuel consumption rates, are associated with considerable uncertainties.

AB  - The flora of clear-cuttings with soil scarification in forests was compared < 1-2 yr after cutting with that in mature herb-rich forests in SW Finland. The total and mean numbers of vascular plant species both in the study areas and in the sample plots, were almost double in clear-cut areas compared to mature forests. Clear-cuttings and mature forests were distinctly separated by multivariate analyses (DCA). Several dozen species not found in forests were common in clear-cut areas. Most of them probably belong to the neglected native species pool of early boreal forest succession and are dependent on the long-term persistent seed bank or effective wind dispersal. It is emphasized that in forests many plant species are confined to the very early stages (< 2 yr) after disturbance. The storage effect of the long-term persistent seed bank is crucial for the maintenance of plant diversity in boreal forests. Probably a considerable part of the flora of agricultural areas is composed of species that were originally disturbance dependent forest plants. Scarification is beneficial to disturbance dependent plants and may be useful in restoration of populations of species of early succession.

AB  - This paper draws on data collected through multiple approaches and presents an exploration of the early stages of a large sustainability-oriented rural tourism development project. Through a streamlined qualitative analysis, the study revealed four tactical moves deployed in the early stages of the project. The moves include instilling project legitimacy, forging a support network, anchoring the project, and mobilising resources and capabilities. Further analysis revealed that these moves tend to reinforce each other, and thus they require concurrent implementation. Subsequently, the study develops a framework delineating drivers, enablers, challenges, and key success factors for navigating the early stages of a large sustainability-oriented rural tourism development project. Intriguingly, the study contradicts the path dependence perspective, which is often used in project management research. Instead, it suggests that the early stages of such projects require tactical path creation involving well-calculated actions that serve as a breeding ground for valuable random incidents.

AB  - While most commercial fisheries in the North Atlantic are strictly regulated through total allowable quotas, licenses and vessel quotas to limit the catch rates, the fishing for blue whiting represents an exception. Today, the blue whiting fishery is out of control; catch rates far exceed what the management authorities propose for a sustainable fishery and there is a real danger for collapse of the stock. The driving force in this development refers to the fact that the coastal states that are involved in the blue whiting fisheries, are not able to agree on the distribution of the migrating blue whiting stock. In Norway, the strong increase in both catch capacity and catch rates, also refers to a liberalization of the institutional framework for the renewal and design of new vessels, but also to structural politics concerning the ocean-going fishing vessels. This article presents the management conflict within the international fisheries for blue whiting and the driving forces behind the capacity increase in the Norwegian blue whiting fleet. However, a future agreement among the coastal nations within the framework of a sustainable fishery, inefficient overcapacity emerges when total quotas and allocation are put on the agenda. This results in allocation conflicts at different management levels that prevent a future solution. The question now is whether regional management organizations like the NEAFC (North East Atlantic Fisheries Committee) should have a more prominent position in the management of resources that migrate through the different coastal states' economic zones.

AB  - This paper introduces three machine learning (ML) algorithms, the 'ensemble' Random Forest (RF), the 'ensemble' Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) and the MultiLayer Perceptron neural network (MLP) and applies them to the spatial modelling of shallow landslides near Kvam in Norway. In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency.

AB  - Diffuse losses of phosphorus (P) from arable land are often related to soil P and P amendments. We follow the in situ dynamics of plant-available [ammonium lactate/acetic acid (P-AL)] and easily soluble (0.01m CaCl2) P during 1year after fertilizer application at five sites in long-term fertility field experiments in Sweden with three different soil P levels and amendment rates and two different crop rotation systems. Clear differences between soils and P treatments were found. These can to a large extent be explained by the amount of applied of P and soil sorption capacity. The bell curve' indicating the development of plant-available P can be described successfully using Gaussian modelling. Strong correlation between plant-available and easily soluble P as determined by the above-mentioned methods shows that the existing agronomic soil test P can be a good indicator even for easily soluble P, especially if other soil properties such as soil sorption capacity are taken into account. From the management standpoint, small increases in both plant-available and easily soluble P as in the P replacement treatment indicate that such a management strategy may reduce environmental risks as a result of P amendments. Increases in P amendments above the agronomic optimum increased plant-available P for a considerable time after P amendment (24months) to indicate high environmental risk.

AB  - Stumps constitute a large wood resource in managed forests, but have generally been little studied in terms of insect biodiversity. Basic knowledge of the stump fauna is necessary to e.g. assess the value of other dead wood, such as high stumps created for conservation purposes. This study focuses on early arriving bark- and wood-boring beetles and associated insect enemies (predatory Coleoptera, Heteroptera, and parasitic Hymenoptera) in fresh stumps of Norway spruce Picea abies. Ordinary low stumps were compared with mechanically created 4 m high stumps. Wood samples for insect rearing were cut from low (n = 28) and high stumps (n = 21) on five one-summer-old clearcuts in Sweden. High stumps were sampled at the base and at 1.5 m above ground. All emerging insects were determined to species or genus level. Proportion of stumps inhabited, density and Shannon's index for diversity and evenness were calculated. At least 17 phloem/fungivorus (predominately Scolytidae and Cerambycidae) and 8 predatory beetle taxa (mostly Cleridae and Nitidulidae) were recorded, as well as 9 parasitoid taxa (Pteromalidae, Eurytomidae and Braconidae) associated with bark beetle hosts. Most taxa occurred in both low and high stumps. High stumps were slightly better for parasitoids in terms of occupancy, density and index values. Phloem/fungivorus and predatory beetles occurred in nearly all low and high stumps (93-95%), whereas parasitoids were more often recorded at 1.5 m in high stumps (95%) than in the base (48%) or in low stumps (54%). Three parasitoid species occurred in significantly higher densities in high stumps than in low stumps (Rhopalicus quadratus, Rhopalicus tutela and Dendrosoter niiddendorffi). The results show that above-ground parts of fresh spruce stumps to a high degree may serve as habitat for secondary and mostly harmless bark beetles. They also barbour generalist predators and parasitoids, including important enemies of forest pests such as the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. The results support previous studies showing positive effects of high stumps on insect biodiversity, and suggest that also hi-her trophic levels such as parasitic Hymenoptera are favoured.

KW  - LIFE
AB  - This article argues for conceptualising the land-water nexus not primarily in spatial terms, but above all as a set of spatiotemporal rhythms of increasing and decreasing wetness and fluidity. By investigating human engagement with water and land as rhythms, the corresponding and conflicting dynamics of particular places becoming - for longer or shorter periods - land, water or a mixture of both can be traced as an evolving web of relationships between human imaginations and practices, and the materialities of water, mud, sediment, dams, floodgates, etc. The article illustrates this approach with two brief ethnographic examples from northern Europe: In the depopulated Estonian Soomaa wetlands, some of the few remaining inhabitants are in the process of redefining unruly fluctuating water as a tourism destination. In doing so, however, these tourism operators are finding themselves and their "products " caught up in volatile and complicated spatiotemporal dynamics, including the difficulty to predict flooding and to coordinate high water with their potential customers' spare time, which is bound to working/school weeks and public holidays. On the Kemi River in Finnish Lapland, water flows are not only conditioned by precipitation and seasons, but also - through an intricate hydropower infrastructure - by the electricity market, triggering continued disputes about appropriate spatiotemporal rhythms in the land-water nexus. Seasonality and hydroelectricity generation point to the inherent rhythmicity of the land-water nexus, which is significant not only because it reflects the experience of people inhabiting and engaging with their in-between environments. A rhythms approach can also de-centre the (often illusive) quest for what the water-land nexus is, and instead focus on how this nexus continually comes into being and is negotiated by both its inhabitants and other people. This argument builds on anthropological thinking about temporality and materiality, and indicates how the two must be combined for better understanding how human life relates to the land-water nexus.

AB  - A manmade stormwater wetland in Kalmar, SE Sweden, sized 1 ha and receiving water from residential and road areas, was monitored over the first years after inundation with respect to chemistry and biology. Water flow and chemistry was analysed in years 2-4, mainly on a monthly basis, but, in the final year, every second month. This revealed that total nitrogen, according to the Swedish Environmental Quality Criteria (EQC), typically showed moderate or high concentrations, whereas total phosphorous levels were very high or extremely high. Metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) concentrations were low or moderate in terms of EQC. Yearly average reduction of nitrogen was 173 kg ha(-1) y(-1), tending to increase over time, and for phosphorous 12.1 kg ha(-1) y(-1), tending to decrease. Vegetation analysis was performed in years 1-4 by noting all species in 27 consecutive zones around the wetland system. This showed that one year after filling with water, the vegetation was already well established with >30 plant species in the entire pond system, and this increased only slightly. After four years, the shoreline vegetation cover had become denser, especially with larger graminoids such as common reed (Phragmites australis) and sea club-rush (Bolboschoenus maritimus), and submersed vegetation almost disappeared. There was a tendency for common species to become more dominant, and for less common species to become rarer. Using sweep net sampling of benthic invertebrates during years 0-2, ca 50 species/higher taxa were observed during the first year, largely because of the appearance of many beetles, especially dytiscids. However, these decreased the following years. Apart from these animals, in the first few months the invertebrate colonisation was dominated by chironomids and corixids, whereas later prominent increases were noticed for the isopod Asellus aquaticus, the snail Physa fontinalis, and the mayfly nymph Cloeon dipterum. The results are discussed in terms of wetland values for biodiversity and nutrient reduction, suggesting that these objectives seem possible to combine in stormwater wetlands. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Various strategies to reduce loss of nitrogen (N) from agricultural land have been implemented in the Nordic-Baltic countries during the last two decades to combat nutrient pollution of surface waters. The mitigation methods have led to a significant reduction in the consumption of N fertilizers in some of the Nordic-Baltic countries. The objective of this study was to investigate trends in N application and N balance and their effect on N concentrations in runoff from agricultural areas. Nitrogen balances consisted of N input in fertilizer, manure, deposition and fixation minus N output in yield. The study was based on monitoring in small agricultural streams in the Nordic-Baltic region over the last two decades with corresponding information on average N application (28 catchments) and N balance (27 catchments) for a varying periods. Long-term time series (14-22 years) on annual N application was available for 17 catchments and for 14 of these catchments, annual information on N balances were also available for the long-term time series. Nitrogen balances were available for 23 catchments for 2007-2011 and our results showed that on average for this period the N balance varied from -12 N ha(-1) yr(-1) in Volbu to 132 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) in Time, both located in Norway. For long-term time series, we found that the N application rates decreased significantly in six catchments, but increased in five catchments. Furthermore, the N balances decreased in four catchments but increased in two catchments. Hence the results describe the differences in agricultural development between countries, caused by e.g. changes in livestock production (Norway), strict regulations of fertilizer application (Denmark) and increased intensity in production (Latvia). The results showed that for 10 of the 14 catchments with long-term time series, there was no significant relationship between annual N balances and N concentrations. The effect of changes in N balances on N concentrations were significant for four of the 14 long-term time series which showed positive relationships (p = 0.0002, 0.0013, 0.0087, 0.0893) between annual N balances for the agricultural area in the catchments and N concentrations in the streams. The significant relationship between N balances and N concentrations were detected where long-term trends in N balances were identified and where a large change in N balances from a very high N surplus occurred.

AB  - The article describes the interaction of the economy and culture, in the frameworks of Indigenous economic development. It implies strong embeddedness of the economic activities of Indigenous peoples in their social and cultural life. The Indigenous economy is based on traditional nature management and it is closely linked to their knowledge of nature, folklore, language, social norms and expectations. At the same time, the active inclusion of Indigenous communities into market relations leads to significant social and economic transformations of their lives. This implies the question of how to preserve the unique Indigenous culture in the market context. The paper considers three different scenarios for the development of the Indigenous economy in the Arctic regions using the examples of Russia, Finland and the United States. In Russia, the state plays a significant role by providing paternalistic care to the Indigenous population and focusing on the preservation of traditional culture; Finland is dominated by a market scenario for the development of Indigenous traditional economies and governmental support for indigenous culture and welfare; and the United States represents an intermediate case in which market incentives and paternalism are combined. The article also examines how the chosen scenario affected the social and cultural aspects of the life of the Indigenous people. The latter are associated with a new attitude to nature, the development of new cultural patterns, and the emergence of new culturally colored types of economic activity. The study is based on qualitative methodology. The main research methods were semi-structured interviews, observations, and analysis of documents.

AB  - Climate change is a central sustainability concern, but is often treated separately from other policy areas in environmental governance. In this article we study how low-carbon energy transitions might be governed in line with broader sustainability goals. We identify conflicts and synergies between low-carbon strategies and the attainment of longer-term environmental objectives by examining the Swedish environmental quality objectives as a governance arrangement. Our analysis indicates that low-carbon strategies might be compatible with preserving other aspects of ecological sustainability. However, this requires relevant flanking policies and measures for non-climate objectives, e.g. systems that control the expansion of biomass and ensure the use of sustainable methods. For such a governance system to be credible and capable, it needs to be flexible in terms of adapting to specific and changing contexts, and reflexive enough to factor in new knowledge on requirements for sustainable development and potentially changing values of future generations.

AB  - Radionuclides from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant were released directly into he ocean as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. This material became entrained in surface ocean currents and subsequently transported for great. distances. In June 2011, a few months alter the disaster, we began a surface ocean I-129 monitoring program, with samples from Scripps Pier, La Jolla, California, USA, with the expectation that surface currents originating off the east coast of Japan would eventually carry radionuclides to the La Jolla site. After 7 years of ocean transport, a distinct signal has not yet arrived at Scripps Pier. We have however, recorded an interesting systematic seasonal I-129 time series record that stems from surface circulation variations along the California coast To provide a more comprehensive picture of the I-129 budget in coastal surface waters off the west coast of the U.S., we also include I-129 data from the Columbia River, and offshore sites along the coast of Washington State. Anthropogenic nuclides are carried by the Columbia River into the Pacific Ocean from the vicinity of the decommissioned Hanford nuclear facility. We find highly elevated I-129/I-127 values in the Columbia River, downstream from the Hanford site, but this anthropogenic I-129 becomes significantly diluted once it reaches the Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Considering the increasing impacts of climate change on nature-based winter tourism, this paper examines the challenges related to assessing the costs of adaptation and the emerging cost-related trends. The survey-based case study was conducted in Finnish Lapland and included 70 local entrepreneurs. The questions focused on the costs occurring during the increasingly important Christmas season. The methodological challenges were related to the diversity of the businesses and to potential difficulties in understanding the concept of adaptation. Five cost-related adaptation trends emerged from the study: large investments may decrease the flexibility to respond to changes quickly; small businesses seem to be most affected in terms of financial costs; strong seasonality may affect the ability to absorb the occurred costs; some of the costs could be decreased with effective mitigation; and finally, the occurring benefits can be equally important as costs.

AB  - Signal crayfish Pasifastacus leniusculus were first discovered in Norway in the Dammane area of Telemark County in October 2006. This introduced population was found to be infected with the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci, the causative agent of crayfish plague. The Dammane watershed consists of 5 small ponds, the largest with a surface area of approximately 2000 m(2). The Norwegian National Veterinary Institute conducted a feasibility study for the eradication of the Dammane signal crayfish population at the request of the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and Directorate for Nature Management. This study recommended the use of the pharmaceutical BETAMAX VET.(R), followed by pond drainage as a feasible course of action. BETAMAX VET.(R) is a cypermethrin-based pharmaceutical developed for treatment of salmon louse (Lepeophtherius salmonis) infestations of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Cypermethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid and a common agent in many insecticides licensed throughout Europe. Following a comprehensive mapping of the Dammane watershed, the ponds were treated with BETAMAX VET.(R) on the 14 and 28 May, 2008. Subsequently, the ponds were drained by pumping out the water in two separate stages on 2-4 June, 2008 and 22-24 December 2008. During the first treatment with BETAMAX VET.(R), signal crayfish were captured in the two upper ponds. During and following the second treatment and draining of the ponds, no signal crayfish were found. The ponds were gradually re-filled with water during the spring of 2009. It is too early to conclude whether the treatment has led to the complete eradication of the signal crayfish, but the results so far are promising. We believe that BETAMAX VET.(R) can be a useful tool in managing alien crayfish populations.

AB  - Source separation of urine for recycling has been applied in small-scale and decentralized wastewater systems in Sweden for the past 25 years and for blackwater for pollution control even longer. The Swedish experience with source separating nutrient recycling systems is relatively well documented; however, few reports have specifically studied the potential for expansion of this practice. The aim of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the status of source-separating technologies in Sweden based on transition theory. This study uses a multi-level perspective to determine how ready the Swedish wastewater sector is for transitioning to alternative systems. Given the stability of the existing sewage wastewater regime, it seems unlikely that changes within the regime will lead to a quick and large-scale transition to source separation. Instead, the initiative must come from the niche itself, exploiting institutional cracks in the regime and opportunities from shifting trends in the landscape. If source separation is to be mainstreamed in Sweden, it will need to break into markets within the wastewater jurisdictions. In order to do so, further knowledge needs to be developed that will overcome glitches with immature technologies, uncertain legal conditions/status, investigate potential risks, and clearly define complementary system advantages. This may require the use of new perspectives that focus on holistic sustainable use of resources, including other nutrients than phosphorous, and taking into account global issues such as planetary boundaries and effects from climate change, such as water scarcity. This knowledge can then be used to establish guidelines, norms, and standards, as well as clarify the legislative structures that can support such a transition. There is also a strong need to improve knowledge dissemination regarding best-practices for implementing source-separation technologies and supporting organizational structures. Similarly, support for entrepreneurial activities within the niche needs to increase, not least through strengthening social networks and communication platforms.

AB  - This study presents a deterministic, lumped model to simulate mesoscale sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) based on a conceptualization of the stormwater control measures (SCMs) making up the system and their influence on the runoff process. The conceptualization mainly relies on parameters that are easily quantifiable based on the physical characteristics of the SCMs. Introducing a nonlinear reservoir model at the downstream end of the SuDS results in a fast model that can realistically describe the runoff process at low computational cost. Modelled hydrographs for the study area in Malmo, Sweden, matched data with regard to the overall shape of the hydrograph as well as the peak discharge and lag time. These output parameters are critical factors to be considered in the design of large systems consisting of mesoscale SuDS. The algebraic foundation of the developed model makes it suitable for large-scale applications (e.g., macroscale), where the simulation time is a decisive factor. In this respect, city-wide optimization studies for the most efficient location and implementation of SuDS are substantially accelerated due to fast and easy model setup. Moreover, the simplicity of the model facilitates more effective communication between all the actors engaged in the urban planning process, including political decision makers, urban planners, and urban water engineers.

AB  - Studies have combined contingent valuation and attitude theory in models directly predicting willingness to pay recreation fees. Little research, however, has modeled predictions of attitudes toward fees on both the intention to pay (WTP) and stated payment amount (SWTP) simultaneously. This article addresses that knowledge gap using onsite survey data from 1068 recreationists at the McDonald-Dunn forest in Oregon. Attitudes toward paying an annual fee at this forest were directly associated with WTP and were among the strongest predictors of WTP. Respondents with supportive attitudes toward paying the annual fee were more willing to pay than those who were opposed. The strength of attitudes also influenced WTP, with those respondents having stronger opposition being least likely to pay. Attitudes toward paying a fee were indirectly (i.e., mediation) related to the stated payment amount (SWTP), suggesting that payment is influenced by intention to pay (WTP), and this intention is partially a function of attitudes about fees.

AB  - While today the SW Barents Sea is a relatively un-impacted and uncontaminated area, industrial activities related to the petroleum industry are projected to increase in the coming decades.
   This makes the area a valuable natural laboratory to establish pre-impacted baselines as a precursor for future seabed monitoring programs. Here we present benthic foraminiferal assemblages and metal concentrations in four sediment cores from the Ingoydjupet trough, SW Barents Sea, covering approximately the last 150 years. This information supports the application of foraminiferal assemblages as a bio-monitoring tool applicable in high latitudes.
   At all stations, metal concentrations in the sediment correspond to no effect concentrations. The downcore metal concentrations are mainly attributed to natural variability of the clay fraction and total organic content of the sediments. Agglutinated foraminifera are poorly preserved down-core. Patterns in the calcareous foraminiferal assemblages suggest an enhanced food supply as a result of increased Atlantic Water inflow through the region during the last 150 years. At near-shore stations, the Norwegian Coastal Current additionally influences assemblages. Decadal scale climatic oscillations are indicated by increased calcareous fluxes and are attributed to variability in the food-rich Atlantic Water. This study serves as an important baseline data set prior to increasing industrial activities in the SW Barents Sea, and thereby contributes to a better understanding of natural environmental variability.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyse the importance of terpene emissions from forestry and the wood industry and relate these anthropogenic emissions to the natural terpene emissions from undisturbed forests. Biogenic volatile organic compounds are emitted naturally from trees and other plants. Boreal forests are dominated by terpene-emitting tree species. Anthropogenic terpene emissions occur due to drying, machining and tooling of wood. This is a cause of concern with regulatory authorities faced with expanding production of biofuels, e.g. wood pellets. Anthropogenic terpene emissions are of current importance as the use of biofuels has increased considerably over the recent years. The most important environmental effects of terpene emissions are due to the formation of photo-oxidants and atmospheric aerosols. Photo-oxidants cause forest and crop damage, and are harmful to humans. Carbonaceous aerosols have an impact on climate change. Furthermore, most sesquiterpenes are used in the chemical communication systems of various insects. There are also issues concerning the working environment in the wood industry. Environmental effects of terpene emissions are analysed with focus on three key aspects: the total amount of emissions, the concentration in air and the types of terpenes emitted. The reported concentrations of monoterpenes are in most cases below the occupational exposure limits, with drum barking and pellets production from non-dried sawdust close to the limit. Anthropogenically emitted terpenes have a higher proportion of sesquiterpenes than naturally emitted terpenes have, especially when the processing of wood involves elevated temperatures.

AB  - Metals are essential for many physiological processes and are ubiquitously present in the environment. However, high metal concentrations can be harmful to organisms and lead to physiological stress and diseases. The accumulation of transition metals in the environment due to either natural processes or anthropogenic activities such as mining results in the contamination of water and soil environments. The present study used Caenorhabditis elegans to evaluate gene expression as an indicator of physiological response, following exposure to water collected from three different locations downstream of a Swedish mining site and a lab reconstituted metal mixture. Our results indicated that the reconstituted metal mixture exerted a direct stress response in C. elegans whereas the environmental waters elicited either a diminished or abrogated response. This suggests that it is not sufficient to use the biological effects observed from laboratory mixtures to extrapolate the effects observed in complex aquatic environments and apply this to risk assessment and intervention.

AB  - This article investigates the socio-cultural role of temporary habitation sites associated with short-distance transhumance in upland and outland pastures of northern Europe. Comparing recent archaeological fieldwork with neglected ethnohistorical information, the author discusses the extraordinary social and sexual freedoms which unmarried young people - particularly young women - experienced in summer pastures of post-medieval Ireland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. Shieling sites and booley sites were places where female-specific traditions of work and leisure were reproduced seasonally with minimal male interference. However, this autonomy was ultimately curtailed by the economic importance of what young women were doing in the hills, namely, looking after dairy cows and ewes. Adult males maintained subtle control over the architecture of seasonal sites and formed a noticeable presence in uplands thanks to occasional industrial activities. Seasonal transhumant sites demonstrate that temporary places in so-called marginal' landscapes can greatly enhance the study of social practice in non-elite rural communities.

AB  - The present study evaluates indicators in Swedish spruce forests. We ask whether different species groups co-vary in their occurrence and to what extent species richness and composition is predictable from habitat structures. We studied 10 boreal spruce forest stands constituting a gradient in degree of selective logging. Occurrences of vascular plants, bryophytes, epiphytic lichens and wood-inhabiting fungi as well as habitat structures was inventoried. In addition, in five of the stands, beetles were sampled with windows traps. Total species richness was correlated with several habitat factors, mainly particular substrates and degree of forestry impact. However, the richness of a set of species regularly used as indicators did not correlate with habitat factors. Correlation in species richness among different organism groups were few and scale dependent. Only lichens and vascular plants formed nested subset patterns (i.e. species composition at poorer sites is subsets of the species present at richer sites) among the study sites. The study shows that in this forest type one cannot a priori assume that richness in one group of species correlated with richness in other, and measures of single habitat features may be relevant only to particular groups of species. Instead, monitoring and inventories should be based on a set of factors reflecting important aspects for different groups of organisms and if indicator species are to be used these should be chosen from several species groups.

AB  - Different species' niche breadths in relation to ecological gradients are infrequently examined within the same study and, moreover, species niche breadths have rarely been averaged to account for variation in entire ecological communities. We investigated how average environmental niche breadths (climate, water quality and climate-water quality niches) in aquatic macrophyte communities are related to ecological gradients (latitude, longitude, altitude, species richness and lake area) among four distinct regions (Finland, Sweden and US states of Minnesota and Wisconsin) on two continents. We found that correlations between the three different measures of average niche breadths and ecological gradients varied considerably among the study regions, with average climate and average water quality niche breadth models often showing opposite trends. However, consistent patterns were also found, such as widening of average climate niche breadths and narrowing of average water quality niche breadths of aquatic macrophytes along increasing latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. This result suggests that macrophyte species are generalists in relation to temperature variations at higher latitudes and altitudes, whereas species in southern, lowland lakes are more specialised. In contrast, aquatic macrophytes growing in more southern nutrient-rich lakes were generalists in relation to water quality, while specialist species are adapted to low-productivity conditions and are found in highland lakes. Our results emphasise that species niche breadths should not be studied using only coarse-scale data of species distributions and corresponding environmental conditions, but that investigations on different kinds of niche breadths (e.g., climate vs. local niches) also require finer resolution data at broad spatial extents.

AB  - This study of the Swedish-based mining company Boliden examines the proactive strategies it adopted to deal with the potential for severe environmental problems associated with the establishment of its large copper smelter in the 1920s. The article demonstrates how international networks, personal experience, and knowledge transfer from the U.S. copper industry help to explain the importance given to environmental issues by the Swedish industrialists. It is suggested that the main explanation for the proactive stance of the Swedish managers is that they perceived excessive pollution as working against creating a profitable and sustainable business. This case provides compelling evidence that firms pursuing an agenda focused on earning profits can still deliver environmental innovation and value to the local community, compatible with the concept of creating shared value.

AB  - The Swedish Postal Services receives and distributes over 22 million pieces of mail every day. Mail transportation takes place overnight by airplanes, trains, trucks, and cars in a transportation network comprising a huge number of possible routes. For testing and analysis of different transport solutions, a discrete-event simulation model of the transportation network has been developed. This paper describes the optimization of transport solutions using evolutionary algorithms coupled with the simulation model. The vast transportation network in combination with a large number of possible transportation configurations and conflicting optimization criteria make the optimization problem very challenging. A large number of simulation evaluations are needed before an acceptable solution is found, making the computational cost of the problem severe. To address this problem, a computationally cheap surrogate model is used to offload the optimization process.

AB  - To maintain biodiversity in managed, boreal forest in Scandinavia, aspen trees (Populus tremula) are often retained at clearcutting. In this study, the habitat availability for beetles associated with aspen coarse woody debris (CWD) was predicted for forests and clearcuts with a model of CWD dynamics. Habitat requirements of eight beetle species (Agathidium bicolor, Cerylon ferrugineum, Cyphaea curtula, Endomychus coccineus, Homalota plana, Mycetophagus fulvicollis, Ptilinus fuscus and Xylotrechus rusticus) were obtained from their occurrence patterns in relation to characteristics of CWD objects in forest and on clearcuts in a study landscape in central Sweden. Three species were more frequent in forest and three at clearcuts. Five species increased with increasing girth of the CWD. Three were more frequent on standing CWD, and two on lying CWD. From the same study area, we also obtained field data on the recruitment of CWD (i.e., tree mortality) and amounts of different types of CWD. Annual tree mortality of aspen was higher for recent clearcuts (6.3%) compared with older clearcuts (1.1%). For all species, the habitat availability was higher on clearcuts, because enhanced tree mortality increased the amount of recently dead CWD. As a conclusion, green-tree retention of aspen is a conservation effort that is beneficial for species associated with aspen CWD.

AB  - Through qualitative interviews with fishermen from six coastal communities in Norway, this article explores different attitudes to the conflict between fish and oil. Fishermen's experiences and stories have many similarities across communities, especially regarding seismic surveys. But the strength of petroleum resistance varies from place to place. Our interpretation of this variation is based on theories about how perceived social support affects attitudes. Fishermen who feel that the local community supports the fisheries express a clearer petroleum skepticism. While fishermen who find that large parts of the local community are no longer in contact with the fisheries, are more cautious in their criticism of the petroleum industry. In addition, fishermen's different meetings with the petroleum industry is important. Those who feel that the industry respects, and perhaps even make use of, their experience and expertise are less skeptical than those who primarily have met the industry through seismic vessels. In many coastal communities where the fishing industry has dwindled, an emerging petroleum industry offers hope. In such a situation fishermen experience a lack of support for their petroleum skepticism. Sometimes they might even be perceived as barriers to the community's opportunities for growth. The result could be that the opposition to the petroleum industry is moderated. But are these industries and communities well-served by conflict reduction if it means that fishermen are marginalized?

AB  - Climate-smart forestry (CSF) consists of an extensive framework of actions directed to mitigating and adapting to global climate change impacts on the resilience and productivity of forest ecosystems. This study investigates the impact of the pan-European 2018 drought on carbon exchange dynamics in typical highland and mountain forests in the Czech Republic, including two coniferous stands (Norway spruce at Bily Kriz and Rajec) and one deciduous stand (European beech at Stitna). Our results show that the annual net ecosystem CO2 uptake at Rajec decreased by 50% during the drought year in comparison to a reference year with normal climatic conditions. The Bily Kriz stand is less affected by drought, as the local microclimate ensures sufficient water supply. The European beech forest at stitna is most resilient against drought and its negative impacts - there we detect no differences in carbon exchange dynamics between the drought year and the reference year. We consider the matching of tree species to site conditions as crucial in the context of CSF, specifically regarding the stand response to water limitation and water supply and demand. Successively replacing spruce with beech trees in areas with high water demand but limited water supply, like Rajec, will support the goals of CSF.

KW  - RESIDENTS
AB  - Dominating strands within the research literature on second homes explain social conflicts between rural hosting and visiting second home populations by describing their differing perspectives on rural development. Such presentations suggest that locals are likely to welcome new developments in order to enhance the economic viability of their rural communities, whereas second home owners advocate conservation of the rural idyll that attracted them in the first place. In this paper, we argue that these simplified differences conceptualised in the contemporary second home research literature are faulty. By analysing 42 qualitative in-depth interviews with second home owners and locals in four Norwegian municipalities, we demonstrate how both locals and second home owners are protective of their rural idyll and, at the very same time, open to rural development. More exactly, locals and second home owners alike generally welcome new activities only when they do not take place in their own vicinity. As such, both categories' interests reflect a "Not in my backyard" (NIMBY) line of logic. Hence, we argue that the major lines of conflict concerning land use in second home municipalities do not run between locals and visitors but between those initiating different kinds of new developments and those appreciating the hitherto existing qualities and appearance of the areas of development localisation. Nevertheless, the influx of second home owners is still influencing the potential for land use conflicts due to the high number of actors present in the same location. In effect, crowding a rural area with second home developments generates more "backyards" and thus guardians of these. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Seismic airgun surveys to map petroleum deposits in the seabed may impact behaviour of marine animals over large distances. Understanding whether fish spawning behaviour is affected by this anthropogenic noise source is important because reproductive success may be impacted. The fine-scale behavioural responses of Atlantic cod to airgun exposure over an extended period were investigated using an acoustic telemetry positioning system on a spawning ground in Norway. During 2019 to 2021, 135 spawning cod were equipped with telemetry sensor tags and were exposed to airgun shooting during the spawning periods of 2020 and 2021, with varying received sound levels comparable to a full-scale survey at distances of 5 to >40 km. Cod demonstrated only weak responses to the disturbance from repeated 3-h treatment periods over 5-d, swimming on average slightly deeper during seismic exposure compared to silent control periods. This response varied between individuals. Longer-term effects of seismic exposure on swimming depth were not detected. No changes in swimming acceleration, displacement, or area use occurred. These results suggest that relatively distant seismic surveys do not substantially alter cod behaviour during the spawning period at received sound exposure levels varying between 115 and 145 dB re 1 mu Pa(2)s over a 5-d period.

AB  - Economical profitability of pasture-based beef production is necessary for continued maintenance of semi-natural pastures. In a situation of decreased cattle stocks, there is a potential to castrate male calves from dairy cows and raise them as grazing steers instead of intact bulls reared indoors, which is the common way in the Nordic countries. We examined the profitability in model enterprises with either grazing steers or indoor bulls. Within the two genders (steer and bull), there were animals of two breed types (pure dairy breed and dairy x beef crossbreed), which were divided into an intensive or extensive production system. The intensive steer system had one summer on grass and slaughter at 21 months of age whereas the extensive steer system had two summers on grass and slaughter at 28 months of age. All bulls were reared indoors and slaughtered at 15 or 18 months of age. The profitability was calculated as contribution margin (CM; sigma revenues - sigma variable costs) in three different herd sizes (50, 100 and 150 slaughtered animals per year) and in three different regions in Sweden (the southern forest districts Gsk, the southern plain districts Gns, and the lower parts of the northern Nn). In the basic calculation, CM for all steers in large herds with 150 slaughtered animals per year was above zero for all cases in Gns, and for one case in Nn and in Gsk respectively. However, all steer cases had lower CM than the comparable bull system in the basic calculation. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate several possible ways of increasing the competitiveness of the grazing steers, compared to the bulls. Utilization of buildings without opportunity cost resulted in a CM above zero for all cases. Increasing the proportion of semi-natural pastures rendering high agrienvironmental payment and support was another effective mean. Decreasing the winter feed cost and labour demand on pasture reduced the costs, whereas producing premium-price certified pasture beef increased the revenue, all measures further contributing to an improved profitability. Pasture-based beef production from dairy-born steers can be economically viable, especially in large herds and with extensive production systems. Thereby, we conclude this system to has a potential to graze large areas of semi-natural pastures and thereby conserve their biodiversity and cultural values.

AB  - The intergovernmental United Nations Conference on Highly Migratory and Straddling Stocks, initiated in 1993 and finished in 1995, addressed the conservation and management of fishery resources located both within the coastal state 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the adjacent high seas. These types of marine resources continue to be a source for international conflicts and debates. The original United Nations Law of the Sea of 1982 failed to address transboundary fisheries in a proper way. In particular, the agreement did not recognize the emergence of the complicated "straddling stock" issue. In the new United Nations Law of the Sea agreement of 1995, a consensus was reached that the management of the straddling and highly migratory fish stocks should be carried out through regional fisheries management organizations. We present a review of the straddling stock issues in the international agreement emerging from the negotiations within the United Nations. The review is contrasted with and clarified by game theoretic analyses. We also discuss one international fishery exemplifying the case, the Norwegian spring-spawning herring. The main conclusion is that the local problems, faced during the stage of setting up regional fisheries organizations for the management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, are expected to be much more complicated and difficult to solve as compared to the cases of "shared fish stocks". In the current paper, we present two reasons for this increased complexity. The first is the larger number of players as compared to the case of "shared fish stocks" and the second is the possibility of new members entering the regional fisheries organizations.

AB  - Variations and trends in water quality parameters (total suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter) were examined in five harbours in the eastern Baltic Sea using satellite imagery collected from 2002 to 2011 by the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) at full spatial resolution (300 x 300 m). In the eastern Gulf of Finland harbours (Sillamae, Kunda) the TSM monthly variations were related to monthly mean wind speed. In Tallinn harbour, which operates > 6000 vessels annually, evidence of anthropogenic impacts was identified through inter-annual TSM variations. The vessel traffic footprint was ascertained from the significant correlation (R = 0.66; p = 0.035) between the number of annual vessel visits and mean annual TSM concentration. In the harbour of Parnu, located close to the river mouth, inter-annual water quality variations in terms of the CDOM concentrations were affected by the mean annual river discharge levels of the Parnu River.

AB  - Lead has been exploited by man over thousands of years for a variety of metallurgical, medicinal, and industrial purposes. The cumulative output of Pb from mining is estimated to be 260 million metric tonnes and 85% of this has occurred over the last two centuries. Global annual production of Pb from mining was about 3 million tonnes at the turn of the millenium. Terrestrial ecosystems all over Norway have been contaminated moderately to strongly by Pb and other trace elements from atmospheric deposition. With the aim of developing a method for mapping the accumulated content of anthropogenic Pb and how deep in the soil profile the atmospherically deposited Pb has penetrated, the concentration of Pb and the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio has been studied in podzolic forest soils at four locations with different lithology, i.e. age and type of bedrock, in the Oslo area. The concentrations of Pb in the soil profiles are 6.6-38.1 mg/kg (median 10.3). The Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio ranges between 1.168 and 1.314 (median 1.267) over the entire profile. In the upper 5 cm the range is 1.168-1.191, similar to ratios determined in recent atmospheric deposition. Applying three different methods, the amount of anthropogenically deposited Pb is estimated at 1-6 t/km(2). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Long term data sets of the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and the Monitoring Forest Health Program (MFHP) are analysed to find trends in relationships between boreal conifer forest communities ranked along a fertility gradient and soil nutrients of the humus layer (LFH-horizon) on podzol soils along a large temperature gradient. The temperature gradient covers the nemoral-boreonemoral, southern-central boreal and the northern boreal regions in the continental zone in Norway. For each region, the forest communities are ranked along a soil fertility gradient: communities dominated by heather species, mosses and lichens represent poorer sites than the communities dominated by grasses and herbs. Communities of grasses and herbs had a lower C/N ratio than communities dominated by heather species. In the colder regions, pH and base saturation were higher in the communities dominated by grasses and herbs than in communities dominated by heather species, while exchangeable acidity (Al + H) showed the opposite trend. Total N (N-tot) was higher in the communities with grasses and herbs than in the heather dominated communities in the warmest region. Phosphorus, S, pH and base saturation were higher and exchangeable acidity lower in the colder regions than in the warmer ones. There were no or low significant differences in base cations among forest communities.
   The analyses show that concentrations of soil nutrients in the humus layer of podzol soils for a given community on a national scale are related to the temperature gradient. Partly these relationships are influenced by the dominant tree species. Furthermore the analyses show that concentrations of soil nutrients within a region are related to the fertility gradient, thus, to type of forest community. These relationships are not similar for the different regions. It is suggested that the differences in relationships between the concentrations of soil nutrients and the fertility gradient for the different regions are influenced by temperature, length of growing season, plant available soil nutrients and acid deposition. For the planning of sustainable forest management, this study shows that more research is needed on forest ecosystem processes to further and better explain the geographical variability in relationships between soil type, soil nutrients and humus layer, forest communities and tree species at national and regional scales.

AB  - The European Union (EU) has set a binding greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target for transportation biofuels and other bioliquids. In this study, the GHG emissions of various biofuel chains considered as relevant in large-scale production in Finland were calculated in accordance with the EU sustainability criteria. Special attention was paid to uncertainties and the sensitivities of certain parameters. According to the results, it is impossible in many cases to unambiguously conclude whether or not a biofuel chain passes the emission-saving limit provided by the EU. This may reduce the willingness to invest in biofuel production. Major sources of uncertainties and sensitivities are nitrous oxide emissions from soil and nitrogen fertilisation, emissions of process heat production and soil carbon stock changes in biomass production. Several propositions are made in order to reduce the uncertainty of the results and to make the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels more harmonised and accurate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Norwegian aquaculture of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is hampered by ulcerative disorders associated with bacterial infections. Chronic ulceration may provide microenvironments that disturb the normal microbial biodiversity of external surfaces. Studying the composition of microbial communities in skin ulcers will enhance our understanding of ulcer aetiology. To achieve this, we tested marine farmed Atlantic salmon and sampled the base and edge of ulcers at the end of winter (April) and end of summer (September), in addition to skin mucus of healthy individuals. In order to assess microbiota associated with the host and obtain insight into the environmental ecology, we also sampled sea water, the sediment layer underneath the farm facility and the distal intestine of Atlantic salmon. The skin microbiota of Atlantic salmon was different from that of the surrounding water. Residential Tenacibaculum and Arcobacter species persistently dominated the cutaneous skin and ulcer mucus surfaces of Atlantic salmon during both winter and summer periods. The intestinal microbiota was dominated by Mycoplasma with an increase in Aliivibrio and Alcaligenes abundance in the intestine of fish with ulcerative disorder at the end of winter. These findings suggest the presence of resilient microbes in the mucus surfaces of Atlantic salmon.

AB  - Understanding tree species responses to climate change is crucial for preserving biodiversity especially in Southern Europe hot spots where Abies alba is widely spread. Three Apennine silver fir populations, Pigelleto (PIG), La Verna (LV) and Bocca Trabaria (BT), ensured gene flows in interglacial periods between the two phylogenetically different groups of northern and southern Apennines. These stands were analysed (nuclear and chloroplast SSRs) with the aim to establish a baseline for their future management in view of the expected changes. The three forests were tested for the Centre-Periphery Hypothesis (CPH) compared to forty-five Italian populations. At the same time, permanent areas were surveyed within LV and PIG on dominant (a) and dominated or natural regeneration (r) tree layers, and on age classes. In two consecutive years, spring cambial phenology activity was also weekly monitored on microcores, and critical phenology dates recorded. The stands matched CPH only partially, showing different phylogenetic history and their bridging between northern and southern groups of silver fir populations was confirmed. LV was distinct from PIG and BT. The within-population variance component was significantly high, and no narrow relatedness was observed between dominant and dominated/ regeneration spatially closer trees, and genetic parameters were comparable in both layers at LV and PIG. In both stands, older age classes ensured natural regeneration. Cambium phenology was highly variable within populations, consistently to other Mediterranean conifers, and highly sensitive to local and year's conditions and monitoring will improve population's adaptive capacity detection. Shelterwood-system silvicultural treatments are suggested on small areas to drive the demographic and panmictic balance towards an uneven-aged more resilient structure, and iterated monitoring will help to adapt the forest management to the isotherm shift.

The surface mapping method provides the commercial developer with a practical tool to evaluate the potential for building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). The solar maps identify the optimum roof and facade areas available for solar energy utilization. The importance of BIPV and facade utilization in new city developments is discussed, along with key questions raised by the commercial developer regarding the practical implementation of BIPV solutions. Based on feedback from the building industry, a simplified model has been implemented to evaluate surface areas producing a profit or a loss over the PV system lifetime. As tilted photovoltaic (PV) modules installed on flat roofs are not building integrated, three simulation variants have been performed for flat roofs with a small inclination up to ten degrees. For some buildings this will give a small gain in annual PV production and payback time. The resulting 3D solar maps give the developer a possibility to review early-stage plans in terms of building shapes and positions in the landscape, in order to maximize utilization of the available solar resource. This enables cost-and energy-efficient development of nearly zero-energy buildings in future city districts.

AB  - Even before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the oil and gas (O&G) industry had been facing disruptions in terms of an energy transition phase that include the focus on the use of renewable energy equipment, transport electrification, decarbonization, and waste elimination among others. However, the contraction in global travel and remote working habits owing to the pandemic really set off disruptions for the O&G industry. This research intends to identify and analyze the enablers for the O&G industry that can help it handle potential disruptions and hence become resilient. Several significant enablers have been identified through a systematic literature review using the PRISMA approach and Delphi method. The mutual inter-relationships among the enablers have been developed using the modified total interpretive structural modelling approach. Later, the matrice d'impacts crois es multiplication appliques an un classement analysis has been used to identify the enablers' clusters according to their dependence and driving powers. The modelling and analysis results suggest four paths for the O&G industry to handle disruptions effectively. This research aims to help academicians, managers, and researchers understand the essential enablers and paths to adopt on a priority basis so as to handle disruptions and build resilience in the O&G industry.

AB  - Eating "less but better" meat can be a strategy to guide meat consumption in Western or high-income countries towards sustainability, but what "better" means depends on the perspective. Multiple studies and reports suggest that agroecological farming systems could contribute to a broad range of sustainability benefits, but few studies have examined the implications for people and nature following trade-offs between sustainability priorities at the farm level. Therefore, this study explored the effects on a broad range of sustainability themes following agroecological transition on a case farm in east-central Sweden. We applied a novel mixed-methods approach, combining the indicator-based SMART-Farm tool with additional quantitative and qualitative analysis of the farm's climate impact, contribution to global food security, economic performance, and working conditions. The results showed improvements for aspects within environmental, social, economic, and governance-related sustainability dimensions, with corroborating results across methods. The case farm thus served as an example of transition to a more sustainable production system, but as expected, there were both trade-offs and synergies between sustainability aspects. Negative effects were found for economic aspects at the farm and societal level. For this case, one may conclude that "better" meat production both supports and depends on, a more sustainable farm; but that "better" meat and a more sustainable farm cannot be viewed in isolation from the wider food system. Also, "better" can be described by several states along a transition pathway. Key contributions of the study are threefold, a) articulation of the links between agroecology and the concept "less but better," b) empirically demonstrating synergies and trade-offs in striving for more sustainable meat production, and c) a novel methodological approach for sustainability assessment.

AB  - We measured volatile organic compound (VOC) volume mixing ratios (VMRs) using a quadrupole proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer, and investigated the differences between winter and spring VMRs and sources at an urban background site in Helsinki (2006) and a rural site in Hyytiala (2007) utilizing a receptor model EPA Unmix. In Helsinki, VMRs of VOCs were typically higher,and their diurnal variations were more pronounced than at the rural site. At both sites, monoterpenes have anthropogenic influence in winter, while in spring biogenic influence is dominating. At the urban background site, the main aromatic hydrocarbon source was traffic, which also explained most of the oxidated VOCs during the urban winter. At other times and at the rural location most of oxidated VOCs originated mainly from distant sources. At the rural site, traffic and distant sources contributed equally to the aromatics in winter but in spring the distant source dominated.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation is a growing problem worldwide. Particularly in river systems, numerous dams and weirs hamper the movement of a wide variety of species. With the aim to preserve connectivity for fish, many barriers in river systems are equipped with fishways (also called fish passages or fish ladders). However, few fishways provide full connectivity. Here we hypothesized that restricted seasonal opening times of fishways can importantly reduce their effectiveness by interfering with the timing of fish migration, for both spring-and autumn-spawning species. We empirically tested our hypothesis, and discuss the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of affected migration timing. We analyzed movements of two salmonid fishes, spring-spawning European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and autumn-spawning brown trout (Salmo trutta), in Norway's two largest river systems. We compared their timing of upstream passage through four fishways collected over 28 years with the timing of fish movements in unfragmented river sections as monitored by radiotelemetry. Confirming our hypothesis, late opening of fishways delayed the migration of European grayling in spring, and early closure of fishways blocked migration for brown trout on their way to spawning locations during late autumn. We show in a theoretical framework how restricted opening times of fishways can induce shifts from migratory to resident behavior in potamodromous partial migration systems, and propose that this can induce density-dependent effects among fish accumulating in lower regions of rivers. Hence, fragmentation may not only directly affect the migratory individuals in the population, but may also have effects that cascade downstream and alter circumstances for resident fish. Fishway functionality is inadequate if there is a mismatch between natural fish movements and fishway opening times in the same river system, with ecological and possibly evolutionary consequences for fish populations.

AB  - The demographic landscape of Norway is diversifying. These changes present challenges for frontline professionals working with immigrant parents raising children with disabilities. This article explored service providers' perspectives on the challenges they face in delivering services to immigrant adolescents and young adults with disabilities aged 16-25. The study generated qualitative data from seven informants from different state institutions using semi-structured interviews. Our findings showed that service providers encountered personal and organisational challenges, including communicating and collaborating with immigrant parents. Service agencies experienced underfunding, making them unable to cope with growing demands. Additionally, service providers experienced inter-agency cooperation and collaboration difficulties such as a lack of information sharing, even when they served the same clients. Increasing funding, staff training, and strengthening formal and informal communication with immigrant parents of children with disabilities can provide opportunities to improve service delivery.
   Point of interest The Norwegian service apparatuses were designed to serve a homogenous population. Adjusting to a diversifying working environment by service providers was necessary to enhance service delivery. Service providers considered low participation by immigrant parents of disabled children in school activities had negative impacts on home-school partnership. They thought some immigrant parents were uninterested in the academic life of their children. Service providers faced communication challenges in service delivery because of language and cultural barriers. The use of untrained cultural brokers and translators was unhelpful in bridging the cultural and communication gaps. Service providers experience work pressure because of insufficient resources and a lack of cooperation and information sharing between agencies. The authors observed that agencies did not coordinate their activities. The study shows a need for in-service training on multiculturalism for professionals working with immigrant parents raising disabled children.

AB  - While Asia's share in 1996 global aquaculture production of fish and shelfish (26.38 million mt as estimated by FAG) was maximal (91%), those of Europe (4.7%) and North America (1.8%) were low. Intriguingly, the relative increases (%) in production over the decade in both the developed continents have decreased. Among the top ten producer countries, China accounted for 67% of total world production, followed by India (7%), Japan (3%), Indonesia (2.5%), Thailand (1.9%), USA and Bangladesh (1.5%), Korea (RoK) (1.4%), philippines (1.3%) and Norway (1.2%). While India has increased its farmed freshwater fish production and shrimps very impressively, utilization of marine aquatic resources (except for shrimps), spread over an expansive EEZ of two million km, is poor. India has little production of farmed marine fishes, molluscs and seaweeds, in which even smaller Asian countries excel. An index of Biodiversty Utilization for Aquaculture (BUA), calculated for India is quite low (0.13), when compared to the highest (0.51) for Taiwan and RoK, India can gain much by diversification of aquaculture, recruiting more species from her rich aquatic fauna and flora and also by developing eco-friendly and sustainable aquaculture systems by sharing of experience and technology with our Asian neighbours through cooperative efforts.

AB  - Anthropogenic alterations of hydrologic regime are a major stressor for aquatic ecosystems. In boreal lakes water levels are often drawn down several meters for hydropower production in winter, which may have negative impacts particularly on littoral biota. We examined macrophyte, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages in littoral zone of 30 regulated and non-regulated reference lakes in Finland. We applied community metrics which correspond to demands of EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) to (i) assess and classify ecological status of the lakes, and to (ii) estimate critical water level drawdown in winter that would allow for acceptable status ("Good" ecological quality class in WFD). All three organism groups indicated strong response to winter drawdown, but with rather high mutual variation. Macroinvertebrates showed the strongest response (r(2) = 0.73 between Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) and winter drawdown), followed by macrophytes (r(2) = 0.43) and fish (r(2) = 0.40). Mean-EQR over the three organism groups indicated that Good ecological status class was usually not attained if winter drawdown exceeded 3.46m, whereas minimum-EQR (lowest of the three groups, i.e. one-out, all-out principle) indicated a critical threshold of 1.76 m. Generally, our results suggest that monitoring and ecological status assessment of regulated lakes should focus on littoral biota which is most vulnerable to water level fluctuations.

AB  - Tailings dam is an indispensable part of mining safety production and environmental sustainability. The stability, monitoring, pre-alarming, and sustainability of tailings dam are crucial for mining disaster control, environment, and human beings. The paper introduces the damage of tailings dam failure by 44 typical accidents (2138 deaths in total), and then presents some developments and new insights for environmental sustainability and disaster control of tailings dam. Firstly, three kinds of methods for stability analysis of tailings dam were summarized and compared. Limit equilibrium methods (LEMs) were focused on Sweden methods, Janbu method, Bishop method, and Morgenstern-Price method. Numerical simulation methods were discussed about finite element method (FED), discrete element method (DEM), boundary element method (BEM), and finite difference method (FDM). Uncertainty methods were compared, including gray system evaluation method, reliability method, and fuzzy evaluation method. Secondly, the research progress in the field of safety monitoring and pre-alarming of tailings dam was reviewed, covering the aspects of traditional monitoring methods and coupled monitoring systems. Finally, the conception map of disaster prevention, disaster control, and environmental sustainability for safety management and environment to enhance cleaner production work in tailings dam was presented. The map for safety work and environmental sustainability achieves the goals from "lagging" to "real time", from "point" to "solid", from "surface" to "internal", and from "passive" to "coupled passive and active".

AB  - This study examines the Swedish debate on the sustainability of using sewage sludge as fertiliser in agriculture. Although the use of sludge as fertiliser presents potential resource and environmental advantages, it can have negative effects on people and soil productivity. Both proponents and opponents of agricultural application of sludge use environmental arguments to support their positions. By 1990, the Swedish parliament stressed the importance of recycling nutrients from wastewater; however, despite low levels of contamination, compared to other countries, little sludge is used in agriculture today.
   During the last few decades, a large amount of research has addressed the risks and benefits of using sludge as fertiliser, but the central actors have not been able to reach lasting agreements. This study, which is based on document analysis, direct observations, and interviews, analyses the beliefs, preferences, and arguments of major actors in the national debate on sludge. The study investigates how actors define problems and interpret the risks and benefits of sludge use. Specifically, the study concentrates on the role of science in the sludge controversy. Two distinct ways of thinking-a precautionary frame and a proof-first frame-are identified. These frames are shown almost immune to factual claims and arguments from opponents. It is concluded that actors in the controversy need to address explicitly value judgements and beliefs that go beyond scientific information. In addition, the study concludes that there is a need for policy makers to further develop process leadership skills. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mitigating climate change is a global challenge demanding effort from all sectors, and sports are no exception. While transportation is one of the key issues regarding sustainable sports, the methods by which children and adolescents get to practice have not received much attention. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to present how adolescents in Southern Norway travel to soccer practice and assess how the mode of transportation is related to sex, socioeconomic status, age, ethnicity, and distance from home to practice. Cross-sectional data were collected from 558 adolescent soccer players (398 boys and 190 girls) representing 30 different clubs from settlements of varying rurality. While most of the participants lived within cycling distance from the field of practice, the majority opted for passive modes of transportation (55% passive vs. 45% active). A logistic regression analysis found that traveling distance and age were associated with active transportation habits, while sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status were not. Further research is needed to examine the main barriers to active travel for this already active population, as active transport represents an opportunity for sports to become more sustainable.

TI  - Norwegian local councils as democratic meta-governors? A study of networks established to manage cross-border natural resources
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN POLITICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
CP  - Conference on Democratic Network Governance
AB  - Focusing on democracy, the question raised in this article is whether it is possible for local councils to play a role as democratic meta-governors in situations with cross-border conflicts over interests. According to the authors' definition, democratic meta-governance implies that the local councils assure that all interests are taken into account in governing networks. The analysis is based on data from extensive studies of two Norwegian networks dealing with cross-border natural resources. Not surprisingly, the authors' answer is rather negative. Based on analysis of who actually participates in the networks and the way the involved local councils deal with the question of democracy, this may be explained by the fact that each local council represents a specific defend interest held by the majority in their constituency. Instead of opening up and allowing the required participation, which may give the networks the legitimacy they need, the local councils are closing the networks in order to better get their interests heard. It should therefore be considered whether responsibility for securing democracy in the management of cross-border natural resources should be given to a regional or national authority, above the level of local government.

AB  - A two-dimensional version of the classical diffusion equation has been used to study the spreading Of CO2 from a source in the deep ocean. In the upper part of the ocean there is a mixed layer including full carbon chemistry, communicating with the atmosphere through a standard gas exchange formulation. The size of the vertical diffusion coefficient, the total ocean depth, the injection depth and the mixed layer thickness appear to be critical for the amount Of CO2 that outgasses to the atmosphere. The carbon source has been fitted to the emission of a 2 GW gas power plant operating for 100 years. If this amount of carbon is released at a depth of 2000 m, the cumulative outgassing to the atmosphere 200 years after the end of the operation of the plant is estimated to be 4% of the total injected carbon for average north Atlantic and north Pacific waters, and 14% for the Norwegian Sea.

AB  - Vertical farms are often claimed to have better environmental performance compared to conventional products on the market. However, there are few assessments of the environmental performance of vertical farms, in particular commercial systems. This study has aimed to analyze the environmental performance of a large commercial vertical farm in Sweden producing packaged lettuce. Life cycle assessment was employed to assess the environmental performance and compare it to conventional imported and domestically produced lettuce from a cradle-to-grave perspective. For conventional supply chains, the production, transportation to Sweden, washing, processing, packaging, and final distribution were all included. The results from the study suggest that the vertical farm has lower GHG emissions than conventionally sourced varieties. However, for other impact categories, the vertical farm may have larger environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective due primarily to the large electricity demand. The electricity use, packaging, infrastructure, and distribution of the products to retail were found to be the primary hotspots for the system. Finally, key performance indicators are also provided to compare the results of this study with other indoor farming studies. The results from the KPIs suggest that the vertical farm has better water use efficiency, GHG emissions, and energy use efficiency compared to other studies in the literature. The results of this study provide insights into the environmental performance and resource use of vertical farms, which can be used for comparisons and validation of claims in the industry, and to provide empirical evidence to this developing field.

AB  - The idea of the smart city' is increasingly central to debates on urban development and sustainability, and a host of cities are now pursuing smartness' as a way to improve energy efficiency, transport, and public services. However, existing research does not provide a clear picture of how this smart city agenda actually contributes to sustainability. The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver. Nevertheless, the sustainability component' of the smart city agenda becomes clearer the closer we come to the city level.

AB  - With the growth of demand for energy, natural gas was predicted to be a major energy commodity in immediate future. In the current setting, it would also act as a transitional energy source (due to its low emission) towards greener energy goals within EU countries. However, production and transportation of gas to various markets have also been met with different challenges, for instance due to economical as well as technical reasons. Norway is one of the leading natural gas exporters in the world, serving a large portion of Europe's energy demand through its subsea gas pipeline infrastructure. In light of not only global uncertainty, but also with respect to the potential market position, a major question is that what types of challenges are present in a specific critical downstream asset such as a subsea natural gas pipeline when striving to uphold the position as leading gas supplier to Europe. This is also a question of future opportunities in the ongoing energy debate despite the current economic conditions. This paper, based on a case study on a section of the large Norwegian gas transportation infrastructure, examines a wide range of multiple challenges, all of which could possibly challenge and pose a risk for the reliability and efficiency of gas supply from the Norwegian shelf. It elaborates on the current and future threats/challenges on the capitalization and management of the gas export pipelines from a longer-term perspective when striving for optimal asset availability in regards to future energy demand. The paper also elaborates on a specific scenario that would help the asset owners and other stakeholders to draw up a suitable strategy for long term value creation using a Strategy map.

AB  - Years with climatically mediated increases in boreal forest fire activity, referred to as large fire years (LFYs), contribute to a disproportionally large portion of the burned area over centuries, and are important drivers of ecosystem processes by affecting forest structure, biodiversity, and carbon balance at regional and continental scales. We analysed changes in LFY return intervals in northern Sweden (the area above 60 degrees N) over 1273-1960 using a network of 29 sites with dendrochronologically reconstructed fires, complemented by documentary records of fires available from forestry statistics. We observed large variability in return intervals of LFYs, an increase in LFY frequency during the 1800s, and consistent associations between LFY occurrence and 500-hPa pressure anomalies over the European sub-continent over 1800xps2#1960. An increase in LFY frequency during the 1800s might be climatically driven, and would thus long precede the period of likely human-induced climatic changes of the 1900s. Long-term variability in climatically driven LFYs may present a challenge in partitioning the effects of human-related and human-independent components of climatic forcing upon forest fire activity.

AB  - (1) The population of moose (Alces alces) at Gausdal Vestfjell in central Norway migrate from low-lying summer areas to winter areas situated at higher altitudes.  This is contrary to the general pattern of migration among herbivores.
   (2) Archaeological evidence along the migration route shows that the migratory behaviour of this population follows a traditional pattern that has been unchanged since 5000 B.P. despite a deterioration in the quality of their winter range through the loss of high quality pine forests.
   (3) The low calf production of the GV population (0.6 calves per cow greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years), compared with neighbouring populations (0.79-1.27 calves per cow greater-than-or-equal-to 2 years) are likely to reflect poor winter ranges.
   (4) Migratory traditions in moose appear to log behind environmental changes, and changing migratory routes to utilise better quality range may take many generations.

AB  - Conflicts between different goals can obstruct progress in sustainability, but interests may also coincide. We evaluated relationships between environmental quality and animal welfare on Swedish farms with grazing livestock, using publicly available databases. Data were collected from 8700 official animal welfare inspections on 5808 cattle farms and 2823 inspections on 2280 sheep farms in 2012-2017. Compliance with three animal-based checkpoints was modeled using logistic regression, including a random farm effect to account for repeated inspections. Compliance was regressed on semi-natural grassland area, participation in the National Meadow and Pasture Inventory, Agri-Environmental Scheme (AES) grassland payments, presence of indicator plant species, and the presence of Natura 2000 habitats. Cattle farms complied more often if they received AES payments for grasslands of special values compared with if they did not apply for them (OR = 1.55-1.65; p <= 0.0001) and there was a similar tendency for cattle farms that applied for but were denied such payments (OR = 1.29; p = 0.074). There was also a strong tendency for Natura 2000 habitats on cattle farms to be associated with higher compliance (OR = 1.36; p = 0.059). These results suggest a direct or indirect causal effect of biodiversity on cattle welfare. The same associations could not be shown in sheep.

AB  - Introduction: The social influence on drunk driving has been previously observed in several countries. It is noteworthy, however, that the prevalence of alcohol in road fatalities is not the same in all countries. The present study aimed to explore whether cultural values and the number of roadside breath tests moderate the link between the perceived drunk driving of one's peers and self-reported behavior.
   Methods: Based on the European survey SARTRE 4, the responses of 10,023 car drivers from 15 countries were analyzed. Two cultural values, "tradition" and "conformism," were identified as possibly being linked to social influence. Country scores for these values were taken from the European Social Survey. The number of random roadside breath tests per inhabitant was used as an indicator of drunk-driving enforcement in each country.
   Results: A hierarchical multilevel modeling analysis confirmed the link between friends' drunk driving and one's own drunk driving in all countries, but the strength of the link was much stronger in some countries (e.g., Italy, Cyprus, and Israel) than in others (e.g., Finland, Estonia, and Sweden).

AB  - Circular economy has emerged as a sustainable alternative to the traditional, linear, extract-produce-use-dump economy. The scientific society, practitioners, policymakers, and business sectors are all actively taking part in driving the transition toward circular economy in their own sectors. Every sector is striving to address the environmental issues of their own area, and to find solutions to the problem of resource scarcity. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on the general status of circular economy research and applied projects. Finland aims to be a global pioneer in this field, which is why there is a tremendous boost in research in various fields of sustainable materials management. Therefore, there is a need to have a better perspective of the research society's efforts to accelerate the transition to circular economy. The objective of this paper is to review scientific research and practices of circular economy transition in Finland, in order to categorize and analyze them. The paper aims to give an insight into the current status and provide a comprehensive understanding of the trend changes during the past 20 years. The analysis shows that there is growing attention to circular economy in many research fields, researchers and practitioners in all fields have responded to the need of the society. However, the recycling-based 'end-of-pipe' interpretation of circular economy is still more dominant than developing and implementing strategies for circular product design, dematerializing society, and developing service-based business models. It is important to bear in mind that circular economy is about much more than improved resource flows and waste management practices. Achieving a circular economy needs the engagement of the society, it needs invention and innovation and it also requires the creation of new technologies, products, services, and business models. This study gives a comprehensive perspective at the national level and addresses the key actions and sectors which require more investment and attention from the scientific community to boost the transition toward circular economy. There are some limitation in this study derived from the method of data collection and selection of databases. Due to this, there may be valuable works that were not published, or only in the Finnish language and were, therefore, not identified in this study.

AB  - The application of ecological indictors for assessing the environmental status of ecosystems play an important role for effective management. However, natural variability may limit the indicators' ability to provide relevant information about anthropogenic pressures and guide management action. Coastal fish species are not only a resource for commercial and recreational fisheries but also key ecosystem components in the Baltic Sea, and is therefore used as management objectives within the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan. A challenge, however, is that the distribution and abundance of coastal fish populations in Baltic Sea is also influenced by spatial and temporal variation in ambient environmental factors. Here, using 16 years of monitoring data, over a latitudinal range of 56 - 66 degrees N along the Swedish Baltic Sea coast, we evaluated the effect of variability in water temperature and depth, and wave exposure for three indicators of environmental status assessment in the Baltic Sea: Abundance of perch, Abundance of Cyprinids, and Abundance of Piscivores. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) revealed an overall positive linear relationship between water tem-perature for all indicators, and overall negative linear relationships to depth and wave exposure. When adjusting indicator values using the parameter estimates from the GLMM models, the variability and 95 % confidence interval for all three indicators were reduced. The adjustment, however, did not have a strong impact on the assessment of the ecological state of the indicator. Our results suggest that adjusting coastal fish indicators to variation in local ambient environmental factors will increase their precision, and hence, the confidence in the assessment of environmental status.

AB  - Cleaning and washing of road tunnels are routinely performed and large volumes of contaminated wash water are often discharged into nearby recipients. In the present study, traffic related contaminants were quantified in tunnel wash water (the Nordby tunnel, Norway) discharged from a sedimentation pond to a nearby small stream, Arungselva. In situ size and charge fractionation techniques were applied to quantify traffic related metal species, while PAHs were quantified in total samples. All metals and several PAHs appeared at elevated concentrations in the discharged wash water compared with concentrations measured in Arungselva upstream the pond outlet, and to concentrations measured in the pond outlet before the tunnel wash event. In addition, several contaminants (e.g. Cu, Pb, Zn, fluoranthene, pyrene) exceeded their corresponding EQS. PAR and metals like Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe and Pb were associated with particles and colloids, while As, Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Ni, Sb and Zn were more associated with low molecular mass species (<10 kDa). Calculated enrichment factors revealed that many of the metals were derived from anthropogenic sources, originating most likely from wear of tires (Zn), brakes (Cu and Sb), and from road salt (Na and Cl). The enrichment factors for Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Fe, K, Mg and Ni were low, suggesting a crustal origin, e.g. asphalt wear. Based on calculated PAH ratios, PAH seemed to originate from a mixture of sources such as wear from tires, asphalt and combustion. Finally, historical fish length measurement data indicates that the fish population in the receiving stream Arungselva may have been adversely influenced by the chemical perturbations in runoffs originating from the nearby roads and tunnels during the years, as the growth in summer old sea trout (Salmo trutta L) in downstream sections of the stream is significantly reduced compared to the upstream sections.

AB  - Sphagnum moss was collected from 22 ombrotrophic (rain-fed) bogs near open pit mines and upgraders within the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) region of Alberta (AB). Mercury was quantified using two approaches: sector-field ICP-MS of acid digests, and a Direct Mercury Analyser (DMA) for solid samples. Using ICP-MS, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (34.7 +/- 1.5 mu g/kg, n = 75) was significantly greater than the control site, Utikuma (26.7 +/- 4.0 mu g/kg, n = 3). Using DMA, the mean Hg concentration in moss from the ABS region (26.2 +/- 0.9 mu g/kg, n = 71) was significantly lower than the control site (28.5 +/- 1.3 mu g/kg, n = 6). These contradictory findings illustrate the challenges associated with comparing the results of two analytical methods, especially given the similarity in Hg concentrations between industrial and background sites, Similar Hg concentrations were also found in Sphagnum moss from two other bogs in AB which are far removed from the ABS region. The Hg concentrations in Sphagnum from the ABS bogs are well below the range found in bog vegetation collected earlier in eastern Canada, and comparable to the lowest values (5th percentile) reported for forest moss collected in 2015 from Norway and Sphagnum moss sampled in 2008 from northern Sweden. Given the rates of Sphagnum accumulation in the ABS region (ca. 215 g/m(2)/yr), Hg accumulation rates there were 5.8-7.5 mu g/m(2)/yr versus 5.7-6.1 mu g/m(2)/yr at the control site (UTK); these are at the upper limit of the range in pre-anthropogenic rates of Hg accumulation for peat from European bogs. Sphagnum moss is abundant in Canada and found in bogs from coast to coast, offering an opportunity to obtain quantitative information on atmospheric Hg deposition to terrestrial ecosystems from natural as well as anthropogenic sources.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NBS) are becoming increasingly important in both the EU and individual countries' political agendas, as a sustainable means to reduce the risk posed by hydrometeorological hazards. However, as the use of NBS is increasing, a number of barriers regarding their practical implementation also become apparent. A number of review studies have summarized and classified barriers, mainly in urban settings. PHUSICOS is a Horizon 2020 Innovation Action to demonstrate the use of NBS in rural and mountain landscapes. Large-scale demonstrator case sites with several sub-projects are established in Italy, Norway and in the French and Spanish Pyrenees. The present paper describes the project's NBS measures and their experienced barriers, some of which have resulted in full cancellation of the planned interventions. Many of the barriers experienced in rural settings have the same root causes as the ones described from urban areas, and the main barrier-creating mechanisms are institutional factors, resistance among stakeholders and technical and economic issues. The key element, however, is the lack of knowledge about the ability of NBS to deliver a series of co-benefits in addition to their risk-reducing effects and that long-term thinking is required to see the effect of many of these co-benefits.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL AND PLANNING RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Two practice stories from planner-designers abroad illuminate the important and complex activities of dealing simultaneously with physical space and dialogic space in order to manage conflict. In this deliberative process, both the planners and the other stakeholders learn about ends and means, about limits and potentials, about facts and values. This learning enriches and enhances the formation of consensus. From listening carefully to the words of these two practitioners as they describe their urban design work, we can extend our theoretical understanding of the overlaps among negotiation mediation, facilitation, and consensus-building within the daily processes of deliberative design and decision-making. This practical planning theory intertwines process and product, acting and learning, relationship-building and world shaping that reaches beyond narrow deal-making to the creative practice of deliberative planning and design in the public sphere.

AB  - The bioeconomy offers a cross-cutting perspective on the societal transformation towards long-term sustainability and the transition away from the non-renewable economy. Identification of future pathways towards a sustainable bioeconomy can be related to different 'visions' of the bioeconomy, including an ecological vision, a bioresource development vision and a biotechnology vision. This paper synthesises empirical work from stakeholder dialogues conducted in Colombia, Rwanda, Sweden, and Thailand. The dialogues were structured around elaboration of bioeconomy pathways arising from different visions. The dialogues considered key driving factors and enabling conditions for different institutional levels ranging from local to regional. By conducting analysis across multiple countries and regions, we aimed to look across different economic development levels, different sectoral perspectives, and different innovation and bioresource strategies. Key components for bioeconomy pathways were identified with respect to bio-based products and resources, sectoral alignment, innovation clusters or hubs, and landscape transitions. The choice of different bioeconomy pathways is characterised by tensions between sector-based development and cross-cutting approaches, which in turn reflect differences between the bioresource and ecological visions, whereas the biotechnology vision tends to be viewed more as a means of implementation. The comparative analysis suggests some future lines of research on governing bioeconomy pathways.

AB  - Increased attention is being paid to the ecological drivers and conservation measures which could mitigate climate change-induced pressures for species survival, potentially helping populations to remain in their present-day locations longer. One important buffering mechanism against climate change may be provided by the heterogeneity in topography and consequent local climate conditions. However, the buffering capacity of this topoclimate has so far been insufficiently studied based on empirical survey data across multiple sites and species. Here, we studied whether the fine-grained air temperature variation of protected areas (PAs) affects the population changes of declining northern forest bird species. Importantly to our study, in PAs harmful land use, such as logging, is not allowed, enabling the detection of the effects of temperature buffering, even at relatively moderate levels of topographic variation. Our survey data from 129 PAs located in the boreal zone in Finland show that the density of northern forest species was higher in topographically heterogeneous PAs than in topographically more homogeneous PAs. Moreover, local temperature variation had a significant effect on the density change of northern forest birds from 1981-1999 to 2000-2017, indicating that change in bird density was generally smaller in PAs with higher topographic variation. Thus, we found a clear buffering effect stemming from the local temperature variation of PAs in the population trends of northern forest birds.

AB  - Question: How does restoration affect the hydrology and the understorey vegetation of managed pine fens?
   Location: Oligotrophic pine fens in Natura 2000 areas in Kainuu, eastern Finland.
   Methods: Eleven managed pine fens and eight pristine reference pine fens were chosen for the study in 2005. The managed fens, which had been drained for forestry during the 1970s and 1980s, were restored in 2007. The water table was monitored in all fens over four growing seasons during 2006 to 2009, and vegetation was surveyed from permanent sample plots in 2006 and 2009.
   Results: Before restoration in 2006, the water table was at a significantly lower level in the managed fens compared with the pristine fens. Immediately after restoration, the water table rose to the same level as in the pristine fens, and this change was permanent. Forest drainage had had little impact on the understorey vegetation of the managed fens in the three decades before restoration, with species typical of pristine fens still dominating the sites. Forest dwarf shrubs and feather mosses had started to increase in cover, but mire dwarf shrubs and Sphagnum mosses still dominated the managed fens. Only the typical hollow species Sphagnum majus, Sphagnum balticum and Scheuzeria palustris were missing from the managed fens. Two years after restoration, the changes in species composition were also marginal, with increased cover of mire dwarf shrubs and sedges being the only significant change.
   Conclusions: The success of restoration of oligotrophic pine fens seems likely, given that changes in hydrological functioning occurred rapidly, and since little change has occurred in the vegetation composition after draining. Speeding up the regeneration process in these peatland types by restoration may, therefore, be recommended, especially if the drainage effect extends to nearby pristine mires and influences their biodiversity.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Tourism and nature-based recreation has changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Travel restrictions caused sharp declines in visitation numbers, particularly in remote areas, such as northern Norway. In addition, the pandemic may have altered human-nature relationships by changing visitor behaviour and preferences. We studied visitor numbers and behaviour in northern Norway, based on user-generated data, in the form of photographic material that was uploaded to the popular online platform Flickr. A total of 195.200 photographs, taken by 5.247 photographers were subjected to Google's "Cloud Vision" automatic content analysis algorithm. The resulting collection of labels that were assigned to each photograph was analysed in structural topic models, using photography date (relative to the start of the pandemic measures in Norway) and reported or estimated photographers' nationality as explanatory variables. Our results show that nature-based recreation relating to "mountains" and "winter" became more prevalent during the pandemic, amongst both domestic and international photographers. Shifts in preferences due to the pandemic outbreak strongly depended on nationality, with domestic visitors demonstrating a wide interest in topics while international visitors maintained their preference for nature-based experiences. Among those activities that suffered the most from decline in international tourism was northern lights and cruises as indicated by the topic models. On the other hand, images depicting mountains and flora and fauna increased their prevalence during the pandemic. Domestic visitors, on the other hand, spent more time in urban settings as a result of restrictions, which results in a higher prevalence of non-nature related images. Our results underscore the need to consider the dynamic nature of human-nature relationships. The contrast in flexibility to adapt to changing conditions and travel restrictions should be incorporated in collaborative efforts of municipalities and tour operators to develop sustainable local nature-based tourism products, particularly in remote areas.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study examining the values and attitudes of nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in relation to adaptation to climate change. The aim is to focus on tourism stakeholders' values and ideas about tourism entrepreneurship, which may bring interesting new insights to the tourism and climate change research and support the industry in adaptation and mitigation processes. The data utilised in this paper consists of 19 thematic interviews conducted with nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in Finland between 2009 and 2013. Analysis of the data reveal issues concerning views on entrepreneurship in general, on the independence and individuality of the enterprises, on the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders in the processes of adaptation and on the attitudes towards innovations and actions in the changing climate. These issues, together with the rate and scale of the change, seem to affect decision-making by the enterprises, but their importance as predictors of action and behavioural intentions needs to be studied more thoroughly. Additionally, more information is required regarding the role of the surrounding social environment as a co-creator of these kinds of values. However, the study supports previous studies on entrepreneurship and its influence on survival and resilience.

AB  - Interdisciplinary, landscape-oriented studies from an archaeological viewpoint in the Low Countries mainly concentrate on cultural and economic research questions. Focal points are the physical setting of settlements and cemeteries, land use patterns and subsistence economy. As a result, the collected data are rather site-based and one-dimensional. As a counterweight, this study aims to look beyond the boundaries of settlements and cemeteries by offering a regional and diachronic perspective on the development of the landscape, vegetation and habitation of Twente (the Netherlands) since the Late Glacial. A detailed search for existing pollen data yielded 125 sites containing information from a wide variety of sampling contexts. A series of six evidence-based regional vegetation maps have been constructed by analysing relations between pollen data, soil data and topography. The maps serve as first-stage generalised models that predict regional trends, allow subsequent testing and place site-specific archaeological data in a wider context. The method developed is applicable to other regions. A comparison with contemporary habitation patterns, based on archaeological and historical data, reveals spatio-temporal trends in human influence on vegetation and in physical factors influencing site location. Five maps have been `translated' into artist impressions.

AB  - The last decades have seen the emergence of the settings approach in Health Promotion one example is the Healthy City initiative which was launched by European division of WHO in 1990. In 2003, four Swedish municipalities accordingly signed a contract on a Partnership for Sustainable Welfare Development. One of the objectives was to promote participation, influence, and health at a neighbourhood level by focusing on one housing area in each municipality. These housing areas constitute the setting of this study. The purpose is to examine the implementation structures in the municipalities, and how variations in the implementation structure affect differences in integration of community participation. A triangulation of methods was used in building up a case study database: semi-structured key informant interviews with 29 stakeholders in the municipalities; examination of solicited and unsolicited documents; and participatory observations which included repeated visits to the neighbourhoods. The results show that the greater the visibility of community participation policy is in the implementation structure the greater is the integration of community participation in the neighbourhood renewal work. Two explanatory factors have been identified. The first is that making the community participation policy visible in the implementation structure results in more appropriate strategies for mobilizing the community in the neighbourhood renewal work. The second is that the municipal governing of the neighbourhood renewal allows more space for community participation when the policy is visible in the implementation structure.

AB  - The surface of the Earth is increasingly dominated by human-modified ecosystems, and many wildlife species are adapting to live within agricultural landscapes. Crops offer a predictable and nutritious food source that may become an integral part of the diet of some wildlife species. Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) are closely associated with forests and wetlands, but recolonizing their previous range following centuries of persecution, they settle into a highly anthropogenic landscape. We investigated spatial patterns of beaver foraging on cereals in southeastern-Norway, 2019 and 2020, as well as beaver movements in crop fields using GPS tags, 2010-2021. Beavers foraged mostly on wheat (Triticum aestivum), followed by oats (Avena sativa), barley (Hordeum sativum), and rye (Secale cereale). The probability that a beaver would forage on cereals decreased with the width of the forested buffer zone, and with increasing elevational gain from water. The extent of foraging increased while cereal plants ripened in early fall, and beavers removed larger areas when foraging further away from water. The extent of foraging varied among beaver territories, but we could not identify the cause of these differences. However, we found that beavers that moved extensively in crop fields also displayed an improved body condition. During late summer to early fall, cereals might provide a supplementary food source for this generalist and opportunistic species. As wildlife populations settle into agricultural land, crops might become a vital part of their diet, which requires research attention to reduce conflicts and improve our understanding of wildlife foraging ecology within anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - Although Torsten Hagerstrand is not known primarily as a landscape geographer, he made significant contributions to the understanding of landscape in Swedish geography. This paper argues that H Hagerstrand examincd the importance of representation for the understanding of landscapeas place and territory, which is a key ingredient in current engagements with landscape within (Nordic) geography and the broader European political context. The current debate on landscape, however. reaches beyond Hagerstrand's rather "scientistic" approach and brings out a stronger sense of the Cultural, social and political powers conveyed by landscape and representation. We show that this is made explicit in recent scholarly work on the so-called Substantive landscape. The paper also provides an introduction to the essays of this theine issue, which reflects a selection of the landscape research presented at the Inaugural Meeting of Nordic Geographers at Lund, Sweden, in May 2005.

AB  - "El Cachucho" Marine Protected Area (MPA), which comprises Le Danois Bank and its intraslope basin, was included during 2008 in the Nature 2000 network mainly because of the presence of the habitat "1170 Reefs" according to the EU Habitat Directive. To review the effectiveness of existing management measures, several activities aimed at characterizing the most structurally complex hard-bottom habitats were planned and carried out during the ESMAREC 0514 survey. For identification of these habitats, several transects using the photogrammetric towed sled Politolana were carried out on Le Danois Bank, in the depth range between 427 and 1379 m, searching for the sea beds with higher values of slope and backscatter. Photogrammetric techniques were used for image scaling, so we could determine the surface areas of different substrata types (fades) and their species densities. A total area of 28,762 m(2) was analyzed in the still images of 23 transects, verifying that 85% of the substrata of our study area are occupied by 4 different facies: Bedrock, bedrock with mixed sediments, mixed sediments with pebbles and boulders, and mixed sediments. Acoustic data and ground-truth visual data were combined to evaluate distinctive benthic scenarios. The relative abundances of the 123 epibenthic species identified by image analyses show that the most abundant are sponges (29%), cnidarians (26%), crustaceans (26%) and echinoderms (14%), i.e. mostly sessile species or those with low mobility. The keystone species of the "1170 Reefs" habitat are 3 cnidarians: Callogorgia verticiilata, Parcunuricea cf. placomus and Dendrophyllia cornigera, and 3 sponges, Asconema setubalense, Geodia msp.1 and Phakellia robusta. Eight new habitats (biotopes) have been identified on Le Danois Bank, six of which occur on the hard bottoms, with depth, substratum, BPI (Bathymetric Position Index) and slope as determining environmental variables that explain their spatial distributions.

AB  - One of the main objectives of sustainable forestry policies is to phase out, if possible, the use of chemical agents in forestry. The saprotrophic fungus Phlebiopsis gigantea has for several years been used as a biocontrol agent against the pathogen Heterobasidion annosum sensu lato. This pathogen is the major cause of root rot disease in conifers that results in economic losses estimated at 50 million euros to Finnish forestry industry annually. A major problem is that, although the effectiveness of P. gigantea as a bin-control agent has empirically been shown, the long term biological effect of this fungus on conifer trees as well as on other wood microflora has not been empirically proven. We investigated the impact of P. gigantea treatment on stump mycobiota using 454-pyrosequencing approach as this has not done before. Samples from forest sites pre-treated with P. gigantea for I, 6 and 13 years ago were collected, DNA was isolated and the ITS regions were pyrosequenced. Similarly samples were also collected from untreated stumps within the same forest site over the same period of time. A total of 53,117 fungal sequences were generated by 454-pyrosequencing from 18 wood samples. After data cleaning we had 26,127 sequences representing 49% of the original sequences. Possible impact of the treatment on fungal communities in different study sites was analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Also diversity indexes and similarity indexes between controls and treated stumps were calculated. Biocontrol P. gigantea represented 0.43% of all fungal sequences and was found only from stumps after one year post-treatment. The pathogen H. annosum s.l. was not observed in this study. Numbers of different OTUs were always higher in the control stumps. However there was no statistical difference noted between treated and non-treated stumps. Based on our results we can conclude that stump treatment should continue as there is no obvious adverse effect on the other stump mycobiota. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Numbers of European hares Lepus europaeus have declined throughout Europe due to agricultural intensification. However, hares are more common in intensive arable areas than in pastural areas. To identify factors limiting populations, functional explanations for differences in density of hares were sought. We compared demography (litter size, prenatal mortality and participation in breeding by females), body condition (urinary and serum nitrogen, kidney fat, bone marrow fat, skeletal size and body weight), and dietary quality of hares from parts of England and Wales where they are present at relatively high densities (arable habitats) and at relatively low densities (pastural habitats). In pastural areas a lower proportion of adult females were lactating in late winter than in arable areas. Recruitment was therefore lower in pastural than in arable habitats. Hares from pastural areas were smaller, lighter and had less fat than those from arable areas, but dietary quality was similar. Thus hares in low-density populations from pastural areas were able to obtain a good-quality diet, but expended more energy and were unable to maintain body condition as well as those from arable areas. Pastural habitat, which in England and Wales is relatively warm and wet, is suboptimal for hares. The reduced recruitment and chance of survival of hares in the pastural habitats we describe may explain the differences in density of hares in arable and pastural habitats. Efforts to conserve the hare should focus on the reduction of predation and exposure to unfavourable weather by the provision of year-round vegetative cover (such as fallow land, rough grassland and shelterbelts), to increase the chances of survival of leverets and adult hares.

AB  - Atmospheric deposition is the most important pathway by which Hg reaches marine ecosystems, where it can be methylated and enter the base of food chain. The deposition, transport and chemical interactions of atmospheric Hg have been simulated over Europe for the year 2013 in the framework of the Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project, performing 14 different model sensitivity tests using two high-resolution three-dimensional chemical transport models (CTMs), varying the anthropogenic emission datasets, atmospheric Br input fields, Hg oxidation schemes and modelling domain boundary condition input. Sensitivity simulation results were compared with observations from 28 monitoring sites in Europe to assess model performance and particularly to analyse the influence of anthropogenic emission speciation and the Hg-(g)(0) atmospheric oxidation mechanism. The contribution of anthropogenic Hg emissions, their speciation and vertical distribution are crucial to the simulated concentration and deposition fields, as is also the choice of Hg-(g)(0) oxidation pathway. The areas most sensitive to changes in Hg emission speciation and the emission vertical distribution are those near major sources, but also the Aegean and the Black seas, the English Channel, the Skagerrak Strait and the northern German coast. Considerable influence was found also evident over the Mediterranean, the North Sea and Baltic Sea and some influence is seen over continental Europe, while this difference is least over the north-western part of the modelling domain, which includes the Norwegian Sea and Iceland. The Br oxidation pathway produces more Hg-(g)(II) in the lower model levels, but overall wet deposition is lower in comparison to the simulations which employ an O-3/OH oxidation mechanism. The necessity to perform continuous measurements of speciated Hg and to investigate the local impacts of Hg emissions and deposition, as well as interactions dependent on land use and vegetation, forests, peat bogs, etc., is highlighted in this study.

AB  - Education for urban, regional and spatial planning has become a regular subject throughout most European nations; this can be attributed in part to European policies promoting planning and spatially balanced development, but also to the recognition that planning can support sustainability. Nevertheless, there is lingering and justifiable concern about the status, profile and recognition of planning as a profession in its own right with the result that planning and planning education remain contested territories in academia. Conceptions of planning differ between countries and over time. The array of different planning cultures and associated educational models and pedagogies that traditionally have coexisted in Europe mean that education for planning can be either very visible or leading a shadow existence being embedded in programmes of other disciplines. While planning education provision customarily has been shaped by changes in planning practice paradigms and the profession, in 21st century Europe the provision is also influenced by European integration policies, the Bologna process and powerful transformations affecting the higher education sector writ large.
   This review seeks to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics at work, which to date have been only partially explored in the literature, by taking stock of the current state-of-play of planning education provision in Europe. Aside from examining the factors influencing planning education in Europe, an inventory of planning education programmes available throughout the member states of the Council of Europe was developed to quantify the provision as a critical first step. Figures indicate a substantial increase in the number of programmes when compared to limited historical data. Data also suggest an underdeveloped provision for education in planning in about ten per cent of European countries. Country case studies with historically differing planning cultures and education provision, i.e., Spain, Portugal, Finland, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and Switzerland are used to compare and explore trends and developments (e.g., in respect to programme structure, curriculum content and focus, professional conceptions, specialisms) in detail. Findings demonstrate, both, an enduring power of national preferences and traditions but also some emerging commonalities. Overall a picture of increasing pluralism and diversity of education models transpires in the aftermath of Bologna which may contravene efforts to establish cross-national professional recognition and standards. Education for planning seems to embrace trends to provide increasingly international learning experiences and degrees while the provision of flexible recognised (online) degree programmes remains sparse. Recommendations for future actions and strategies to further develop and strengthen the field which is at present complex and little coordinated conclude the contribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the past 50 years, wet stormwater ponds have been constructed to reduce negative environmental impacts of urban stormwater discharges on receiving aquatic environments. However, in many jurisdictions there is little information on the current operational status of such ponds and their functioning. This paucity of information prompted a field survey of 25 Swedish municipal stormwater ponds, aged between 3 and 26 years. The pond survey focused on estimating the pond hydraulic loading and efficiency, the state of littoral vegetation, characteristics of bottom sediment in the inlet and outlet zones (sizes and the chemistry), and the overall operational pond status, including the access for maintenance. The hydraulic efficiencies of ponds were estimated for pond footprint shapes and relative locations of the inlets and outlets using literature data. The estimated hydraulic efficiencies correlated well with the pond length-to-width ratios and the ratio of the pond surface area to the impervious area of the runoff contributing catchment (i.e., the hydraulic loading). Littoral vegetation was inspected visually and found to be overgrown at some facilities, which impeded the maintenance access. Benthic sediments in ponds contained silt and clay (< 63 mu m), sand and gravel fractions, and when compared with the literature data, such sediments appeared relatively coarse. Chemical characteristics of sediments reflected anthropogenic (traffic) activities, but without excessive contamination warranting special disposal requirements. Of the 25 ponds surveyed, four were fenced off and inaccessible to machinery. In fact, the design of these four ponds was such that it made inspection and maintenance very difficult, which may pose potential risks to ponds operation. Fifty-four percent of the investigated ponds were in need of minor maintenance, primarily because of sediment and litter accumulation in their inflow and outflow sections. The fact that the inspection survey revealed relatively few minor issues that could be corrected easily demonstrates the importance of relatively simple regular inspections serving to detect minor problems at an early stage before they would seriously impact pond functioning. The above survey methodology should be helpful for developing similar low-cost surveys in other jurisdictions. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - We estimated the ecological footprint of cities in Baltic Europe and globally. The 29 largest cities of Baltic Europe appropriate for their resource consumption and waste assimilation an area of forest, agricultural, marine, and wetland ecosystems that is at least 565-1130 times larger than the area of the cities themselves. Of the global human population, 20% (1.1 billion), living in 744 large cities worldwide, appropriate for their seafood consumption as much as 25% of the globally available area of productive marine ecosystems. The same cities' appropriation of forests for assimilation of CO2 emissions exceeds the full sink capacity of the world's forests by more than 10%. If the goal as emphasized at the UN Habitat II Conference, 1996, is sustainable human settlements, the increasingly limited capacity of ecosystems to sustain urban areas has to be explicitly accounted for in city planning and development.

AB  - Due to the reduction of cattle farming, the Finnish agricultural sector currently needs solutions to replace animal manure with new sustainable alternatives. This problem is especially acute for organic farms, which need livestock manure to improve soil fertility and soil organic carbon (SOC) to sustain yield. On the other side, plywood manufacturers aim to find ways to reuse waste fractions such as sandy, wet spruce bark waste. To address both issues, a new soil conditioner was developed from crushed bark (CB) and approved for organic farming by the Finnish Food Authority.
   To test the advantages of CB in organic wheat production, we conducted a two-year field experiment on a farmer's field in Mikkeli (Finland) on loamy sand with moderate soil fertility (C 3.5%. C/N ratio 17, pH 6.2). CB (organic matter 80%, C/N ratio 78, pH 5.7-6.0) at 40 t ha(-1) was applied either in the first year of the experiment or in both years. In addition to CB, half the plots received base ash (4 t ha(-1)) obtained from a power plant using wood to maintain the optimal soil pH. All plots were fertilised annually with commercial organic fertilisers. The control plots received no CB or base ash.
   A one-year application of CB with base ash statistically significantly increased the grain yield by 800 kg ha(-1) and grain N uptake by about 10 kg ha(-1) in the following growing season compared with the control. In terms of grain yield quality, a one-year application of CB with or without base ash already showed an improvement of 1000 seed weight by 2 g in the first year, and the effect was even more pronounced in the second year of the experiment. Hectolitre weight was increased in the following year after application of CB with base ash. In contrast, a two-year application of CB either alone or with base ash caused no changes in grain yield, N uptake, or yield quality compared with the control.
   The results indicate that the use of spruce CB with a high C/N ratio as soil conditioner in a large amount may be beneficial in terms of yield and quality when it is applied only once, but not twice in successive years. Future studies need to focus on the long-term residual effects of CB on productivity, as well as soil parameters such as SOC, cation exchange capacity, and soil microbial activity.

AB  - Raised bogs are wetland ecosystems which, under the right climatic conditions, feature patterns of pool hollows and hummock ridges. The relative cover and the spatial arrangement of pool and ridge microforms are thought to be influential on peatland atmosphere carbon gas fluxes and plant biodiversity. The mechanisms responsible for the formation and maintenance of pools, and the stability of these features in response to warming climates, remain topics of ongoing research. We employed historical aerial imagery, combined with a contemporary uncrewed aerial vehicle survey, to study 61 years of changes in pools at a patterned raised bog in central Sweden. We used a pool inheritance method to track individual pools between image acquisition dates throughout the time series. These data show a rapid loss of open-water pool area during the study period, primarily due to overgrowth of open-water pools by Sphagnum. We postulate that these changes are driven by ongoing climate warming that is accelerating Sphagnum colonisation. Open-water pool area declined by 26.8% during the study period, equivalent to a loss of 1001 m(2) y(-1) across the 150-hectare site. This is contradictory to an existing theory that states pools are highly stable, once formed, and can only convert to a terrestrial state through catastrophic drainage. The pool inheritance analysis shows that smaller pools are liable to become completely terrestrialised and expire. Our findings form part of a growing body of evidence for the loss of open-water habitats in peatlands across the boreal and elsewhere.

AB  - Throughout the history of humankind, people have settled along seashores. The gradual accumulation of population and industrial activity in coastal areas has created preconditions for coastalisation - the movement of people and socio-economic activity to marine coasts. To date, coastal areas have a higher rate of economic development, fostering migration and an influx of capital across the globe. Scholars and policymakers voice concerns about the asymmetry of regional development and the increasing anthropogenic impact on the coastal ecosystem. It reinforces the importance of coastal zone management. In this study, we use an example of the Baltic region to identify the coastalisation patterns in the Baltic region and answer the question, whether there can be a single defi- nition of the coastal zone of the Baltic region. According to a broad definition, the Baltic macro-region is nearly all coastal and, consequently, all settlements are influenced by the coastalisation effect. We have studied urban population dynamics in 128 cities of 45 coastal regions through the lens of various characteristics of a coastal city - the distance from the sea (10, 50, 100, and 150 km), location in a coastal region (NUTS 2), availability of a port and its primary maritime activity (tankers, cargo, fishing, passenger, recreation- al vessels and others). The research results suggest that despite the strong coherence of the Baltic region countries, there should not be a single delimitation approach to defining the coastal zone. Overall, the most active marine economic processes occur in the zone up to 10 km from the seacoast and 30 km from ports and port infrastructure. However, in the case of Sweden, Poland, and Latvia, the coastal zone can be extended to 50 km, and in Germany - up to 150 km inland.

AB  - Although proximity by densification is a leading strategy to promote sustainable mobility, knowledge of the gendered and situated use of proximity is scarce. This study explores how women and men use nearby amenities in urban environments varying in amenity concentration. We use survey data from cities in western Sweden to analyse how amenity density, socioeconomic factors, and attitudinal factors affect women's and men's choices of activity location, and to explore the motives underlying these choices. Applying a time-geographic understanding of the role of proximity in everyday life, we consider two activities situated in different time-space contexts: grocery shopping and leisure activities. Results indicate that the roles of gender and density vary. The choice of regular grocery store appears gendered to only a limited extent: women and men choose a regular grocery store within a similar distance from home; distances are affected by similar factors; and actual choice is motivated by similar reasons. Density promotes proximate use among both women and men. High economic status, habitual car use, and being foreign born induce women and men to travel farther. For women, environmental concern is associated with reduced travel distances, while experiencing time pressure in everyday life is associated with greater distances. Distinct gender differences are found in chosen leisure activities: men engage in regular leisure activities farther from home than women do, and women's local choices are affected by amenity density while no such association is found among men. Men more seldom cite time-constraint and mode-access reasons for their choice of leisure activity location. Location choices are generally made primarily with regard to quality of service rather than, for example, the possibility of walking or biking. We conclude that proximity is important for both women and men, but that its role varies with activity and gender, reflecting the dynamic relationship between proximity, inherent qualities of the activity, and individual values and conditions. Swedish women, to a larger degree than men, experience limitations regarding access to the city. Policy and planning to promote proximity should consider the gendered contexts of everyday activities and the heterogeneity among women and men regarding needs and desires for and constraints on local living.

AB  - 1. A large population increase of the Svalbard-breeding pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus over recent decades has intensified the conflict with agriculture at the spring-staging sites in Norway. Knowledge of the yield loss caused by goose grazing in these northern areas is lacking, and the motivation behind the study was to quantify a relationship between grazing pressure and yield loss of agricultural grasslands and corresponding changes in vegetation composition.
   2. Field trials were established on agricultural grasslands at four sites in central Norway. Eight plots were established at each site; four with exclosures to exclude or reduce grazing from geese and four with access for the geese. The exact same plots were followed for 2-4years. Dropping density, used as a measure of grazing pressure, and compressed sward height were recorded throughout the goose staging periods, and dry matter yield was determined at first and second harvests. Plant samples from first harvests were analysed for vegetation composition.
   3. Grazing pressure varied between both years and sites. Exclosures reduced grazing pressure by 75-78% during high-pressure grazing periods and increased first harvest yields by up to 31%. At lower grazing pressure, exclosures prevented grazing completely. Grazing pressure was inversely correlated with dry matter yield at first harvest, but second harvest yields were unaffected.
   4. The fraction of sown species declined while the fraction of weeds increased during the study both in open plots and exclosures, but level of grazing pressure did not have any significant influence on the overall fraction of sown species, or in any specific year.
   5. Synthesis and applications. As the same plots were measured over several years, it was possible to quantify goose-grazing effects beyond one season. In the context of the wildlife-agriculture conflict, the results demonstrate that some farmers always suffer disproportionately with yearly variations. The relationship between grazing pressure and yield loss may provide knowledge to a regional goose grazing subsidy scheme in the study area, identifying the most affected areas and distributing the subsidies correspondingly. However, the seasonal variations in grazing pressure demonstrate the difficulty of targeting exact areas on a yearly basis. On the other hand, the observed variations may promote another management tool in the form of delayed ploughing of stubble fields before spring sowing, as stubble fields may attract more geese, reducing the grazing pressure on agricultural grasslands and hence the overall conflicts with agricultural interests.

AB  - Annual nitrogen leaching losses from arable land in south Sweden usually amount to 15-45 kg ha(-1). The objective of this three-year study was to investigate the timing effect of mouldboard ploughing (early autumn, late autumn or spring) on soil mineral nitrogen content and nitrate leaching in a cropping system with spring-sown small grain crops (barley, oats and wheat). Late autumn ploughing was studied with and without perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a catch crop, and with and without preceding stubble cultivation. The effects of removal compared to incorporation of straw were also studied. Soil mineral nitrogen in the 0-90 cm layer was determined on 4-5 occasions each year, Nitrate was determined in soil water sampled with ceramic suction cups at 60 and 90 cm, Total nitrogen in above-ground catch crops, weeds and volunteer plants was determined at ripeness of the main crop and before tillage operations. Time of tillage, as opposed to catch crop or crop residue management, influenced nitrogen leaching. After early tillage, soil mineral nitrogen increased during autumn, In November, the nitrogen content was on an average 68 kg N ha(-1) in 0-90 cm in early ploughed soil and 39 kg N ha(-1) when ploughing was delayed to spring. Also nitrate leaching was greater in treatments with early than with late tillage. This was probably because of increased nitrogen mineralization, However, when tillage was delayed there was also a substantial growth of weeds and volunteer plants during autumn, particularly couch-grass (Elymus repens L.), This caused grain yield to decrease by up to 40% when tillage operations were delayed until late autumn or spring. Delaying tillage operations to late autumn or spring seems to be necessary to reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching. Swedish regulations for farmers to control nitrogen losses have been changed as a consequence of these results. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geoscience is relevant to issues in sustainability in many ways, for example through the aspects of earth sciences connected to the environment, climate, geohazards, energy and natural resources. There is also significant support for the use of active fieldwork experience as an effective way to teach sustainability in earth science. Some of the best sites for exploring sustainability issues in geoscience are those designated for special attention, such as geoparks, geosites, nature reserves and World Heritage Sites. Former mining areas are another type of useful locality to teach about sustainability in geosciences, as these sites usually present ample evidence of severe mining impacts on the environment and people through time. Historical mining activities can present typical examples of non-sustainable ways of working alongside modern remediation projects to manage severe environmental problems. Here, the Great Copper Mountain in Falun, central Sweden, is presented as an example of a "suitable field study site" for teaching sustainability in geoscience. This site is a former mining area, today museum and visiting resort and a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site. Mining and human activities have had a severe impact on this landscape for up to 1000 years. As a result, it is an example of a historical non-sustainable activity that is now the site of active and developed remediation work that aims for a sustainable future for both environment and people. The Falun site presents themes useful for teaching both geoscience and sustainability, and it is presented in order to demonstrate the advantages of using a site like this for teaching sustainability in earth science.

AB  - Bud-break is an environmentally and economically important trait in trees, shrubs and vines from temperate latitudes. Poor synchronization of bud-break timing with local climates can lead to frost injuries, susceptibility to pests and pathogens and poor crop yields in fruit trees and vines. The rapid climate changes outpace the adaptive capacities of plants to respond through natural selection. This is particularly true for trees which have long generation cycle and thus the adaptive changes are significantly delayed. Therefore, to devise appropriate breeding and conservation strategies, it is imperative to understand the molecular underpinnings that govern dormancy mechanisms. We have recently identified and characterized the poplar EARLY BUD-BREAK 1 (EBB1) gene. EBB1 is a positive regulator of bud-break and encodes a transcription factor from the AP2/ERF family. Here, using comparative and functional genomics approaches we show that EBB1 function in regulation of bud-break is likely conserved across wide range of woody perennial species with importance to forestry and agriculture.

AB  - Electric vehicles are considered the most promising alternative to internal combustion engine vehicles towards a cleaner transportation sector. Having null tailpipe emissions, electric vehicles contribute to fight localized pollution, which is particularly important in overpopulated urban areas. However, the electric vehicle implies greenhouse gas emissions related to its production and to the electricity generation needed to charge its batteries. This study focuses the analysis on how the electric vehicle emissions vary when compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, depending on the electric power plant fleet and the efficiency during the use-phase. For this to be done, the Global Warming Potential (GWP) associated to the electricity generation on the electric vehicle most selling European countries are calculated. Similarly, electric vehicle's use-phase energy efficiency is calculated under a wide range of driving conditions using the Monte Carlo method. The results from energy production and energy use phases are compared to the GWP calculated for internal combustion engine vehicles for six different driving cycles, to obtain the threshold values for which electric vehicles provide GWP reduction. These threshold values are then matched with the current electricity power plant fleet and the electric vehicle promotion incentives of the European countries considered in the study, showing that some countries (e.g. France or Norway) are better-suited for electric vehicles adoption, while countries like Spain or Portugal should boost electric vehicle promotion policies. Furthermore, other countries in Europe, such as Germany or the UK that are doing an effort on decarbonizing their power plant fleet, do not offer immediate greenhouse gas emission reductions for the uptake of electric vehicles instead of conventional cars.

AB  - As constituted today, the transport sector is not sustainable in the long-term. It is based almost entirely on non-replenishable natural resources which, when combusted, release emissions that can cause serious harm to human beings, animals and the natural environment. Therefore, in order to achieve a sustainable transport system, it is imperative to achieve a means of propulsion, which is based on renewable energy sources in every phase of production and distribution. The responsibility for developing such a sustainable transport system is an assignment, which must be approached as a common cause, involving both the official agencies of society and the business sector together with international cooperation. In 1991 the Swedish Government allocated 120 million Swedish crowns to the Swedish Transport and Communications Research Board (KFB) as funds for research, development and demonstration in the field of biofuels to be used in the transportation sector. In order to fulfil this obligation a program was presented and approved and this program for engine alcohols and biogas was carried out between the summer of 1991 and the end of 1997. The program has generated a broad spectrum of useful results showing that, in general terms, there are a number of technical problems connected to the use of biofuels. There is also a need to continue the development of both the fuels and the engines in order to take advantage of all that can be achieved concerning the use of biofuels in the transportation sector. The presentation at The Sixth International Highway and Urban Pollution Symposium will focus on a brief description of the program carried out and a presentation of the results of the field tests and the emission characterisation.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between national culture and individuals' psychological contracts. Predicted relationships were drawn from prior theory that identified cognitive and motivational mechanisms through which culture manifests its influence. The dominant forms of psychological contracts were evaluated against predictions based on the national-level cultural values of vertical and horizontal individualism and collectivism in four countries. Results of interviews with 57 participants indicated that French interviewees (vertical individualist) described their psychological contracts as primarily exploitive, Canadians (horizontal individualist) as primarily instrumental, Chinese (vertical collectivist) as primarily custodial and Norwegians (horizontal collectivist) as primarily communitarian. Exploration of the conditions under which patterns deviated from those predicted by the theory indicates potential areas for future theoretical development.

AB  - On the Antarctic Peninsula, lichens are the most diverse botanical component of the terrestrial ecosystem. However, detailed information on the distribution of lichens on the Antarctic Peninsula region is scarce, and the data available exhibit significant heterogeneity in sampling frequency and effort. Satellite remote sensing, in particular the use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has facilitated determination of vegetation richness and cover distribution in some remote and otherwise inaccessible environments. However, it is known that using NDVI for the detection of vegetation can overlook the presence of lichens even if their land cover is extensive. We tested the use of known spectra of lichens in a matched filtering technique for the detection and mapping of lichen-covered land from remote sensing imagery on the Antarctic Peninsula, using data on lichen presence collected by citizen scientists and other non-specialists as ground truthing. Our results confirm that the use of this approach allows for the detection of lichen flora on the Antarctic Peninsula, showing an improvement over the use of NDVI alone for the mapping of flora in this area.

AB  - Roll on-roll off (RoRo) shipping represents a maritime segment that could easily form part of an intermodal transport system, as cargo does not need to be lifted in ports; it is rolled' to and from sea. This paper investigates the operation of RoRo shipping services in Northern Europe, focusing on a set of services chartered by a major shipper whose demand has a great impact on the service design, potentially affecting the frequency of departures and even stipulating the use of specific vessels. The case of cooperation between Stora Enso, a major forest company in Sweden and Finland, and the shipping company Swedish Orient Line (SOL) is analysed, giving some insight into the way these RoRo services operate and manage to integrate successfully into sustainable intermodal transport chains. Despite various initiatives taken by different stakeholders, the level of integration of shipping in intermodal transport chains has been quite slow. This paper's results could contribute to the identification of barriers that prevent RoRo shipping from being a viable alternative to road transport for certain transport routes and assist in the discovery of policies and incentives that could lead to developing sustainable intermodal transport chains.

AB  - Purpose - In Norway the most critical effects of climate change are predicted to be increased rain and snow, higher temperatures, increased wind loads, and sea-level rise. This will increase the number of floods and landslides, along with more cycles around the freezing point and increased exposure to high moisture. The main issue for protecting Norway's historical monuments from climate change is how to be aware of and how to handle the coming problems. One challenge is to define and give this information to heritage owners and local authorities. The purpose of this paper is to describe some of the practical threats related to climate change, and provide suggestions for mitigation and adaption strategies.
   Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical information of the problem is useful at a general level, but the practical impact has to be used at a local level. Improved knowledge about the risks for deterioration at different exposure levels, thorough surveys, and practical solutions, can significantly reduce the negative effects. This knowledge must reach the people that have local and daily contact with the cultural heritage. Information to the owners and responsible authorities about the normal risk of deterioration and how to identify risks related to climate change is crucial.
   Findings - The main results of the authors' work is a methodology dealing with the problem step-by-step production of a web-site based on fact sheets for heritage owners and managers. The fact sheets are divided amongst different subjects and are designed to be informative and easy to use for owners and responsible authorities.
   Originality/value - The results presented in this paper will increase the knowledge of how owners of cultural heritage can be prepared for climate change on a practical, hands-on level. This can, for example, be done by a brief overall analysis of the threats of the cultural heritage in a specific municipality. The analysis can be summarised in a list of increased possible risks, with direct practical information given to those needing it, and placed online. This would enable detection of and reaction to warning signs of an unusual situation. Information, training and production of both general and specific plans for action in case of extreme situations are also important in order to prevent the negative effects of climate change.

AB  - Population performance is predicted to be more strongly influenced by detrimental species interactions such as predation under benign climatic conditions, and by climate forcing under harsh conditions, reflected in geographical gradients in biotic interaction strength. Less appreciated is the potential for site-specific changes in drivers with the advent of anthropogenic alteration of predator-prey relationships, including apex predator restoration and spread of invasive predators. Particularly interesting is the relative impact of climate and biotic interactions on population performance when these conflict. In this 31-year study (1990-2020), we revisit a common eider Somateria mollissima population from SW Finland, Baltic Sea, fifteen years on from an earlier study showing that climate warming positively affected reproductive parameters and performance. However, the population is simultaneously exposed to increasing predation by the rapidly recovering native apex predator and invasive mammals. Based on the current population trend, we predicted 1) a weakening of the previously documented positive effects of a warming climate on vital rates, 2) intensified predation and 3) increasing top-down control of vital rates and accompanying population decline. Five out of seven breeding parameters (annual spread in female body condition, breeding phenology and synchrony, interval between arrival and breeding, fledgling production) were best explained by predation indices, whereas climate signals (winter NAO, Baltic Sea maximum ice cover) on breeding parameters have weakened. Particularly intriguing is that the previous positive association between mild ice winters and subsequent reproductive output has disappeared during the past 15 years, highlighting the non-linear nature of climate change responses. Indirect predation effects (selective disappearance, changed reproductive strategies, nest-site selection and population age distribution) can potentially explain also the remaining breeding parameters (annual mean body condition and clutch size). The observed regime shift in predation risk appears to prevent this now endangered population from reaping the potential benefits of a warming climate.

AB  - Soil and water acidification was internationally recognised as a severe environmental problem in the late 1960s. The interest in establishing "critical loads" led to a peak in weathering research in the 1980s and 1990s, since base cation weathering is the long-term counterbalance to acidification pressure. Assessments of weathering rates and associated uncertainties have recently become an area of renewed research interest, this time due to demand for forest residues to provide renewable bioenergy. Increased demand for forest fuels increases the risk of depleting the soils of base cations produced in situ by weathering. This is the background to the research programme Quantifying Weathering Rates for Sustainable Forestry (QWARTS), which ran from 2012 to 2019. The programme involved research groups working at different scales, from laboratory experiments to modelling. The aims of this study were to (1) investigate the variation in published weathering rates of base cations from different approaches in Sweden, with consideration of the key uncertainties for each method; (2) assess the robustness of the results in relation to sustainable forestry; and (3) discuss the results in relation to new insights from the QWARTS programme and propose ways to further reduce uncertainties. In the study we found that the variation in estimated weathering rates at single-site level was large, but still most sites could be placed reliably in broader classes of weathering rates. At the regional level, the results from the different approaches were in general agreement. Comparisons with base cation losses after stem-only and whole-tree harvesting showed sites where whole-tree harvesting was clearly not sustainable and other sites where variation in weathering rates from different approaches obscured the overall balance. Clear imbalances appeared mainly after whole-tree harvesting in spruce forests in southern and central Sweden. Based on the research findings in the QWARTS programme, it was concluded that the PROFILE/ForSAFE family of models provides the most important fundamental understanding of the contribution of weathering to long-term availability of base cations to support forest growth. However, these approaches should be continually assessed against other approaches. Uncertainties in the model approaches can be further reduced, mainly by finding ways to reduce uncertainties in input data on soil texture and associated hydrological parameters but also by developing the models, e.g. to better represent biological feedbacks under the influence of climate change.

AB  - Veteran trees are keystone structures and play vital roles in ecosystems. Tree hollows, which are filled with a mix of leaves and wood that is transformed by the biotic community into wood mould, represent an important microhabitat. Tree hollow communities consist of three major groups of organisms: microbes, mesofauna (nematodes, mites and springtails) and macrofauna (beetles, millipedes and other insects). Little is known about the interplay between associated biota and their importance for decomposition and wood mould production. The aim of this study was to test how initial food web complexity in artificial tree hollows influences community structure, decomposition, and wood mould production. We used large wooden boxes to imitate natural hollows, and mounted them on 20 veteran oaks in Southern Norway. The food webs were manipulated into three levels: (i) a complex community with macrofauna and mesofauna, (ii) a simple community without macrofauna, and (iii) only the defaunated material. Three boxes (one of each treatment, N = 60 boxes) were mounted on each oak and left in the field from May 2017 to October 2019 (28 months). After the field experiment, macrofauna and mesofauna were collected and identified, mass loss in the boxes was determined, and nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the wood mould were measured. We found that the complex community treatment had the greatest diversity of beetles and the highest number of predatory macrofauna. The nematodes within the complex community treatment had greater trophic structuring with K-selected species associated with stable conditions. The nematodes communities also indicated that the complex community had a balanced decomposition pathway, while the simple community was dominated by fungi and the defaunated community by bacteria. Lastly, we found that the boxes with the complex community treatment had the highest overall rate of mass loss, and greater amounts of wood mould with higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Our results indicate that macrofauna in artificial hollows increase trophic structuring, enhance decomposition rates and wood mould production, and mediate the decomposition pathway. These findings highlight the importance of food web complexity for promoting biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in veteran tree hollows.

AB  - Due to requirements of EU Water Framework Directive, the popularity of littoral macroinvertebrate communities as indicators in quality assessment of lakes has continuously increased. However, it is not always clear what the indices actually reflect. The littoral is an area linking the lake and the adjacent terrestrial environment, and is integrating the influences from both habitats on the aquatic biota. In addition, natural and anthropogenic environmental factors cannot always be disentangled easily. Our study was based on littoral macroinvertebrate data from 296 hand net samples collected from 196 natural Estonian lowland lakes during 2000-2010. The aim was to identify relationships between relevant macroinvertebrate metrics and several natural and anthropogenic factors. Five metrics (total taxon richness, Shannon diversity H', number of EPT taxa, Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), and Swedish Acidity Index) were used. In addition, a new hydromorphological index, MESH (Macroinvertebrates in Estonia: Score of Hydromorphology) was tested against the environmental factors. First, we analysed the relationships between the metrics and factors according to Estonian lake typology. In order to estimate the effects of factors on biological quality, the effect of the lake type was thereafter eliminated. The highest number of significant relationships was found in relation to natural factors, such as diversity of vegetation types, general relative vegetation coverage, lake area and latitude. In general, the human-related factors had unexpectedly low relationships with most of the metrics. Average Score Per Taxon predictably increased with the percentage of natural land use area in the lake's catchment. However, the lake water concentration of total phosphorus - a typical indicator of eutrophication in freshwaters - did not reveal a significant relationship with any of the tested metrics. We suggest that the expected ecological relationships were obscured by a general low human stress on Estonian lakes, in combination with a high residual natural variability in the littoral.

AB  - Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon is a nutritious type of food in increasing demand and although production has stagnated and is faced by various challenges, it is likely to continue to expand in the future. We present results from a detailed greenhouse gas emission assessment of the most important Norwegian farmed salmon export products along with improvement measures. By scaling up both baseline results and reduction opportunities, based on growth projections, we estimate current and future emissions of the sector as a whole. We show that export of gutted salmon to Europe by truck dominates Norwegian salmon exports, not only in volume and value, but also in emissions, followed by export of fresh gutted salmon and fillets to Asia and fillets to the US by air. The cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are dominated by feed production followed by emissions from overseas airfreighting of fresh products. The five most important emission reduction measures, based only on existing technology and without particular order were 1) slightly increased feed efficiency, 2) increased utilization of side streams occurring in secondary processing after export, 3) seafreight to market instead of road and air, 4) higher energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, and 5) changed feed composition. Collectively, they have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of current production by 60%, from 5.2 to 2.1 million tonnes of CO2e, assuming the same relative importance of each supply chain. This implies that a medium growth-scenario, representing more than a doubling of the volume of salmon farmed to 3.3 million tonnes, would be possible while reducing total sector emissions by 16% if the improvement measures were fully implemented. For larger reductions, either lower growth or more ambitious implementation of improvement measures is needed. Although greenhouse gas emissions are often linked to resource efficiency and wider sustainability, this is not always the case, and it is important to avoid shifting burdens from climate to e.g. eutrophication or biodiversity impacts. However, many environmental impacts of salmon farming are centered around feed efficiency, and even problems with welfare, escapees, and in part eutrophication are reflected in lower feed efficiency resulting in higher greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the systematic collection of robust data for more continuous monitoring of greenhouse gas emission performance over time, we therefore recommend identifying additional indicators to monitor to ensure the sector develops not only towards climate neutrality but also towards broader sustainability.

AB  - The maturing aquaculture sector currently faces a number of challenges relating to the objectives of sustainability, conservation, equity and access to and legal protection of genetic resources. The study investigates, through interviews, how actors in the aquaculture sector perceive their options with a view to accessing aquatic genetic material and to protecting innovations in breeding. Moreover, the study analyses how corporate strategies, technological developments, and international regulatory regimes are perceived to affect these options, building also on scientific literature and other legal and policy documents. A methodology of descriptive and explorative case study within the qualitative domain is applied for this. Included are comparisons of findings from Norwegian case studies on Atlantic salmon and Atlantic cod with similar studies on marine shrimp in India and tilapia in South East Asia and Africa.
   Aquaculture is increasingly characterised by pressure toward higher production efficiency and short-term profits. Hence, actors in the aquaculture sector face emerging difficulties pertaining to affordable access to improved breeding material and technology, while also securing adequate funding for sustainable breeding programmes. Public ownership or support seems to be important measures to balance these objectives that may otherwise be hard to combine. This is particularly the case during the early phases of implementation and operation of applied aquaculture breeding programmes. An alternative model with cooperative/farmers' ownership is also worth considering in many situations, particularly after the first establishment phase. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In coastal North Norway, mire areas and mire pools frequently exist, but their development and time of origin are poorly known. In order to investigate the development of a coastal mire pool and relate its changes to known climatic changes, a sediment sequence from the mire-pool Lillevardhaugvatnet (c. 0.05 ha large), was C-14-dated, investigated for loss on ignition and analysed for pollen and botanical macrofossils.
   The bottom of the sequence dates c. 7500 cal. BP. The site gradually developed from a swamp forest c. 6200 cal. BP via a more open dwarf-shrub phase to a pool c. 5000 cal. BP. The pool grew in depth as the result of continuous peat growth damming the water body. The water level of the pool was probably lowered by erosional drain c. 2700 cal. BP. Redeposited peat in the sequence occurred c. 2100 cal. BP and c. 1100 cal. BP. C-14-dates and pollen indicate that erosion and redeposition of the peat surrounding the mire pool is a normal process, connected with the expansion of the water body.
   The combination of macrofossils and pollen accumulation rates (PAR) of R sylvestris indicates that in small lakes in coastal areas of North Norway, a PAR of 200-400 cm(-2) yr(-1) is sufficient for indicating local presence of P. sylvestris. P sylvestris is represented with abundant macrofossils between 4800 and 2100 cal. BR It is suggested that a marked R sylvestris decrease about 2100 cal. BP may be a combined effect of human impact and climatic deterioration. A possible final termination of the R sylvestris population about 1600 cal. BP may be considered human-made.

AB  - The aim of this case study was to investigate what vocational knowing was made available in subject-integrated teaching of four vocational subjects in a Swedish Health and Social Care Program (HSCP). The study was composed of two separate data collections, both ethnographic. The first data collection was performed in autumn 2012 on a theme unit called VIPS, with a group of students (16 +), in a Swedish HSCP. Data comprised observations, field notes, and audio recordings of planning and teaching of the theme unit, informal discussions with teachers and students, handouts, a theme booklet, and student assignments. The second data collection was performed during spring 2018 in which life-history interviews focused on documentation were conducted with the teachers involved in the theme unit from 2012. Data comprised audio recordings and time lines. A theoretical framework and analytical work were performed with concepts from Cultural Historical Activity Theory, and from New Literacy Studies. The results indicate that the object in the teaching activity comprised vocational knowing in three areas: psychosis, ethics, and communication, and vocational literacy. Vocational contextualization of teaching was a necessary component that made available vocational knowing that contributed to the students' professional development.

AB  - Forest inventorying and reporting at the national level have been known for about one hundred years. For more than fifty years, forestry has also been part of international reporting. The Slovenian forestry industry presently drafts two types of annual forest reports. Additionally, it participates in creating international reports on forest health and greenhouse emissions and in preparing occasional reports on forest resources, carried out within the UN/FAO and the process of Forest Europe. This research aimed to assess the differences between the Slovene forest reporting and the reporting of selected countries, with the support of content analysis. The comparison was carried out with the use of the pan-European indicators of sustainable forest management. In addition to the Slovene reports, the reports on sustainable forest management and annual forest reports of Austria, Switzerland, Finland, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Spain were selected. The analysis of contents revealed that the Slovene reporting is mostly inefficient. While the forest reports of selected countries directly support forestry, environmental, energy and wood industry policy as well as the forestry profession, the Slovene reports lack end-users. Because of insufficient information, the reports cannot be used for shaping sectoral policies, steering forest development, and carrying out international reporting.

AB  - Social sustainability has increasingly become a goal for urban policy and planning, and for local and regional developmental strategies. Neighbourhoods are a common spatial scale for studying social sustainability and there is a growing focus on social sustainability in urban neighbourhoods for both researchers and policymakers. This paper is based on a qualitative case study of a neighbourhood defined by the municipality as at-risk of negative social development in a municipality in northern Sweden. The aim is to describe the perceived threats and promoters for social sustainable development in a neighbourhood defined as at-risk, and to analyse these in relation to a perspective of spatial scale. The study is based on data from interviews with municipal representatives, local professionals and residents, representing different experiences and perspectives in the neighbourhood. Four themes illustrating threats to socially sustainable development were identified: crime, unrest and unsafety; segregation and social exclusion; reputation and stigmatisation; and low involvement in municipal processes. The promoters for socially sustainable development identified in the respondents' stories reflect four themes: strong community spirit; safety and low criminality; lively civic society and well-functioning public services. Our results show that neighbourhood social sustainability cannot be studied or acted upon without being put in a context of spatial scale and an understanding that processes occurring at a particular scale only can be adequately understood when considered in relation to other scales, i.e. the development in the neighbourhood can only be understood in relation to the development in the city and at national level. There is also a need for an awareness of how different aspects of socially sustainable development relate to each other, by strengthening or counteracting each other.

AB  - The concept of green transformation is burgeoning in the academic literature and policy discourses, yet few empirical studies investigate what the concept actually means to diverse actors, and how it manifests in practices. This paper contributes to filling that gap. Through an analysis of policy documents and interviews, we investigate how central policy actors and interest organisations in Norwegian farming, fisheries and aquaculture conceptualise and enact transformation. The analysis of the policy documents shows that the concept 'transformation' is mentioned more frequently, and a rhetoric with close connotations to green growth is increasingly applied, which may leave the impression that there is consensus concerning what the concept means and entails. The interviews however leave a more nuanced picture. Among most of the actors, transformation is interpreted in terms of green growth, while a minority of the actors argue for a deeper sustainability, pointing to planetary limits. Clearly, what transformation is and what it entails is embedded in interpretive flexibility. The concept 'transformation' is plastic enough to be applied in several different, and partly conflicting, policy discourses and arenas. We argue that transformation can be understood as a boundary object, and different actors perform different sorts of boundary work to adapt the boundary object of 'transformation' to fit their agendas. Thus, it makes more sense to think of transformation in plural - transformations - instead of a single, consensual discourse. We find that the very practices of most of the actors are not transformative in the theoretical understanding of the concept and that inadequate attention is given to potential negative sides of transformation. Consequently, both scholarly and practical discussions on how to achieve transformation should take into account that different and (partly) conflicting interpretations will continue to exist and contribute to distinguish between different degrees of sustainability and related pathways.

AB  - Automatic real-time control of traffic perturbations has recently become a central issue for many European railway infrastructure managers. The aim is to make use of mathematical algorithms to maintain the required service availability during unplanned disturbances to operations. In the literature many tools for real-time traffic control are proposed, but their effects on traffic have never been studied neither in real life nor in fully realistic simulation environments. We can mention only a few pilot tests and a unique installation in the Lotschberg Base tunnel in Switzerland, which uses a replanning framework that is generally applicable but does not consider a standard data communication format. Standardisation of railway data is instead one of the main requirements of the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) to enable traffic interoperability across different countries along the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T). Following this direction, this paper introduces one of the outputs of the European project ON-TIME: a framework for the automatic real-time management of railway traffic, designed for being standard and interoperable across different European railways. We make use of a web based Service-Oriented Architecture to ensure scalability and flexibility of application. A standard railML interface is used for the input/output data of the modules, allowing immediate applicability of the framework to any network having a railML representation. A proof-of-concept is provided where the framework is tested in a closed-loop with the simulation environment HERMES for perturbed traffic scenarios on different networks in the UK, the Netherlands and Sweden. Tests are performed for two different replanning algorithms (ROMA and RECIFE) used for the automatic detection and optimised resolution of train conflicts. The two algorithms are compared on the test case in Sweden. Results show that the design of the proposed framework is effective in managing traffic perturbations and is extendible to real-life systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Subjects: A total of 120 subjects, 48 with isolated low back pain and 72 with more widespread pain distribution were included.
   Design and Methods: The Norwegian translation of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, Hopkins Symptom Check List 25 question version and Fear Avoidance Behaviour Questionnaire were completed. The properties of the Norwegian translation of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia were explored by a Rasch analysis.
   Results: The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia fitted the Rasch model and passed the independent t-test for a unidimensional scale. The response categories for some of the items needed to be collapsed from 4 to 3 levels. Only the item "It's not really safe for a person with a condition like mine to be physically active" was significantly different in men and women.
   Conclusion: The Norwegian translation of Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia seems to reflect a unidimensional construct of kinesiophobia. The scale seemed to be quite robust across age and gender, and the response patterns to the items were similar in patients with low back pain and widespread pain distribution including low back pain.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated approach combining the optimization-based frontier model with a global multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis for food consumption in Europe. The weighted and conventional data envelopment analysis models are coupled with production and consumption-based environmental and economic footprint data obtained from the environmental footprint explorer database. Eco-efficiency assessment is carried out using multiple undesirable environmental outputs such as carbon emission, total energy consumption, land use, material use, water use, and one desirable economic output, which is the gross value-added (GVA). This assessment indicates an efficiency level of each economic activity associated with its environmental impacts and policies are made as a result of the efficiency level to propose an equilibrium between economic development and environmental impacts. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of each parameter, variability analysis between weighted and non-weighted models, and performance improvement projections are presented. Based on the results, four countries become efficient when moving from production-based accounting (PBA) to consumption-based accounting (CBA). France, United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden are efficient countries in both findings. Denmark caused the highest carbon emission from the production point of view. Germany is the largest importer in all environmental categories such as carbon emission, energy usage, material use, land use, and water use. Additionally, the weight-restricted model indicated a noticeable difference concerning the eco-efficiency scores under the PBA and CBA approach, where land use and material footprint categories were found to be the most sensitive parameters for eco-efficiency scores. The authors believe that this integrated approach will aid in decision-making and help build a composite eco-efficiency score when comparing the performance of food consumption with multiple environmental and economic metrics.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents a nationwide university collaboration project to complement regional demand for Master degree engineers. Technology industry with sufficient ability and investment in research, development and innovation is in the core of economic growth and success at both national and regional level. Higher education institutions should produce the needed new engineering professionals and serve as platforms for university-industry collaboration in research and innovation. Due to phenomena such as globalisation of industrial activities and growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, the regional development of different technology industry sectors, e.g. marine technology, telecommunications and battery technologies, can take diverting directions and change the need for skillsets of new engineers. While innovation activity of a local higher education institution can on long term provide the platform for new growth businesses, investment-heavy industries often have other drivers for the location of their activities. Establishing new degree programs, or even further, new educational institutions, contains its potential challenges, financial and in availability of qualified researchers, teachers and students. Furthermore, these efforts are not sufficiently fast to address the fairly rapid changes in the need for the workforce.
   FITech (Finnish Institute of Technology) has been a five year project to address the demand of qualified engineers in Southwestern Finland, the region with the fastest growing technology industry in the country. The project consortium contains the seven Finnish universities providing engineering education, with the budget for the 5-year project period (from 2017 to 2021) being 18 million euros, from which 70% is funded by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and the 30% is covered by the universities themselves, This paper analyzes the quantitative (e.g. master thesis elaborated in companies in the region, plans and agreements to take the collaboration forward after the funded project period) of the project. In addition to reflect upon the follow up, three new education projects (FITech ICT, FITech Energy Storage and FITech 5G), materialized from the collaboration within FITech consortium, are introduced. The discussion summarizes the detected challenges and areas for improvement to enhance the success of such systematic university collaboration at a national scale.

AB  - The Late Iron Age of northern Finland is often approached through an ethnic perspective. Archaeological sites are defined as local or foreign and, accordingly, linked to either Sami or non-Sami groups. In recent decades, the concept of transculturalism and mixing of cultural traits has been discussed by several researchers, and their work has shown that such categorizations can be questioned. Correspondingly, certain sites and artifacts found in the northern parts of Finland seem to relate to interactions and contacts instead of ethnic backgrounds. One such site was excavated at Viinivaara E in 2013 and 2014. Based on the fieldwork, the site can be linked to encounters and cultural exchange between local groups and visitors. The entangled nature of the site is understood by taking into consideration its location and landscape, but also by examining the archaeological and historical conception of Late Iron Age northern Finland in general. Further, transcultural dynamics present at the site are also tied to social development on a broader temporal and spatial scale.

AB  - With the rapid growth of the aquaculture production since the 1980s, there has been a concomitant increase in disease outbreaks. The injudicious and/or incorrect use of antimicrobial agents against diseases of farmed aquatic species poses a considerable threat to the development and growth of a successful and sustainable aquaculture industry. An increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an important consequence, resulting to the difficulty in treating common bacterial diseases in populations of aquatic organisms, combined with the presence of antibiotic residues in food fish and their products, leading to import refusals and negative impacts on international trade. To reduce the frequency of AMR, good aquaculture and effective biosecurity practices should include the prudent and responsible use of antibiotics and also consider the use of alternatives to antibiotics, in addition to disease prevention management. This article reviews the literature discussing the scope of the problem pertaining to antibiotic use, the emergence of AMR in aquaculture and to consider and discuss viable alternatives (e.g., vaccination, bacteriophages, quorum quenching, probiotics and prebiotics, chicken egg yolk antibody and medicinal plant derivative). We also discuss lessons learnt, from specific case studies such as the vaccination of farmed salmon in Norway and the use of 'specific pathogen-free' seed-as primary and essential part of a biosecurity strategy.

AB  - Old living oaks (Quercus robur) are known as a very species-rich habitat for saproxylic beetles, but it is less clear to what extent such veteran trees differ from an even rarer feature: downed trunks of large oaks. In this study, we set out to sample this habitat, using window traps, with two aims: (1) to describe the variation of assemblages among downed trunks of different type and (2) to compare beetles on downed oaks with data from veteran standing trees. The results showed that trunk volume and sun exposure better explained assemblages as well as species numbers on downed trunks than did decay stage. Furthermore, species classified as facultative saproxylic species showed weak or no differentiation among downed trunks. Species with different feeding habits showed no apparent differentiation among downed trunks. Furthermore, species composition on dead, downed oak trunks differed sharply from that of living, veteran oaks. Wood or bark feeders were more common on veterans than downed trunks, but there was no difference for those species feeding on fungi or those feeding on insects and their remains. In conclusion, for a successful conservation of the saproxylic beetle fauna it is important to keep downed oak trunks, and particularly large ones, in forest and pastures as they constitute a saproxylic habitat that differs from that of living trees.

AB  - The article analyses European cohesion from the perspective of integration policies employed by selected European states. The cases of the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Finland constituting the core of the analysis have been chosen due to Brexit (UK), rigidifying of integration practices after 2015 (Denmark) and an ad hoc approach in integration policy planning (Finland). Existing social, cultural, and political differences and similarities in Europe constitute both opportunities and challenges for European cohesion at the beginning of the 21st Century. This may considerably affect the future role of Europe in the international context as regards agency, competitiveness and innovation. The methodology applied in the study included qualitative in-depth analysis of official government documents, NGOs' publication, reports from EU institutions and statistical data provided by Eurostat. Major findings from the analysis comprise recommendation to increase integration policy effectiveness by enhanced participation of migrants (including refugees) in the labour market, altered education of civil society, and intensified supra-regional cooperation. This may strengthen European capacity as an international actor and reduce the risk of "the fate of Roman Empire" for the European Union.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias are a global challenge. Early diagnosis is important to manage the disease. However, there are barriers to diagnosis that differ by region. Researchers from Brazil, China, Nigeria, Spain, and Sweden have identified key barriers to AD diagnosis in their countries. In Brazil, socioeconomic inequalities and poor recognition of dementia by physicians can prevent diagnosis. In China, a very large population and lack of physician training in dementia make diagnosis problematic. In Nigeria, socioeconomic inequalities and cultural stigma can stand in the way of diagnosis. In Spain, patient hesitancy and an overloaded health-care system are barriers to diagnosis. In Sweden, inconsistent use of biomarkers is a prominent barrier to diagnosis of AD. To support diagnosis, more focus is needed on education of patients and physicians, increased use of support services, and improved access to biomarkers to accurately diagnose AD.

AB  - Some travellers "want to make a difference" and develop themselves while exploring the world through programmes offered by international volunteer organisations, such as the WWOOF initiative (WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms). This international network promotes organic farming and sustainable lifestyles by connecting hosts and volunteers who are willing to work for hosts in exchange for food, accommodation, and insight into organic farming. However, who are these WWOOFers? While researched mainly by qualitative studies in other countries (e.g. Australia, Hawaii, Japan, U.S.A.), this is the first cross-sectional study of WWOOFers in Europe. Data was collected by online questionnaires to WWOOFers registered at WWOOF Norway (n = 1184; response rate = 85%). These WWOOFers come from 77 countries, among which U.S.A., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands dominates. They are mainly young, well-educated, well-travelled, urban people wanting to explore rural living. Some, but not all report lifestyles and behavioural intentions in line with the WWOOF philosophy. Age and gender differences apply. Through factor analyses, the study identified seven personal characteristics, including, in descending order Empathy, Goal-orientation, Outgoing, Reserved, Recognition seeking, Child-oriented, and Egoistic-materialistic. The study expands the current insights and partly contradicting previous research.

AB  - Despite generalised global recommendations, local communities are rarely involved in defining strategic tourism development options. Similarly, methodologies to facilitate these processes of co-creation have not been adequately implemented, tested, and generalised. This study aims to contribute to this body of knowledge by assessing the potential of a participatory planning method centred on the strategic diversification of tourism products. Focusing on the Swedish island of Gotland, where tourism dynamics partly depend on the visits to the Hanseatic town of Visby by cruise ships, a workshop based on an Open Space Methodology (OSM) was implemented, involving local entrepreneurs, representatives of organisations, students, and international researchers in tourism (an original contribution). The results revealed that these "coopetition" processes can contribute to identifying problems and determining possible solutions. In our case, these options can be framed within the concept of "penetration" (modifications and increasing promotion of existing products to the existing markets) involving aspects related to physical and digital infrastructures, along with partnerships and collaborations amongst stakeholders. Overall, this study reveals that the interaction between members and non-members of the local community appears crucial for the emergence of innovative ideas.

AB  - Bog pine is an endangered species in Europe as drainage of bogs permits colonisation by Norway spruce, resulting in severe bog pine habitat loss in marginal bog forests, and a habitat shift towards the bog centre where growing conditions are extreme. Thus, we investigated the physiological causes that limit bog pine regeneration at the bog margins and growth in the centre. We measured needle nitrogen concentration, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic capacity and the morphological traits of bog pine and spruce along transects from the centre to the margin of a bog in the Black Forest, Germany. Needle nitrogen and chlorophyll contents in the bog pine increased from the centre to the margin. However, photosynthesis was independent of chlorophyll content indicating that other factors, such as light rather than nutrients, may limit regeneration of bog pine. Vitality of bog pine was highest at the edge of the bog centre. This zone appears to be a compromise between nutrient limitation and shallow water levels on the one hand, and light limitation caused by spruce on the other. Therefore, in order to conserve bog pine, it is necessary to maintain wet and open bog forests that cannot be colonised by spruce.

AB  - Urban populations typically consume large quantities of food and foods with high resource demands. To better understand the environmental support behind the food preparation and diets of a "green" urban district, this study evaluates the resource support and sustainability of three diet scenarios in Rosendal, Uppsala, Sweden using emergy synthesis. Scenario one represents actual food preparation and the average diet including meat consumption in Rosendal from Maassen (2017). Two hypothetical scenarios, a vegetarian and pescatarian diet, are examined to investigate the potential implications of different diets on environmental support and total emergy. The results show that the total emergy is lower for the vegetarian and pescatarian scenarios in comparison to the diet including meat, but the ratios and indices for all three diets are not significantly different. The ratios and indices indicate the food preparation and diet system in Rosendal is a consumer and high throughput system that is not sustainable or efficient, mainly due to strong reliance on imported and to a high degree nonrenewable inputs. The results also show that the typical resident, no matter the diet, overshoots the solar share strictly based on their food preparation and consumption alone. This indicates that the specific diet is not as significant as to where and how the food is produced, processed, packaged and delivered from farm to fork. Therefore, this study concludes that specific dietary changes may not be the main issue when considering the sustainability of food consumption in urban populations, but rather the next larger system from which the food is obtained. To improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban food preparation and diets, food should be considered from a holistic perspective that considers environmental performance and resource support in the larger scale systems from where food is sourced and food production should be integrated into urban planning policies.

AB  - The increase in large carnivore populations in a number of European countries causes numerous social conflicts and populations need to be kept at levels that are acceptable to the public. This may eventually require opening up or increasing public hunting of species like bear, wolf, wolverines and lynx as a management strategy. We surveyed a sample of 672 Norwegian hunters to examine how they judged a set of dilemmas associated with hunting carnivores versus ungulates. More than one-half of the sample would like to maintain or increase the current population sizes of the large carnivores (for wolverines: 57.5%; bears: 65.6%; wolves: 66.1%; lynx: 59.6%). A large majority of hunters (85.5%) emphasise not stressing the game over securing success in killing game, require adequate shooting skills (87.7%), linking harvest strategies to ecological principles (79.5%) rather than the level of conflict, and sustainable wildlife populations (95.1%) over optimum economic yield. Carnivore hunting is associated with a stronger preference for quotas based on science rather than local knowledge as well as paying more attention to the conflict level, compared to the judgments made for ungulate hunting. Positive attitudes toward maintaining or increasing carnivore populations are associated with a concern for animal welfare, and faith in scientific information, ecological values and sustainable wildlife populations.

AB  - High levels of gender segregation in Scandinavian labour markets have been referred to as a paradox in view of these countries' commitment to gender equality and advancements in other areas. The status of gender segregation in these welfare states is addressed here: Are they (still) the most gender segregated? What processes drive (de)segregation? Relatively fast occupational desegregation in recent years has moved Denmark, Norway and Sweden from the group of highly to moderately gender segregated labour markets, and women's share of management positions is rising. Empirical case studies selected to shed light on (de)segregation processes are discussed in relation to two presently influential theoretical theses - gender essentialism' and the welfare state paradox'. Findings suggest the existence of gender essentialist ideas, but the weakening of such ideas is likely to be a main driver of desegregation. Findings on the role of the public sector and work-family policy in segregation processes are somewhat conflicting.

AB  - Purpose - Firms that need to address growing concerns about the environmental impact of their activities could benefit from collaborating internally and externally. The purpose of this paper is to develop and empirically test a theoretical model of the effects of internal and external environmental collaboration with customers on the firm performance of logistics service providers (LSPs).
   Design/methodology/approach - Hierarchical multiple regression and generalised linear modelling are utilised to analyse 311 LSPs offering road transport services in Finland. The data set was collected from a Finnish nationwide logistics survey in 2012 and financial reports-based data.
   Findings - External environmental collaboration with customers seems to be the most effective way to improve operational and financial performance, while internal environmental collaboration does not yield similar benefits.
   Research limitations/implications - Research limitations include the concentrated geographic origin of the respondents and the exclusion of potential indirect effects of environmental collaboration on operational and financial performance through environmental performance.
   Practical implications - Managers planning to implement environmental initiatives should extend their focus from internal operations to external partners in the supply chain.
   Originality/value - This research is one of the first attempts to focus on performance outcomes with regard to the environmental activities of LSPs. The research provides quantified insights using both self-reported and financial reports-based data.

AB  - Corporate social performance in the pulp and paper industry was studied by testing a potential indicator, the acceptability of operations, divided for this purpose into technical, financial, environmental, social, cultural and political dimensions and re-grouped into financial-technical, environmental and social acceptability criteria in the empirical analysis. The basic material was gathered from four case mills and their surroundings in four countries: China, Finland, Germany and Portugal. The stakeholders in the case companies determined the priorities among the acceptability criteria by means of pairwise comparisons, after which a prioritisation function, i.e. the weights on the criteria, was estimated using regression techniques. The resulting stakeholders' valuations were compared cross-culturally and intra-culturally. Technical, financial and environmental issues were perceived as the most relevant elements of the acceptability of operations, and thus of corporate social performance. Despite the common elements identified, the present findings indicated that the concept of the acceptability of operations varies from place to place. It was obvious that national and company culture influenced the elements that were emphasised at a particular time, although all background factors could not be studied statistically in the present context. The variability in the concept of acceptability makes the definition of CSP difficult even within one branch of industry, not to mention providing a general definition for all business.

AB  - The paper presents a case study of applying crowdsourcing to library deliveries. The trial was conducted in the city of Jyvaskyla in Finland as part of the Resource Wise Communities program funded by The Finnish Innovation-Fund Sitra. The city has a population of 120 000 inhabitants and is facing the shutdown of half of the public libraries in order to adapt its economy to lowered revenues and compulsory cost savings. The assumption was that the level of service for customers not able to settle-for e-books would be lowered and/or customers would have to travel longer distances. However, a research pilot was carried out where -instead of lowering the level of service in the area books and other library media were delivered to customers' homes by utilizing a novel crowdsourced delivery service called PiggyBaggy.
   Crowdsourced delivery means that citizens deliver goods to each other along their way. Ideally, the deliveries would be made with minimal detour, along the way, thus maximizing the reduction in natural resource use and related environmental impacts from the transport. However, the transport fuel forms only one part of the overall footprint and in practice rebound effects such as drivers traveling longer distances motivated by monetary compensation, can reduce the targeted environmental improvement.
   The objective of our study was to investigate whether an existing consumer service, in this case the library public service, can adopt crowdsourced deliveries quickly from scratch, and to whether consumers participate in the deliveries in a way that has real sustainability benefits. Despite prevailing regulative challenges, the study found that existing library deliveries can be successfully crowdsourced. Each crowdsourced delivery reduced an average of 1.6 km driven by car, despite 80 per cent of the deliveries being made within less than a 5-km distance. Mobility related footprint reduction potential for Finland is also estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - European air traffic control is undergoing changes in organization and technology in order to increase efficiency in air traffic. Change processes can have a negative impact on existing safety cultures, the foundations of safety work, and on safety. This paper reports on an assessment of safety culture at one administrative and two operative units in a Swedish air traffic control setting, using questionnaire packages and interviews, and focuses on 391 questionnaire respondents. The objectives of the study were to obtain baseline data of safety culture aspects and relationships between safety culture and organizational climate before major organizational and technical changes were implemented, and to yield reference data on safety culture aspects in this transport branch. The safety culture aspects were generally perceived and judged to be good by the respondents. Relationships were identified between the organizational climate and the safety culture at the two operative units, where a higher level of Support for ideas and a lower level of Conflicts were positively related to many of the investigated safety culture aspects. The general safety culture in the air traffic control setting was found to be on a somewhat higher average score level than that found in the authors' previous studies of passenger shipping and airport ground handling.

AB  - The establishment of non-indigenous species (NIS) has become a global phenomenon and is acknowledged as one of many potential threats against biodiversity and the functioning of marine ecosystems. To support effective management there is a need to predict NIS distribution and identify areas with the highest invasion risk. In this study we have developed local species distribution models by combining observations of one of the top-tier invasive NIS, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, with high resolution maps of environmental conditions along the Baltic Sea coast of south-eastern Sweden. By applying the model with and without spatial constraints we estimate the current and potential distribution. The difference between these two maps outlines high risk areas for potential colonization, should round goby continue to spread in accordance with environmental preference in the area. We additionally highlight the significance of scale for distribution modelling by comparing the importance of local environmental conditions to variables important on a regional scale.

AB  - Wastewater application to Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) of fast growing trees (willows and poplars) is an attractive alternative to conventional forestry and water purification systems to meet the environmental and renewable energy goals set in European Union (EU). To evaluate the purification efficiency of willow vegetation filter and to describe the response of different commercial willow clones to pre-treated wastewater application, the study was carried out in experimental SRC during last three years of the first five-year-long harvest cycle. Water samples collected from the lysimeters after percolating through the vegetation filter soil (at 40 cm) indicated substantial reduction of pollutants (58% and 70% for total N and P, respectively). The purification efficiency of studied vegetation filter was sufficient to avoid groundwater pollution and meet the legislative limits of Estonian environmental legislation. Wastewater application did not reduce the average plant survival but increased the average number of shoots, plant dry weight (DW) and wood yield per area significantly. The comparison of average shoot DW of clones indicated quite stable growth pattern of different genotypes irrespective of various growing conditions. The average number of shoots of clones 83, 90, 97, Gudrun and Tora was smaller, the shoots were heavier and clones produced more wood than the rest of the studied varieties. Higher planting density or denser irrigation pipe network did not result in substantially higher wood yield. We conclude that willow SRC functioned efficiently as vegetation filter and when combined with growing more productive clones the economically viable yields should be realistic.

AB  - National destination pledges are a destination and visitor management intervention that seeks to positively influence visitor behaviour. They have been used since 2017, and the earliest and most prominent among these are the Icelandic Pledge, the Palau Pledge, New Zealand's Tiaki Promise, and the Sustainable Finland Pledge. Using semi-structured interviews with 17 destination managers and marketers, covering all aforementioned pledges, this paper demonstrates that national destination pledges are a new and innovative soft visitor management intervention. In comparison to other soft visitor management techniques, national destination pledges strategically connect with the emotions of visitors, require (often public) action from visitors, and engage visitors in a process of interpretation to build their own understanding of their role in destination management. As such, this paper outlines how these pledges offer a unique approach to destination management by engaging with demand side stakeholders (visitors).

AB  - Background: Anthelmintic treatment is the most common way of controlling nematode infections in ruminants. However, several countries have reported anthelmintic resistance (AR), representing a limitation for sustainable small ruminant production. The knowledge regarding worm control management represents a baseline to develop a guideline for preventing AR. The aim of the present study was therefore to improve our knowledge about the worm control practices in small ruminant flocks in Norway.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey regarding worm control practices was performed in small ruminant flocks in Norway. Flocks were selected from the three main areas of small ruminant farming, i.e. the coastal, inland and northern areas. A total of 825 questionnaires, comprising 587 sheep flocks (return rate of 51.3%) and 238 goat flocks (52.6%) were included.
   Results: The results indicated that visual appraisal of individual weight was the most common means of estimating the anthelmintic dose used in sheep (78.6%) and goat (85.1%) flocks. The mean yearly drenching rate in lambs and ewes were 2.5 +/- 1.7 and 1.9 +/- 1.1, respectively, whereas it was 1.0 (once a year) in goats. However, these figures were higher in sheep in the coastal area with a rate of 3.4 and 2.2 in lambs and ewes, respectively. Benzimidazoles were the predominant anthelmintic class used in sheep flocks (64.9% in 2007), whereas benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones were both equally used in dairy goat flocks. In the period of 2005-2007, 46.3% of the sheep flocks never changed the anthelmintic class. The dose and move strategy was practiced in 33.2% of the sheep flocks.
   Conclusions: The present study showed that inaccurate weight calculation gives a risk of under-dosing in over 90% of the sheep and goat flocks in Norway. Taken together with a high treatment frequency in lambs, a lack of anthelmintic class rotation and the common use of a dose-and-move strategy, a real danger for development of anthelmintic resistance (AR) seems to exist in Norwegian sheep and goat flocks. This risk seems particularly high in coastal areas where high treatment frequencies in lambs were recorded.

AB  - This study explores a systematic strategy to design appropriate bioremediation projects for marginalized regions that have the potential to contribute to sustainable development in that region. Ecological Engineering (EE) is of particular value for the development of appropriate bioremediation technology for such regions but a stricter planning tool than provided by EE itself, is also needed when the goal of the project goes beyond remediation targets. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) applies basic principles for sustainability and includes a stepwise strategic planning mechanism for their application. The inclusion of EE within the FSSD may steer soil bioremediation projects in rural areas in developing countries and sparsely populated regions in industrialized countries towards sustainability. The utility of the approach was tested on two cases of soil pollution in marginalized regions: the Chinandega region in Nicaragua (pesticide polluted agricultural soil) and a former filling station (diesel polluted residual area) in Gaddede, northern Sweden. The study demonstrates how the inclusion of the EE key concepts within the FSSD may increase the utility of EE for strategic sustainable development within the region. No difficulties in terms of conflicting suggestions were found in the proposed integrated approach; the two tools were found to contribute on different aspects to provide support to project management and decision making.

AB  - This paper investigates transition pathways using an example from the bioeconomy: salmon farming and feed development in Norway. With a Multi-Level Perspective (MLP), the analysis shows how a crucial biological input factor, feed, was gradually developed and innovated through interactions among technologies, institutions, and landscape (external) pressures, with the industry's ambitions of becoming more sustainable. The case story presents the start of salmon farming as an example of an incremental transformation pathway with gradual reorientations in the 1960s', where the shift from wet feed to dry, extruded feed was a crucial technological enabler. At the start of the 1990s, strong exogenous changes, including an economic crisis of overproduction and declines in salmon prices, led to extensive institutional changes. Shifts in ownership and the introduction of feed quotas brought a substitution pathway, whereby salmon farming became a national economic project. As production recovered, however, overfishing for feed became a concern. From the late 1990s on, the sociotechnical regime followed a reconfiguration pathway with the innovation of among others plant-based feed input. Over time, using vegetarian salmon feed has had unintended consequences, particularly environmental and social problems related to soy production. While neither technologies nor transitions in themselves are sustainable, this case exhibits a shift in transition pathways and how the salmon farming industry was able to respond to different sustainability concerns over time. Yet, as the transition to soy-based salmon feed demonstrates, this development entails only a weak sustainability with a main focus on economic sustainability, which also could be the case as new innovative feed substitutions continue to evolve. This finding is line with the critique of the bioeconomy agenda for paying insufficient attention to environmental sustainability and for failing to challenge predominant structures in society.

AB  - Electrification of the transport sector is considered as a solution to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and achieve sustainable mobility. Specifically in the case of electrification of passenger vehicles, various industrial and policy initiatives have been introduced. In this article, we present and assess three approaches - pro-technology, pro-simplicity and mix (of the aforementioned approaches) - to achieve target emission reductions in the Norwegian road transport sector. We also assess the influence of including 'Guarantee of Origin' certification for the electricity production in accounting for typical consumption electricity mix in Norway.
   Results show that for the same reductions in tail-pipe GHG emissions, pro-technology, pro-simplicity, and the mix scenario offer 22%, 29% and 28% reduction in the life cycle GHG emissions respectively, compared to the reference scenario in year 2020. However, the pro-simplicity scenario requires 25% reduction in vehicle-km driven compared to the pro-technology scenario, which provides the same passenger car mobility as in the reference case. When the GHG intensity of the electricity mix used to power EVs is corrected to account for actual consumption mix in Norway, a 13% reduction in the net GHG benefit of pro-technology scenario is observed.

AB  - Increasing the share of walking and cycling is one of the building blocks of sustainable mobility transformation. Fundamental changes are needed in society and urban structure to support the integration of walking and cycling into everyday routines. We conducted an online Delphi study with 30 walking and cycling experts during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland in the spring of 2020. The aim was to explore transport experts' views on the future and derive scenarios of walking and cycling with the broader context of the urban mobility system. The scenarios were created using a combination of cluster analysis and qualitative content analysis. In addition, a methodological elaboration of the Disaggregative Delphi analysis was introduced, systematising the analysis of qualitative data. The analysis resulted in five scenarios depicting walking and cycling in 2034: 1. Business as Usual Plus, 2. The Demise of Bus-Transport, 3. The Era of Soft Modes, 4. Public Transport Serving All, and 5. Car-dependent Lifestyles Persist. The scenario set can be used as a basis for strategic transport planning and policy as well as a more practical tool for identifying measures for walking and cycling promotion in urban areas.

AB  - This paper explores citizens' views about the welfare of farmed fish and the mental abilities of fish with a large survey data sample from Finland (n = 1,890). Although studies on attitudes towards animal welfare have been increasing, fish welfare has received only limited empirical attention, despite the rapid expansion of aquaculture sector. The results show that the welfare of farmed fish is not any great concern in the Finnish society. The analysis confirms the distinct character given to farmed fish compared to traditional farmed animals. Salmon are rated low in their mental abilities, including the capacity to feel pain, which may weaken ethical concerns for fish welfare. When analyzing the social determinants surrounding the rating of the welfare of farmed fish, it was shown that fish welfare attitudes follow general animal welfare attitudes regarding age and place of residence as fish welfare tends to be rated more negatively among younger age groups and among urban residents. However, no clear connection could be identified between gender and the rating of fish welfare, which may suggest that the distinct cultural categorization of fish diminishes the typical gender difference identified in animal attitudes. It is concluded that in order to improve awareness about fish welfare, there is a need to increase dissemination of scientific knowledge about fish and their welfare. Moreover, further research should be directed toward studying the moral positioning of fish and the distinct moral categorization they receive.

AB  - The determination of the contribution of background values in a potentially polluted soil is very important in defining the contamination extension, in particular in areas of geological complexity and long-term economic development, where mining and industry have been traditional activities and soils are showing both geogenic and anthropogenic contributions. Some approaches have been proposed for the estimation of the anthropogenic input vs. the background; in this paper we present a more robust approach.
   The proposed methodological approach includes the following steps. The first step consists of the comparison among the trace element contents in potentially polluted soils (PPS) and the reference and threshold values calculated both for the same geotectonic unit. A second stage is the calculation of the reference and threshold values for the surrounding area (LTV), natural setting, of the PPS with similar lithological characteristics. The final step is based on the analysis of the results by comparison of the PPS with LTV. On the other hand, the definition of a new pollution factor allows to grade the pollution and to classify the pollution importance.
   The protocol proposed was applied to PPS from a potentially polluted area of SW Spain. The anthropogenic vs. geogenic anomalies and the pollution grade of the three PPS were assessed, which is important to establish the priority to further actions. In addition, this study makes clear that the use of the enrichment factors to estimate the pollution of soils is not advisable. On the other hand, in this study, new areas close to the PPS were defined as potentially polluted because of the high trace element concentration.
   The methodological approach proposed can be considered as a good indicator for evaluating the geogenic vs. anthropogenic contribution in polluted soils and for classifying the pollution importance in a more robust way than the use of other previous indexes. The proposal methodology could be used also by the administration to detect other PPS in a study area, which a priori were not considered as contaminated.

AB  - Recent popular press suggests that 'binge flying' constitutes a new site of behavioural addiction. We theoretically appraise and empirically support this proposition through interviews with consumers in Norway and the United Kingdom conducted in 2009. Consistent findings from across two national contexts evidence a growing negative discourse towards frequent short-haul tourist air travel and illustrate strategies of guilt suppression and denial used to span a cognitive dissonance between the short-term personal benefits of tourism and the air travel's associated long-term consequences for climate change. Tensions between tourism consumption and changing social norms towards acceptable flying practice exemplify how this social group is beginning to (re)frame what constitutes 'excessive' holiday flying, despite concomitantly continuing their own frequent air travels.

AB  - The sustainability of the aquaculture sector depends mainly on the search for alternative sources to fishmeal and fish oil, one of which is microalgae. However, there are few feasibility studies of the microalgae process chain. This work aimed to address this gap through a TEA of microalgae (Phaeodactylum tricornutum) production. The TEA combines process modelling, engineering design and economic evaluation. As a result, different projections are obtained, yielding the breakdown of capital investment and operating costs.The study is based on pilot-scale experimental results using tubular PBR in Norway. This TEA shows that 29.48 t of biomass per ha of facility and year would be a real productivity. At PBR scales of 1 and 100 ha, microalgae could be produced for 108.26 or 44 euro /kg DW of harvested biomass respectively. Artificial light is indispensable for microalgae production in Norway, as its absence would represent a 50% lower productivity and a cost increase of 95%. Producing the final product as a powder represents a 1.20% greater cost. Not only does the production under more favourable climatic conditions (southern Spain) removes the need for artificial lights and greenhouses, but it also would imply greater productivity (39.02 t/ha/year) and a reduced cost (23.08 euro /kg DW of disrupted and dry biomass) at a scale of 100 ha.The main factor affecting CAPEX is the PBR, which range from 49.48 to 96.37% of the MEC. As for OPEX, the most critical elements vary with the projection: labour, energy, utilities, and other costs. The competitiveness of microalgae for aquaculture depends on a combination of different factors. Reducing the cost of the PBR and greenhouse, increasing the PE and widening the temperature range of the culture could reduce the cost by a further 76%.

AB  - Densification is the key intervention strategy proposed in the urban sustainability planning literature. Nevertheless, the blueprint for action is still vague, and especially so in small cities. Is, for example, the premise for and reward of densification relatively transferable between city scales? In addition, does difference in centre structures and distribution of facilities in small cities have an implication for active travel? By focusing on three Norwegian small cities, this paper addresses how built environment and attitudes influence active travel behaviour in small cities with different centre structures. Using descriptive statistics, ANOVA test and negative binomial regression on survey data, the paper finds that attitude towards active travel as well as accessibility significantly influence walk/bike trip frequency. Moreover, variation in small-city centre structure has an important implication for active travel but the effect varies between facility types.

AB  - Agroforestry is thought to be an approach that could support agriculture in the transition from a system with sustainability problems to one containing regenerative activities contributing to viable ecosystems and, therefore, sustainability solutions. A transdisciplinary and participatory action research (PAR) group that included farmers approached the development of temperate agroforestry systems in the modern agricultural setting of Sweden through practical experience on 12 farms for collective analysis. The objective was to research potential systems such as edible forest gardens, silvopasture and silvoarable systems to discuss their use and effects as well as scaling possibilities. Knowledge and experiences of challenges and solutions related to the development of agroforestry were identified at both niche and regime levels.

AB  - Adoption of environmental management systems (EMSs) based on ISO 14001 has constituted one of the most important developments in sustainable industry management in recent years. Previous research on the impact of EMSs has relied heavily on corporate representatives' subjective perception of benefits. Moreover, studies tend to focus on the systems' impact on firms' overall environmental performance, not distinguishing between the differences in different environmental aspects. This study aims to contribute knowledge about the influence of certified EMSs on industrial waste generation based on objective industrial waste data derived from mandatory annual environmental reports. The study focuses on changes in waste generation over a period of 12 years and includes both ISO 14001-certified firms (66 firms) and non-certified firms (50 firms). Consideration is given to the improvement efforts in the firms before EMS adoption. Analysis has been carried out using statistical methods for three different industrial waste parameters: hazardous waste, waste to landfill and the total amounts of waste. The results indicate that the certified EMSs have no statistically significant effect on any of the three waste parameters.

AB  - The increase in urbanization has caused a deterioration of the quality of water bodies and ecosystems such as rivers, streams and lakes. Urban hydrology, which reflects the anthropogenic impact on water balance, results in an excess of phosphorus (P) and their eutrophication in urban water bodies. Nature-based solutions (NBS) are a measure for the restorations of green areas and the mitigation of urban stormwater problems. Despite many advantages, in some specific cases (e.g., green roofs), NBS may be a source of water pollution. The way to decrease P release from NBS construction is by using P-binding mineral materials (P-BMM). The aim of the study is: (1) to assess the sorption abilities of five different P-BMMs: autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC), Filtralite (R) Nature P (FNP) (Norway), limestone, Opoka and zeolite, (2) to determinate of the equilibrium contact time with P solution, and (3) to dimension the P-BMM filter mass needed to enhance P-removal from green roof run-off before it reaches the receiver. Based on the Langmuir isotherm equation, P-BMM maximum sorption capacity (S-max) and equilibrium sorption capacity (S-max_(Eq)) follow the sequence: FNP > Opoka > AAC > zeolite > limestone. The most suitable P-BMM for filling up the filter for green roof runoff seems to be AAC. This is because it took the shortest time to achieve equilibrium (300 min) and had high S-max_(Eq) value (66.28 mg g(-1)). The mass of AAC P-BMM needed to provide the P retention from 100 m(2) of a green roof ranges from 2.4 to 11.2 kg. The P-BMM filter, with a discharge to rain garden, was proposed as a P-removal enhancing system for green roof runoff.

AB  - The potential to adapt to climate change varies depending on the crop and is considered low especially for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in Europe. Barley is the most widely cultivated crop in Finland, grown in a wide range of climatic and edaphic conditions. Access to a large and diverse assortment of locally well adapted, climate -resilient barley cultivars is the premise for successful cultivation. Barley has plenty of cultivar choices in Finland. However, cultivar switch is "a hidden process," and in this study, we therefore aimed: 1) to increase understanding of farmers' cultivar renewal process; 2) to study how yield and growing time of new cultivars have changed when farmers switched cultivars; and 3) to describe how farms with willingness to change cultivars differ from those reluctant to make a change. The renewal interval of barley cultivars is long: The cultivars grown in 2018 were usually introduced to the Official Variety Trials as early as 2008-2012. The median age difference between replaced and new cultivars was seven years. The probability of switching cultivars was systematically higher on larger farms and farms with a large cereal area. New cultivars were allocated primarily to high-yielding field parcels owned by a farmer. Farmers aspired for an increased yield potential, but this did not necessarily entail a shift to later maturity. We found strong spatial dependency in cultivar renewal if the distance between the neighboring farms was < 5 km. The direction of the change was not only toward new breeds as long as the cultivar was high yielding. When returning to an older cultivar, it was likely that the new breed did not meet the farmer's expectations, or that the growing season was exceptionally challenging.

AB  - Mosses and lichens are among the best biogenic dust collectors and these can be used in detailed studies of airborne pollutants. In this study, magnetic and chemical measurements were performed on moss bags collected from urban (Turku City) and industrial (Harjavalta City) areas of SW Finland, to study the relationship between concentration of anthropogenic magnetic particles and heavy metals. The main source of air pollution in the urban site is heavy traffic while in the industrial site it is a Cu-Ni smelter. Additionally, the representative lichen samples were selected from the urban site for detailed magnetic and chemical studies, on the basis of volume magnetic susceptibility mapping (kappa). The moss bags and lichen samples were collected near the roads and from city parks in the urban site. In the industrial site the moss bags were collected around a Cu-Ni smelter. The significant enhancement of mass magnetic susceptibility (chi) was observed near the main pollution sources (roads, Cu-Ni smelter) in both sites. A decreasing trend in chi and concentration of heavy metals with increasing distance from the pollution source was noticed in the investigated samples. Most of the examined heavy metals show a strong significant correlation with chi. Moreover, the Tomlinson pollution load index (PLI) exhibits significant correlation with the chi.
   The magnetic mineralogy of the samples from both sites is dominated by a magnetite-like phase. Thermomagnetic analysis revealed stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric magnetite in the samples collected from urban and industrial sites, respectively. Hysteresis parameters and FORCs (first-order reversal curves) of lichen samples indicate a mixture of PSD/MD (pseudo-single domain/multi-domain) magnetite as the main magnetic fraction. The angular-shaped particles prevail in the road dust of Turku city, while the iron-rich spherules are predominant in the fly ash from the Cu-Ni smelter.
   This study demonstrates that magnetic measurements of moss bags and lichens can be effectively applied to monitor the temporal and spatial distribution of heavy metals and trace the sources of anthropogenic pollutants. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article analyzes the experience of foreign countries regarding the state regulation of sustainable development of mountain areas. There are common tools of state support "countervailing" an approach in the field of regulation of socio-economic development of mountain areas in Western European countries, central and Eastern European countries (namely Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, which are tangent to the Carpathian region). The generalization of the experience of the EU states showed that such specific instruments of state policy, such as regional development agreements and a program to overcome the depression of territories that belong to the mountain areas that successfully worked in Sweden, deserve particular attention. Concerning problem areas, in particular mountainous ones, in the world practice such mechanisms of state financial support as state grants and subsidies, reduction of interest rates and tax rates for loans issued to implement regional projects, state guarantees and so on. The effectiveness of the implementation of these instruments depends essentially on the institutional and institutional mechanism that is designed to develop, implement and properly monitor. Spatial planning is a very relevant mechanism for the implementation of European mountain policy. Along with this clusterization of the economy of depressed territories, including mountainous, in the EU countries is widely used and such a mechanism of state regulation of socio-economic development of mountain areas, to reduce the inequality of their socio-economic development. The experience of the EU countries in respect of ecological and social safety of mountain areas deserves considerable attention. Therefore, the adaptation of any foreign model of the development of mountain areas should be consistent with the socio-economic strategy of Ukraine as a whole, determined by the priorities of regional policy at the state level. The approach to selecting a model should be flexible and take into account, first of all, the interests of the country regarding the social and environmental safety of the mountainous areas of the Carpathian region.

AB  - Wildlife harvest remains a conservation concern for many species and assessing patterns of harvest can provide insights on sustainability and inform management. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are harvested over a large part of their range by local people. The species has a history of unsustainable harvest that was largely rectified by an international agreement that required science-based management. The objective of our study was to examine the temporal patterns in the number of polar bears harvested, harvest sex ratios, and harvest rates from 1970 to 2018. We analyzed data from 39,049 harvested polar bears (annual mean 797 bears) collected from 1970 to 2018. Harvest varied across populations and times that reflect varying management objectives, episodic events, and changes based on new population estimates. More males than females were harvested with an overall M:F sex ratio of 1.84. Harvest varied by jurisdiction with 68.0% of bears harvested in Canada, 18.0% in Greenland, 11.8% in the USA, and 2.2% in Norway. Harvest rate was often near the 4.5% target rate. Where data allowed harvest rate estimation, the target rate was exceeded in 11 of 13 populations with 1-5 populations per year above the target since 1978. Harvest rates at times were up to 15.9% of the estimated population size suggesting rare episodes of severe over-harvest. Harvest rate was unrelated to a proxy for ecosystem productivity (area of continental shelf within each population) but was correlated with prey diversity. In the last 5-10 years, monitored populations all had harvest rates near sustainable limits, suggesting improvements in management. Polar bear harvest management has reduced the threat it once posed to the species. However, infrequent estimates of abundance, new management objectives, and climate change have raised new concerns about the effects of harvest.

AB  - Style morph frequencies in tristylous Lythrum salicaria were determined along the shore of a lake in South Sweden. The results indicated a significant deviation from equal morph frequencies, with the S morph having a lower frequency than the L morph and the M morph being intermediate but there was no tendency for the S morph to be subject to local loss more frequently than the other morphs, as would be expected if genetic drift were responsible for the deviation seen at the regional level. The linear distribution of the habitat and the presence of all three morphs even in small clusters of plants indicate extensive gene Bow with seedlings recruited from the same pool of water-dispersed genotypes. Morph-specific differences in fitness or self-fertilization may be more important than random processes in determining morph frequencies in this region and in other areas with a similar population structure.

AB  - Recently, questions about the return of the concept of Arctic agriculture in order to promote sustainable development of the northern regions and ensure food security have been raised more often. The re-involvement of previously-used and abandoned soils into agricultural usage can provide an essential contribution for the development of the Arctic regions. We conducted a comprehensive research of soils with different levels of abandonment in the central part of the Yamal Region (Russia) and compared their morphological features, chemical and physical properties, fertile qualities and the level of contamination with heavy and trace metals to background soils of the region. It has been noted that there are no evident features of cryoturbation processes in the profiles of abandoned agricultucal soils and regular changes in the redox regime, as a consequence of the presence of reductimorphic spots in the soil profiles, have been recorded. Soil organic matter (SOM) stock in the topsoil of abandoned soils is estimated as medium and has a similar level to the stocks of total organic matter in the agricultural soils of the Arctic circumpolar region (Norway, Sweden, and Finland). Statistically significant differences in the content of nutrients between abandoned and background soils were recorded which indicates stability of the soil nutritional state during different abandoned states. Particularly notable are the differences between the content of available forms of phosphorus. The (c) Nizamutdinov T et al.

Abandoned soils can be used for ground and greenhouse agriculture, these soils having a high level of fertility and are not limited for use in agriculture by the level of contamination with heavy and trace metals. According to the character of trace metal contamination, abandoned and background soils are evaluated as uncontaminated on the base of Z and I indices c geo values. Reuse of the previously abandoned soils can undoubtedly become the basis for increasing agricultural production and ensuring food security in the Yamal Region.

AB  - Species occurrences are influenced by numerous factors whose effects may be context dependent. Thus, the magnitude of the effects and their relative importance to species distributions may vary among ecosystems due to anthropogenic stressors. To investigate context dependency in factors governing microbial bioindicators, we developed species distribution models (SDMs) for epilithic stream diatom species in human-impacted and pristine sites separately. We performed SDMs using boosted regression trees for 110 stream diatom species, which were common to both data sets, in 164 human-impacted and 164 pristine sites in Finland (covering similar to 1,000 km, 60 degrees to 68 degrees N). For each species and site group, two sets of models were conducted: climate model, comprising three climatic variables, and full model, comprising the climatic and six local environmental variables. No significant difference in model performance was found between the site groups. However, climatic variables had greater importance compared with local environmental variables in pristine sites, whereas local environmental variables had greater importance in human-impacted sites as hypothesized. Water balance and conductivity were the key variables in human-impacted sites. The relative importance of climatic and local environmental variables varied among individual species, but also between the site groups. We found a clear context dependency among the variables influencing stream diatom distributions as the most important factors varied both among species and between the site groups. In human-impacted streams, species distributions were mainly governed by water chemistry, whereas in pristine streams by climate. We suggest that climatic models may be suitable in pristine ecosystems, whereas the full models comprising both climatic and local environmental variables should be used in human-impacted ecosystems.

AB  - Forty-five soil samples from the O- and C-horizons were taken in a 12,000 km(2) area on the borders of Finland, Norway and Russia. The nickel smelter at Nikel, the ore roasting plant at Zapoljarnij, both in Russia, and the iron ore mine acid processing plant at Kirkenes in Norway, are all situated within this area. Element levels and variation in both soil horizons (two different extractions of the O-horizon and two different grain size fractions of the C-horizon) are presented and discussed. No good correlation exists between element concentrations measured in the O-horizon and the parent C-horizon. Of the 30 analysed elements, 7 are clearly enriched (> 2 X) in the O-horizon, while 11 show higher concentrations (> 3 X)in the C-horizon, In Russia, near industry, a number of heavy metals (Co, Cu, Ni) show extreme enrichments in the O-horizon soils. All the anthropogenic contaminants show a marked decrease in element concentrations from the Russian nickel industry towards the west in the O-horizon samples. Chemistry of the C-horizon is very little affected by the emissions. For the O-horizon samples, a close correlation was observed between 1 M ammonium acetate- and concentrated nitric-acid extractable element concentrations. Element availability in 1 M ammonium acetate, however, differs widely from 65% (K) to less than 1% (Si, Ti). Of the heavy metals examined, Cd and Zn are most readily extractable. Copper is more strongly bound in the O-horizon than Ni or S. Interestingly, Na, K, Mg and P are less available at sites affected by emissions from industry than in background areas. Element content and variation are generally higher in the < 0.063 mm than the < 2 mm fraction of the C-horizon samples by a factor of 1.6 to 2.8. In addition, correlation between O-horizon and C-horizon chemistry is higher for the fine fraction of the C-horizon. The fine fraction of mineral soils is thus considered more appropriate for the detection of element sources and for mapping regional differences than the < 2 mm fraction. Comparison of the results of the two extractions used for the O-horizon samples and the two fractions used to analyse the C-horizon samples helps to distinguish anthropogenic from geogenic element sources.

AB  - BACKGROUNDAnimal agriculture has been criticised in terms of its sustainability from several perspectives. Ruminants such as dairy cows can transform inedible, low-quality protein in roughage and by-products from the food industry into the high-quality protein found in milk and meat. Evaluation of the protein conversion efficiency of dairy production from a sustainability and resource perspective must be based on the proportion of the animal feed edible to humans. A relevant metric is thus edible feed protein conversion ratio (eFPCR), i.e. human-edible protein output in cow's milk per unit human-edible protein input in feed. In this study, eFPCR was calculated for five regionally adapted and realistic feed rations fed to Swedish dairy cows producing different annual milk yields typical for high-yielding, intensive dairy production.
   RESULTSAll scenarios except one showed a protein efficiency ratio of >1 for human-edible protein. Thus, depending on the composition of their diet, most Swedish dairy cows can convert human-inedible protein into edible, high-value protein. However, higher milk yield led to a decrease in eFPCR, regardless of diet.
   CONCLUSIONDairy cows in high-yielding, intensive production systems such as those used in Sweden have the capacity to convert low-value inedible protein into high-value edible protein. However, a minor part of the dairy cow diet is edible for humans and this fraction must be minimised to justify dairy production. These results are in line with previous findings on protein conversion efficiency and add scientific input to the debate on sustainable food systems and sustainable diets.

AB  - Family forest ownership today is shaped by multiple values that are entwined with varying lifestyles. The challenge for forestry extension services is to adapt reasonably to these cognitive, social and cultural patterns. Focusing on a decision support perspective, the present study adds to prior knowledge on family forest owners' wishes concerning forest planning. The aim is to identify forest owners' decision-making modes, and the connections between owner backgrounds and decision support anticipation. A psychological survey tool, measuring the degree of sharing of decision-making power and desire to learn, was constructed for data collection. Data were acquired through a postal survey in 2006 from 676 family forest owners in Finland. Multivariate analysis yielded three owner groups as fusions of decision-making modes serving the pre-hypothesis: trusting realizers (53%), active learners (27%) and independent managers (20%). The results suggest differently weighted decision support services (including both written/online information and spoken communication) for these owner groups. Education, occupational status and distance to the holding showed some association with the grouping. The theoretical basis and the methodological approach may be applied in conditions where family forest owners are advised and consulted by public or private endeavours.

AB  - Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) is an alternative to the monoculture of fin fish species, in which several species are combined in the production process. This can have environmental advantages such as a lower environmental impact through nutrient cycling and natural filters; and can have economic advantages consisting of increased efficiency, product diversification and potential price premiums. In this paper, a choice experiment (CE) was conducted through an online survey in Ireland, the UK, Italy, Israel and Norway, to assess how the public makes decisions on what type of salmon or sea bream to buy based on the attributes of the product. Analysis assessed the Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for more sustainable produced seafood using a Latent Class multinomial logit modelling approach. In the experiment, an ecolabel was used to distinguish between regularly produced (monoculture) products and sustainably produced (IMTA) products. The general public in each country showed a positive attitude towards the development of such an ecolabel and towards the payment of a price premium for the more sustainably produced salmon or sea bream.

AB  - entrepreneurs are still interested in starting operations there, even though Russia is not an easy business environment. This study identifies the most significant risks in contracting in Russia. Risks were identified through expert evaluation and a risk analysis was conducted by using a risk matrix. Possible preventative measures were assessed for the identified risks. Some risks were found to be common in Russia and Finland, for example a limited number of clients, dependency on a few clients, and weak negotiating positions. A stable amount of work, i.e. the availability of stands for harvesting, was also a challenge on the both sides of border. Typical problems in Russia were breaches of contract, especially disagreements on wood measurement and payment delays, potentially causing serious economic losses. Specific to Russia were problems related to machine service and spare parts, as well as security issues. The professional skills of machine operators, as well as changing work motivation were risks in Russia. Cultural differences lead to more challenging supervision and management of staff. Among the external factors, the most challenging in Russia were unhealthy competition in the marketplace and non-transparent and the unpredictable procedures of the authorities. In Russia problems caused by seasonality are amplified by the sparse road network and longer downtime. The revealed specific features of the Russian business environment can help Finnish wood harvesting companies to plan a risk management process for operations in Russia.

AB  - Since the 1980s, aquaculture has developed rapidly around the world, outpacing all other sources of animal protein production. Chile is the largest producer in South America, with an export-driven aquaculture industry. Aquaculture development in Chile has largely focussed on three high-value species (Atlantic salmon, Rainbow trout and Chilean blue mussel). These three species accounted for over 90% of the volume and value of Chilean exports by 2014. The paper considers the role of trade and markets on Atlantic salmon production in Chile and the role of government regulators and industry to facilitate a further sustainable increase in farmed salmon output. Specifically, we address the opportunities and constraints regarding the impact of trade and markets for further industry expansion. We find that production constraints (e.g. regulation, over-production), marketing constraints (e.g. consumer perception) and environmental constraints (e.g. disease) have led to stagnating and sometimes declining production, preventing Chile from surpassing Norway and becoming the world's largest Atlantic salmon producer. The paper concludes that the signs for further growth are positive in Chile, although to date, it is noted that industry expansion has outpaced developments in infrastructure, regulation and research and development. Most significantly, the industry has been blighted with environmental problems, which has weakened market share in recent years. However, better regulatory practice in Chile in recent years has been seen as positive in international markets. We note that further development in the regulatory framework and continued aspirations to meet certification standards (e.g. Aquaculture Stewardship Council, Global Aquaculture Alliance Certification) could lead to increased market share for Chilean farmed salmon in the future.

AB  - The Bergslagen area, south-central Sweden, where large amounts of Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Au, Ag, Mo and W have been produced for several centuries, is one of the oldest mining districts in Europe. Two episodes of magmatism and ore formation can be distinguished: (1) an ''older'', Early Svecofennian phase that generated 1890-1850 Ma old calc-alkaline, continental-margin volcanic and plutonic units related to the Svecofennian orogeny; and (2) a ''younger'' phase comprising potassium-rich granitoids, which intruded over a period extending from 1825 to 1680 Ma during the final stage of, or subsequent to, the regional metamorphism and deformation related to the Svecofennian orogeny. In recent years, considerable confusion has dominated the discussion concerning the timing and setting of the Mo-W-forming granites in western Bergslagen. In this study, one of the most important intrusions of undeformed granite in western Bergslagen has been investigated in regard to geochemistry and U-Pb zircon age. The granite (Skalhojden) has a peraluminous, silica- and potassium-rich chemistry as well as a uniformly flat REE-pattern with a marked negative Eu anomaly. The U-Pb data yielded an age of 1758 +/- 8 Ma. These data show convincingly that the granite is comparable to other 1800-1680 Ma Mo-W-bearing granitoids elsewhere in the Fennoscandian Shield but are in strong conflict with hypotheses on Early Svecofennian rift-related crust- and ore-forming processes recently proposed for western Bergslagen. A revision of the models of crustal growth and ore formation in that area is suggested.

AB  - Decisions about the optimal use of coastal and marine resources must be made with high uncertainty about environmental impacts and may conflict with public percep-tion of the risk associated with current blue growth initiatives. In a discrete choice experi-ment conducted in valuation workshops in five communities in Arctic Norway, we examine public preferences for various aquaculture ex-pansion paths. Respondents prefer a smaller expansion in terms of the number of aquacul-ture sites compared with the planned expan-sion. Emphasizing scientific uncertainty re-garding the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture leads to lower resistance against the planned expansion. (JEL Q22, Q51)

AB  - Economic recessions have created challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and contributed to disruptions requiring them to be resilient. At times of economic crises, SMEs face major threats to their financial performance and ultimately to their survival. The average number of Swedish textile and clothing (T&C) firms that went bankrupt during the recent crisis (2007-09) escalated twofold compared to the average over 2000-10. Following the 1990s economic crisis nearly 12 per cent of the T&C companies went bankrupt in 1994-95. The structural industrial statistics also plummeted in these crisis years, aggravating many internal problems in SMEs as a ripple effect.
   This study concentrates on the constraints faced by Swedish textile-related SMEs, primarily during the economic crises of the past two decades (1990-93 and end 2007-09), and identifying the antecedents and their different degrees of influence on economic resilience. It also deepens the understanding of the underlying patterns in the antecedents, observed in SMEs, favouring or inhibiting resilience due to their significance or deficit, respectively.
   The paper adopts an exploratory research conducted in two phases, first through a survey and followed by a series of interviews, responded by eight Swedish T&C SMEs. Annual reports provide a detailed account of the financial performances of these firms. A conceptual resilience framework was developed earlier, based on a review of extant literature.
   Findings provide insight on how the responding firms considered resourcefulness, viz, cash flow and investment finance, relational networks and material assets, along with 'dynamic competitiveness' through strategic and operational flexibility to be key enablers of resilience and financial performance, mostly through generation of profitability, cash flow/liquidity and sales turnover. Responses also highlighted the indirect influence of the 'soft' learning and cultural aspects like attentive leadership and collectiveness on economic resilience, considered tacit and ingrained in small or medium-sized family businesses. Additional process initiatives, in particular growth and continuity strategies, were also emergent patterns to properly utilize and direct the antecedents for resilience development. These are beneficial for firms to understand the key areas, in which to invest for developing resilient business models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores to what extent organic initiatives that go beyond mainstream organic (so-called Organic 3.0) can challenge the corporate food regime and how they can push the food system towards sustainability transformations. We depart from the assumption that individual initiatives may differ in their potential to influence the corporate food regime and that this potential can be assessed by examining traits linked to reformist, progressive or radical food regime/food movement trends that they may possess. Rather than establishing a dichotomy between niche and food regime or categorizing Organic 3.0 initiatives within one of these trends, we explore the nuances in niche-regime relationships within the food system from a multi-level perspective, using the cases of two Organic 3.0 initiatives in Sweden. The results show that relations between these initiatives and the food regime share key characteristics, but also differ in important respects. While a reformist strategy facilitates niche growth, progressive and radical approaches are more likely to challenge the regime. The choice of approach in both cases involves trade-offs between growth and organic values. We conclude that one of the primary roles of Organic 3.0 initiatives may be to illustrate the viability of alternative models.

AB  - Reducing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable energy in the building sector are crucial to the mitigation of climate change. Wind power driven heat pumps have been considered as a sustainable measure to supply heat to the detached houses, especially those that even do not have access to the electricity grid. This work is to investigate the dynamic performance of a heat pump system driven by wind turbine through dynamic simulations. In order to understand the influence on the thermal comfort, which is the primary purpose of space heating, the variation of indoor temperature has been simulated in details. Results show that the wind turbine is not able to provide the electricity required by the heat pump during the heating season due to the intermittent characteristic of wind power. To improve the system performance, the influences of the capacity of wind turbine, the size of battery and the setpoint of indoor temperature were assessed. It is found that increasing the capacity of wind turbines is not necessary to reduce the loss of load probability; while on the contrary, increasing the size of battery can always reduce the loss of load probability. The setpoint temperature clearly affects the loss of load probability. A higher setpoint temperature results in a higher loss of thermal comfort probability. In addition, it is also found that the time interval used in the dynamic simulation has significant influence on the result. In order to have more accurate results, it is of great importance to choose a high resolution time step to capture the dynamic behaviour of the heat supply and its effect on the indoor temperature.

AB  - To understand colonization success of an invasive species we need to know the origin of the founders, where and when they were introduced, and how they spread from the introduction site(s) through the landscape. Admixture of different genetic lineages from multiple introductions is generally hypothesized to be beneficial to invasive species thanks to adaptive variation and heterozygosity-fitness correlations. In this study, population genetic and landscape data was gathered for Roesel's bush-cricket, Roeseliana roeselii a small bush-cricket common in central and eastern Europe that currently is expanding its range in northern Europe. We examined how colonization history and landscape structure affect the spread of the species and its population genetic structure, as a consequence of multiple introductions. Using comprehensive information of the species ecology and dispersal, together with genetic structure inferred from samples from 29 locations in central Sweden (we employed data published by Preuss et al., 2015), we found that two parapatric founding lineages have coexisted with very little gene flow during a long time span. An isolation-by-distance pattern and a decrease of genetic diversity toward marginal areas were more pronounced in the lineage situated in forest dominated landscapes. Our findings are in strong contrast to the hypothesis that different genetic lineages will admix when introduced to the same area. The presence of the separate lineages decades after introduction and without physical barriers for gene flow shows that some mechanism prevents them from admixture. One possibility is that the lineages with different genetic setups have adapted independently to local conditions and their admixture resulted in loss of locally adapted genotypes and hybrid offspring, less viable than the respective ancestral genotypes. However, an alternative post-mating reproductive barrier and hybrid breakdown phenomenon should also be considered. Our data indicate that besides landscape characteristics, human transportation of agricultural goods may play an important role for the overall spatial genetic pattern of the species in the study area by aiding the spread of the species.

AB  - Climate change is expected to lead to higher precipitation amounts and intensities causing an increase of the risk for flooding and combined sewer overflows in urban areas. To cope with these changes, water managers are requesting practical tools that can facilitate adaptive planning. This study was carried out to investigate how recent developments in downscaling techniques can be used to assess the effects of adaptive measures. A combined spatial-temporal downscaling methodology using the Statistical DownScaling Model-Decision Centric (SDSM-DC) and the Generalized Extreme Value distribution was applied to project future precipitation in the city of Bergen, Norway. A raingarden was considered a potential adaptive measure, and its performance was assessed using the RECARGA simulation tool. The benefits and limitations of using the proposed method have been demonstrated and compared to current design practices in Norway. Large differences in the raingarden's performance with respect to percentage overflow and lag-time reduction were found for varying projections. This highlights the need for working with a range of possible futures. Further, it was found that K-sat was the determining factor for peak-flow reduction and that different values of K-sat had different benefits. Engineering flexible solutions by combining measures holding different characteristics will induce robust adaptation.

AB  - Coping with hydrological extremes, floods, and droughts has been a major concern since the dawn of human civilization. Freshwater, a necessary condition of life and a raw material used in very high volumes in virtually every human activity, is becoming increasingly scarce. Water use has risen considerably in the last hundred years at a pace exceeding the population growth. Therefore, societies are increasingly vulnerable to droughts and water deficits. Although the 21st century is heralded as the age of water scarcity, flood losses continue to grow. Increasing global vulnerability results to a large extent from soaring anthropopressure: settlements in hazardous locations and adverse land use changes. Deforestation and urbanization lead to reduction of the storage volume and higher values of runoff coefficient. In more wealthy countries, it is the material flood losses that continue to grow, while the number of fatalities goes down. Advanced flood preparedness systems can save lives and reduce human suffering. In some regions of the world, long-term forecasts (e.g., ENSO) help improve the preparedness for hydrological extremes, both floods and droughts, and hopefully will even more so in the future. Scenarios for future climate indicate the possibility of sharpening the extremes and changes of their seasonality. For instance, in Western Scotland and Norway, an increase of winter floods has already been observed According to recent assessments, there is a growing risk of summer droughts in the Mediterranean region: less precipitation in summer and higher temperature will coincide, causing higher evapotranspiration and less runoff Fighting with floods and droughts has not been quite successful, Humans have to get used to the fact that extreme hydrological events are natural phenomena that will continue to occur. While doing one's best to improve the preparedness systems, it is necessary to learn to live with hydrological extremes.

AB  - Incidental social interactions such as seeing a known person while travelling are theorized to contribute to community connections and social capital. It is argued in such work that walking may be a critical factor, but the frequency of such interactions is generally unknown. For children, these community connections may increase independent travel and contribute to their well-being. Previous research out of Japan found that walking was indeed more likely to result in children seeing people in general and seeing a known person. However, it is not clear whether that is a culturally anecdotal finding, or whether similar findings would occur in different cultural and transportation contexts. Reasons why it may be anecdotal include: in most cases, all elementary school children walk to school in Japan; many trips occur at a local level and are conducted by non-motorized modes in Japan; greeting others (aisatsu) is a cultural value in Japan. This study examines whether one's transport mode relates to having incidental social interaction during their trips for children aged 10-11 in Canada (177), Japan (178), and Sweden (144). Further to previous work, the research carried out here asked the children what type of interaction occurred (spoke, waved, no interaction, or other) which would relate to building or maintaining community connections. The findings demonstrate that the results are internationally applicable and that most incidental social interactions result in a verbal communication in all three countries.

AB  - Purpose Currently, there is no consensus on how the impacts of land use on the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks would be best quantified within life cycle assessments (LCA) of agricultural products. The impacts of different decisions were tested within a model-based assessment of soil carbon changes on the life cycle global warming impact for spring wheat produced in two example regions in Finland (Southwest Finland and Northern Savonia) on mineral fields. Methods Global warming impact for spring wheat was assessed, including CO2 emissions due to the SOC change. The SOC change assessment was made with the soil carbon model Yasso07. The effects of assumptions on land use history were tested, i.e. the initialisation of the model and time horizon of the analysis (20 or 100 years) on the SOC change estimates. Other greenhouse gas emissions contributing to the global warming impact of spring wheat production were assessed using general LCA methodology taking into account the greenhouse gas emissions caused by the production of input materials and fuels, as well as direct and indirect N2O emissions from the soil due to fertilising and the decomposition of crop residues and organic matter, nitrogen leaching and volatilisation and lime application. Results and discussion The selection of the model initialisation method and timeframe remarkably affected the SOC change estimates. The global warming impact of wheat production, without accounting for SOC changes, was 0.68 and 0.89 kg CO2-eq/kg yield in Southwest Finland and Northern Savonia, respectively. The impact of SOC stock changes on the total global warming impact varied from -4 to 5% in Southwest Finland and from 5 to 21% in Northern Savonia, depending on the assumptions used to initialise the model or the timeframe applied in the analysis. Adding a cover crop as a means to increase the SOC stock removed between -67 and -26% of the total global warming impact in both regions. Conclusions It is essential that all the decisions made in the analysis are transparently reported and communicated. The choice of assumptions regarding the reference state, model initialisation and time horizon of the assessment period should be made based on the scope and goal definition of the LCA study.

AB  - Introduction: There is increasing evidence supporting the relationship between family support and patient outcomes. Therefore, involving families in the care of cardiovascular patients is expected to be beneficial for patients. The quality of the encounter with families highly depends on the attitudes of nurses towards the importance of families in patient care.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the attitudes of nurses towards family involvement in patient care and to investigate the individual contributions of demographic, professional and regional background characteristics.
   Method: A survey was distributed among cardiovascular nurses attending an international conference in Norway and a national conference in Belgium. Nurses were asked to complete a questionnaire, including the Families' Importance in Nursing Care - Nurses' Attitudes scale. The study population consisted of respondents from Belgium (n=348) and from Scandinavian countries (Norway, Sweden and Denmark; n=77).
   Results: In general, nurses viewed the family as important in care. However, attitudes towards actively inviting families to take part in patient care were less positive. Higher educational level and a main practice role in research, education or management were significantly associated with more positive attitudes. Furthermore, the attitudes of respondents living in Scandinavia were more positive as compared to the attitudes of respondents living in Belgium.
   Conclusion: Education on the importance of families and active family involvement in patient care seems to be necessary in basic, undergraduate education, but also in clinical practice. More research is necessary in order to explore the cultural and regional differences in the attitudes of nurses towards the involvement of families in patient care.

TI  - Public libraries in a changing political landscape: results from a survey on political influence and pressure on public libraries in Southern Sweden
T2  - INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL
LA  - English
CP  - 11th International Conference on Conceptions of Library and Information Science (CoLIS)
AB  - Introduction. When the definition of democracy and the meaning of a democratic society is renegotiated and reinterpreted, the mission of the public library is placed in a new context. This paper reports findings from an ongoing research project focused on library managers' and librarians' lived experiences of recent political developments in Sweden.
   Method/Analysis. Methodologically, the research project applies the perspective of institutional ethnography and combines a longitudinal survey study with interviews, focus- group interviews, and document studies. This paper reports findings from the first stage of a library manager survey.
   Results. Results indicate that the interplay between libraries and the local political level is experienced as mostly well-functioning, although notable exceptions exist, and that the correspondence between national cultural- and library policies and politics of the participating municipalities is perceived as high. However, the Library Act paragraph, stipulating that particular attention should be devoted to national minorities and persons with a native language other than Swedish, causes notable opposition between local and national political levels.
   Conclusions. Illegitimate political pressure is uncommon, but when it occurs, it is often connected to issues pursued by radical right-wing parties. The study indicates a need to further investigate the intersection of (national) policies and (local) politics.

AB  - Recent observations suggest that climate change affects the growth conditions and range of tree species distribution in Europe. This may also have a major effect on communities of different organisms associated with these tree species. We aimed to determine whether Larix sp. could provide suitable habitats to insects and lichens associated with P. abies to conserve their biodiversity under climate change. The study sites were 10 Larix sp. and 10 P. abies forest stands in Lithuania. Both living and dead trees were included. Sticky traps, bark sheets, and exit hole methods were used for the assessment of insects. Independent plots on tree stems were established for the assessment of lichens. There were 76 and 67 different insect species on dead and living P. abies, respectively, using sticky traps. Similarly, there were 64 and 68 on dead and living Larix sp., respectively. The overall community of xylophagous insects consisted of nine and eight species, which were detected using the bark sheet and exit hole methods, respectively. The bark area colonized by lichens was 34.3% on dead P. abies and 63.2% on dead Larix sp., and 40.4% on living P. abies and 78.0% on living Larix sp. Taken together, the results demonstrate that native P. abies and introduced Larix sp. support similar diversity of stem-associated insect and lichen species.

AB  - Wood is the most widely used renewable energy source in the world. However, there are competing views on how wood should be used in the future. The objective of this study is to examine conceptions related to alternative futures for the use of woodchips as an energy source in Finland. We construct futures images based on two data sources describing the views favouring the use of woodchips: thematic interviews with woodchip users and newspaper articles. The futures images are constructed based on two key themes that emerge from our data. First, the alternatives are imagined for the types of the operators using woodchips in the future, varying between small-and large-scale use. Second, the strong role of regulations, particularly at the European Union level, will be the key driver of the future use of woodchips as an energy source. The results show wide variation in the potential goals of public governance, ranging from regulations designed to strongly support the use of woodchips as an energy source to almost complete conservation of forests. Focusing on the regime level, we identify possible transition pathways illustrating how the use of woodchips could change in the future and discuss possible policy implications.

AB  - Chilean salmon aquaculture has exhibited dynamic growth since its introduction on a commercial scale in the early 1980s (IFOP, 1994). The indicators of growth show no immediate signs of abating, despite lower prices, and Chilean production now ranks second only to Norway in international production. The industry's efficiency and profitability depends primarily on two factors: optimal food utilisation to achieve a maximal rate of growth at a minimum cost and the control of mortality in the farmed fish population. The management of these factors has direct and indirect effects on the fresh water and marine environments of production sites. Many of these effects can be linked to the contamination of aquatic environments. The regulation of the industry to control these effects will determine its sustainability. This paper argues two points. The first point is that responsibility for the monitoring and regulation of the salmon aquaculture industry should lie with the state, especially in terms of environmental quality. The second point is the need to establish the degree to which intensive salmon aquaculture in Chile is sustainable at its current rate of expansion. In both cases, it is stressed that state regulation should be broader and more efficient than at present if the industry is to have a more sustainable future. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Background: Reliable information on the use of health services is important for health care planning, monitoring and policy. It is critical to assess the validity of the sources used for this purpose, including register and survey-based data. Studies on foreign-born populations' health care use have usually implemented either survey or register data. The concordance of such data among groups of different cultural background remains largely unknown. In this study, we presented an approach to examine routinely how survey and register-related characteristics may explain disagree-ment found between the two information sources.Methods: We linked register-and survey-based data pertaining to the Finnish Register of Primary Health Care gen-eral physician visits and the Survey on Well-Being among Foreign Born Population (FinMonik, 2018-2019), a nationally representative survey. The sample comprised n =5,800 informants for whom registered general physician visits were tracked in the 12-month period preceding their participation in the survey. Cohen's kappa was used as measure of multisource concordance, hierarchical loglinear models for the association between single predictors and multisource discrepancy, and a logistic regression model for examining source-related predictors of source discrepancy. Survey weights were used in all sample analyses.Results: Source concordance was poor. When dichotomizing general physician visits (zero vs one or more), 35% of informants had reported one or more visits while none were found from register. Both register-and informant-related predictors were associated to this discrepancy (i.e. catchment area, private health care use, inability to work, region of origin and reason for migration).Conclusions: We found high discrepancy between the reported and the registered physician visits among the for-eign-born population in Finland, with a particularly high number of reported physician visits when none were found in the register. There was a strong association between the specific catchment area and mismatch, indicating that both register under-coverage and survey over-report are plausible and may coexist behind the discrepancy. However, associations of informant's characteristics and mismatch were less pronounced. Implications on the validity of medical information sources are discussed.

AB  - In this paper we show the quantitative and relative importance of phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural areas within European river basins and demonstrate the importance of P pathways, linking agricultural source areas to surface water at different scales. Agricultural P losses are increasingly important for the P concentration in most European rivers, lakes, and estuaries, even though the quantity of P lost from agricultural areas in European catchments varies at least one order of magnitude (< 0.2 kg P ha(-1) to > 2.1 kg P ha(-1)). We focus on the importance of P for the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and discuss the benefits, uncertainties, and side effects of the different targeted mitigation measures that can be adopted to combat P losses from agricultural areas in river basins. Experimental evidence of the effects of some of the main targeted mitigation measures hitherto implemented is demonstrated, including: (i) soil tillage changes, (ii) treatment of soils near ditches and streams with iron to reduce P transport from source areas to surface waters, (iii) establishment of buffer zones for retaining P from surface runoff, (iv) restoration of river-floodplain systems to allow natural inundation of riparian areas and deposition of P, and (v) inundation of riparian areas with tile drainage water for P retention. Furthermore, we show how river basin managers can map and analyze the extent and importance of P risk areas, exemplified by four catchments differing in size in Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Finally, we discuss the factors and mechanisms that may delay and/or counteract the responses of mitigation measures for combating P losses from agricultural areas when monitored at the catchment scale.

AB  - Mixed mountain forests consisting of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) are among the most productive and stable forest ecosystems in Europe. Their southeasternmost geographical distribution range is located in the Western Rhodopes, where they have high economic, recreational, and ecological value. In the past, shelterwood cuttings dominated forest management practices in these forests and were mainly aimed at maintaining and reproducing conifers. During the past two decades, single-tree and group-tree selection systems have been promoted as alternative management approaches to support the conversion of spruce-dominated stands to close-to-nature mixed forests of fir, beech, and spruce. However, the natural regeneration dynamics in these stands are barely known, and their dependence on microsite and management effects needs to be better understood. The objective of this study was to investigate ecological factors under management regimes of different intensity ("single-tree"-selection and "group-tree"-selection) that influence the regeneration processes in mixed mountain forests in the Bulgarian Rhodopes. Data on regeneration and microsite conditions were collected on 105 systematically distributed plots (25 m(2)/100 m(2)) in four 100-120 years old stands located in the regional forest district of Smoljan, Bulgaria (1580-1650 m a.s.l.). We relied on generalizeds linear mixed models to analyse for each species the (1) size-dependent regeneration density and (2) height increment in dependence on management practices, competing vegetation, as well as soil and light conditions. Our study revealed an overall high potential for recruitment in the Western Rhodopes. Regeneration density was highest in fir (median 12800 N ha-1), followed by spruce (median 1600 N ha-1) and beech (median 1200 N ha-1). Fir benefited most from "single-tree" selection cuttings, while "group-tree" selection cutting tended to promote beech and fir but also spruce. Competing ground vegetation was detrimental for seedling density of all species. Annual height increment increased with plant size, was lowest in spruce, and similar in fir and beech. Sapling increment was driven by light, whereas seedlings did not react to increased radiation. Browsing was species-specific and was highest in beech (15-30 %), followed by fir (5-10 %) and spruce (<1 %). It was not a crucial factor in impeding tree recruitment. We conclude that frequent harvest activities of low intensity which consider advanced regeneration are a promising approach to successfully convert the formerly spruce-firdominated forests to climate-adapted fir-beech-(spruce)-mixed stands.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals aim for a better future, but gains are threatened by conflict and governance failures, exacerbated by climate change. While research on energy security is well-established, conceptualanalytical research on sustainability transitions has paid little attention to security threats as factors influencing transitions or security policy as part of policy mixes. This paper combines policy coherence and integration analysis of energy and security strategy documents with sustainability transitions' research, considering how landscape pressures and energy niches are presented in documents pertaining to Estonia, Finland and Scotland during 2006-2020. The findings show that security and energy policies present a functional overlap. Yet, policy integration and coherence are insufficiently addressed, conflicts created by coexisting low-carbon and hydrocarbon-based security considerations. An increasingly multifaceted landscape creates a complicated policy environment where pursuing policy coherence becomes harder. Despite the accelerating energy transition, the security implications of energy niches have received too little attention.

AB  - A combination of process and I-O analyses is used to investigate relationships between several kinds of energy uses, product compositions and technical change in Swedish agriculture. Estimates are based on comparisons of three development stages in the transition period from 1956 to 1993, Energy productivity has changed dramatically. Cash crops and non-ruminant animals have been more efficient in their use of support energy, compared to other farm sectors; all sectors have increased their solar energy productivity, Support energy from fertilisers is increasingly a major contributor to solar energy productivity giving 20 kWh biomass per kWh input. Manure has become marginal as a substitute fbr external energy inputs through fertiliser. Transforming a larger population of produced biomass to useful products outside agriculture, changing from ruminants to non-ruminants production or finding fuel uses of manure will increase energy, productivity and sustainability. Contradictions with recent analyses of energy or sustainability may be explained by differences in the perceived influences of technical and structural change or earlier incomplete systems approaches.

AB  - In northern Sweden, large forest areas are affected by extensive damage caused by moose, fungi, beetle and other biological pests. For non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners this leads to large losses of value, not only in economic terms but also in the form of loss of biodiversity and amenity values. Therefore, several research projects are underway to develop new silvicultural methods and other measures to reduce damage. However, a successful implementation of these will often depend on the willingness and knowledge of the forest owners. The objective of this study was, therefore, to elucidate NIPF owners' knowledge about forest damage and their preferences regarding forest management alternatives that potentially could mitigate the damage situation. Data were collected through a questionnaire that was distributed to a random sample of 1,177 NIPF owners in northern Sweden, and the response rate was 31% (n = 368). The results show that 19% of the NIPF owners did not know the current damage situation in their own forest. In addition, NIPF owners judged that their knowledge to identify damage themselves is quite limited, except for damage caused by moose. Regarding future management options, many were positive towards avoiding clear-cuts in suitable areas, while many were negative towards implementing alternative tree species such as larch and lodgepole pine. The study concludes that there is a clear need to inform and educate NIPF owners about forest damage, but also that there will be challenges in reaching all types of owners.

AB  - Local reactions to climate change and sustainable development take various forms. The literature on grassroots innovation has grown recently, and it illustrates the myriad of initiatives that are actively working with the issues. The eco-village movement is one example of a grassroots innovation that reacts and adapts to its prerequisites, all striving for an alternative living with reduced environmental impact. This paper focuses on the development of eco-villages in Sweden, arguing that in recent years a fourth generation of initiatives has emerged, with ideals close to the pioneers of the first generation's idealistic views and ambitions for alternative living as a way of reacting to global trends. The fourth generation is highly diverse in form and goals, but with an emphasis on outreach and networking as well as more focus on small-scale agriculture and permaculture. This paper presents, through literature reviews, database searches and interviews, how the eco-village idea has moved between initiatives and has taken various forms over the generations. In the first generation via books, reports and personal contacts, in the second and third also via contractors and professionals, and in the fourth via the internet and social media in order to attract members and have impact.

AB  - The reduction of nitrogen fluxes from land to sea is an important task in areas with estuarine or marine eutrophication. Wetland creation has been proposed as one method to reduce nitrogen from streams draining agricultural areas. In this study, a scenario of nitrogen removal in created wetlands was evaluated by mathematical modelling of nitrogen fluxes in a catchment (224 km(2)) in southern Sweden. The scenario was based on topographically realistic siting of 40 potential wetlands with a total area of 0.92 km(2) (0.4% of the catchment area). Nitrogen removal in the wetlands was described with a simple and robust first-order model, which was modified and evaluated against data from eight monitored surface-flow wetlands. However, the modifications gave no substantial support for changing the basic model. For catchment-scale modelling this wetland model was incorporated into a dynamic process-based catchment model (HBV-N). The catchment was then divided to several coupled subbasins, so that the wetland influence on nitrogen load could be estimated separately for each potential wetland. The modelling showed that the 40 potential wetlands would reduce the nitrogen transport to the coast with approximately 6%. Specific removal rates ranged between 57 and 466 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the different wetlands, depending on residence time (size and hydraulic loading) and nitrogen concentration in inflow. Due to temperature dependence and seasonal variation in water discharge, significant decrease in nitrogen concentrations mainly occurred during summer periods with low loading. The study illustrates that catchment modelling is a useful method for analysing wetland creation plans, and that wetland creation must cover fairly large areas and be combined with other measures in order to achieve substantial reduction of nitrogen fluxes to coastal waters. Further monitoring of existing wetlands will improve the removal expression and decrease uncertainty. For instance, at present it could not be deducted whether wetlands with low average residence times ( < 2 days) have net removal or net resuspension on an annual basis. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

KW  - PRECAUTION
AB  - In this article, we investigate how the uncertain consequences of sea lice agents on the environment affect the management process, focusing on the coastal shrimp in Norway. In this context, the key stakeholders (shrimp fishers and aquaculture owners) have conflicting interests and understand uncertainty from different perspectives. We ask: (1) How do fishers and aquaculture representatives translate uncertainty into risk, and do they link uncertainty to the precautionary approach or not? (2) How is uncertainty dealt with scientifically and related to decisions made by the authorities? Finally, we address organizational aspects related to a "post-normal approach" and ask: (3) Is it possible to organize the risk assessment process differently, to ensure more effective and legitimate advice? In order to answer these questions, we understand these issues as post-normal ones, and lean on both Science and Technology Studies and Risk Governance theory. We use a mix of social scientific methods including literature review, participatory observation, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings indicate that since the effect of sea lice agents is an uncontrollable problem ridden with uncertainty, science alone is insufficient, calling for a more participatory approach.

AB  - A significant part of our cultural heritage consists of wood. Research on historical wooden structures and artefacts thereby provides knowledge of people's daily lives and the society in which they lived. Dendrochronology is a well-established dating method of wood that can also provide valuable knowledge about climate dynamics, environmental changes, silviculture, and cultural transformations. However, dendrochronology comes with some limitations that end users in cultural heritage sciences must be aware of, otherwise their surveys may not be ultimately performed. We have drawn attention to studies in which dendrochronological results have been misinterpreted, over-interpreted, or not fully utilized. On the other hand, a rigorous dendrochronological survey may not respond to the request of information in practice. To bridge this rigour-relevance gap, this article has considered and reviewed both the dendrochronology's science-perspective and the practitioner's and end user's call for context appropriate studies. The material for this study consists of (i) interviews with researchers in dendrochronology and end users represented by cultural heritage researchers with focus on building conservation and building history in Sweden, and (ii) a review of dendrochronological reports and the literature where results from the reports have been interpreted. From these sources we can conclude that a continuous two-way communication between the dendrochronologists and end users often would have resulted in improved cultural heritage studies. The communication can take place in several steps. Firstly, the design of a sampling plan, which according to the current standard for sampling of cultural materials often is required, is an excellent common starting point for communication. Secondly, the survey reports could be developed with a more extensive general outline of the method and guidance in how to interpret the results. Thirdly, the potential contribution from dendrochronology is often underused, foreseeing historical information on local climate, silviculture, and choice of quality of the wooden resource, as the focus most often is the chronological dating. Finally, the interpretation of the results should consider all the available sources where dendrochronology is one stake for a conciliant conclusion.

AB  - Ancient trees are considered one of the most important habitats for biodiversity in Europe and North America. They support exceptional numbers of specialized species, including a range of rare and endangered wood-living insects. In this study, we use a dataset of 105 sites spanning a climatic gradient along the oak range of Norway and Sweden to investigate the importance of temperature and precipitation on beetle species richness in ancient, hollow oak trees. We expected that increased summer temperature would positively influence all wood-living beetle species whereas precipitation would be less important with a negligible or negative impact. Surprisingly, only oak-specialist beetles with a northern distribution increased in species richness with temperature. Few specialist beetles and no generalist beetles responded to the rise of 4 degrees C in summer as covered by our climatic gradient. The negative effect of precipitation affected more specialist species than did temperature, whereas the generalists remained unaffected. In summary, we suggest that increased summer temperature is likely to benefit a few specialist beetles within this dead wood community, but a larger number of specialists are likely to decline due to increased precipitation. In addition, generalist species will remain unaffected. To minimize adverse impacts of climate change on this important community, long-term management plans for ancient trees are important.

AB  - In this lectio praecursoria, which I presented as part of my doctoral defense at the University of Eastern Finland on 5 November 2021, I delve deep into the Brazilian anti-mining movement to understand the context in which activism take place, their main strategies and course of actions, and their ability to influence the overall mining debate in Brazil in the 2010s. It sheds light on the key challenges faced by groups fighting for more environmental and social justice in mining conflictual situations. More specific, the research covers the 2013-2017 time frame, when discussions on the mining framework and a severe tailings dam failure happened. These two cases are analyzed and their effects on anti-mining activism are explored through a twofold focus on social movements and environmental justice studies. The study contributes to scientific discussions on mining and society by seeking conceptual bridges across political-ecologically oriented studies on social movements against mineral extraction. It also expands, significantly, analyses of social movements in Brazil by contributing to the international comparative literature on the social and environmental impacts of mining, Brazilian and Latin American studies, studies on mining history, sociology of mining, and mining policy.

AB  - In 1986, the Ottawa charter marked a paradigm shift for public health, putting the focus on strengthening community action and on creating supportive environments for health. A key to this is "capacity building" (CB), which we understand as the development and sustainable implementation of structural capacities, e.g. coordinated data collection, collaboration processes across sectors and reliable provision of basic resources in all areas of local health promotion. Many efforts and three and a half decades later we still envisage infrastructure deficits, scattered public health landscapes and restraints to intersectoral cooperation much too often. While agreement on the theoretical insights on what is needed appears to be broad, translating these insights into practice remains a challenge. In this situation, digital public health (DPH) can contribute to overcoming barriers and making knowledge for action more visible and more accessible. With DPH, data can be integrated, structured and disseminated in novel ways. We discuss why CB at the local level could benefit from technological advances and what DPH might do for the provision of information services on public health capacity. Our focus is on the web-based, interactive representation of public health data for use in information, governance or benchmarking processes. As an example from public health practice, the Finnish tool TEAviisari (National Institute for Health and Welfare, Finland) is presented. The 2020 EU Council Presidency of Germany - with the topics of digitalisation and the common European health data space - offers opportunities to decisively advance the development of CB in health promotion in this country.

AB  - The disease Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation (HSMI) is causing substantial economic losses to the Norwegian salmon farming industry where the causative agent, piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), is reportedly spreading from farmed to wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with as yet undetermined impacts. To assess if PRV infection is epidemiologically linked between wild and farmed salmon in the eastern Pacific, wild Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) from regions designated as high or low exposure to salmon farms and farmed Atlantic salmon reared in British Columbia (BC) were tested for PRV. The proportion of PRV infection in wild fish was related to exposure to salmon farms (p = 0.0097). PRV was detected in: 95% of farmed Atlantic salmon, 37-45% of wild salmon from regions highly exposed to salmon farms and 5% of wild salmon from the regions furthest from salmon farms. The proportion of PRV infection was also significantly lower (p = 0.0008) where wild salmon had been challenged by an arduous return migration into high-elevation spawning habitat. Inter-annual PRV infection declined in both wild and farmed salmon from 2012-2013 (p <= 0.002). These results suggest that PRV transfer is occurring from farmed Atlantic salmon to wild Pacific salmon, that infection in farmed salmon may be influencing infection rates in wild salmon, and that this may pose a risk of reduced fitness in wild salmon impacting their survival and reproduction.

AB  - Maritime pine (Mims pinaster) is the most important conifer species in France in terms of wood production. It is mostly cultivated in even-aged monoculture stands in the Landes forest. These plantations are exposed to multiple biotic and abiotic risks: most importantly the cyclical outbreaks of a defoliator, the Pine Processionary Moth (PPM, Thaumetopoea pityocampa), and storms causing large windthrown. This study aims to compute the optimal rotation age and land expectation value (LEV) for maritime pine plantations in order to assess the impact of these disturbances. Using stochastic simulation methods, we simulate multiple scenarios combining different disturbance intensities. Our results show that both disturbances reduce LEV individually. When combined together, the two disturbances generate sub-additive losses (i.e. combined damages are smaller than the sum of the damages from each disturbance individually). The impact on the optimal rotation length, however, is different for the two analysed risks: While storms tend to reduce the optimal harvest age, PPM tends to increase it. Overall, the impact of PPM on the rotation length prevails and, here, risks increase rather than decrease the optimal rotation length. Thinnings play an important role. They do not only increase profitability but also constitute an effective hedging strategy against both risks since they mitigate the negative impacts of PPM and storm disturbances for all the tested scenarios.

AB  - Despite its relevance for ecology and biodiversity, the stability of spatial microeukaryote diversity patterns in time has received only little attention using gene-based strategies, and there is little knowledge about the relation of spatial vs. temporal variation. We addressed this subject by investigating seasonal fluctuations in protistan communities in three ecologically distinct marine habitats. We analyzed 3360 eukaryote small subunit rRNA gene sequences collected along an O-2/H2S gradient in a Norwegian fjord in order to reveal shifts in protistan community composition and structure in three different seasons. In all nine clone libraries, ciliates and stramenopiles accounted for the largest proportion. Yet, as expected, at the phylotype level, the protistan communities from distinct habitats differed significantly, with the number of shared phylotypes between two habitats being as low as 18%. This confirmed previous notions that environmental factors along the stratification gradient shape biodiversity patterns. Surprisingly, the intrahabitat community composition and structure varied at a comparable order of magnitude over time, with only 18-28% phylotypes shared within the same habitat. Our study demonstrates that the consideration of local fluctuations in microeukaryote diversity over time offers additional information for diversity surveys and can significantly contribute to the revelation of spatial protistan community patterns.

AB  - Plant associated mutualists can mediate invasion success by affecting the ecological niche of nonnative plant species. Anthropogenic disturbance is also key in facilitating invasion success through changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, but the combined effect of these two factors in natural environments is understudied.
   To better understand this interaction, we investigated how disturbance and its interaction with mycorrhizas could impact range dynamics of nonnative plant species in the mountains of Norway. Therefore, we studied the root colonisation and community composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in disturbed vs undisturbed plots along mountain roads.
   We found that roadside disturbance strongly increases fungal diversity and richness while also promoting AM fungal root colonisation in an otherwise ecto-mycorrhiza and ericoid-mycorrhiza dominated environment. Surprisingly, AM fungi associating with nonnative plant species were present across the whole elevation gradient, even above the highest elevational limit of nonnative plants, indicating that mycorrhizal fungi are not currently limiting the upward movement of nonnative plants.
   We conclude that roadside disturbance has a positive effect on AM fungal colonisation and richness, possibly supporting the spread of nonnative plants, but that there is no absolute limitation of belowground mutualists, even at high elevation.

AB  - The cod resources in the Barents Sea constitute the most important fisheries in Norway. In order to reduce resource allocation conflicts among different gear and vessel groups and to ensure profit for all participants throughout the value chain, the sector is thoroughly organized. The institutions established to ensure long-term sustainability, have been developed within the framework of a joint Norwegian-Russian fisheries management regime. However, due to a very high fishing mortality, the cod stock is now under severe pressure. In addition, a major part of the cod fisheries is highly seasonal and unable to be a stable supplier to neither the land-based industry nor demanding international markets. In parallel, cod farming is expected to become a new emerging industry, with potential to copy the success of farmed Atlantic salmon. Many actors within the cod fisheries fear the future competition from the growing cod farming sector. With reference to important attributes that characterize the cod fisheries and cod farming, this paper discusses how a future farming industry may affect the traditional cod fisheries. Moreover, we discuss how the fisheries may be forced to organize in the future to encounter the expected competition from cod farming. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines how the past is used in the construction of regional identity narratives in policy discourses and documents. Despite assumptions that regional identity is based on shared culture, some authors argue that new forms of regional identity have emerged as the consequence of regions' involvement in wider networks. Identity has been pursued as an asset to regional attractiveness and economic growth and, as such, is shaped by regional development strategies concerning particular social groups. Socially shared representations of the past through history, cultural heritage and collective memory play an important role in this process, since the past is a powerful resource that may be used to construct images of places, legitimizing claims on territories. Document analysis and interviews with planners are used to analyse strategies for regional development in five counties located in the Malardalen region, Sweden. This study shows that regional strategies are guided by narratives framing regions from an exclusive outside perspective, leaving internal qualities unnoticed. The past is used to structure these narratives and construct identities that serve economic growth rather than the integration of the plural heritages of the region.

AB  - The evidence of human activities around Erhai Lake catchment was revealed by pollen records from a sediment core in the lake, northwest Yunnan Province. The chronologic sequence based on AMS C-14 data made it possible for pollen results to compare with archaeological records and historical documents. The preliminary deforestation started from the selective clearance at about 5500 C-14 a BP, marked by the loss of vertically distributed montane forest and the expansion of second pine woodland across the catchment. The deforestation resulted in the increase of surface runoff and the enhanced erosion in the catchment. The increased herbs of pasture and crop suggested the primitive agriculture and stockbreeding in study region. With the limited human activity, as well as the suitable climatic condition, second pine forest expanded quickly, resulting in the weakened soil erosion around the basin. The strong forest clearance inferred from pollen occurred since 2160 14 C a BP, paralleling to the first dense immigration of population, when Yeyu County was first set up around west coast of Erhai Lake, documented in historic record. The development of agriculture led to the steady enhancement of soil erosion from farming land, increasing the input of fine materials and nutrients to the lake. Moreover, the serious deforestation by human activity stressed the vulnerability in ecosystem of the landscape. The time of primary anthropologic impact recorded from pollen is earlier than that of the oldest archaeological record by 1500 a (C-14 year).

AB  - Forest age structure has become younger and the amount of old forest has decreased due to intensive forestry in Northern Europe. Consequently, large forest-dwelling hawks may lack nest sites as they need large trees to support their nests. Construction of artificial nests has been a globally adopted conservation measure to provide nest sites for several raptors, but the impact of this practice has seldom been evaluated. We compared the nesting success of northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, common buzzard Buteo buteo, and honey buzzard Pernis apivorus in natural and artificial nests based on long-term data in Finland. The probability of successful nesting of goshawk and common buzzard was lower in artificial nests, whereas no difference was found in the nesting success of honey buzzard between the nest types. Brood size did not differ between natural and artificial nests in successful nests of any of the three species. Finally, distances to anthropogenic features had no effect on nesting success. These results indicate that hawks switching from natural to artificial nests are potentially lured to an ecological trap with higher risk of nesting failure. However, breeding at artificial nests, even with lower success than in natural nests, can still add to the population, if otherwise nonbreeding individuals settle to nest. It should be investigated which part of the population breeds in artificial nests and whether the site selection for artificial nests needs revision. Our results emphasize the importance of monitoring and evaluation of well-intentioned conservation efforts.

AB  - In order to study the ecological effects of logging combined with mechanical soil preparation, we sampled carabid beetles with pitfall trapping in nine spruce-dominated stands in central Finland in 1995-1998. Three of the stands were left intact as controls. Three 1600-m(2) openings per stand were logged in the winter 1995-1996 into six stands. In three of these stands, light soil preparation was applied. Logging affected the species assemblages, but soil preparation per se had no clear effects., Open-habitat species increased in abundance in the openings one year after logging, but catches of generalist species in the different treatments did not differ from each other. A forest species, Calathus micropterus, was least abundant in the prepared openings. The amounts of logging residue, exposed mineral soil and aggregated humus, as well as the abundance of red wood ants, significantly explained variation in carabid assemblages.

AB  - Tourism is one of those sectors, which are increasingly important in the economic development of regions and countries. The aim of this study was therefore to the see the regional differences in the level of development of tourism infrastructure in the EU countries of Central and Eastern Europe compared to other EU states, Switzerland and Norway. The following selected indicators related to the accommodation infrastructure were analysed: the number of facilities, number of beds in these facilities and the average size of accommodation facilities measured by the number of beds. The results were confronted with the data referring to inbound tourists and accommodation provided to them, in order to answer the question of how infrastructure development responds to the increased demand for accommodation services. The analysis was conducted in terms of the dynamics of change for the years 2000-2011 by NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 regions. The analysis pointed to a continuation of the upward trend in terms of tourists' arrivals and overnight stays as well as a wide variation in the level of development of accommodation infrastructure in Europe. In the regions of the Central and Eastern European EU member states the number of accommodation facilities per 10 000 population is much lower than in the most attractive tourist regions of Italy, Austria, Greece and Spain. The relatively best performance in this regard in the CEE regions is recorded in Croatia and the Czech Republic. In most of the central regions of Europe, the trend in the number of accommodation facilities is downward, but in the analysed period a strong growth was recorded in the regions of Spain, Italy, Croatia and Greece, which are traditional tourist destinations.

AB  - Attention paid to energy efficiency in data centers has been increasing significantly in the last decade. One of the latest trends on this issue is supplying data centers with renewable energy. Reducing the carbon footprint of data centers is a major step towards green computing. Following this trend, more and more data centers are built in cold climate areas for cheaper cooling and increased energy efficiency of the facilities. However, such geographical locations have highly varying availability of renewable energy (especially solar energy), and fitting the data centers completely with renewable energy is hence more difficult.
   This paper analyzes the feasibility of using renewable energies for a data center located on 60 north latitude. For this purpose, we introduce a new metric called Minimum Percentage Supply, which represents the fraction of the total data center energy consumption that renewable energy, produced by 1 wind turbine and 1 m(2) solar panel, can cover. After estimating the available renewable energy provided for the city of Turku, Finland, and the energy consumption caused by the server workload, a feasibility study is conducted for a data center powered by renewable energy on such a location. We also analyze the ratio between number of wind turbines and m2 of solar panels to achieve a desired percentage of renewable energy coverage for a given data center. Finally, the energy cost trade-off is evaluated for different quantities of wind and solar energy sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Historic inscriptions accompany rock art panels and sandstone cliffs throughout Montana and the North American plains. The two historic inscription locations described here emphasize the cultural and historical value of these provocative archaeological signatures. One of these includes a cliff face incised with Chinese characters near the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul, & Pacific Railroad in southeastern Montana. The Chinese characters are among other historic inscriptions associated with a coal mining district established by that railroad to supply the fuel for its engines, underscoring the inherent connections between extractive industries and railroad rights-of-way. The second location includes a collection of Japanese words and names, as well as Irish and Norwegian names, incised into a sandstone cliff face adjacent to a section of the Northern Pacific Railroad. These inscribed archaeological sites represent text-aided resources that may be some of the only written accounts available to better understand the lives and identities of people in transnational work camps of railroads and associated extractive industries in the American West.

AB  - There exists a two-way detrimental relationship between climate change and several agricultural practices. Emissions from the agriculture sector (e.g. GHG emissions, and release of pesticides, herbicides, and nutrients) is causing global warming as well as damaging the environment, and in return climate change is stressing agriculture globally. The bewildering relationship between adaptative measures and risk of maladaptive outcomes demands a better understanding concerning "What, where and how to implement" adaptive measures. This article is one step towards a deeper understanding of "what", "where" and "how" related questions on climate change adaptation in connection to constraints of carrying capacities and risks of maladaptation. A GIS based framework was employed for generating risk maps for identification of nutrient surplus and discharge hotspots "i.e. Where to implement?". Moreover, extensive in-depth interviews and a questionnaire survey were conducted to explore perceptions on carrying capacities, resources management, climate change adaptation measures and risk of maladaptive results, i.e. "What and how to implement?". Furthermore, the data collected from the questionnaire survey and interviews was employed to ameliorate the analytical model, previously developed, based on the initial work of Juhola et al. (2016) and Neset et al. (2019a), which could help guide planners, advisors, and farmers for better understanding of adaptation and maladaptive risks. The study is expected to assist in developing robust, sustainable and climate smart adaptive interventions in response to negative climate change impacts.

AB  - Introduced predators are one of the main threats to island avifaunas. However, the magnitude of their impact in the Mediterranean has not often been studied. This is the case for the introduced alien black rats Rattus rattus, the most destructive predator of seabirds in the Mediterranean. Here, we analyse the impact of black rats on the breeding performance of Cory's shearwater Calonectris diomedea breeding at the Chafarinas Islands, an archipelago with a very high density of rats. An intensive rat control campaign (through anticoagulant poison) was carried out during 1999-2004 at two shearwater sub-colonies with contrasting habitat features (vegetated vs. rocky). Breeding success of Cory's shearwaters increased in proportion to the effort of rat control. Such increase was mainly due to a decline in black rat predation on chicks, while eggs losses remained constant throughout the period. We found a differential effectiveness of rat control in each sub-colony. The increase in breeding success after rat control was higher in the sub-colony with lower breeding success (the vegetated habitat), but this parameter never reached the values shown by the other sub-colony (the rocky habitat). Our results suggest that habitat characteristics of each case of study must be taken into account when designing and evaluating specific rat control programs.

AB  - In this article, we explore the production of socio-cultural values around blue-green solutions (BGS) through the perspective of care. We explore how values and preferences are formed through the complexity of everyday life engagements in a BGS environment. The data come from a questionnaire answered by 328 households in the neighborhood of Augustenborg in Malmo, Sweden. The questionnaire collects detailed information about inhabitants' possible recreational use (through Likert scale questions) and willingness to pay (WTP) (estimated through contingent valuation). The study evaluates if and how people care to use, care to live with, and care to pay for BGS. The result shows that people in Augustenborg relate in different and sometimes contradictory ways to BGS. A well-used BGS environment does not per se make the environment successful or result in people preferring a BGS environment in the future. Building awareness about BGS seems to increase the willingness to pay, whereas recreational use seems to decrease it. The study reveals a landscape of care that is constantly being formed and transformed. This suggests that both planning and research needs to focus more on the relation between BGS and social use over time.

AB  - In Norway domestic sheep Ovis aries range unattended in mountainous areas during the summer season. Wolverines Gulo gulo re-established in the alpine regions of southern Norway during recent decades and are viewed as a substantial predator on lambs. Reducing predation on sheep by wolverines would not only reduce the economic loss to farmers but also promote the acceptance of wolverines in their summer ranges. We hypothesized that male lambs would be more prone to wolverine predation, because of higher locomotor activity, lower behavioural ewe-lamb synchrony and larger ewe-lamb distance. We studied ewe and lamb behavioural patterns, synchrony and ewe-lamb distance on a summer range in Knutshoi, south-central Norway. Although no differences were found in ewe-lamb distance or locomotor activity in gender, female lambs synchronized their behaviour more with their mother than males. Only for female lambs, increased synchrony resulted in closer ewe-lamb distances. Overall losses to wolverines based on long-term data indicate that male lambs are more prone to predation than females later in the season. These sex-specific behavioural differences in lambs affect the spatial and social relationships between ewe and lamb, and are likely to increase with age eventually leading to sexual segregation. Male lambs can therefore be expected to be more prone to wolverine predation towards the end of the season, when lambs become independent from the ewe. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using the new Energy-Transport-Reaction Model, the nitrogen-cycle is presented in relation to energy flow in a system. This model is applied exemplary to three degraded inland water bodies. The increase in the density of energy flow in a spatially limited system provides the framework for this model. By this model the N-cycle can be observed in relation to other abiotic and metabolic processes.  The N-cycle proves to be an important indicator, sensitive to disturbances in the hydrologic cycle. A poorly managed hydrologic cycle will increase resource losses from the watershed, and simulate the formation of loss processes. The model allows an evaluation of a catchment's management according to its ion losses related to its nitrogen losses. Based on a longterm sustainable function of a catchment the integrity of the system is measured by its degree of closure of material cycles and lack of losses. Moreover, loss-minimizing management practices can be derived from the model. Planning and management can be directed towards this goal of minimizing losses and evaluated accordingly.

AB  - This paper explores the implications of climate change and urban development on the design of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) using the example of ponds and raingardens in Auckland, New Zealand. Many of Auckland's coastal and freshwater receiving environments have been degraded due to stormwater inflows and are potentially at further risk due to continued urbanisation and climate change. SUDS have been suggested as a possible means of adapting to those risks. However, there is little guidance available on how they should be designed for future conditions. Response-curves which relate changes in SUDS sizing to both climate change and imperviousness are presented as a means of displaying a range of possible future design needs. It is suggested that they could aid in the selection of adaptation strategies. The methodology followed is based on publicly available guidance material to provide a real world example of the design issues facing stormwater managers. An incremental adaptation strategy, whereby construction is staggered over time, is recommended for ponds which vary greatly in size depending on the projected climate and imperviousness. In contrast, adapting raingardens at the time of construction is pragmatic as the change in size, with even the maximum projected climate change, is modest.

AB  - One of the possibilities to expand sea-based fish fanning is to move the aquaculture installations away from the conflicts of the coastal zone, and into more open ocean locations. However, open ocean aquaculture puts other demands on the structures than aquaculture in sheltered locations, and in this context it is necessary to understand the behaviour of the aquaculture structures as they are exposed to large sea-loads from waves and current. Flexible netting is a main part of most sea-based aquaculture structures, and in this paper the interaction between waves and netting is studied. Experiments were conducted at the narrow wave flume facility at the University of Oslo, Norway, where several different regular wave cases were run through netting with different solidity. The wave energy was measured after the wave had passed through the net and compared with the energy of an undisturbed wave to assess the wave damping properties of the net. The vertical and horizontal forces were also measured. The findings show that the damping effects of the netting are not necessarily correlated with the wave forces, indicated complex nonlinear processes contributing to the fluid-net interaction. The amount of nonlinear energy in the wave and force waveforms is also investigated, and it is shown that the nonlinear energy in the incoming wave results in an even higher level of nonlinear components in the forces experienced by the net.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify and analyse the sets of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management (C&I) in the Forest Europe signatory countries in terms of their origin, structure, scope and practical use in the forestry decision-making process and forest policy-making. The analysis was conducted as desk research based on available publications, including applicable legal acts, reports, research publications or conference materials. In some cases, direct contacts with local experts were also made. Most European countries with significant forest resources have introduced their sets of criteria and indicators. The Ministerial Conference for the Protection of Forests in Europe (Forest Europe process), played a significant and positive role in this process. The set of C&I developed through the process served as a starting point and template for actions in member states aimed at systematizing and formalizing the monitoring of forest management in their territory. However, some countries with significant forest resources have not yet developed national sets of C&I. This is particularly the case for six countries with a forest area of more than 4 million hectares: Germany, Sweden, Poland, Romania, Italy and Ukraine. Altogether, sets of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management (SFM) have been developed in 20 countries out of the 46 Forest Europe signatory countries, although their status and timeliness varies. In most countries, the criteria and indicators for SFM are the basis for periodic reporting on the condition of forests, communication with the public, and in some countries they are also a formal instrument for monitoring the results of policy decisions and administrative actions. We conclude that the differentiation of solutions used in individual signatory countries of Forest Europe should also be a guide for the development of the Polish set of C&I, which - referring to the developed solutions at the European level - should also refer to the specificity of Polish forestry and take into account the issues important for forest management in our country.

AB  - Limiting the negative effects of human-induced global warming is the focus of climate policy worldwide. In the European Union (EU), the target for reaching carbon neutrality is set to 2050, including a proposed renewable energy target of 45% for 2030. In Finland, the government has pledged to reach net-zero emissions already by 2035, which is expected to require large increases in wind and nuclear capacity, as well as sector coupling with, e.g., transport and heating. In view of these plans, this study evaluates the feasibility of attaining carbon neutrality in Finland by 2035, while considering delays from potential bottlenecks, such as limited raw material availability, fuel availability, manufacturing capacity, and import reliance. The literature review highlights the considerable dependence of renewable technologies on critical raw materials and other minerals, largely im-ported from non-EU countries. Modelling revealed how increased biomass usage considerably reduces the size of national carbon sinks, vital for reaching net-zero emissions in Finland in the coming decade. In light of this, current climate strategy was shown to be partially outdated and short of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035, already without including potential delays from the analyzed bottlenecks. Subsequently, alternative measures to improve sustainability and reduce emissions are presented. The findings of this paper are also relevant for other countries aiming to reach net-zero emissions, especially for those which have climate strategies emphasizing bioenergy and wind power.

AB  - Background. The objectives were to assess thoughts about suicide, plans to commit suicide and suicide attempts in the community, to investigate the use of health services following a suicide attempt, and to describe basic socio-cultural indices of the community.
   Method. The community survey was one component of the larger WHO multisite intervention study on suicidal behaviours (SUPRE-MISS). In each site, it aimed at randomly selecting and interviewing at least 500 subjects of the general population living in the catchment area of the emergency department where the intervention component of the study was conducted. Communities of eight SUPRE-MISS sites (in Brazil, China, Estonia, India, Iran, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam) participated plus two additional sites from Australia and Sweden conducting similar surveys.
   Results. Suicide attempts (0(.)4-4(.)2%), plans (1(.)1-15(.)6%), and ideation (2(.)6-25(.)4%) varied by a factor of 10-14 across sites, but remained mostly within the ranges of previously published data. Depending on the site, the ratios between attempts, plans, and thoughts Of Suicide differed substantially. Medical attention following a suicide attempt varied between 22% and 88% of the attempts.
   Conclusions. The idea of the suicidal process as a continuous and smooth evolution from thoughts to plans and attempts of suicide needs to be further investigated as it seems to be dependent on the cultural setting. There are indications, that the burden of undetected attempted suicide is high in different cultures; an improved response from the health sector on how to identify and support these individuals is needed.

AB  - Subclinical endometritis (SCE) is highly prevalent in dairy cows, causing negative effects on reproductive outcomes and the producer economy. Genetic selection for animals with better resilience against uterine disease should be prioritized due to both sustainability and animal welfare. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the heritability of SCE in the Norwegian Red (NR) population. Moreover, future perspectives of the condition as a fertility phenotype for breeding are discussed. A total of 1,642 NR cows were sampled for SCE at the time of artificial insemination, using cytotape. The percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in each sample was established by cytology, through the counting of 300 PMN and epithelial cells. The mean percentage of PMN was 5%. Different trait definitions were examined, and SCE was defined as binary traits, based on the following cut-off levels of PMN: Cyto0 = PMN >0, Cyto3 = PMN >3%, Cyto5 = PMN >5%, Cyto10 = PMN >10%, and Cyto20 = PMN >20%. The mean ranged from 0.07 (Cyto20) to 0.59 (Cyto0). We also analyzed PMN as a continuous variable using percent PMN. Information on the animals and herds was obtained from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. The pedigree of cows with data included a total of 24,066 animals. A linear animal model was used to estimate the heritability. The only trait definition that had an estimated genetic variance larger than the standard error was Cyto5, with an estimated heritability of 0.04. For all other definitions, the genetic variance was not significantly different from zero. A cut-off level of 5% PMN has been established as a general threshold for the definition of SCE in earlier literature. The standard errors of the estimated variance components were relatively large, and results should be interpreted with caution. However, the current study indicates that SCE is heritable at a similar level to that of clinical endometritis and metritis, and has potential as a future fertility phenotype to be used for breeding purposes. A more feasible method to diagnose SCE is needed to establish larger data sets.

This paper analyses science-based stakeholder dialogues with climate scientists, municipal officers and private individual forest owners in Sweden, and examines how local experts both share scientific knowledge and experience and integrate it into their work strategies and practices. The results demonstrate how local experts jointly conceptualise climate adaptation, how scientific knowledge is domesticated among local experts in dialogue with scientific experts, the emergence of anchoring devices, and the boundary-spanning functions that are at work in the respective sectors.

AB  - The first offshore wind farm became operational in 1991 in Vindeby, Denmark. By 2008, large offshore wind farms had been built in Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Sweden with a total capacity of 1200 MW. Offshore wind farms have the potential to generate a significant fraction of US electrical consumption, but the US currently lacks offshore wind farms and is still developing a regulatory system. At the state level only Texas has a leasing system for offshore wind. Since all offshore land is the property of the state and cannot be legally developed without a lease from the government, these absences have stalled development. We review and compare regulatory and leasing systems developed in Europe and the US to inform a discussion of the major issues associated with the development of an offshore leasing and regulatory system. We focus on the tradeoffs between encouraging a sustainable energy source and ensuring environmental protection and public compensation. We conclude that there are likely multiple effective methods of regulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The method, Swedish Physical Activity on Prescription (SPAP), has been launched in Swedish healthcare to promote physical activity for prevention and treatment of lifestyle related health disorders. Despite scientific support for the method, and education campaigns, it is used to a limited extent by health professionals. The aim of the study was to describe the views of health professionals on perceived facilitators, barriers and requirements for successful implementation of SPAP in primary healthcare.
   Methods: Eighteen semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in SPAP, i.e. ten people working in local or central management and eight primary healthcare professionals in two regional healthcare organisations, were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: We identified an overarching theme regarding requirements for successful implementation of SPAP: Need for knowledge and organisational support, comprising four main categories: Need for increased knowledge and affirmative attitude among health professionals; Need for clear and supportive management; Need for central supporting structures; Need for local supporting structures. Knowledge of the SPAP method content and core components was limited. Confidence in the method varied among health professionals. There was a discrepancy between the central organisation policy documents declaring that disease preventive methods were prioritised and a mandatory assignment, while the health professionals asked for increased interest, support and resources from management, primarily time and supporting structures. There were somewhat conflicting views between primary healthcare professionals and managers concerning perceived barriers and requirements. In contrast to some of the management's beliefs, all primary healthcare professionals undisputedly acknowledged the importance of promoting physical activity, but they lacked time, written routines and in some cases competence for SPAP counselling.
   Conclusion: The study provides knowledge regarding requirements to facilitate the implementation of SPAP in healthcare. There was limited knowledge among health professionals regarding core components of SPAP and how to practise the method, which speaks for in-depth training in the SPAP method. The findings highlight the importance of forming policies and guidelines and establishing organisational supporting structures, and ensuring that these are well known and approved in all parts of the healthcare organisation.

AB  - Enabling resources are the array of tangible and intangible assets that social entrepreneurs mobilize or create to bring forward novel place-based initiatives, to respond to unmet sustainability challenges and ideally contribute to virtuous processes of socio-economic transformation. Understanding the role of resources in constraining or enabling the development of social enterprises holds important implications not merely for the initiatives, but also for the places where they are embedded. Existing studies fail to provide a comprehensive, empirically grounded account of resources for place-based social entrepreneurship. This paper aims to fill this gap, by exploring the array of resources that enable and constrain the development of Green Care practice, i.e., nature-based activities with a social innovation purpose. Three communities of Finnish practitioners-a nature-tourism company, a care farm, and a biodynamic farm-were involved over the span of 3 years in research activities conducted with an in-depth qualitative approach. Participants were engaged in several stages of iterative learning combining conventional and action-research methods: semi-structured interviews, participatory mapping, and a co-creation workshop. Results show that entrepreneurs resort to a great variety of enabling resources, inclusive of both tangible and intangible assets, that are only marginally considered by relevant literature. Based on these findings, the paper proposes a novel set of enabling resources, comprehensive of nine clusters: infrastructural, institutional, material, place-specific, organizational culture-related, social, ethical, affective, and competence-related. Two concluding insights can be inferred: understanding resources is paramount to grasp possibilities and challenges of place-based entrepreneurship; in-depth participatory processes are needed for a thorough and grounded investigation of enabling resources in places.

AB  - Determining the impacts of invasive pathogens on tree mortality and growth is a difficult task, in particular in the case of species occurring naturally at low frequencies in mixed stands. In this study, we quantify such effects by comparing national forest inventory data collected before and after pathogen invasion. In Norway, Fraxinus excelsior is a minor species representing less than 1% of the trees in the forests and being attacked by the invasive pathogen Hymenoscyphus fraxineus since 2006. By studying deviations between inventories, we estimated a 74% higher-than-expected average ash mortality and a 13% slower-than-expected growth of the surviving ash trees, indicating a lack of compensation by the remaining ash. We could confidently assign mortality and growth losses to ash dieback as no mortality or growth shifts were observed for co-occurring tree species in the same plots. The mortality comparisons also show regional patterns with higher mortality in areas with the longest disease history in Norway. Considering that ash is currently mostly growing in mixed forests and that no signs of compensation were observed by the surviving ash trees, a significant habitat loss and niche replacement could be anticipated in the mid-term.

AB  - In the transition to a sustainable energy system, there is an urgent need for expansion of offshore renewable energy installations. To ensure sustainable development also with respect to the marine environment, a variety of decision support tools (DSTs) are currently under development, aiming at potentially increased quality and ef-ficiency for environmental risk assessment (EIA) of planned offshore energy installations. However, the savings potential of a DSTs is to a large extent governed by the timing of the DST development, which in turn is directly dependent on the investment rate over time. A set of development scenarios were evaluated, simulating different degrees of strategic implementation and successful utilization of the DST for offshore energy. Using the situation in Sweden as a case study, we demonstrate that a planned investment can lead to considerably lower total costs for the EIA at a national level, at the same time allowing for improved quality of the EIA in line with the am-bitions in both marine spatial planning and existing goals within marine environmental management.

AB  - Coastal resource management requires the resolution of local resource use conflicts. The research on coastal conflict resolution is still scarce despite the progress made in fisheries and marine related conflict studies. Utilizing qualitative methodology this paper makes comparative analyses of strengths and deficits of coastal conflict resolution practices in three conflicts from the Swedish west coast and five conflicts from the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium, all studied in the context of the European research project SECOA (Solutions to Environmental Contrasts in Coastal Areas). The analyses focus on power relations among the stakeholders and their practices of knowledge use, including knowledge integration and joint learning. The results show deficits of research and practical neglect of these aspects in coastal management. In the discussion the question of how approaches to conflict resolution can be improved and integrated into long-term strategies of sustainable resource management in coastal areas is addressed. It is concluded that complex conflicts over natural resource use require context specific combinations of formal and informal resolution methods. The interconnected components of transformation of power relations, knowledge integration and joint learning are seen as key components of conflict resolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS FOR THE LAND BIRDS OF SOUTHERN FINLAND
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Protected areas (nature reserves) cover 0.7% of the land area in southern Finland (162,000 km2), which belongs to the south- and mid-boreal coniferous forest zones. The value of these areas in preserving land birds was studied on the basis of quantitative censuses. The numbers of bird pairs were estimated in nature reserves and in the whole of southern Finland, and the significance of the reserves was evaluated based on bow large a proportion of the total population in southern Finland was found in them. Forest habitat generalists and species of coniferous forests occurred in protected areas as expected by the proportion of these areas in southern Finland Specimens of these species groups comprise two thirds of all the country's land birds. Species of old-growth forests and open peatlands clearly preferred protected areas, whereas species of bushes, and lush and deciduous forest were scarcer in protected areas than elsewhere in southern Finland The latter fertile habitats are poorly represented in protected areas, even though due to their disappearance or alteration elsewhere several species confined to these habitats have declined and are even threatened. Drainage of open peatlands and clear cutting of old-growth forests has caused a decrease in the area of these habitats in southern Finland during the past decades. Therefore, protected areas have a high significance in preserving bird species preferring these habitats. Protected areas are particularly important for decreased species of old-growth forests, such as the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus and the Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus, as about 10% of their total population in southern Finland was estimated to breed in protected areas. The future protection of both old-growth and deciduous forests is important if we are to preserve biodiversity of land birds in Finland

AB  - In Sweden, tree stumps are currently considered as a potential resource for bioenergy production. However, environmental effects of stump harvesting - in particular when applied on a larger scale - are regarded as a potential threat to biodiversity in forests but are only poorly investigated. This is especially true for the numerous non-coleopteran macroarthropod groups inhabiting stumps. The aim of the present study was to investigate if a reduction in available dead wood due to stump harvesting in boreal coniferous forests has a negative effect on Diplopoda (millipedes) and Chilopoda (centipedes). We compared abundance, species richness and community composition (dominance patterns and similarity) of these groups on 3-year-old stumps remaining on stump-harvested (SH) clearcuts and non-harvested 'control' (C) clearcuts at 2 locations in central Sweden. For each investigated stump, animals were extracted from the total bark area (including the space between bark and wood), enumerated and determined to species level. Stump harvesting significantly decreased diplopod abundance per stump by 52% and changed community composition compared to clearcuts. Stump harvesting predominantly affected the abundance of two species (Polyxenus lagurus and Proteroiulus fuscus) that strongly dominated the diplopod communities on stumps. Mean species richness of diplopods on individual stumps was low (1-2 species depending on clearcut type and region) and was not affected by stump harvesting. Overall, eight diplopod species were found on stumps at both SH and C clearcuts. Only two species of chilopods were found on the stumps, occurring in low abundances and revealing no response to stump harvesting. The significant loss of diplopod specimens per stump after stump harvesting may be linked to a corresponding loss in function, particularly the mechanical breakdown of woody substrates. The results indicate that a reduction of habitats for stump species with low dispersal ability can both reduce their abundance per unit substrate and potentially also change the stump decomposition rate compared to sites with higher stump densities. Our results therefore highlight a need for careful consideration of increased intensity of stump harvesting at the landscape level. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - China already has more numerous and larger cities than ever before. If the current trend holds, by 2025 it will have a predicted 1 billion of urban population and 8 megacities, each containing 10 million residents or more. China is facing enormous challenges when it comes to balancing rapid economic development with social development, sustainable use of resources and environmental protection in its fast-growing urban areas. Of the 10 most polluted cities in the world, 7 are in China. To meet these challenges, China has become a vast living laboratory for experiments on sustainable urban development. This paper reviews the use and development of city concepts and approaches regarding sustainable urban development in China. The large number of different concepts used appears to be partly due to institutional reasons and partly because they involve gradual changes in national policies. However, the data indicate that the concepts are generally becoming more comprehensive in relation to sustainable development, including social and heritage aspects.
   The most common barrier to the development of sustainable cities in China is still lack of clear visions, targets and indicators for sustainable development. More holistic approaches are needed for integrated urban planning, such as that used in Tangshan Bay Eco-city, a joint project between Sweden and China. This paper proposes the use of metabolic thinking and eco-cycle models derived from the discipline of Industrial Ecology to support urban planners in developing more sustainable and resource-efficient urban pathways. This will require closer cooperation between academics and practitioners and better monitoring of projects. Finally, it will be important to identify ways to scale up successful interventions in the urban area, rather than just moving from one innovative pilot project to the next. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The return of apex predators re-shape population densities of their prey species, creating conflicts and challenges for the conservation and management of both predator and prey populations. The population of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Baltic Sea has grown rapidly since the 1980s after a previous population collapse, causing growing predation pressure on its prey species. However, little is known about variation in the prey use in the landscape or changes in time. We provide detailed information about the diet of the white-tailed eagle along landscape-scaled gradients and about temporal changes in their diet over 25 years. We used an extensive data set with 7700 identified prey remains collected during the breeding season on the land Islands (Finland) 1985-2010. The results support the view of the white-tailed eagle as an opportunistic hunter, preying on the most available prey and switching to other prey when the availability changes

AB  - Purpose - The Swedish government is likely to implement longer and heavier road freight vehicles, so-called high-capacity vehicles (HCVs), in the near future. The purpose of this paper is to analysis the expected effects on the whole transport system regarding tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres on road, CO2 and socio-economics with three possible implementation strategies (HCVs on all roads, a designated road network and a designated road network with a kilometre-based truck charge) and two vehicle types (74 t/25.25m and 74 t/34m).
   Design/methodology/approach - Calculations are based on two well-established scenarios for transport development in Sweden. Changes per tonne-kilometre are modelled for ten product groups with considerations taken to their transport networks. Socio-economic effects are analysed using the net present value rating method over a 40-year period.
   Findings - The study shows the increase in demand for transport and the modal shift, from rail and sea to road, in terms of tonne-kilometres, vehicle-kilometres and CO2 emissions for three implementation strategies of HCVs in two scenarios. All implementation strategies show a positive social net-benefit with the introduction of HCVs.
   Research limitations/implications - The results reveal potential benefits to the implementation of HCVs. The results are limited by possible over/under-estimations of effects considered in the calculations, due to uncertainties and assumptions.
   Practical implications - The results highlight expected levels of modal shift and induced transport for different HCV implementation strategies and how they depend on transport and climate policies and the expected growth of tonne-kilometres.
   Originality/value - The calculations consider socio-economic effects, particularly from increased CO2 emissions due to modal shift and induced traffic, which is lacking in previous studies. To balance conflicting economic and environmental goals, the findings indicate that the implementation of HCVs could be accompanied by other policy measures. The findings are based on the Swedish context, but the model can be adapted to other countries or regions and to study other freight transport reforms.

AB  - The economies of size in Norwegian dairy farming are far from exploited. There is increasing pressure on cost savings through faster farm restructuring. Such a structural transition could have severe effects on other concerns (rural employment and social well being, landscape preservation, biodiversity, heritage values, etc.) valued by the society. A simulation model is developed to study effects of alternative rates of structural change on the social costs of milk production, farm employment and farm subsidies. The model is based on economic conditions at the farm level for various size groups and regions. Changes in the model's farm structure depend on the exit rate of existing farms in various size groups and the size of newly established farms. When new farms are substituted for existing farms, a rapid change in farm structure and a new herd size of 60 cows (the largest evaluated) results in the lowest costs. Approximately 60% of the cost savings achieved by larger farms can be attributed to lower labour input, resulting in considerable losses of employment. Job losses will have the greatest negative family and community impacts in areas located far from urban centres, because a large share of the milk is produced is such areas, farms are smaller and there are fewer non-farm employment opportunities. Government support is necessary to preserve small farms' provision of multiple benefits. The balance between cost-saving pressures and the rationales for retaining small farms under increasingly liberalized market regimes is bound to be a complex issue. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The Swedish licensing system for wastewater sludge use in agriculture, REVAQ, sets challenges. These include a maximum nominal accumulation rate of 0.2%/year on farmland, for specified metals, to be reached by 2025. Here a model is suggested, and applied for the Gothenburg regional wastewater treatment plant, Gryaab, to quantify historic sludge quality improvements and necessary future development. Local sampling campaigns covering two decades show a substantial reduction of heavy metals and ecologically harmful organic substances (such as adsorbable organic halogens, nonylphenols, phthalates, naphthalenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) from households and society at large. For the metals studied the historic mass flow reduction to sludge varies from 1 to 2%/year for mercury, zinc and copper to 15%/year for silver. Copper needs further reduction, involving water pipes and copper roofing. Silver is rare in soil, and significant reduction from already low levels is needed to reach the accumulation goal. Further reduction of other metals involves addressing storm- and drainage water entering the sewers and the sediments already in the sewers. Fulfilling the goals of REVAQ implies national and local measures affecting public and private stakeholders including property owners, the wastewater collection system, commercial businesses and legislating authorities.

AB  - Archaeological and historical records suggest that cultivation became established rather late in northern Fennoscandia, preferably in coastal villages of northernmost Sweden during the 14th century. The expansion of these settlements has obliterated the relevant biological archives, thus restricting our ability to conduct palaeoecological studies of the oldest villages and limiting our knowledge of their cultivation history. In a secondary phase, new settlements were established around the periphery of these primary villages. We hypothesize that such secondary villages, which generally are only moderately affected by urban expansion, may function as key sites for vegetation-history studies and that the results can be extrapolated to provide clues about the establishment of primary villages and the initiation of associated permanent cultivations. Analyses of pollen, pollen accumulation rates, charred particles and loss-on-ignition residues from a small lake in the secondary village of Arnemark revealed continuous land use from at least c. 1650 cal. BP (cal. ad 300), a step-up phase in grazing and trampling around 1200 cal. BP (cal. ad 750), and permanent cultivation during the last c. 625 years (cal. ad 1325). The results suggest that the secondary village was established around cal. ad 750, that is, c. 600 years earlier than previously thought and that cultivation here was initiated at the same time as has been suggested for the primary villages by the coast. In this study, we also demonstrate that using pollen from old cereal types as references can make the distinction between cereal and wild-grass pollen more reliable.

AB  - Rogaland Council has adopted Universal Design as an overriding principle for all planning and development in the county. Private stakeholders and public agencies collaborated in the development of a successful County Plan for Universal Design that has been recognised as an example of good practice by Norway's public authorities. The plan provides guidelines for both state and municipal planning and operations in several policy areas from public transport to educational and cultural buildings to sports and recreation areas. One of the main contributions of the plan is an evaluation methodology built on the "TEK-10" national standard, and developed with the participation of authorities, experts, staff from municipalities and representatives of organisations for people with disabilities. This method is used to assess the accessibility and compliance with Universal Design principles of different destinations. This information is then published in the dedicated website www.tilgjengelighet.no which serves as an information channel for the general public about accessibility to various locations in the county. A community engagement method has been developed for including user groups in the design process for both new buildings and renovation projects. Representatives for user groups are chosen by the Council's Disability Committee, and these help to inform the planning and construction process. The plan also emphasises the development of knowledge and skills in Universal Design through educational programmes for secondary schools and colleges as well as training opportunities for councillors. This paper summarises the plan's rationale and the progress made until now.

Primary data were collected through a questionnaire survey in five European countries - United Kingdom, Finland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic and were processed by categorical data analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Findings - It was identified that medical services have proven to be the most important key factor in the assessment and development of health and wellbeing tourism destinations followed by the environment. Accommodation and wellness services are the third and fourth key factors which have significant influence on H&WB tourism destination. Originality/value - The identification of the environment as the second most important key factor for evaluation and development of H&WB tourism destination is an important step in the strategic decision-making process from which they are derived development of products, choice of price tools and other tasks of the destination management focused on health and human well-being.

AB  - First, this paper reviews the literature of technology competition in car industry. Secondly, technology forecasting method used in this study utilized retrieved patent data to define the technological life cycles of battery electric vehicle technology. Thirdly, life cycle assessment (LCA) is made for six selected OECD countries (Estonia, Finland, France Iceland, Israel and Norway) in order to compare the environmental impacts of internal combustion engine and electric vehicle technologies with widely different electricity generation mixes. For cars, the life cycle assessment considers the environmental impact throughout the entire life cycle, from raw material extraction and acquisition, through energy and material production and manufacturing, to use and end-of-life treatment and final disposal. For fuels and electricity, the whole life cycle from cradle to gate is considered. The results show significant differences in the environmental impacts between the countries. In addition of analyzing industrial dynamics and environmental impacts, we also provide policy recommendations for how government's policy can support the transition towards more sustainable automobile transportation.

AB  - Global society is rapidly ageing. Research on ageing and mobility suggests that better synergies could exist between older people and the built environment. The age-in-place policy will put increased demands on the transport system as a key facilitator for access. The main goal of this study is to examine the spatial distribution of older adults, assessing if it could be affected by selective characteristics of the surrounding built environment and, if so, to what extent. The study district is the region of Scania in the southern part of Sweden. Register-based longitudinal socio-demographic data such as income, employment and education associated with the outcomes of previous travel surveys conducted in the region are the main data sources to be considered. Correlated with population density patterns and expansion of the railway network, this longitudinal approach is expected to reveal causal inferences. Better knowledge may be gained about the environmental and demographic factors that may potentially lead older people to adapt their mobility choices according to the area in which they reside. Research findings could provide useful policy recommendations both to land use and transport planners, contributing to the development of age-friendly neighborhoods, cities and regions.

AB  - Noise and anthropogenic disturbances from vessel traffic are an important threat to the recovery of the endangered St. Lawrence Estuary (SLE) beluga population. The consequences of acoustic masking could be particularly adverse in the case of critical vocalizations that maintain contact between mothers and their dependent but mobile calves. This study models the communication range of adults, sub-adults and newborn beluga contact calls in the presence and absence of vessels in an important summering area for this population. Ambient noise measurements, a composite beluga audiogram and apparent source levels of adult/sub-adult and newborn calls, informed the model. Apparent source levels were estimated from received levels of contact calls produced by four individuals carrying digital acoustic tags in the SLE, Canada, and from received levels of calls recorded from two adults and a newborn calf at an aquarium, at known distances from a calibrated hydro phone. The median communication ranges were over 18 times larger for SLE adult and sub-adult calls than for newborn calls, with a 57 and 53% reduction in range in the presence of vessel noise, respectively. For newborn calls, this results in a median range of 170 m in vessel noise. These first estimates of the communication range of beluga vocalizations with a known function suggest that masking of the quiet calls of newborns by anthropogenic noise could impair mother-calf contact. This article is part of the special cluster Beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas): knowledge from the wild, human care and TEK, which has been funded by Mystic Aquarium, CAFF and the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment.

AB  - Electronic (e-) invoices potentially enhance environmental sustainability in several stages from production of paper to its usage. This study investigates empirically to what extent a set of firm characteristics and external factors associate with the probability to send e-invoices and with the intensity of usage, based on a representative survey of approximately 1500 Swedish firms. An invoice is considered electronic when it is exchanged in an automated system between the buyer and the seller. The analysis includes firms with one employee or larger across all industries except, agriculture, fishery, forestry, public administration and defence. Descriptive statistics show that 42 per cent of the firms in 2016 send e-invoices. By use of a two-part model, estimation results reveal that both internal and external factors are associated with the e-invoice behaviour. The probability of adoption is significantly higher for firms with government sector clients and a large number of invoices. The intensity estimation exhibits a reverse pattern, where the number of e-invoices is most strongly associated with the invoice pattern. Another internal factor of importance for the extent of e-invoices is the level of labour productivity. Construction firms have the highest probability to adopt e-invoices and manufacturing firms scale-up the usage. Besides this, neither industry affiliation nor size-class is crucial. When size-class is estimated separately, it appears that medium-sized and large firms strongly associate their invoice adoption with type of client, while the extent of the activity is solely related to internal factors. For micro enterprises and small firms, kind of client is the most important aspect at all. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article is an examination of one conflict story out of a total of 101 conflict stories from a Norwegian urban hospital. The data comes from an ethnographic study and was gathered through interviews, observations, and existing documents. The author demonstrates how conceptualizing professional conflicts as narratives can bring new insights to understanding, explaining, and resolving conflicts. A major contribution of the narrative approach to conflict management is the emphasis on the conflict as an integral part of the story. Conflict management. approaches inspired by research from a positivistic tradition often look beyond the story to the real issues, treating the stories as anecdotes. Within the narrative approach, the parties' stories are considered an integral part of the conflict and solution.

AB  - Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an urgent challenge for mankind. However, as aggregate emissions continue to rise, necessary changes in industrial practices are lagging behind. The article addresses this discrepancy by exploring how the issue of GHG reduction is channeled from policy to industry, in one of the more GHG intensive sectors, agriculture. We adopt the translation perspective to analyze and discuss how the climate issue travels between contexts. Our study explores the activities involved as advisors, functioning as translating agents within Swedish agri-policy, inform producers about the issue of GHG reduction. The study sheds new light on the effectiveness of mitigation policy in promoting practice change and illustrates how translation is an analytical framework suitable for studying this within different industries.

AB  - Taxonomic richness and community composition were related to environmental variables in 88 streams in an area of 60,000 km(2) in central Sweden. In all, 247 macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded and taxonomic richness observed per site ranged from 21 to 77. Partial least squares regression analysis suggested that taxonomic richness was positively and most strongly correlated with channel width and catchment size. Correlations were also positive, but weaker, with the percentage of lakes in the catchment, temperature and macrophyte abundance, whereas the degree of shading, moss coverage and distance to upstream lakes showed negative associations with species richness. The number of 'rare' (found at <25 % of the sites) and 'very rare' (found at <10 % of the sites) taxa, showed similar trends although the correlation with distance below upstream lakes was positive rather than negative in the 'very rare' taxa category. The most taxa-rich sites were found in streams of intermediate size leading to a significant quadratic relationship between catchment size and taxonomic richness. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that catchment area, distance from upstream lakes, substratum, temperature, altitude, amount of macrophytes, pH, colour, and Fontinalis spp. were the variables explaining most variation in community composition. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Diptera: Simuliidae showed nested distribution patterns, i.e. species-rich sites tended to be inhabited by species present also at species-poor sites. Some taxa, however, deviated from expected distributions possibly because they are sensitive to biotic interactions, restricted to small streams, or specialised with respect to some habitat features. In comparisons with other studies of Swedish macroinvertebrates, we observed differences suggesting that the design of studies, including the selection of geographical regions and limited range of stream sizes, can importantly influence the results.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic impact and global change effects on natural ecosystems has prompted the development of less expensive and more efficient bioassessments methodologies. One promising approach is the integration of DNA metabarcoding in environmental monitoring. A critical step in this process is the inference of ecological quality (EQ) status from identified molecular bioindicator signatures that mirror environmental classification based on standard macroinvertebrate surveys. The most promising approaches to infer EQ from biotic indices (BI) are supervised machine learning (SML) and the calculation of indicator values (IndVal). In this study we compared the performance of both approaches using DNA metabarcodes of bacteria and ciliates as bioindicators obtained from 152 samples collected from seven Norwegian salmon farms. Results from standard macroinvertebrate-monitoring of the same samples were used as reference to compare the accuracy of both approaches. First, SML outperformed the IndVal approach to infer EQ from eDNA metabarcodes. The Random Forest (RF) algorithm appeared to be less sensitive to noisy data (a typical feature of massive environmental sequence data sets) and uneven data coverage across EQ classes (a typical feature of environmental compliance monitoring scheme) compared to a widely used method to infer IndVals for the calculation of a BI. Second, bacteria allowed for a more accurate EQ assessment than ciliate eDNA metabarcodes. For the implementation of DNA metabarcoding into routine monitoring programmes to assess EQ around salmon aquaculture cages, we therefore recommend bacterial DNA metabarcodes in combination with SML to classify EQ categories based on molecular signatures.

AB  - The Russian Barents Sea represents a celebrated example of sustainable fisheries management owing to effective and stable bilateral cooperation between Norway and Russia. The success of the state regime has not ruled out the emergence of private certification of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The current study investigates the intended and unintended implications of the emergence and implementation of MSC certification in the Russian Barents Sea region. The employed conceptual framework builds on the literature on private informational governance, more specifically by providing an analytical prism of three core concepts: transparency, participation and trust: Based on interviews with stakeholders closely involved in MSC certification in Russia and literature analysis, this study concludes that MSC performs primarily a supplementary commercial function for Russian Barents Sea fisheries, which are already generally considered as sustainable, by ensuring access to the world market of sustainable fish and potentially providing a premium price. The certification mechanism has little to add to the well established practices at sea, but it does urge companies to prioritise attention to such environmental issues as bycatch, discards and negative effects of bottom trawling through encouraging cooperation between fishing companies, NGOs and research institutions. Our analysis also suggests that indirectly MSC certification contributes to a growing divide between larger-scale, internationally oriented, distant water fishing companies and the smaller-scale coastal fisheries dependent on state support. Finally, our analysis draws attention to the distrust of the Russian state in transnational private governance arrangements, like MSC, the implications of which are currently unclear.

AB  - Philopatry and monogamy are conventionally viewed as strategies for improving fitness. Many philopatric and monogamous species have, however, been shown to perform breeding dispersal-an exchange of territory (and often also partner) between two breeding seasons. The adaptiveness of breeding dispersal remains controversial, as data remain scarce and sporadic. For the Northern Goshawk, a typically highly philopatric and monogamous forest raptor, pairs breeding in barren forest landscapes produce fewer fledglings than pairs breeding in more productive landscapes. Using data on Finnish breeding female Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) during 1999-2016, we tested the hypotheses that: (1) breeding dispersal is more likely at barren territories, (2) dispersing females move to less barren territories, and (3) breeding dispersal improves the survival of young. About 29% of the female Goshawks in our study performed breeding dispersal, which contrasts to philopatry and suggest that site and partner fidelities show large variation within the species' breeding range. We found no evidence that territorial landscape barrenness (proxy on habitat quality) affects the probability of breeding dispersal. However, females that dispersed upgraded to less barren territories. Nevertheless, there were no subsequent effects of breeding dispersal on reproductive performance, suggesting no obvious difference in the capability of rearing young at either site. Although dispersal events were directed to less barren habitats, we suggest that female dispersal is not driven by the pursue for more prospersous habitats, rather that those females are forced to move, for whatever reason. In addition to other observed reasons such as female-female competition for mates and loss of the original mate, intense logging of mature forests lowering local food availability and restricting nest site availability were likely a partial cause of increased breeding dispersal.

AB  - Several alien predator species have spread widely in Europe during the last five decades and pose a potential enhanced risk to native nesting ducks and their eggs. Because predation is an important factor limiting Northern Hemisphere duck nest survival, we ask the question, do alien species increase the nest loss risk to ground nesting ducks? We created 418 artificial duck nests in low densities around inland waters in Finland and Denmark during 2017-2019 and monitored them for seven days after construction using wildlife cameras to record whether alien species visit and prey on the nests more often than native species. We sampled various duck breeding habitats from eutrophic agricultural lakes and wetlands to oligotrophic lakes and urban environments. The results differed between habitats and the two countries, which likely reflect the local population densities of the predator species. The raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), an alien species, was the most common mammalian nest visitor in all habitats and its occurrence reduced nest survival. Only in wetland habitats was the native red fox (Vulpes vulpes) an equally common nest visitor, where another alien species, the American mink (Neovison vison), also occurred among nest visitors. Although cautious about concluding too much from visitations to artificial nests, these results imply that duck breeding habitats in Northern Europe already support abundant and effective alien nest predators, whose relative frequency of visitation to artificial nests suggest that they potentially add to the nest predation risk to ducks over native predators.

AB  - Discrepancies in time-space representation of indata and calibration/validation data obstructs analysis of hydrological processes thatlink natural and anthropogenic water infrastructure in catchments and landscapes. To improve indata for hydrological- and modelling of the soil-plant-atmosphere-continuum, this paper presents a high-resolution dataset of hydrological functions in the agricultural landscape of Tidan, Sw Sweden. We firstly address spatial representation of soil physical parameters, describing soil water flows and storage. Secondly, we derive tile drainage datasets from historical maps. Lastly, we explore delineation and spatial location of streams, ditches and waterbodies to improve description of water connectivity. The new soil datasets with top- and subsoil descriptions varied in depicting the sensitivity of saturated hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity. The most representative soil map showed moderate (34%) - to very rapid (21%) saturated hydraulic conductivity, water holding capacity below 40 mm 10 cm-1 (94%) and a dry bulk density ranging between 1.2 and 1.8 g cm-3 (71%). The digitalization of drained fields suggests that 69% of the arable fields are under tile drainage, dominated by sandy loam, loam and clay loam. The combined stream network resulted in 5350 km of streams and ditches, + 14% km and + 129%, respectively, compared to available best resolution datasets. Landscape surface water storage increased with a small addition (+ 6439 m3 storage potential) compared to previously available datasets. The improved descriptors of natural and anthropogenic flow and storage can potentially serve to improve water quantity and quality modelling under current and future climate- and hydrological changes.

AB  - Ants are an important part of biodiversity and are useful bioindicators. Our aim was to determine whether ant species richness and composition differ among large clear-cuts (ca. 3000 m(2)), small forest gaps (ca. 400 m(2)), and areas of mature forest. The research was conducted in a large plantation of Picea abies in the Jizerske Mountains in the Czech Republic at an elevation of ca. 900 m a.s.l. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in three areas, each of which had a large clear-cut, mature forest, and gaps; a randomized complete block design was used. Species richness and composition of ant assemblages differed significantly among plots in the three treatments. The results showed that ant abundance and diversity were similarly low in small gaps and in closed-canopy mature stands; in comparison, large clear-cuts supported significantly higher species richness, more complex species composition, and a higher abundance of ants. Six species were found in large clear-cuts, but only one and two species were collected in small gaps and mature forests, respectively. Our findings suggest that small-scale forest management is not suitable for maintaining ant diversity.

AB  - Simple Summary Gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infections are a significant health and welfare threat to calves in pasture-based rearing systems. Sustainable control requires an efficient and cost-effective diagnostic tool. The serum pepsinogen assay is a long-established tool to monitor the infection level. However, the relatively high cost and lack of standardisation hinder the broad implementation of this method. Here, the more cost-efficient and robust Ostertagia ostertagi-Ab ELISA is evaluated as a potential alternative diagnostic method in first-season grazing (FSG) calves. We performed both a literature review of studies where this method has been applied in FSG calves and conducted field studies in Belgium and Sweden to compare results from the O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA with the serum pepsinogen assay. We conclude that the O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA test is a valuable monitoring tool in FSG calves and could complement or replace the serum pepsinogen assay. The O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA assay is widely used as a diagnostic tool for monitoring gastrointestinal (GI) nematodes using milk samples from adult dairy cows. This assay is potentially also useful to analyse serum samples from first-season grazing (FSG) calves, providing a more cost-effective and robust diagnostic technique than the current serum pepsinogen assay. However, a comprehensive evaluation of its use in serum samples from FSG calves has not yet been conducted. In this study, we first reviewed the available scientific literature in which the O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA was applied to serum samples from FSG calves. Then, a field study was conducted to compare results from the O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA assay with a serum pepsinogen assay on a set of 230 serum samples from 11 commercial dairy herds (seven in Belgium and four in Sweden). The literature review showed an increase in mean antibody levels, expressed as optical density ratio (ODR) values, from <0.4 (early grazing season) to values of 0.7-1.1 (late grazing season). Three out of five studies found a negative correlation between O. ostertagi antibody levels measured during the late grazing season and weight gain, while the other two studies found no correlation between the two variables. Our field studies showed a good correlation between O. ostertagi antibody levels and the results from the pepsinogen assay. Both indicators were negatively related to average daily weight gain in the Belgian herds, but not in the Swedish herds. Overall, the results suggest that the O. ostertagi-Ab ELISA test can be a useful tool in FSG calves and could replace the use of the serum pepsinogen assay at the end of the grazing season for general monitoring purposes.

AB  - Decomposition of coarse woody debris (CWD) bark is characterized by complex and poorly understood dynamics with unclear implications for carbon and nutrient cycling and biodiversity. We examined changes in cover and physical parameters through decomposition of bark attached to logs of the main tree species in an old-growth middle boreal forest. In a 66 yrs long chronosequence after tree death and fall, we analyzed changes in the following parameters of log bark: cover, moisture, area-specific mass, total mass, dry bulk density, thickness and proportion of phloem. The percent of bark left on the sampled stems decreased with time since tree death and averaged 38%, 61% and 86% for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies), and silver and downy birch (Betula pubescens and Betula pendula) = aspen (Populus tremula), respectively. Bark moisture increased along with succession of epixylic vegetation on logs that progressed similarly for all studied tree species. On average, no vegetation was recorded on logs 3 yrs after tree death. In 9 yrs, logs were characterized by the first stage of sparse vegetation cover. The closed groups of the second stage, with cover of not less than 70%, consisted mainly of non-epigeous species, and developed an average of 19 yrs after tree death. The third stage was dominated by ground cryptogam species without a significant contribution of vascular plants, and the fourth stage, when the wood was completely overgrown by the establishment and spread of vascular plants, was observed and average of 30 yrs after tree death. The exponential rate of total mass loss of bark increased at rates of 0.068, 0.110, 0.197 and 0.312 yr(-1) for birch, aspen, spruce, and pine, respectively. The highest rate of bulk density loss was recorded for aspen (0.024 yr(-1)) and did not differ for birch, pine and spruce (0.009 yr(-1)). The decomposition rate was expressed as a rate of bark mass loss divided by initial volume (integrating losses due to bark mineralization, peeling, consumption by insects and sloughing from logs). It averaged 0.147 yr(-1) for birch, aspen and spruce and 0.291 yr(-1) for pine, independent of stem section, log diameter and decay class. In old-growth forests, where CWD volumes may reach hundreds of cubic meters, the accurate portrayal of bark decomposition patterns is crucial for estimating the role of CWD in carbon and nutrient cycles and the diversity of CWD-dependent organisms with different habitat requirements.

AB  - Recently, Europe is experiencing more frequent and greater floods compared to the last 500 years due to climate change among other factors. This has increased the associated risks, especially in urban areas, which poses a great challenge to all stakeholders. To protect traffic networks from possible floods, this paper uses QGIS, remote sensing data, and HEC-HMS model to assess flooding events and possible adaptation measures. Two case studies have been taken; 1) a 60-mm rain-storm that occurred in 2012 on a main road in the Northern part of Sweden (NB)); and 2) a 35 -mm rainstorm that occurred in 2019 in the Southern part of Gothenburg (GO). The resulting flood hydrographs show that the peak reached are 0.5 m3/s and 3.8 m3/s in GO and NB, respectively. To adapt to these flood events, four adaptation measures were assessed namely afforestation, permeable pavements & green roofs, multi-use detention basins and culvert installation consid-ering food production, biodiversity, prosperity, and the environment. The study has shown that afforestation is an effective flood risk mitigation measure to handle both moderate and extreme rain events. Well-maintained permeable surfaces and green roofs are effective in reducing flooding due to moderate rainfall, but not in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall events. Well-designed multi-functional detention basins are good flood protection measures, however, if they are not well-maintained, their efficiency may be reduced by up to 90 %. Culverts are effective for frequent and limited rain events, but extreme rain events may even increase flood risk and thereby contribute to damaging the infrastructure.

AB  - This paper proposes to rethink the agriculture-migration nexus through the notions of temporal fix and migrant hierarchies. Its empirical setting is the post-socialist migration of Latvians who move to the Channel Island of Guernsey and to Norway, where they take temporary jobs picking crops such as tomatoes and strawberries. I analyse both how agricultural migrants are viewed by others and how they evaluate themselves. The research material comes from long-term ethnographic engagement with Latvian migrants in these two destinations. In both geographical contexts, temporary agricultural work positions migrants at the bottom of the labour hierarchy. Yet, because of their experience of agriculture in the homeland in Soviet and early post-Soviet times, and because being close to nature is part of Latvian cultural identity, such work is viewed as fundamental and positive. Experiences abroad are nevertheless 'shocking' because of the tough work under strict capitalist regulations. Yet the work is endured either as a step to a better job abroad, or as a means of accumulating income for a better life upon return 'home'.

AB  - Lysevatten, a lake in southwest Sweden, has experienced both acidification and recent changes in the amount of lake-water organic carbon (TOC), both causing concern across Europe and North America. A range of paleolimnological tools - diatom-inferred pH, inferred lake-water TOC from visible-near-infrared spectroscopy (VNIRS), multi-element geochemistry and pollen analysis, combined with geochemical modeling were used to reconstruct the lake's chemistry and surroundings back to the most recent deglaciation 12 500 years ago. The results reveal that the recent anthropogenic impacts are similar in magnitude to the long-term variation driven by natural catchment changes and early agricultural land use occurring over centuries and millennia. The combined reconstruction of both lake-water TOC and lithogenic element delivery can explain the major changes in lake-water pH and modeled acid neutralizing capacity during the past 12 500 years. The results raise important questions regarding what precisely comprises "reference" conditions (i.e., free from human impacts) as defined in the European Water Framework Directive.

AB  - Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides, LMB) and Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu, SMB) are among the most highly invasive species across the globe, but are simultaneously among the most highly sought-after game fish. To explain these disparate views, data on invasive status and angling participation of these two species were compiled at the country level. Largemouth Bass were found established in 62 countries on five continents, whereas SMB were found established in only nine countries on the same five continents. Invasive risk assessments were disparate between the species, with more for SMB (N = 29) than LMB (N = 27). In every instance save one (Finland), SMB were considered "invasive" compared to LMB, which were "invasive" in only 74% of assessments. Twenty-eight countries with non-native black bass have groups that participate in high-profile fishing tournament such the Black Bass World Championship, BASS (Bass Anglers Sportsmans Society) Nation, and Major League Fishing. Most countries with fishing tournaments occur in countries with established LMB populations than in countries with established SMB populations, suggesting a greater economic importance on LMB fishing. The struggle between conserving biodiversity and relying upon economic benefits from fishing for introduced species is a wicked problem likely to continue into the future.

AB  - The Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is a well-known tourist destination, visited annually by almost 2 million tourists. Among the different types of accommodation available to visitors, Bed and Breakfast (B&B) on the Airbnb platform have become very popular. This exploratory study discusses how the human capital of some B&B lifestyle entrepreneurs affects their plans and practices of sustainability. Human capital theory (Becker, G. (1964). Human Capital. The University of Chicago Press.) is discussed by intersecting it with a sociological perspective represented by the two main Bordieuan forms of capital, namely cultural and social capital (1986 and 1992). The research is based on data collected between June 2017 and October 2020 through semi-structured interviews and field observation of fourteen rural B&B lifestyle entrepreneurs listed on Airbnb. Results show that participants' cultural capital is high and constantly developing through the acquisition of new knowledge on sustainable measures that can be applied to their businesses. Their current social capital in Gotland, on the other hand, is still quite underdeveloped.

AB  - Background, Goal and Scope. System expansion is a method used to avoid co-product allocation. Up to this point in time it has seldom been used in LCA studies of food products, although food production systems often are characterised by closely interlinked sub-systems. One of the most important allocation problems that occurs in LCAs of agricultural products is the question of how to handle the co-product beef from milk production since almost half of the beef production in the EU is derived from co-products from the dairy sector. The purpose of this paper is to compare different methods of handling co-products when dividing the environmental burden of the milk production system between milk and the co-products meat and surplus calves.
   Main Features. This article presents results from an LCA of organic milk production in which different methods of handling the co-products are examined. The comparison of different methods of co-product handling is based on a Swedish LCA case study of milk production where economic allocation between milk and meat was initially used. Allocation of the co-products meat and surplus calves was avoided by expanding the milk system. LCA data were collected from another case study where the alternative way of producing meat was analysed, i.e. using a beef cow that produces one calf per annum to be raised for one and a half year. The LCA of beef production was included in the milk system. A discussion is conducted focussing on the importance of modelling and analysing milk and beef production in an integrated way when foreseeing and planning the environmental consequences of manipulating milk and beef production systems.
   Results. This study shows that economic allocation between milk and beef favours the product beef. When system expansion is performed, the environmental benefits of milk production due to its co-products of surplus calves and meat become obvious. This is especially connected to the impact categories that describe the potential environmental burden of biogenic emissions such as methane and ammonia and nitrogen losses due to land use and its fertilising. The reason for this is that beef production in combination with milk can be carried out with fewer animals than in sole beef production systems.
   Conclusion, Recommendation and Perspective. Milk and beef production systems are closely connected. Changes in milk production systems will cause alterations in beef production systems. it is concluded that in prospective LCA studies, system expansion should be performed to obtain adequate information of the environmental consequences of manipulating production systems that are interlinked to each other.

AB  - ContextEven though habitat use is essential information for conservation management strategies, studying it in elusive and scarce forest species has proven challenging. Passive acoustic monitoring allows collecting accurate presence-absence data even for species that typically exhibit low detectability. It further provides tools for long-term and cost-effective biodiversity monitoring, and may also be used to infer population estimates at the landscape level.ObjectivesWe aimed to demonstrate the application of passive acoustic monitoring to the problem of detecting elusive species, especially in forests, using the Eurasian pygmy owl as a model species. We explored its habitat selection, and estimated occupancy and density at the landscape level in the managed boreal forest.MethodsWe conducted a wide-scale autonomous recording units (ARUs) survey, involving 292 sites in a single season, in a study area covering approx. 370 km(2) in south-western Finland. We clustered the detections into territories of males to infer population size by also taking into account the size of home ranges derived from GPS-tags data. Since we were simultaneously monitoring the occupancy of a network of nest boxes and previously estimated the abundance of natural cavities, we could also estimate the proportion of pygmy owls nesting in natural cavities.ResultsIncreasing availability of mature forests was consistently the most critical habitat variable both for calling and nesting sites, increasing occupancy probability of the pygmy owls in a landscape dominated by managed forests. The proportion of sites showing occupancy by the pygmy owls was 20.9%, corresponding to an estimate of ca. Six territorial males/100 km(2).ConclusionOur results confirmed that the pygmy owl can be considered a species of mature and old forests, and we provide the first data-based estimate of the total density of territorial males of this species. Passive acoustic monitoring proved to be an efficient method in detecting the presence of pygmy owls, and may overcome weaknesses of other methods, such as nest box surveys, in order to quantify population numbers.

AB  - This study assesses the potential cost-effectiveness of incentive payment programs relative to traditional, top-down regulatory programs for biological conservation. We develop site-level estimates of the opportunity cost and non-monetized biological benefits of protecting biodiversity hotspots in Finnish non-industrial private forests. We then use these estimates to contrast and compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative conservation programs. Our results suggest that incentive payment programs, which tacitly capitalize on landowners' private knowledge about the opportunity costs of conservation, may be considerably more cost-effective than traditional, top-down regulatory programs.

AB  - There are various existing practices and future potential for turning mining waste into valuable products. The inventory of the tailings in the metal mines in Finland showed that considerable concentrations of many critical metals are contained in the waste. However, the amounts of generated waste are so significant that the full implementation of circular economy is challenging. A combination of several different circular economy approaches (reduce, reprocess, upcycle, downcycle and dispose for future) is needed to manage the waste streams in mining in a holistic way. Various technologies are already in use for the recovery of metals from the tailings and for the use of the mineral residues in high and low-value products. The institutional framework has an impact on the economics of the valorisation of mine waste. Digitalisation can support in identifying where the biggest potential for valorisation exists. The rising concepts of digital material and product passports would support the circularity and the traceability of waste-based materials.

AB  - One key area has received special attention in Sweden and that is the role and working environment of the operators, e.g. the train dispatchers. It will in the future be important to have operators with the adequate knowledge and skills, working in an efficient organisation. The operators must also be supported by adaptable and adequately designed decision support and control systems.
   The emphasis in this paper is on decision support in the train traffic control centre. The goal is to develop and evaluate, simple, easy to use support tools. Support tools that must have the potential to be of practical use. In order to reach this goal it has been necessary to make a survey of how the dispatchers actually handle the process of conflict solution and re-planning. This work, as well as its results is presented in this paper. Furthermore is the design of the decision support tool to be implemented briefly described.

AB  - This paper evaluates performance of the current waste management system in the Nordic countries. The assessment is based on real data, whereas the composite indicators include waste generation, composting waste, recycling waste, landfilling waste, recycling rate, waste to the energy rate, and greenhouse gas emissions from waste. The comparison is done by recent multiple-attribute decision-making method, i.e. the best-worst method combined with the evaluation based on the distance from the average solution. Experts selected waste generation (0.26), greenhouse gas emissions from waste (0.21), rate and amount of recycling waste (0.142) as the most important indicators in the assessment. The comparative evaluation indicates that Sweden has the best waste management profile (0.9748), whereas the weakest performance was obtained for Iceland (0.2425). Sweden waste management profile presents strength in lower rate of waste generation per capita, greenhouse gas emission and landfilling section as compared to neighboring countries. The sensitivity analysis proves the robustness of our results in that Sweden's waste management performance is dominant in the Nordic region. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predatory beetles are important natural enemies of early successional cambium feeding beetles and knowledge about their ecology is of paramount importance for biological control and sustainable forest management. We used a large-scale experiment including 3 stand types (clear-cut, mature managed and old-growth stand) and 6 dead wood substrates (burned, shaded, white rot inoculated, brown rot inoculated, untreated control logs and created snags) to test substrate preferences of 10 common predatory beetle species. We collected insects in eclector traps and measured dead wood availability within 100 m from the experimental logs at each site. We also tested the relationships between predators and prey at the trap level. Stand type was important for all predators; Nudobius lentus and Ampedus tristis were more abundant on clear-cuts while Phloeonomus sjoebergi, Quedius plagiatus, Epuraea boreella, Epuraea pygmaea, Epuraea angustula, Rhizophagus dispar and Epuraea laeviscula were more abundant in mature managed and old-growth stands. Snags differed most from the control logs supporting significantly more E. boreella and E. angustula and significantly less R sjoebergi, E. pygmaea, A. tristis and R. dispar. Prey abundance proved to be more important than dead wood availability at the stand level for most species, although the response varied among species. At the trap level, the abundances of P sjoebergi, E. laeviscula and Q. plagiatus were correlated with the abundances of their known prey species. P. sjoebergi, E. boreella, E. pygmaea, R. dispar and N. lentus were correlated with total bark beetle abundance suggesting that many predators might be less specific in their choice of prey than previously thought. The variable response of the 10 examined predatory beetles at different levels of scale suggests complex relationships with their prey and environment. The conservation of this group of beetles is important both to achieve environmental goals but also for biological control of potential pest species. Thus, conservation oriented measures needs to be performed aiming at improving both substrate and stand qualities. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - AimClimate change and anthropogenic environmental deterioration strongly affect aquatic microbial communities. Although microbes have irreplaceable roles in various ecosystems, the spatial variation in microbial communities has received less attention in comparison to macro-organisms. Studies aiming to disentangle the effects of local environmental, catchment and climatic variables on microbial communities are also rare. Here, we disentangled the effects of local, catchment, spatial and climatic variables on boreal stream diatom and bacterial communities.
   LocationWestern Finland
   MethodsWe sampled 21 boreal river basins comprising 105 study sites spanning 520km in north-south direction and 330km in east-west direction in western Finland. We used principal coordinates of neighbour matrix analysis (PCNM), redundancy analyses (RDA), variation partitioning, boosted regression trees (BRT) and regression analyses to examine variation in community composition and species richness.
   ResultsWater chemistry and physical variables had significant effects on the community composition of both microbial groups. Catchment level variables explained a slightly larger amount of variation in diatom community composition than local level variables. Agriculture was the most significant determinant of variation in diatom community composition among catchment level variables and was also related with variation in the richness of both groups. Of spatial and climatic variables, growing degree days (GDD) and spatial variables were the most significant drivers determining diatom community composition. GDD was also positively associated with the richness of diatoms and bacteria. Unique effects of spatial and climate variables accounted for the largest amount of variation in the community composition of both diatoms and bacteria.
   Main conclusionsOur results highlight that aquatic microbial communities can exhibit biogeographical variation at regional scales due to the joint influence of local, catchment and climatic variables, and possibly because of dispersal limitation. Catchment properties, especially agriculture, can be used as a proxy for the effects of landscape alteration on aquatic microbial communities.

AB  - Browsing damages to young trees can have lasting impacts on forest structure. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the most common and widespread large herbivore in central Europe, create a vast majority of this damage. To lessen the impact, it is important to understand the relationship between roe deer and the landscape matrix, and which factors such as food availability and cover will drive the use of habitat by roe deer. In this study, we explored how small scale-food availability (5 x 5 m2), forest structure (100 x 100 m2) and landscape heterogeneity (500 m radius) influenced the use of habitat by roe deer in an intensively managed temperate mountainous mixed forest with implemented retention forestry practices. Using camera-trap detections of roe deer from 130 study plots in the southern Black Forest, monitored for 2.5 years, we found that local forest structure had the strongest in-fluence on roe deer habitat use. Contrary to our expectations, landscape features, such as edge density between forest and non-forest, did not affect roe deer detections, probably because overall anthropogenic pressure is high and homogenous throughout our study system. Small-scale food availability also had little influence, which is likely due to widespread availability throughout the study area. Roe deer were also detected less where there were higher amounts of lying deadwood in autumn, indicating that retention forestry methods may have a negative impact on roe deer habitat use. Since forest structure was the strongest driver of roe deer habitat use, this study supports earlier claims that forests may be managed by affecting roe deer habitat use, thereby browsing damage intensity, through manipulation of food availability and cover.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate why companies reduce transportation emissions by examining the relative importance of external drivers vs internal motives for companies in considering CO2 emissions in freight transportation.
   Design/methodology/approach - A framework is suggested that captures internal, competitiveness-driven motives and external, stakeholder-driven drivers for companies seeking to reduce CO2 in freight transportation. These factors are tested in a large industry survey in Sweden. The survey resulted in 172 responses from corporate heads of logistics, a response rate of 40.3 per cent.
   Findings - Variations in responding to stakeholder pressure vs company strategy for reducing transportation emissions are identified. Company strategy outweighs stakeholder pressure in determining whether a company intends to green its transportation. The strategy leads to company-internal motives for reducing transportation emissions which differ from company to company. These differences, in turn, lead to different levels of intended reductions. Stakeholder pressure sets the minimal levels that elevate the performance of a group of companies in an industry or a country, but the differentiation effect across companies is lost. The intention to reduce emissions is greatest if a company has both economic and image motives. The logistics resource configuration does not seem to impact drivers and motives.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is based on companies in Sweden. Studies across several countries are needed to investigate the impact of national requirements.
   Originality/value - The paper shows that the combination of the resource-based view and stakeholder theory presents a better explanation as to why companies reduce transportation emissions than either of them do separately. By combining the two theories this research differentiates between how stakeholder pressure and company strategy influence intents to green transportation.

AB  - Young juveniles of many motile benthic species are concentrated in structurally complex habitats, but the proximate causes of this distribution are usually not clear. In the present study, I assessed three potentially important processes affecting distribution and abundance of early benthic stages in the shore crab (Carcinus maenas): (1) selection of habitat by megalopae (postlarvae); (2) habitat-specific predation; and (3) post-settlement movements by juveniles. These processes were assessed concurrently over 3 - 9 days at two spatial scales: at the scale of square meters using cage techniques within nursery areas, and at the scale of hectares using isolated populations of juvenile shore crabs in small nursery areas as mesocosms. The results were compared to habitat-specific distribution in the field. Shore crab megalopae and first instar juveniles (settlers) were distributed non-randomly among micro-habitats in the assessed nursery areas, with great densities in both mussel beds, eelgrass and filamentous algal patches (on average 114-232 settlers m(-2)), and significantly smaller densities on open sand habitats at all times (on average 4 settlers m(-2)). The same habitat-specific settlement pattern was found in cages where predators were excluded, suggesting that active habitat selection at settlement was responsible for the initial distribution. Older juveniles (second to ninth instar crabs) were also sparse on sand, but in contrast to settlers, were concentrated in mussel beds, which showed significantly greater densities than eelgrass and algal habitats. The cage experiment demonstrated a dynamic distribution of juvenile crabs. Young juveniles constantly migrated over open sand habitats (20 m or further) and colonized the experimental plots in a habitat-specific pattern that reflected the distribution in the field. This pattern was also found for very small crabs colonizing predator-exclusion cages, suggesting that selection of habitat by migrating juveniles caused the ontogenetic change in habitat use. Although post-settlement movements were great within nursery areas, juvenile dispersal at a regional scale appeared to be small, and the recruitment of juvenile shore crabs to the shallow bays occurred mainly through pelagic megalopae. Conservative estimates at the scale of whole nursery areas, based on migration trap data and field samples, indicated great mortality of settlers and early benthic stages of shore crabs. Results from the cage experiment suggest that predation by crabs and shrimp were responsible for the high settlement mortality. Both enclosed cannibalistic juvenile crabs and local predators on uncaged habitat plots caused significant losses of settlers in all habitats (on average 22% and 64% 3 day(-1), respectively). The effect of predators was highly variable between trials, but differed little between habitat types, and predation had no detectable proximate effect on juvenile distribution, despite the great losses. Small settlement densities on sand habitats in combination with a refuge at low prey numbers, and an aggregation of cannibalistic juvenile crabs in nursery habitats appear to decrease the effect of habitat-specific predation rates on the distribution of juvenile shore crabs.
   This study demonstrates that active habitat selection at settlement followed by a dynamic redistribution of young juveniles can be the proximate processes responsible for habitat-specific distribution of epibenthic juveniles, and indicate that predation represents a major evolutionary process reinforcing this behavior.

AB  - YouTube represents an increasingly popular cultural phenomenon in the contemporary Norwegian media landscape. Since the inception of the digital video platform over 15 years ago, personal videoblogging has emerged as one of its dominant types of user-generated content. In this article, I draw from New Rhetoric genre theory and netnographic approaches to explore the beauty and lifestyle sphere on YouTube, in which several emergent genres are situated within a new media ecosystem. Through a qualitative content analysis of seven established Norwegian YouTube channels, a total of 17 individual genres were identified. Furthermore, I elaborate upon how informational, instructional, and confessional communicative functions are utilised in audiovisual publications through conventionalised digital media production practices.

AB  - Previous research points to leadership as a key ingredient in mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. We adopt a polycentric perspective and use focus group interviews with Swedish actors within the business sector, politics, and government agencies, to analyse participants' views on what it means to lead, preconditions of leadership, and division of responsibilities, in a context of transformative change. Our results suggest that participants focus on collective dimensions of leadership rather than front-running but see multiple ways of demonstrating climate leadership as being available to actors across governance levels and issue areas. Challenges to these views on leadership include the request for shared rules and regulations, and courage among leaders to enact coercive top-down leadership to handle conflicts and trade-offs. We conclude that polycentric transformative leadership is by default polysemic and will require multiple leadership roles at different scales changing over time.

AB  - The quality of education is a political priority. The European Union contributes through the principle of subsidiarity. In the Finnish and Italian education systems, assessment becomes fundamental and is closely connected to qualitative organization and to the objective of providing reliable information to plan effective policies with an increase in learning outcomes at various levels (i.e., local, regional, and national). This research explores the Italian and Finnish education systems to outline how they facilitate creating schooling systems that follow the objectives set by Agenda 2030 and are increasingly aimed at sustainability, an essential element in the relationship between humans and the environment. This study was enriched by new ideas and further research perspectives through field experience from a methodological point of view, starting from the international debate linked to the issue of sustainability and examining the OECD survey (PISA, in which European countries took part, specifically the experience of job shadowing in the city of Oulu). This investigation has highlighted the actions carried out in the Finnish educational path with the aim of tracing a "sustainable path" as an international model to follow.

AB  - The large lakes of Sweden (Vanern, Vattern, Malaren and Hjalmaren) have been monitored for more than four decades for water quality conditions to assess the impact of eutrophication from anthropogenic activities. Lake Vanern is basically an oligotrophic lake that showed signs of eutrophication, notably the emergence of algal blooms in the coastal areas (1967-1968). The lake was also contaminated, due to the discharge of pulp and paper effluents including metals such as mercury. However, ecosystem-based information is lacking for Lake Vanern. Consequently a symposium was organized in 2012 by the University of Gothenburg, Motesplats Vanersborg and the Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management Society to: assess the current status of the health of Lake Vanern's ecosystem, identify knowledge gaps and develop a road map for the future. In this regard, Lake Vanern was compared with the North American Great Lakes to learn from their extensive, long-term data sets. A special issue devoted to the State of Lake Vanern Ecosystem symposium was published in Aquatic Ecosystem Health and Management (AEHM, Vol. 17, no. 4) including keynotes and contributed papers. The conclusions shown in the appendix (available in the online supplementary information) summarize the authors' contributions. Most of the articles covered Lake Vanern, but some were directed towards monitoring and management of Great Lakes in general, and others addressed co-operation under the auspices of international agreements and directives. Based on the background information provided by the State of Lake Vanern Ecosystem symposium and its publication in the special issue, the conveners decided that a synthesis of the symposium with recommendations for the future would be useful in boosting ecosystem research in Lake Vanern.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization put stress on urban stormwater systems, triggering hydraulic overloading and urban flooding increase. Low Impact Development (LID) techniques have a high potential to mitigate their impacts. This study investigates the consequences of climate change and urbanization on the urban runoff in the Risvollan catchment in Trondheim, Norway, and the effects of LID implementation and the influence of LID spatial distributions on their performance. A SWMM model of Risvollan was implemented, along with different scenarios of urbanization and climate change. The performance of various spatial distributions of LID infrastructures in the catchment was investigated, using the outflow volume and the peak runoff at the outfall as indicators. The rainfall event-based simulation results confirmed the negative effects of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff. These effects were partially mitigated by a homogenous LID implementation. The different spatial distributions of LID had little impact on volume reduction but targeting the most downstream zones of the model was more efficient in reducing the peaks at the catchment's outlet. These findings confirm that the spatial configuration of LID might be a determinant parameter towards an efficient design of LID infrastructure in urban settings, depending on the local stakes and criteria of urban water management.

AB  - The use of large-scale, high-resolution ground-penetrating radar surveys has increasingly become a part of Norwegian cultural heritage management as a complementary method to trial trenching surveys to detect and delineate archaeological sites. The aim of this article is to collect, interpret and compare large-scale, high-resolution ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey data with results from trial trenching and subsequent large-scale excavations, and to extract descriptive and spatial statistics on detection rates and precision for both evaluation methods. This, in turn, is used to assess the advantages and disadvantages of both conventional, intrusive methods and large-scale GPR surveys. Neither method proved to be flawless, and while the trial trenching had a better overall detection rate, organic and charcoal rich features were nearly just as easily detected by both methods. Similarly, the spatial representability was similar, even though the total detection rates were lower with the GPR. This can be used as an argument in advance of integrating full-coverage GPR results into a site evaluation scheme, preferably in combination with other methods. Overall, these analyses have highlighted drawbacks and possibilities in both methods that are important contributions in understanding how to use them and integrate them in future site evaluations.

AB  - Habitat loss and climate change are rapidly converting natural habitats and thereby increasing the significance of dispersal capacity for vulnerable species. Flight is necessary for dispersal in many insects, and differences in dispersal capacity may reflect dissimilarities in flight muscle aerobic capacity. In a large metapopulation of the Glanville fritillary butterfly in the A land Islands in Finland, adults disperse frequently between small local populations. Individuals found in newly established populations have higher flight metabolic rates and field-measured dispersal distances than butterflies in old populations. To assess possible differences in flight muscle aerobic capacity among Glanville fritillary populations, enzyme activities and tissue concentrations of the mitochondrial protein Cytochrome-c Oxidase (CytOx) were measured and compared with four other species of Nymphalid butterflies. Flight muscle structure and mitochondrial density were also examined in the Glanville fritillary and a long-distance migrant, the red admiral. Glanville fritillaries from new populations had significantly higher aerobic capacities than individuals from old populations. Comparing the different species, strong-flying butterfly species had higher flight muscle CytOx content and enzymatic activity than short-distance fliers, and mitochondria were larger and more numerous in the flight muscle of the red admiral than the Glanville fritillary. These results suggest that superior dispersal capacity of butterflies in new populations of the Glanville fritillary is due in part to greater aerobic capacity, though this species has a low aerobic capacity in general when compared with known strong fliers. Low aerobic capacity may limit dispersal ability of the Glanville fritillary.

KW  - 1970s
KW  - civil disobedience
AB  - During the 1970s, hydro power construction occasioned heated political debate and large-scale civil disobedience in Norway, resulting in some projects being abandoned or heavily modified, others being carried through without significant resistance. In examining all the state-owned water power projects during the decade, this article seeks to explain the driving forces behind this resistance, as well as the different outcomes of individual cases. Most of the earlier historical studies have concentrated on a contemporary breakthrough of new ideological currents, the rejection of economic and industrial growth and centralisation as the targets of development. Ideology was surely an important driving force behind the conflicts at Mardola in 1970 and Alta in the period 1978-82. Seen more generally, however, the explanatory power,of this perspective seems to have been limited in relation to the increasing complexity of the water power projects. This complexity and the conflicts it caused were, in turn, met by institutional responses. While, on the one hand, the state power company aligned closer to its regional counterparts, on the other a stronger national administration of physical planning developed under the new Ministry of the Environment. The projects treated politically within a regional framework, Eidfjord Nord, Ulla-Forre, Leirdola and Kobbelv, were decided without significant resistance, while those subject to debate on a national level, Jotunheimen and Veig, were both rejected. The article's identification of regional energy interests as a decisive force is consistent with earlier studies of Norwegian history of energy.

AB  - Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local populations, and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (similar to 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F-ST, differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion.

AB  - Sustainable development (SD) is a central value in ECEC institutions and is highlighted in the Norwegian framework plan. ECEC institutions are required to work with SD, and the theme area is to be reflected in the institutions' annual plans. The aim of this study is to explore ECEC institutions' annual plans regarding SD. Data were collected through examinations of 30 randomly selected annual plans downloaded from the internet, and a document analysis approach was followed. The findings indicate that in total eighteen of the data sample contained no elaboration or consideration regarding SD whatsoever. It can be argued that SD is not grounded in the documents because the concept is considered a buzzword. The other key finding is that SD focuses on ecological topics, sorting and reduce non-recyclable garbage, caring for the environment and nature and more.

AB  - Fire is important in maintaining a diversity of communities and landscapes in boreal ecosystems, but, in recent times, forest management has suppressed fires. Managers now commonly burn a proportion of clear-cuts in Sweden to conserve components of the fire-favoured fauna, but effects of these treatments on the ant fauna are unknown. We compared ant communities between burned and control clear-cuts to determine their value for this important faunal group. Ants were collected in 1995 and 1996 from 5 burned and 5 control clear-cuts in mid-boreal Sweden. We compared abundances of workers and reproductive females of common species between the treatments. Burned and control clear-cuts supported similar abundances of common species, differing only in the abundance of Leptothorax acervorum queens collected in 1995. This suggests that L. acervorum was attracted to the burning, but we did not detect an increase in the abundance of its workers the following year. The abundance of dominant red wood ants (E rufa group) was not correlated with that of any other species, suggesting that their patchy occurrence did not conceal differences between treatments. Our findings suggest that nests of many ant species survive low severity fires. Habitat structure is likely to be important in determining ant community structure and low severity burning in disturbed open habitats, such as the clear-cuts examined in this study, may not significantly alter habitat structure relative to unburned habitats in the short term.

AB  - Moss, humus, till and needle samples from coniferous forests at 87-103 sites were used to elucidate how natural processes and human activities throughout a 500 km(2) area in western Finland have affected the content, accumulation and dispersion of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, S, B, Cu, Zn, Mn, Cd, Cr, Ni and Ph in the environment. Abundance, correlations and spatial trends between and within the organic, biological and inorganic compartments were determined. No evident spatial trends existed for K, P, S, Mn, Mg and Ca. The distribution of these macronutrients in and between the media is controlled, to a high degree, by biological cycling; thus the nutrient levels are optimized in the various media. Low correlation coefficients for Ca, P, K, S and Mg between humus and moss, and the low spread of these nutrients in moss and needles, are other strong indications of efficient recycling. No correlation existed between the concentrations of B and the distance from the coast, suggesting that the B patterns are unaffected by deposition of marine salts. There was T a strong spatial pattern for B in humus, moss and needles, probably connected with anthropogenic emissions from a nearby town centre. Geogenic dust affected the spatial distribution and the high correlation between Fe and Cr in moss, while natural processes were associated with the Fe anomaly found in the needles. The spatial accumulation patterns of Zn, Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb in humus and moss were strong and diverse and related to current industry, the former steel industry, traffic, coal combustion, and natural geochemical processes. An intriguing Cu anomaly in moss, probably caused by corrosion of the railway line's electric cables, was identified.

AB  - Home energy management systems (HEMS) connect homes to a smart grid and may increase the overall use of renewable energy by directing energy demand to off-peak hours and increasing energy conservation. However, the promised changes in electricity consumption have yet to be proven in real-life experiments. We therefore analysed the changes in electricity consumption, daily consumption profiles, and number of low and high consumption hours after installing HEMS in 10 Finnish households. These changes were examined in the context of the values related to energy use in each household, which were derived from semi-structured interviews. In the real-life experiment, we showed that the HEMS reduced the total consumption of electricity in the winter months by up to 30%, shifted the consumption to off-peak hours and decreased the number of high consumption hours. These changes occurred even in the homes that valued comfort over savings or ecological sustainability. Nevertheless, the levels of energy conservation varied greatly between the households and between months in the same homes.

AB  - Traffic congestion is of utmost importance for modern societies due to population and economic growth. Thus, it contributes to environmental problems like increasing greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution. Traffic signal control plays a vital role in improving traffic flow in urban networks. Hence, optimizing cycle timing at many intersections is paramount to reducing congestion and increasing sustainability. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to conventional traffic signal control, namely EcoLight, that provides significant improvements in noise levels, CO2 emissions, and fuel consumption, resulting from the incorporation of future noise predictions. A Sequence to Sequence Long Short Term Memory (SegtoSeq-LSTM) prediction model, combined with a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, allows the system to achieve higher efficiency than its competitors based on real-world data from Helsinki, Finland.

AB  - In today's political reality, the resilience and sustainability of Estonia's development depends on its ability to respond adequately to existing challenges and threats. Given the historical peculiarities of the development of the energy sector and the resulting dependence on Russian energy resources, energy independence is a key issue of national security. This raises the issue of developing the basic principles of energy policy, including the creation of new, potentially profitable gas and energy markets and the development of renewable energy. In developing its national energy sector, Estonia is taking into account EU initiatives aimed at overcoming dependence on Russian energy resources and transitioning to climate-neutral production. The subject of the study is the content and peculiarities of the Estonian energy policy formation. The purpose of the paper is to identify key areas and mechanisms for the implementation of Estonia's energy policy in the context of today's challenges. Research methodology: systematic approach, methods of analysis and generalization. The content of Estonia's energy policy is set out in a number of important documents, including the Strategy Estonia 2035 and the National Energy Development Plan until 2030. The key areas of energy policy implementation are synchronization with the power grid of continental Europe, participation in the formation of the European energy and gas market, renewable energy, development of cross-border cooperation in the energy sector, fulfillment of obligations under the European Green Deal to reduce CO2 emissions, and the role of shale production in IdaViru County. The issue of energy sustainability of Estonia and other countries in the Baltic-Finnish region is a key issue on the EU energy agenda. This is evidenced by the active public diplomacy of EU leaders to intensify cross-border cooperation of energy sector stakeholders in order to completely abandon Russian energy resources under the REPowerEU plan and to intensify the transition to climate-neutral production in the context of the European Green Deal. The EU's main energy security initiative is the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan (BEMIP), which implements various projects. Estonia uses both economic and political mechanisms to implement its energy policy. Economic mechanisms include active participation in strategic projects (Baltic Synchronization, Balticconnector), 75% of which are financed by the Connecting Europe Facility. The potential of cross-border cooperation, especially with the countries of the Baltic-Finnish region, aimed at intensifying the development of renewable energy and regional energy and gas markets, is actively used. Estonian government officials pay considerable attention to the formation of dialogue and cooperation among energy sector stakeholders, which is evidenced by their participation in various special events and declaration of their intentions for mutually beneficial cooperation in the energy sector. Research findings: the key areas of implementation of the Estonian energy policy are synchronization with the EU energy system, participation in the formation of regional gas and energy markets, and intensification of energy production from renewable sources. The implementation of Estonia's energy policy is correlated with EU initiatives and is carried out through a number of economic and political mechanisms.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to make an assessment of the 2011 reform of the public pension system in Spain using the Swedish pension system as a benchmark, although some reference to the US pension system is also made. The paper focuses on the reform, explaining its aims, breaking down the main contents, critically examining the official view and describing the expected ageing of the Spanish population. This approach complements the quantitative analyses performed by other researchers and will enable us to assess the reformed system with the focus on four main areas: actuarial fairness, actuarial transparency, solvency and communication with the public. The main conclusion is that the reform was a wasted opportunity given that Spain did not take advantage of the lessons learned in Sweden, it did not include any elements for improving the management of pay-as-you-go systems, and there is no sound basis for claiming that the system's sustainability is assured in the medium term, the long term or even the short term. The new parametric reforms currently under consideration in Spain are targeted to correct some of the pension system's design faults that have been highlighted in this paper.

AB  - Norway is a major renewable energy developer in Europe, mainly through its development of hydropower. Research has shown that solar energy also has potential in Norway, however, the cumulative installed photovoltaic capacity was only 120 MW at the end of 2019, representing 4.1% of the total electricity generation. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the main barriers to diffusing photovoltaics for residential buildings from the public sector, private sector, and the people's perspectives in Norway. Furthermore, it analyzes solar development, policies, and models in different countries, and proposes a potential model and solutions to overcome barriers. The results show that the high initial costs of photovoltaics and limited information and awareness of the possible benefits are the main barriers for the people. For the private sector, limited funding and few pilot projects to learn from, as well as risk uncertainty are the main barriers. The main concern in the public sector is the low application of existing incentives. Public-private-people partnerships (PPPP) have a big potential to overcome these barriers by dividing the high initial costs into more affordable sums, facilitating the information flow among different sectors, and involving all three sectors to create new incentives. In addition, Norway is well-suited for PPPP, as the citizens pay much attention to sustainable development, and there is already a close collaboration between the public and private sectors in the energy sector. Finally, three concrete solutions using PPPP are proposed: design a co-investment solution, provide information sharing platforms, and create new incentives.

AB  - Despite numerous attempts to transform Swedish older adult care, similar problems regarding its coordination have persisted over the years. This literature review aims to identify which coordination mechanisms can be perceived as the alleged culprit of poor coordination of integrated health and social services for seriously ill older individuals in Sweden between 2000 and 2022. Classical and contemporary coordination theories are utilised to pinpoint these coordination mechanisms, and the analysis is based on the content of collected articles from this thematic area. This literature review reveals that the following coordination mechanisms are perceived as the primary cause of poor coordination in older adult care: (1) plans, programmes, rules, and standardised work processes. Research has confirmed that decentralisation, the autonomy of regional and local authorities, new regulations implemented in the spirit of NPM, and double principalship have hindered care integration for seriously ill older adults; (2) roles, standardisation of skills, and direct supervision. Neither organisational principal adequately addresses excess employee workloads and an insufficient number of employees providing care services, which generates stress, conflicts, and even occupational burnout among staff. They do not prioritise staff competency development; (3) proximity, feedback, and adjustments through mutual communication. Most studies have shown that communication among staff is crucial to achieving integration, but it could be more effective among staff members involved in providing care. Knowledge about "objects and representations" and "routines and standardisation of outcomes" is somewhat limited and deserves further research.

AB  - The distribution of occupied and vacant sites and migration of the threatened butterfly Lopinga achine were studied in the province of Ostergotland, Sweden. The probability of occupation increased with increasing patch area and decreasing distance to the nearest occupied patch, presumably due to different probabilities of colonisation and survival of the populations inhabiting the patches. Probability of female emigration from and immigration to a patch increased with decreasing area. Middle-sized patches produced the largest number of female migrants, although the highest fraction was noted for the smallest patches, and the greatest number of females was marked in the largest patch. The fraction of resident females, but not males, increased with increasing area. The observed occupancy and migration pattern have important conservation implications: all but two populations comprising three or more individuals were within 740 m of the nearest neighbour, indicating the need for networks of suitable, closely situated patches.

AB  - Global objectives to mitigate climate change in the construction industry have led to increasing geopolymer development as an alternative to carbon-intensive cement. Geopolymers can have similar mechanical properties and a lower carbon footprint. However, geopolymer production is not as homogeneous as cement because it is produced by synthesizing alkali solutions with different aluminosilicate precursors. This study assessed the feasibility of using conventional (fly ash, blast furnace slag, and metakaolin) and alternative precursors (steel slag, mine tailings, glass waste, sewage sludge ashes, and municipal solid waste incineration bottom ashes (MSWI BA)) in geopolymer mixes for different European regions (Belgium and Finland) from a sustainability perspective, using environmental, economic, and resource availability indicators as the criteria. A multi-objective optimization technique was applied to identify optimal precursors for geopolymer mixes using two scenarios: (1) considering both conventional and alternative precursors; (2) only considering alternative precursors. The results from the first scenario show that one of the most optimal precursor combinations for the geopolymer mix is 50% fly ash, 25% MSWI BA, and 25% sewage sludge ash for Belgium. For Finland, it is 19% fly ash, 27% mine tailings, and 45% MSWI BA. For the second scenario, one of the most optimal precursor combinations for Belgium is 87% MSWI BA and 13% steel slag. For Finland, it is 25% mine tailings and 75% MSWI BA. Subsequently, linear regression analysis was applied to predict the compressive strength of the identified optimal mixes, and the results for Belgium and Finland were between 31-55 MPa and 31-50 MPa for the first scenario and between 50-59 MPa and 50-55 Mpa for the second scenario, respectively.

AB  - Mycetophilids is a species-rich insect group for which the ecological requirements in temperate forests are poorly understood. This study of mycetophilids was based on trap samples from 15 oak-dominated sites in the boreonemoral zone of southern Sweden. Species richness and composition were analysed in relation to environmental variables at a local and at larger scales (multiple regression), and compared to results from similar studies in spruce-dominated sites in the boreal zone of Norway (PCA and two-sample t tests). Regressions showing a dominance of regional factors over local in-site variables agree with species-richness models assuming that local communities most often are unsaturated. Precipitation (inter-correlated with elevation) was the strongest factor for explaining the variation in species-richness, which is consistent with previous results indicating that mycetophilids are disfavoured by drought. In addition to precipitation, the area of mixed forest with high biodiversity values (woodland key habitats and protected areas) was a positive factor for species-richness, probably because such habitats combine elements of both coniferous and deciduous forests. PCA ordination revealed a clear separation of the species composition between boreal and boreonemoral forests. Species-richness in boreal forest was significantly higher than in boreonemoral forest, indicating a preference for boreal habitats in many of the species. For mycetophilids and other drought-sensitive insects, it is suggested that (partial) cutting in some dense successional oak stands should be avoided, and that some invading spruces should be tolerated.

AB  - We need to know if and how western barbastelles Barbastella barbastellus are affected by wind farming in Sweden. This is because wind turbines are frequently constructed in barbastelle habitats and yet there is no national guideline on how the arising conflict should be handled. We studied the movement, behavior and mortality of a barbastelle population at a wind farm in southern Sweden, using radio-telemetry, automatic bat detectors and carcass searches. The tagged bats (6 males and 8 females) roosted mainly under loose bark of dead oak trees and foraged in patches of mature deciduous woodlands or pockets of mature spruce trees within 15 km of the roosts. Extensive areas of young spruce plantation, open farmland and lakes were not used for roosting or foraging but were crossed by commuting bats. Continuous recordings with bat detectors frequently picked up barbastelles at forest edges 30 m from the turbines, but rarely over the turbine pads within 10 m from the turbines and never at heights of 30 and 100 m at the turbine towers. Barbastelles were apparently not attracted to the wind turbines and did not seem to interact with them in any way. Carcass searches under 10 wind turbines at 1-week intervals over three summers did not reveal any dead barbastelles, although three other species were recovered. We conclude that wind farming is not nessarily incompatible with effective conservation of barbastelles in Sweden, but instead of focusing on wind turbines, effors should concentrate on (a) preservation and restoration of mature, age-structured deciduous woodlands and spruce forests, including very small and isolated patches, which provide food and roosts, and probably also (b) avoidance of outdoor lighting in areas used by barbastelles. Designating large circular buffer zones around each known or suspected colony according to current practice would be inefficient or meaningless in our case, because barbastelles use extensive home ranges and switch roost frequently. We argue that barbastelle management must be applied on a landscape scale.

AB  - Forestry is continually changing the habitats for many forest-dwelling species around the world. The grey-sided vole (Myodes rufocanus) has declined since the 1970s in forests of northern Sweden. Previous studies suggested that this might partly be caused by reduced focal forest patch size due to clear-cutting. Proximity and access to old pine forest and that microhabitats often contains stones have also been suggested previously but never been evaluated at multiple spatial scales. In a field study in 2010-2011 in northern Sweden, we investigated whether occurrence of grey-sided voles would be higher in (1) large focal patches of >60years old forest, (2) in patches with high connectivity to surrounding patches, and (3) in patches in proximity to stone fields. We trapped animals in forest patches in two study areas (Vasterbotten and Norrbotten). At each trap station, we surveyed structural microhabitat characteristics. Landscape-scale features were investigated using satellite-based forest data combined with geological maps. Unexpectedly, the vole was almost completely absent in Norrbotten. The trap sites in Norrbotten had a considerably lower amount of stone holes compared with sites with voles in Vasterbotten. We suggest this might help to explain the absence in Norrbotten. In Vasterbotten, the distance from forest patches with voles to stone fields was significantly shorter than from patches without voles. In addition, connectivity to surrounding patches and size of the focal forest patches was indeed related to the occurrence of grey-sided voles, with connectivity being the overall best predictor. Our results support previous findings on the importance of large forest patches, but also highlight the importance of connectivity for occurrence of grey-sided voles. The results further suggest that proximity to stone fields increase habitat quality of the forests for the vole and that the presence of stone fields enhances the voles' ability to move between nearby forest patches through the matrix.

AB  - This study explores how resource colonization for iron in central Sweden during the early Iron Age may have affected the use of forest landscapes. Slag heap volume at iron production sites was used to estimate the amount of forest resources required for charcoal production. Forest resources required for livestock grazing and fodder were estimated from literature sources. To produce charcoal at iron production sites, forests were harvested, creating conditions suitable for grazing. Production of livestock winter fodder, leaf-hay, became a constraint due to the conflict between grazing grounds and fodder producing areas near main settlements. Although availability of forest was not limiting, a combination of opportunities and constraints is suggested to have promoted a new spatial ordering of land use. This included land closest to the main settlements allocated to fodder production and development of secondary seasonal settlements (shielings) at iron production sites, which could be exploited for livestock grazing.

AB  - Migrants' houses are a common feature of many regions of emigration globally and are one manifestation of migrants' transnational ties. This paper explores why migrants' build houses in their country of origin, even when migrants are not planning to return. The paper aims to analyze migrants' houses as relational places located in transnational social space. This is done through an analysis of the reasons for building migrants' houses, which shows the significance of these houses as relational places, in practical and symbolic ways. This is supported by a transnational perspective that includes the different views on migrants' houses among involved actors across transnational social space: the migrants, their relatives, the local communities the houses are built in, and societies where migrants have settled. The data for this paper consist of 45 semi-structured interviews with Pakistani migrants in Norway and non-migrant relatives in Pakistan, informal conversations with local Pakistanis, and analysis of media reports in Norway.

AB  - Decreased fitness due to loss of genetic variation is a well recognised issue in conservation biology. Along the Swedish west coast, the endangered natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) occurs on, for the species, highly unusual habitat of rocky islands. Although the toads inhabit a restricted geographical area (maximum distance between the populations is 71 km), the fragmented nature of the landscape makes the genetic properties of the populations of conservation interest. However, lack of genetic variation found using conventional methods (microsatellites) has impeded genetic studies within these peripheral populations so far. In this study we assess population structure and genetic variation among seven of these fringe populations using 105 polymorphic Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) loci. We found a well-defined population structure without evidence for isolation by distance, implying restricted gene flow between populations. Additionally, the populations differed in their amount of genetic variation, emphasizing the need to monitor genetically impoverished populations for possible declines mediated by inbreeding depression and reduced adaptive potential. Conservation implications for these unique populations are discussed in the light of our results.

AB  - The use of chemicals, biologicals and veterinary medicinal products (VMPs) helps in healthy and sustainable fish production. Information on the use of these products is essential for assessing farming practices, potential human health and environmental risks. A questionnaire-based nationwide survey covering aquaculture farms (n = 2936) producing carps, tilapia, pangasius and rainbow trout in freshwater and shrimp in brackishwater estimated the use of 52 different types of inputs which included disinfectants (597 g t(-1)), probiotics (2.28 kg t(-1)), environmental modifiers (22.82 kg t(-1)), nutritional supplements (1.96 kg t(-1)), natural anti-infective agents (293 g t(-1)), herbicide and piscicides (844 g t(-1)), antibiotics (2 mg PCU-1), antifungal (4 mg PCU-1), and antiparasitic (14 mg PCU-1) agents. The bulk of these inputs was used for soil and water quality improvement and had low environmental and human safety concerns. The multivariate analysis revealed significant variation in the frequency and quantity of compounds use among farm groups. Redundancy analysis revealed a significant association between the number of products used and stocking density. The survey also showed a considerable influence of education and farming experience on the usage pattern of aquaculture inputs. Results of the study indicated greater reliance of farmers on the use of disinfectants for biosecurity, nutritional supplements for enhanced growth and environmental modifiers for maintaining soil and water quality in culture systems. Though there was no use of restricted antibiotics and antiparasitic agents, the development and implementation of standard regulatory guidelines are essential for safe and effective use of inputs for sustainable aquaculture.

AB  - Adequate understanding of the factors that determine the establishment and survival of dead-wood-dependent species in natural forests is a prerequisite to the successful maintenance of these species in managed forests. This study investigated the factors affecting the occurrence of five wood-inhabiting polypores in old-growth timberline spruce forests in northern Finland, including the substrate availability and the spatial arrangement of large-diameter logs. The volume of coarse woody debris (CWD) varied significantly between the sites (range 15-30 m3 ha-1), large-diameter logs comprising on average 35% of the total CWD volume. However, the within-site variation in CWD volume was 10-15 times larger than the between-site variation. The spatial distribution of large-diameter logs was aggregated or initially aggregated on four sites and random on one site, creating local patches of high CWD volume. An individual target species occurred on average on 8% of all large-diameter logs, and on 11% of optimal logs (as determined by the decay stage). The characteristics of the logs and stand variables explained partly the occurrence of the target species; furthermore, the mortality pattern of trees (stem breakage versus uprooting) and the presence of primary decomposers also significantly affected the occurrence of the target species. The results indicate that besides substrate availability and quality, local habitat factors and species interactions also play a role in the occurrence of wood-inhabiting fungi in boreal timberline forests.

AB  - Regionally restricted, hums-rich topsoils in Southwest Norway and the Baltic Sea region of Germany and Denmark were formed by inputs of various amendments (combustion residues and marine biomass) and, therefore, were classified as Anthrosols. For a deeper insight into the ancient management practices, we investigated the elemental and P-composition in the upper and underlying horizons from 12 soil profiles in the J AE ren region, at the islands of Karmoy and Feoy (Norway), at the island of Fehmarn and the peninsula of Wagrien (Germany), and at the islands of Poel (Germany) and Sjaelland (Denmark). We used aqua regia digestion and the complementary methods of sequential P fractionation, phosphorus K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (P-XANES) spectroscopy, and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31-NMR) spectroscopy. Results were compared with the composition of differently amended and/or un-amended soils from other studies. In addition, archaeological literature was used to confirm possible inputs of specific P-containing amendments in ancient agriculture. The P composition from SF of the Anthrosols in Norway (44% NaOH-P-i > 18% NaOH-P-o > 14% NaHCO3-P-i, 12% H2SO4-P > 7% NaHCO3-P-o > 3% residual-P = 3% resin-P) and complementary archaeological literature provided strong indication for the use of peat, sheep manure, compost, and human excreta. The Anthrosols in the J AE ren region have been formed from peat, which had been used as alternative bedding material and had been mixed with sheep and/or cattle manure. The P-composition in the Anthrosols at the island of Fehmarn and at the peninsula of Wagrien (42% H2SO4-P > 25% residual-P > 10% NaOH-P-o, 8% NaOH-P-i: > 6% NaHCO3-P-i and NaHCO3-P-o, 4% resin-P) resulted from the application of domestic cattle manure. This was strongly supported by archaeological findings of cattle bones in this region, as well as high proportions of Ca-P, as confirmed by P-XANES. The predominance of P-o in the Anthrosols at the island of Poel and Sjaelland (31% NaOH-P-o > 23% NaHCO3-P-o, 21% H2SO4-P > 11% NaOH-P-i > 8% NaHCO3-P-i > 4% residual-P, 3% resin-P, in agreement with results from P-31-NMR) indicated low ancient inputs of various excrement or manure. This was supported by low livestock history at the island of Poel. In conclusion, these agricultural techniques can be considered as sustainable P recycling and soil amendment since they improved soil fertility for many generations.

AB  - Integrated stormwater management is based on the natural processes in the water cycle and the criteria for sustainable development. The aim of this paper was to investigate which integrated stormwater system components might be suitable in cold climate regions. The evaluation was based on literature reviews and studies made in Lulea, Northern Sweden. It was found that porous pavement, grassed waterways (swales, ditches), wet pond, and percolation basin were the most suitable integrated stormwater system components in cold regions whereas dry basin, stormwater infiltration surfaces, and stormwater reuse seemed to be the less suitable. Polluted snow may be treated at a central (large-scale) snow deposit; cleaner snow may be placed in many local snow depots.

AB  - Background: Medication reviews have been introduced as healthcare interventions to decrease inappropriate polypharmacy in older patients, but implementation in practice is challenging.
   Objective: This case study aimed to explore the events, actions and other factors that were involved in the implementation and sustainability of medication reviews in older patients by clinical pharmacists in Region Uppsala, Sweden.
   Methods: A case study design informed by change management principles (Kotter) and normalization process theory, consisting of a review of published and grey literature, key informant interviews and focus group triangulation. Findings from additional literature review and interviews were integrated into a final thematic analysis. Ten healthcare professionals, managers and policy makers participated as key informants. The study included data up to 2015.
   Results: Factors were identified across all Kotter's principles and normalization process theory domains, ranging from the first evidence on inappropriate polypharmacy in the 1980s until the creation of permanent clinical pharmacist positions in recent years. Examples of facilitating factors were a national focus on quality of care for the elderly, multiprofessional teamwork, key individuals with different professions, education, financial support and local evidence. Barriers included an unclear allocation of tasks and responsibilities, a lack of time and continuity, and a lack of a national plan for implementation, monitoring and evaluation.
   Conclusions: Multiple factors across the full range of change management and implementation principles were involved in the implementation and sustainability. A systems approach, including these factors, should be considered in similar future initiatives, both in Sweden and settings in other countries.

AB  - The restoration of forest structure and function is increasingly being used in boreal forests in order to halt the loss of biodiversity. Often ecological restoration is aimed at increasing the volume of dead and dying trees to enhance the biodiversity of deadwood-dependent organisms, but it may also increase population sizes of pest bark beetle species, even several years following restoration. Herein, we used a large-scale restoration experiment in Northern Sweden to assess the 5 years post-restoration effects of restorative gap cutting and prescribed burning on the populations of a set of economically harmful pest bark beetles (Ips typographus, Polygraphus poligraphus, Tomicus piniperda and Pityogenes chalcographus) and the most important predators of bark beetles, Thanasimus spp. In addition, we assessed the effects of forest stand characteristics at stand and landscape scale on the abundance of I. typographus. Five years post-restoration, gap-cut stands supported the highest abundances of P. poligraphus and contained the highest count of spruce trees newly attacked by bark beetles. By contrast, prescribed burning generally sustained the lowest abundances of pest bark beetles, especially I. typographus and P. poligraphus, and the highest abundance of their natural predators Thanasimus spp. The population abundance of I. typographus was also positively affected by the area of clear cuts within a 500 m radius from the stand. In conclusion, prescribed burning appears to be a safer method for ecological restoration than gap cutting in the long-term. According to our results, a risk of a local bark beetle outbreak still remains 5 years following the initiation of ecological restoration treatments on spruce-dominated mature gap-cut stands.

AB  - The growing world population and the growing need for food are raising the importance of more efficient and sustainable food production systems. Food loss is a significant global challenge and a major stressor on natural resources. True assessment of food loss is a precursor to its reduction. This study aimed to assess the actual food loss in the Norwegian farmed salmon production system in the year 2019 by quantifying the protein flows and stocks in the system. Protein served as an indicator substance of the true systemic food loss. This study highlights the system's qualitative value-adding conversion of plant protein into higher quality marine animal protein, with deposited vital trace minerals harvested from the sea and carried to the human food chain. However, it takes a lot of protein from multiple sources to produce salmon. We found that the total invested feed protein is about four times more than the harvested salmon protein, and about 40% of that harvested protein in the salmon biomass departs the human food chain by flowing to other non-food industries. The current post-harvest practices, material trade-offs, and waste management solutions could be adjusted to a context that prioritizes human food security. An alternative scenario is presented in this study, based on a hypothetical new food product in parallel to the main salmon fillet product. The alternative scenario turned 99% of the harvested protein into food and adjusted the ratio between the invested marine protein and the human food product protein. The originality of this research is in its approach to food loss assessment at the industrial level by means of a systemic macronutrient (protein) inventory.

AB  - The recent surge in populist politics in Europe and North America has challenged many of the policies aimed at advancing sustainable shifts. In this article we argue that this surge necessitates a rethinking of transition and transformation. The mainstream perspective on transitions understands it largely as the proliferation and upscaling of innovative technologies and policy frameworks. We recast sustainability transitions and transformations as continuous processes of assembly and disassembly, driven by rupture and instability. Rather than seeing populist resurgence as a "barrier" to change toward sustainability, we argue that these ruptures and instabilities should be considered inherent to the transformation process itself. The recent local election in Bergen, Norway, witnessed the surge of a new "anti-elite" political party dedicated to protesting road tolls that finance public transport. We hold that although such movements certainly pose challenges to sustainable transitions, they also provide opportunities for revitalizing democratic politics-moving beyond postpolitical managerial governance and inviting new concerns into local and urban transformation processes.

AB  - Finnish alcohol policy has aimed for decades years to mitigate alcohol-related harm by using high taxation and restrictions on the physical availability of alcohol. The state monopoly on the retail of alcohol has played a central role in reducing the availability of alcohol. In 2011, preparations began for a comprehensive reform of the Alcohol Act 1994. Over time, the issue became highly politicised, lobbied and divisive. It took intense work of two consecutive governments to finalise the reform. The new Alcohol Act came into force in 2018. It expanded the rights of grocery stores to sell alcohol and reduced the administrative burden for on-premise sales. As a result, the state monopoly on the retail of alcohol was weakened, but it still has an important impact on the physical availability of alcohol. The Finnish public health community expected an increase in alcohol sales following the reform because of greater alcohol availability and expected price reductions related to greater competition of sales in grocery stores. However, prices decreased less than expected in 2018, partly due to a simultaneous increase in alcohol taxes. It is difficult to evaluate the impact of the reform at this early stage. However, after the reform, the 10-year (2008-2017) downward trend in the total per capita alcohol consumption was discontinued despite the tax increase. According to preliminary analyses, the change in the law may have slightly increased recorded alcohol sales but the effect was not statistically significant. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Finnish forest bioenergy production has mainly evolved in close connection to the industrial forestry system producing pulp, paper and building materials, with tensions also related to these competing forms of forest resource utilization. However, in recent years, the tensions have been growing in terms of climate change, sustainability and innovations, and forest bioenergy production is facing important pressures pushing simultaneously for both increasing and restricting the production. Focusing on stakeholder perspectives in the preparation processes of two recent bioenergy related pieces of legislation, and drawing from framing theory, this study demonstrates the existence of the tensions. Only parts of the tensions are acknowledged in the making of bioenergy policies. The most significant tension evolves between actors related to forest industry and bioenergy production. Environmental tensions and wider sustainability aspects including local actors are largely neglected. The results show sustenance of old energy and forest policy paradigms with resistance related to new emerging interests. The resistance is explained by the ability of established actors to frame themselves as important in the policy arena, which hinders the entrance of new actors. The resistance presents a risk for aggravated tensions in the future and may constrain innovations related to the development of different types of bioenergy production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Among boreal forest bird species, the three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus) is closely associated with old-growth forests (>120 years), and possibly the most negatively affected by long-term changes induced by commercial forestry in eastern Canada. Part of this conflict is related to the woodpecker's use of standing dead trees as nesting sites. Moreover, this woodpecker's foraging behavior and its choice of feeding and drumming substrates may increase its vulnerability in managed forests. We describe foraging behavior of three-toed woodpeckers, and characterize foraging and drumming trees used by this species in Quebec's black spruce (Picea mariana) forests. During summer (May-Jul) and mid-winter (Jan-Feb), birds of both sexes used a highly specialized feeding technique consistent with searching for bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae). Snags were highly preferred over live trees as foraging substrates. Snags used for foraging had a greater diameter at Breast height (dbh) and were less deteriorated than paired nearest available snags. When live trees were selected for foraging, they also had a greater dbh but were more deteriorated than nearest available live trees. Thus, only a limited number of trees had all characteristics preferred by foraging woodpeckers, probably as a result of the ecology of its phloem-boring prey. Snags also were highly preferred over live trees as drumming substrates. Drumming snags differed from paired nearest available snags by having a broken top, less bark cover, and a lower deterioration class, which probably provided better acoustic towers for territorial birds. Given the extensive use of snags with different characteristics for foraging and drumming by three-toed woodpeckers, models estimating snag requirements for this species based only on nesting requirements are probably of limited use to maintain populations in managed areas. Wildlife habitat management objectives that specifically require the maintenance and renewal of snags in early decaying stages found in old-growth forests are essential to the conservation of this woodpecker species in managed forests.

AB  - Deadwood can be recreated as a forest restoration measure to increase the amount of deadwood and assist deadwood-dependent biodiversity. While deadwood restoration is known to have an overall positive effect on associated species in the long term, it remains poorly understood how and when wood-inhabiting organisms colonize different kinds of deadwood, which is essential for developing efficient restoration frameworks. In this study, we use DNA metabarcoding to compare wood-inhabiting fungal communities between fresh naturally fallen spruce logs and spruce logs felled for restoration. The results show that although pioneering fungal community composition greatly differs between natural and felled logs, with natural logs hosting more species-rich and heterogeneous communities, felled logs still hold a relatively high fungal diversity. Responses to log type carried a strong phylogenetic signal, and orders Polyporales and Hymenochaetales including most species of conservation concern were more likely to occur in natural than in felled logs. Furthermore, we found that log type was more important for rarely recorded than commonly recorded taxa, suggesting that rare species might be more specialized in their habitat requirements than the common ones. Overall, while restored deadwood can hold a high fungal diversity, the results underline that freshly felled logs do not mimic fresh natural logs. Deadwood restoration should focus not only on increasing the quantity of deadwood but also on the quality of thereof, and most importantly, retaining the existing natural deadwood rather than artificially downing trees.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) is already impacting marine organisms and may fundamentally alter marine ecosystems in the coming decades, with major implications for ocean services, such as food provision. Though OA is an emerging concern in coastal zone management, current actions are limited to monitoring and knowledge production. This article presents a framework for addressing coastal zone OA in local-level policy agendas through workshops, and lessons learned and outcome from the implementation of this framework in two cases in southern and northern Norway. The framework includes four components: 1) facilitating knowledge exchange and identify challenges and opportunities relating to OA; 2) ensuring legitimacy of new knowledges; 3) building capacity through learning and skill development; and 4) raise awareness about OA among local decisionmakers. The case studies include local and regional coastal zone management stakeholders and, using OA measurements and modelling, illustrate co-production of new knowledge of coastal ocean acidification and its potential local impacts. Through two rounds of workshops, we demonstrate that the level of OA awareness markedly increases among stakeholders. This awareness manifests in vocal interest for looming projected impacts and their necessary mitigative measures. This concern is compounded by stakeholders who recognize that OA should be treated as a component of water-quality, implying that OA is gaining salience as a local policy issue. However, it is evident that local management faces challenges in addressing such an issue, combined with expectations that higher levels of government take responsibility for mitigative and adaptive actions in response to OA.

AB  - The influence of catchment variables on lake organisms is understudied. The terrestrial zone in the vicinity of lakes is, however, probably highly important for biota due to the effects on water chemistry and to various processes operating across ecosystem boundaries. We examined the relative importance of lake and catchment variables, as well as large-scale geographical factors, on the taxa richness of phyto- and zooplankton in 100 small lakes in Finland. In variation partitioning, the variability of phytoplankton richness was most strongly related to the effects of lake variables, the joint effects of lake and catchment variables, and the joint effects of all three groups of variables. Zooplankton richness, in turn, was most strongly related to the effects of lake and catchment variables and the joint effect of lake and catchment variables. The exact results of the variation partitioning depended on the catchment sizes considered in the regression models. Among lake variables, planktonic richness was strongly related to variables indicating productivity. Among catchment variables, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), indicating catchment productivity, showed a relatively strong association with planktonic richness. These results provide evidence that catchment variables such as the NDVI may be efficient predictors of planktonic richness in small lakes. It is possible that individual lakes embedded in a highly productive landscape have higher taxa richness than solitary, potentially productive lakes because of the high influx of dispersing propagules from the regional pool. We also suggest that catchment variables may respond to environmental changes at different scales than the lake variables, and explicit consideration of catchment productivity would therefore be useful when planning research and monitoring programs. for freshwater organisms.

AB  - Active commuting to work (ACW) is beneficial to traffic, environment and population health. More evidence is needed on effective ways to promote ACW. This paper describes the protocol and baseline findings of a cluster-randomized controlled study, which aims to promote ACW with multilevel strategies in two large workplace areas in Tampere, Finland. In Phase 1, the impacts of environmental strategies (trail improvements) were evaluated in 11 workplaces within Area 1. In Phase 2, five more workplaces were recruited from Area 2 to evaluate the impacts of social and behavioral strategies customized for each workplace. For this purpose, the workplaces in both areas were randomly assigned into experimental group (EXP, n = 6 + 2), which promoted ACW with social and behavioral strategies or into comparison group (COM, n = 5 + 3), which participated in the data collection only. The primary indicator in both phases is the change in employees' ACW. Secondary indicators are e.g., changes in employees' self-rated health, wellbeing at work, restrictions to and motivation for ACW, adverse effects due to ACW and the use and quality of the main walking and cycling trails. Also process, efficiency and environmental evaluation is included. The study is the first one in Finland to combine interdisciplinary collaboration between practitioners and researchers working in the fields of transportation, urban design, physical activity and sustainable development to promote ACW. The findings benefit all stakeholders interested in promoting ACW in urban context.

AB  - Local emissions of Arctic air pollutants and their impacts on climate, ecosystems and health are poorly understood. Future increases due to Arctic warming or economic drivers may put additional pressures on the fragile Arctic environment already affected by mid-latitude air pollution. Aircraft data were collected, for the first time, downwind of shipping and petroleum extraction facilities in the European Arctic. Data analysis reveals discrepancies compared to commonly used emission inventories, highlighting missing emissions (e.g. drilling rigs) and the intermittent nature of certain emissions (e.g. flaring, shipping). Present-day shipping/petroleum extraction emissions already appear to be impacting pollutant (ozone, aerosols) levels along the Norwegian coast and are estimated to cool and warm the Arctic climate, respectively. Future increases in shipping may lead to short-term (long-term) warming (cooling) due to reduced sulphur (CO2) emissions, and be detrimental to regional air quality (ozone). Further quantification of local Arctic emission impacts is needed.

AB  - Purpose - In tourism research, crisis management mostly refers to operational, on-location, chaotic measures taken as a crisis strikes a tourism destination. Related to COVID-19, this paper focuses on public initiatives representing strategic-oriented crisis management while showing that such initiatives may not help those needing support. More precisely, the paper discusses and exemplifies the conflict of logics between private sector interests and public initiatives related to crisismanagement in tourism. Design/methodology/approach - The main data source is a structured newspaper review of COVID-19 and tourism as covered in the Swedish press, comprising more than 4,000 items. Findings - Findings indicate logics manifested at different levels and a logic gap between small and large firms. Large firms are potentially better able to adapt but tend to wait passively for financial support rather than reformulate their business operations. Originality/value - The paper contributes to research on crisis management in tourism by taking a public, societal-level view of crisis management juxtaposed against the local actors' sphere of operations. The conflict of logics proves how support needs to be improved to better help a sector in crisis. Thematic logics are introduced as a concept and captured in the conflicts between the present and the future, survival and change and operations and aggregates in crisis management. Broadly, the paper provides valuable insights into the future of tourism while indicating policy failures in the sector.

AB  - People's reactions to large carnivores take many forms, ranging from support and coexistence to resistance and conflict. While these reactions are the outcome of many different factors, in this paper we specifically explore the link between social constructions of landscapes and divergent responses to large carnivore presence. We compare case studies from four different landscapes shared by people and large carnivores, in India and Norway. We use social construction of landscapes as a key concept to explore responses to large carnivores in the context of ecological, economic, social, and cultural changes in these areas. Based on this comparison, we argue that the process of change is complex, with a plurality of responses from the groups affected by it. The response to large carnivore presence is influenced by many different factors, of which the interpretation of change-particularly landscape change-plays a significant role.

AB  - Schemes for transformation of even-aged monoculture forest management regimes into near-natural regimes are currently applied throughout the Atlantic region of Europe. This is mainly due to poor ecological stability, low economic performance, and decrease in biodiversity in existing forests. In this study, we analysed the simultaneous transformation of adjacent even-aged stands (a forest division) into mixed conifer/broadleaved stands. The case area is found in a conifer-dominated Danish forest and consists primarily of Norway spruce, European beech, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce. An economic evaluation of several transformation strategies was carried out by simulation. An area based combined Markov chain and Dynamic yield table model was used. Analyses were conducted under risk of wind throw.
   Strategies were defined by length of the cutting cycle and the diameter class harvest volume proportions of each tree species. As a reference point, an optimal strategy was determined using strict target diameter harvesting. It was assumed that such a regime would not achieve the desired change in stand structure due to the narrow diameter distributions of the existing stands as well as the present forest structure. Two groups of harvest strategies were analysed: passive strategies entailing harvesting mature and over-mature trees, and active strategies entailing harvest of immature, mature and over-mature trees; and three lengths of cutting cycles were applied: 2, 5 and 8 years. A transformation period of 80 years was assumed for the entire forest division.
   The importance of the local forest conditions was evident: for all strategies, an economically over-mature forest structure resulted in large harvest income at the beginning of transformation, leading to small differences between the strategies and thus increasing flexibility in the choice of strategy. When trees were harvested before or after economic maturity, opportunity costs depended on strategy. Such costs must be taken into account when forcing a fast transformation, e.g. for biological or recreational reasons. For the worst performing strategy, the overall loss was 34% compared with the optimal strategy in terms of total expectation value. Regarding area distribution of tree species and size classes, the differences between strategies were insignificant at the end of the transformation period. The active strategies with a 2-year cutting cycle were the least vulnerable to wind throw but had the lowest economic performances, emphasising the trade-off between vulnerability and operational costs (entry costs).

AB  - Growing anthropogenic activity in the Arctic, especially near regional municipal and transportation hubs, threatens coastal environments with significant changes and contamination. A detailed study of a wide set of organic-geochemical proxies in surface and subsurface sediments and soils around the typical urbanized Arctic area (Tromso, Norway) was performed to investigate natural and anthropogenic input of hydrocarbons. The sites were located close to main areas of human activity and differed in the level of anthropogenic pressure: oil terminal, boat harbor and recreation beach zone in the city center, and a remote, conditionally-clean area. The samples from each site were collected along four subtidal - intertidal - supratidal transects. GC-MS data on the distribution of more than 110 compounds were obtained including n-alkanes, isoprenoids, terpanes, parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and alkyl PAHs. Organic matter embedded in a mineral matrix was more thermally mature than its fresh non-bound fraction. Biomarker distribution and diagnostic ratios attested to the predominantly local origin of near-shore organic matter formation (phytoplankton, algae, high foliar plants, grass). PAH composition revealed a significant input of pyrogenic components from liquid and solid fuel combustion to the surface coarse-grained sediments. Background bacterial activity was evidenced by the high content of biohopanes and hopenes in less polluted sediments and soils. The presence of an unresolved complex mixture and even n-alkanes in sediment profiles from the most polluted sites attested to the active biodegradation that, together with the erosion of the upper layers by tidal currents, reduces the toxic compound penetration deeper into the sediments.

AB  - Climate change and more frequent extreme weather events are expected to significantly challenge food production and food security worldwide, underlining the need for adaptation within the agricultural sector. Although Norway, as other Nordic countries, potentially benefits from higher temperatures in terms of agricultural production, adaptation will be necessary. Employing resilience as a theoretical lens, this study investigates Norwegian farmers' handling of the dry summer of 2018, a summer that comprehensively challenged agricultural production throughout Europe. In-depth interviews revealed that farmers' main strategy was to improve their buffer capacity to be able to 'bounce back' (i.e., to get 'through' the summer to return to a 'normal' situation). Informal and formal networks, access to outfield resources and governmental support played key roles in enhancing the buffer capacity. Structural changes in the agricultural sector seem to challenge future access to the resources needed to improve the buffer capacity in times of crisis. Within the current environmental, social and political framework, farms are considered resilient, and strengthening buffer capacity is reasonable. However, a higher frequency of extreme weather events may require that other capacities, such as adaptive or transformative, be improved. Thus, resilience is not a given state and independent of values but strongly context dependent. To achieve long-term resilience, climate change adaptation needs to be politically encouraged and economically supported. Farmers need flexibility to use local resources. Worries about structural changes may draw farmers' attention away from making potentially important adaptations to climate change.

AB  - Wood ash recycling to forests after logging residues harvest is important to ensure long-term sustainable forest management, however, it is not recycled in Sweden at the level required to compensate for current logging residue out-take. A problem in this context is wood ash contamination through co-incineration of waste wood with forest fuels, a practice driven by the political goal of a circular bioenergy system. We performed a case study of co-incineration at a typical Swedish district heating (DH) plant, which showed that the forest fuel ash alone could be recycled to forests due to high nutrient levels. Co-incineration with waste wood resulted however in such high levels of contaminants that the ash was landfilled as hazardous waste. Our assessment of the Swedish DH sector showed that wood ash contamination through co-incineration is common, and that only a minor proportion of the ash from forest fuels is recycled to the forest. It also revealed a lack of reliable data regarding ash production and management, making implementation and evaluation of effective countermeasures difficult. Practical measures to enable wood ash recycling, such as removal of waste wood from the fuel mix, incineration of separate fuels, and ash after-treatment, are hampered by technical and economic barriers. Furthermore, no comprehensive policy tools currently exist on either a national or EU level that facilitate wood ash recycling. Thus, we conclude that comprehensive and efficient policy tools are urgently needed to overcome current barriers, and stimulate large-scale recycling of wood ash for long-term sustainable forest fuel utilisation.

AB  - This study analyses the sustainability transitions of technological innovation systems (TISs) in the context of multi-level governance frameworks. TISs which are spatially embedded in both international and national arenas are simultaneously governed by the governance frameworks in different layers, i.e. international institutions on a macro level, national institutions on a meso level and domestic dynamics of novel technologies on a micro level. Through the investigation of the biodiesel innovation system in Taiwan, this study concludes that international institutions could appropriately play a role in the guidance of search, while national governments should ensure policies are consistent and generate appropriateness on the domestic TISs' functions. If the domestic TISs' functions are appropriately guided by the institutions on the above levels, novel technologies that sustainably transit the systems would then emerge on a micro level.

AB  - This article approaches urban ethics through critically examining the production and reproduction of an eco-modern socio-technical imaginary of sustainable urban development in Sweden, and the conditions and obstacles this poses for a just transformation. We see that notions of ecological modernization re-present problems of urban sustainability in ways that do not challenge the predominant regime, but rather uphold unjust power relations. More particularly, through an approach inspired by critical discourse analysis, we uncover what these problem representations entail, deconstructing what we find as three cornerstones of an eco-modern imaginary that obstruct the emergence of a more ethically-engaged understanding of urban sustainability. The first concerns which scales and system boundaries are constructed as relevant, and how this results in some modes and places of production and consumption being constructed as more efficient-and sustainable-than others. The second cornerstone has to do with what resources and ways of using them (including mediating technologies) are foregrounded and constructed as more important in relation to sustainability than others. The third cornerstone concerns the construction of subjectivities, through which some types of people and practices are put forth as more efficient-and sustainable-than others. Utilizing a critical speculative design approach, we explore a selection of alternative problem representations, and finally discuss these in relation to the possibility of affording a more ethical urban design and planning practice.

AB  - Biomass is the greatest source of renewable energy in Europe, North America, and most of the rest of the world. The leader in total biomass production in 2012 was China, followed by the U.S. and Brazil. Federal government programs have given the U.S. leadership in ethanol production, most recently adding cellulosic ethanol. Forest and wood products are prominent energy resources for Sweden and Finland, which lead in biomass production per capita. Germany is the international leader in renewable energy policy. Its feed-in tariff (FIT), initiated in 1991 for an initial 20-year period, provided the stimulus for Germany's success in fostering growth of diverse renewable energies, including solar and wind energy, and biogas. The FIT is a widely used policy, including in China and Japan. Commitment, cooperation, and stable national and European policies have fostered biomass energy development in Europe. However, despite large potentials, minimal increase in U.S. biomass production other than corn-based ethanol is attributable to policy conflicts and a complex regulatory environment.

AB  - This article explores the relationship between the domestic position of Jewish bourgeois housewives and the larger Swedish, urban landscape at the beginning of the twentieth century. Examining the interior decor, shopping patterns, urban places, and the social, cultural and religious aspects of the domestic spheres of Irene Strauss and Jeannette Ettlinger, this article argues that they consciously used public spaces to establish their individual practices of Jewishness. By entering the gendered space of the Jewish home, accessible through private letters and receipts, this article portrays the bourgeois women as actors with social and economic power. They produced public spaces that communicated either cultural integration or orthodox distinctiveness, thereby constructing diverse strategies for Swedish belonging. These strategies demonstrate the growing religious, social and cultural diversity within the Jewish community in Stockholm during the last Three decades before the Second World War.

AB  - Mastering ecological dynamics necessitates identifying the substance cycles in biomass. In terms of sustainable soil productivity, the nutrient content of below-ground biomass is just as significant as the above-ground biomass, which fluctuates depending on land use. Yet, there were limited studies on determining the quantity of plant nutrient stocks, particularly in the below-ground biomass, in rangeland, forest, and plantation areas coexisting in the same ecological zone. In this regard, it is expected that the findings of this study will contribute to the literature. For this purpose in mind, distinct samples were taken from three depth levels (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) to determine root biomass and nutrient stocks of roots in neighboring rangeland, forest, and plantation areas, and roots were divided into diameter classes, and below-ground biomass amounts and nutritional contents of below-ground biomass were determined. According to the results obtained, the total root biomass in the rangelands is 8.02 Mg ha(-1), total root biomass was 5.95 Mg ha(-1) in forest areas, and in plantation areas, the total root biomass is 6.94 Mg ha(-1). Root biomass in the 0-10 cm soil layer constituted 78% of the total biomass. Also, for all land uses, the highest below-ground biomass concentrations were observed for Al, Fe, K, Mg, and Ca. The amounts of Al, Fe, K and Mg in the below-ground biomass followed the sequence of rangeland, plantation, and forest from high to low. Nutrient stocks in below-ground biomass and the effects of increases in root biomass on plant growth should be evaluated by future studies.

AB  - This article critically examines the discourses concerning historical and transnational linguistic and cultural diversity in the semiotic landscape of a new teacher education building in Norway. In 2020, this building, housing the Department of Education, opened at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, in the city of Tromso. Designing, constructing, and decorating a new building for a national teacher education was taken as an opportunity to reflect on and negotiate the institution's role in relevant contemporary, as well as historical, educational discourses and to mark a current standpoint. Taking a nexus analytical approach, we analyse how linguistic and cultural diversity are represented in the department's public space and how this is interwoven with the construction of the institution's position in a multilingual and multicultural environment. Our analysis shows that this diversity is constructed through various contrasts. Sami identities and regional roots of knowledge are emphasised in the official part of the semiotic landscape - framed as learnings from diversity. However, by analysing meta-sociolinguistic discourses about diversity, we show that this is accompanied by the erasure of other aspects of linguistic and cultural diversity, in particular Kven culture and identity, transnational diversity, and children and their lifeworld.

AB  - Despite its rapid growth during the last three decades, salmon farming is risky because of production risk and dynamic market conditions, resulting in volatile salmon price over time. Price variability raises revenue uncertainty, affecting financial performance, capital structure, and survival probability. This study evaluates how price variability and financial ratios affect business failure in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. An initial statistical analysis indicates a positive correlation between price variability and firm exit cases. The estimation results of the nonproportional hazard model show a positive impact of price variability on the hazard rate. Among financial ratios, retained earnings/total assets and equity/total liabilities influence the hazard rate jointly with price variability. To this end, we discussed the implications regarding risk management and the sustainable growth of the aquaculture industry.

AB  - In contrast to old-growth forests, early-successional stands remain understudied despite potentially harbouring species of conservation interest. With this work, focused on hazel grouse Tetrastes bonasia, a cryptic and indicator species known to select for close-to-natural forests, we evaluated winter densities, home range, microhabitat selection and diet, combining DNA-based mark-recapture and metabarcoding from faecal samples. In total, 216 droppings, collected over 2 years along forest transects in the Italian Alps, were successfully genotyped and 43 individuals were identified. Density estimates were similar to values reported by other studies in the Alps with an average of 4.5 and 2.4 individuals/km(2) in the first and second study year, respectively, and mean home ranges estimated at 0.95 km(2). According to habitat selection models and eDNA-based diet analysis, hazel grouse selected early-succession secondary-growth forests formed after the abandonment of traditional agropastoral activities. These forests, mostly composed of hazel Corylus avellana, Norway spruce Picea abies and Sorbus spp., provided winter food resources and shelter. The diet analysis also highlighted forest arthropods as a non-negligible source of food. Birds avoided areas subject to intensive browsing by ungulates; small forest roads seasonally closed to traffic had positive influence on hazel grouse (i.e. higher abundance of droppings), while roads open to traffic had no effect. Importantly, despite the high coverage of mature forest habitats of Community Interest (53% of our study area), droppings were more abundant in non-listed early-succession secondary forests with similar plant composition. Our results suggest that forest succession after agropastoral abandonment may be beneficial for some forest birds of conservation interest, while acknowledging its negative effects on the previous grassland biodiversity.

AB  - International studies are dealing with the promotion of sustainable food systems more frequently. Additionally, places of purchase and sharing in the choice of food to be consumed have become a network system for families. The aim of this work is to analyse the preferences of Swedish consumers for local/artisanal cheeses and the purchase motivations that guide their choices. We also studied the role played by consumers' favourite shopping locations (retail store, hypermarket, city market, supply chain). On the one hand, we examined the attractiveness and the power exercised by the various stores and on the other hand, we viewed the consumer in relation to the frequency of purchase, and the confidence with the sales points. We interviewed 200 people in the city of Ostersund, highlighting habits, consumption preferences and reasons for purchasing. A multiple correspondence analysis explores the reasons behind the purchase preferences of the local 'Kallarlagrad getost' artisan cheese from the Slow Food brand. The representations of social network analysis are used to show the complex articulations that influence the choices of consumers in terms of type of cheese purchased/consumed and places of purchase/consumption. The results showed that Swedish consumers, in the purchase of cheeses, have a loyalty point at the point of sale, follow the advice of the seller and are attentive to the reputation of the product. Those who buy Kallarlagrad getost are sensitive to safety, appreciate artisan cheeses and choose them for their versatility, have a strong connection with the territory and wish to contribute to supporting the local economy. Knowing these characteristics and preferences of Swedish consumers living in a city in the north of the country is important for marketing activities and for promoting tourism and sustainable gastronomy.

AB  - Resident birds in boreal forests can serve as indicators of habitat quality and are often species of conservation interest, particularly in multifunctional forests also used for timber production. To make informed forest management decisions, we must first understand which structural features provide habitats useful for resident birds. This is particularly true in winter, an understudied and critical season for their survival. The objective of this study was to establish reliable methods for monitoring bird presence and activity during winter, and to use these methods to evaluate the relative importance of stand structural features to make inferences about which features support and increase winter survival potential. Using a hybrid bioacoustic and ecoacoustic approach, we tested the ability of acoustic recordings to identify links between bird diversity and components of structural complexity, and compared these results to those from the traditional point count method. We conducted a vegetation survey, point count surveys and collected acoustic recordings from December 2019-February 2020 in 19 sites in a Swedish boreal forest. First, we compared species richness values derived from point counts and bioacoustic monitoring methods. Bioacoustic species richness was significantly higher than point count richness, although only when the time spent identifying species from recordings exceeded the time spent conducting point counts in the field. Next, we demonstrated that bioacoustic species identification yields additional metrics of bird activity that point counts cannot. We tested the response of these metrics, and point count metrics, to variables of structural heterogeneity and complexity of our sites. Almost all bioacoustic metrics increased significantly with increasing structural complexity, while point count richness and abundance did not, indicating that automated recording is more effective in identifying forest patches of high quality in winter. Lastly, using an ecoacoustic approach, we calculated six of the most common acoustic indices and tested if any could effectively reflect the bird-structure relationships described above. Two indices showed significant positive relationships to bioacoustic metrics, demonstrating their potential as biodiversity assessment proxies that respond to differences in habitat quality. This is the first winter acoustic study to monitor bird assemblages in detail; it employed both bioacoustic and multi-index ecoacoustic approaches, which provided evidence that automated acoustic recording can be an effective and superior method for monitoring resident forest birds.

AB  - It has been argued that widespread extinctions of top predators have changed terrestrial ecosystem structures through mesopredator release, where increased abundances of medium-sized predators have detrimental effects on prey communities. This top-down concept has received much attention within conservation biology, but few studies have demonstrated the phenomenon. The concept has been criticized since alternative explanations involving bottom-up impacts from bioclimatic effects on ecosystem productivity and from anthropogenic habitat change are rarely considered. We analyse the response of a mesopredator (the red fox) to declines in top predators (wolf and Eurasian lynx) and agricultural expansion over 90 years in Sweden, taking bioclimatic effects into account. We show a top-down mesopredator release effect, but ecosystem productivity determined its strength. The impacts of agricultural activity were mediated by their effects on top predator populations. Thus, both top-down and bottom-up processes need to be understood for effective preservation of biodiversity in anthropogenically transformed ecosystems.

AB  - Virtually all destinations seek to increase tourist numbers, pursuing economic maximization strategies. Considerably less attention is paid to optimizing existing tourist systems to create more profitable, stable, resilient and potentially more sustainable entities. While aspects of tourist expenditure, average length of stay and seasonality as three key destination management variables have received considerable attention in the literature, focus has usually been on the identification of profitable tourism markets by considering observed patterns of spending, length of stay and vacation timing. Building on such earlier studies, this paper focuses on flexibilities in these parameters: could tourists have spent more, stayed longer or visited during a different season? Perceptions of destination expensiveness as a potential deterrent to visitation were also addressed. Based on a sample (n = 1914) of domestic and international tourists in the Swedish cities of Kalmar and Stockholm, data were collected in face-to-face interviews using questionnaires. Results indicate considerable potential to optimize the Swedish tourism system with regard to all variables studied, while also providing new insights for destination management in the context of economic resilience. Results also indicate the need for researchers everywhere to have detailed market knowledge if they are to persuade the industry to change its sustainability behavior.

KW  - SOLAR RESOURCE ASSESSMENT
AB  - Solar energy applications have, in recent years, become a common element in the urban landscape, especially on roofs and facades. However, it is important that the integration of solar energy in the built environment do not distort the fabric or expression of the existing building envelope, not at least in areas of high cultural-heritage values. The aesthetics depend, to a large extent, on how visible the new technology, such as photovoltaic (PV) panels, is. This paper describes a method for visibility assessment of building envelopes. It is referred to as target-based as it, in contrast to previously reported methods, bases the assessment from the perspective of the building envelope itself, rather than possible vantage points on the ground. The method was evaluated for two Swedish cities; Stockholm and Visby. In Stockholm, each building was evaluated based on its cultural-heritage values, solar irradiation and visibility. Deploying PV only on the roofs with the lowest cultural-heritage values, with insolation > 900 kWh/m(2), and with no visibility from ground, results in a total PV yield of up to 2% of the total electricity demand. In Visby, various definitions of the vantage area were evaluated, from which the building envelope can be seen. It was found that the choice of vantage area greatly impacts the solar energy potential. If the vantage area is defined by the public domain, i.e., streets and other public open spaces, the non-visible roof area doubles compared to if all ground/terrain defines it. Compared to previous studies, the use of a vantage area, instead of discrete vantage points, seems to result in higher visibility of the roofs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, an analysis of driver behaviour is reported focusing on car following separation at low speed traffic conditions. The data used for this analysis was collected using an Instrumented Vehicle in three European cities: Oslo (Norway), Paris (France) and Southampton (UK). The data collection covered a wide range of traffic conditions on urban motorways, urban arterial roads and urban streets. Time gaps and distance gaps in low speed traffic conditions were investigated and were compared with those in high speed traffic conditions. This research is part of the work of STARDUST, an EU project aimed at assessing the extent to which Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated-Vehicle Guidance (AVG) systems can contribute to sustainable urban development. The results obtained will be fed into simulation models in the next stage of the project, to assess the impacts of selected ADAS systems in the urban applications.

AB  - In the European Union, the majority of afforestation is carried out on former agricultural land. This afforestation causes fundamental changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, with the trees intercepting light and precipitation, producing litterfall and competing for soil nutrients. All of these effects could potentially have a negative impact on understorey biomass and vascular plant biodiversity in a relatively short time span. This study aims to evaluate the effects of afforestation with Pinus radiata D. Don (Monterey pine: pine) and Betula pubescens Ehrh. (Downy birch: birch), established at two different densities (2500 and 833 trees ha 21) and sown with two different pasture mixtures (Dactylis glomerata L. + Trifolium repens L. + Trifolium pratense L. and Lolium perenne L. + T. repens L. + T. pratense L.), on understorey biomass, alpha plant biodiversity, life cycle type (annuals vs. perennials) and beta biodiversity over a period of 11 years. Pine showed better development than birch throughout the study, although both species were very sensitive to tree density. While increasing density increased pine height and decreased pine diameter, both aspects of birch development were reduced by higher tree densities. Aboveground biomass increased throughout the study. Alpha plant biodiversity was drastically reduced under pine established at high density, 11 years after afforestation. However, the similarities in species richness, species composition and the low beta growth rates found under pine at low density, and birch at both high and low density suggest that, in these cases, the choice of canopy tree has little consequence for understorey biodiversity at this stage of system development.

AB  - It is critical to analyze the performance of enterprises to achieve sustainable agricultural development. Several studies have been conducted to assess farm performance. However, the studies have been criticized for failing to account for farm heterogeneity (which is frequently unobserved) in their evaluation of Norwegian agricultural performance. Technically, a farm is efficient if it can produce a certain amount of output with the fewest possible inputs and no input waste. In this paper, efficiency scores are calculated using a production function with both a random intercept and a random slope parameter, addressing the issue of unobserved heterogeneity in stochastic frontier analysis. Using Norwegian dairy and crop farms as a case study, we demonstrate the viability of improving the agriculture industry and reducing resource waste. The case study was established on data collected from 5884 dairy farms and 1880 crop farms from the years 2000 to 2019. According to the empirical findings of the case study, dairy and crop producers used inefficient technologies and squandered production resources. If all farmers follow a sustainable and efficient path to produce agricultural output, they could increase output by 15-18%. Farmers must follow sustainable paths, and politicians must encourage farm experience exchange so that less efficient dairy and crop-producing farms can learn from the most efficient farms to achieve sustainable development.

AB  - Increasing awareness of climate issues and environmental policy has been a key factor behind the continuous transition of energy systems at different levels. This paper aimed to analyse the energy system of Viken county, located in Norway. An energy system model using the energy system analysis tool EnergyPLAN was developed. Based on the reference year 2018, two future scenarios which focus on changes in the transport sector for the year 2030 and 2050 were designed. Besides changes in the transport sector, the integration of renewable energy sources is considered in the future scenarios. The results of the analysis regarding the future scenario shows substantial CO2 reduction as a result of energy-carrier switching within the transport sector. The integration of new energy sources, in this case, solar PV and wind power, helps to offset increased import dependency. The primary energy supply decrease and the share of renewable energy increases significantly.

AB  - Herbivorous insects such as butterflies and moths are essential to natural and agricultural systems due to pollination and pest outbreaks. However, our knowledge of butterflies' and moths' nutrition is fragmented and limited to few common, charismatic, or problematic species.
   This gap precludes our complete understanding of herbivorous insects' natural history, physiological and behavioral adaptations that drive how species interact with their environment, the consequences of habitat fragmentation and climate change to invertebrate biodiversity, and pest outbreak dynamics.
   Here, we first report a population of the Buff-tip moth Phalera bucephala (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae) feeding on a previously unknown family of host plants, the mountain currant Ribes alpinum (Saxifragales: Grossulariaceae). This is the first report of a Notodontid moth feeding on Grossulariaceae hosts.
   Using no-choice and choice assays, we showed that P. bucephala has strong foraging preferences for a previously unknown hosts, the R. alpinum but also, although to a smaller extent, R. uva-crispa compared with a previously known host (the Norway maple Acer sp.).
   These findings demonstrate that P. bucephala feed on-and show strong preference for Grossulariaceae host plants, indicating flexible physiological mechanisms to accommodate hosts plants from various families. This makes this species a potential model organism to study the behavioral and physiological mechanisms underpinning insect-plant interactions and diet breadth evolution.
   We discuss the broad ecological implications of these observations to the biology of the species, the potential negative effects of interspecific competition with endemic specialist moths, and highlight questions for future research.

AB  - Norwegian industries are constantly assessing new technologies and methods for more efficient and safer production in the aqua cultural, renewable energy, and oil and gas industries. These Norwegian offshore industries share a common challenge: to install new equipment and transport personnel in a safe and controllable way between ships, farms and platforms. This paper deploys the Moving Frame Method (MFM) to analyze the motion induced by a crane and controlled by a gyroscopic inertial device mounted on a ship. The crane is a simple two-link system that transfers produce and equipment to and from barges. An inertial flywheel a gyroscope is used to stabilize the barge during transfer. The MFM describes the dynamics of the system using modern mathematics. Lie group theory and Caftan's moving frames are the foundation of this new approach to engineering dynamics. This, together with a restriction on the variation of the angular velocity used in Hamilton's principle, enables an effective way of extracting the equations of motion. This project extends previous work. It accounts for the dual effect of both the crane and the stabilizing inertial device. Furthermore, this work allows for buoyancy and motor induced torques. Furthermore, this work displays the results in 3D on cell phones. The long-term results of this work leads to a robust 3D active compensation method for loading/unloading operations offshore. Finally, the interactivity between the crane and the stabilizing gyro anticipates the impending time of artificial intelligence when machines, equipped with on-board CPU's and. IP addresses, are empowered with learning modules to conduct their operations.

AB  - It has been documented that the degree of biological degradation of the petroleum in the Brent Group reservoir in the Gullfaks Field (quadrant 34/10, Norwegian North Sea) varies laterally. The most severe degradation has taken place in the western part of the field where he Brent Group sediments are not eroded. Lack of erosion in the West suggests that this part of the reservoir has always been buried at greater depths than the eastern part of the field. The geochemical description with the most severe biodegradation in the West, seems therefore to conflict with the most obvious geological model with easiest access for bacteria with meteoric water from the East. This suggests that we either do not understand the geology of the Gullfaks Field area or we do not understand the biological degradation process, or perhaps both. It is possible to give a reasonably good approximation of the amount of carbon that has been removed from the reservoired petroleum by bacterial degradation by comparing degraded and non-degraded petroleum with a fill-spill relationship in the area. By assuming that the supply of an oxygenating agent is the rate limiting factor in biological degradation of petroleum within a reservoir, it is possible to simplify the very complex processes and mechanisms involved in petroleum degradation, and to reduce the number of variables to three. These are: the thickness of the supply zone below the reservoir from which an oxygenating agent can be supplied, the flow of water within this supply zone below the oil water contact (o.w.c.) and the time available to degrade the petroleum in the reservoir. Geochemical and geological observations and modelling have demonstrated that it is unlikely that the degradation involves sulphate reducing bacteria but that degradation is probably aerobic bacterially mediated and a supply of oxygen ''rich'' water with nutrients or is related to a yet unidentified process. This mass balance based on the supply and demand of oxygen dissolved in meteoric water indicates that several thousand reservoir volumes are required to degrade the petroleum within the Brent Group to is present stage. This is difficult to explain with the current geological model of the field, however the biological degradation must be accounted for when establishing a realistic geological model in the Gullfaks area. The main advantage of our model is that it is quantitative and although some inaccuracies are inevitable it gives an order of magnitude estimate of the amount of water which must have been supplied into the reservoir.

AB  - There is an urgent need to develop scenarios and roadmaps for a more sustainable future than where business-as-usual is heading. This paper addresses the use of sensitivity analysis for analyzing environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) models in order to develop cost-effective and comprehensive scenario building. Main components of resource use, emission intensity and final demand are extracted from the complete network of interactions contained in the input-output tables of the national accounts. The method is demonstrated using a detailed Finnish EEIO-model (ENVIMAT). Based on the results, only 0.3% of the 23 103 interactions were found to have a significant effect on Finnish greenhouse gas emissions. The same parameters were also relevant for waste generation and land use, but not for gross domestic product. The identified main components were tested by structural decomposition. Actual development of greenhouse gas emissions from 2002 to 2005 was compared to that predicted by updating only the identified components. Based on the results, the development of greenhouse gas emissions could be predicted with high accuracy using only the identified main components. Generalizing the results, sensitivity analysis can assist in identifying the main components to be included in future scenarios for sustainable development. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Epibenthic dinoflagellates occur globally and include many toxin-producing species of concern to human health and benthic ecosystem function. Such benthic harmful algal blooms (BHABs) have been well described from tropical and sub-tropical coastal environments, but assessments from north temperate waters, e.g., northern Europe, and polar regions are scarce. The present study addressed the biodiversity and distribution of potentially toxic epibenthic dinoflagellate populations along the west coast of Sweden (Kattegat-Skagerrak) by morphological and molecular criteria. Morphological analysis conducted by light- and electron-microscopy was then linked by DNA barcoding of the V4 region of 18S rRNA gene sequences to interpret taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships. The presence of two potentially toxigenic epibenthic dinoflagellates, Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) F.Stein and Coolia monotis Meunier was confirmed, along with a description of their spatial and temporal distribution. For P. lima, one third of the cell abundance values exceeded official alarm thresholds for potentially toxic BHAB events (> 1000 cells gr(-1) of macroalgae fresh weight). The same species were recorded consecutively for two summers, but without significant temporal variation in cell densities. SEM analyses confirmed the presence of other benthic Prorocentrum species: P. fukuyoi complex, P. cf. foraminosum and P. cf. hoffmannianum. Analyses of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene also indicated the presence P. compressum, P. hoffmannianum, P. foraminosum, P. fukuyoi, and P. nanum. These findings provide the first biogeographical evidence of toxigenic benthic dinoflagellates along the west coast of Sweden, in the absence of ongoing monitoring to include epi-benthic dinoflagellates. Harmful events due to the presence of Coolia at shellfish aquaculture sites along the Kattegat-Skagerrak are likely to be rather marginal because C. monotis is not known to be toxigenic. In any case, as a preliminary assessment, the results highlight the risk of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) events caused by P. lima, which may affect the development and sustainability of shellfish aquaculture in the region.

AB  - This article proposed the combination of cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment and extended exergy analysis to analyse international environmental performance in agricultural production. The unified approach allowed the cumulative analysis of total extraction of all types of resources and services from the ecosystem in agriculture. The analysis, therefore, enabled a more accurate comparison of the environmental performance of different countries or systems based on different indicators of sustainability. The application was conducted for 29 OECD countries for the years from 1990 to 2003 with some important findings. First, the organic contents in topsoil, feed and total water withdrawal were the three types of resources that agricultural production extracted most from the environment. Second, during the 14 years surveyed, the efficiency of using exergy in the livestock sector was much lower than the efficiency in the crop sector. Third, the environmental loading of economic investment had increased slightly, implying a minor increase in the pressure on the environment overtime. In addition, the empirical study on OECD countries confirmed that rankings varied widely based on different indicators. The empirical results gave some evidence to support the use of non-renewability yield ratio, firstly defined in this paper, because the rankings based on this indicator was more consistent with many other indicators.

AB  - The best borders are bridges rather than barriers. Borders define peoples, their lifestyles, destinies, rights and duties. Even today vestiges of the Roman Limes define the Roman Empire, that culture, at its greatest extent. By nature, borders range from the coolest thousand miles between Norway and Sweden to that piece of tropical string between Ethiopia and Somalia. Europeans may bestride borders by crossing the line of tiles through Baarle (in both Belgium and the Netherlands), the metal strip through the Eurode Business Center, Herzogenrath (in both Germany and the Netherlands), or zipline from Spain to Portugal "in less than a minute." Bridges welcome tourists and trade, promote cross-cultural co-operation and the easy movement of people. Barriers prevent illegal entry, terrorism, disease, sedition and other criminal activity. Clearly a strong agency is required to manage these contrasts in the task descriptions. Sadly, terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels remind us of the need for improvement in the border management of Europe. This chapter considers the major problem areas which arise at national borders in Europe and illustrates recent examples of the key pre-terrorist troubles that have arisen and the solutions so far embraced. Review of present border management provides a number of options employed for current border management and leads to consideration of other options which might be introduced. A detailed analysis of border management practices, their implementation and success, identifies the realities of border management particularly when facing security issues. This leads to consideration of how to enhance current border security through new strategy and 21st century capacity building. So begins identification of the new needs for the European Union in the context of European Union thinking and activity directly related to border management. There is particular urgency for the European Union to put in place an effective border agency. An agency which recognizes the need for "mending-time" so that we continue to "beat the boundaries" but tuned in to modern time.

This task is even more complicated in small ungauged catchments where inadequate amount of input, calibration, and validation data exists and thereby limit the application of process-based, parameter-heavy models. In this study, we present methodology to assess spatial variations in erosion and P losses, and based on source-apportionment and erosion modeling, to develop a base for source-and site-specific abatement countermeasures. Water quality monitoring program was developed to cover spatial variability in erosion and phosphorus (P) losses. Conducted soil survey detected high variations in soil P content within the catchment and strong correlation between soil P test and easily soluble P. A simple water balance model, calibrated for the comparable catchment with existing water flow measurements, was applied to determine water discharge, providing necessary input data for calculations of loads and source-apportionment. Source-apportionment modeling based on results from water discharge modeling, water quality monitoring program and soil survey identified P losses from arable fields as main source of P to two small lakes situated in the catchment, contributing roughly a half of total P load to the lakes. Inclusion of an assumed but previously undocumented point source considerably improved the performance of source-apportionment model. Existence of such a point-source was afterwards confirmed by results from detailed water quality monitoring program. Erosion modeling based on high-resolution digital elevation data identified areas most prone to erosion, and model results were compared to farmers' observations and analyses of Cs-137. Use of a spectrum of models and assessment tools formed a broad support for further steps in abatement efforts, and created concrete discussion base for implementation of detailed site-specific countermeasures.

AB  - Decentralized sanitation facilities serving single households to small communities can offer a more flexible way of improving global sanitation. In Nordic countries, on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are mostly used in sparsely populated areas and are regulated for the removal of phosphorus (Tot-P), organic matter (biological oxygen demand, (BOD7)) and total nitrogen (Tot-N). However, available reports, albeit commonly using small data sets, call attention to often low and variable treatment performance. In this work, a statistical analysis of 1301 samples from 395 units reported in 10 studies from Finland and Sweden was conducted. The objective was to increase knowledge regarding the effluent water quality of OWTS and their compliance with regulations. In addition, the goal was to identify possible factors affecting contaminant concentrations. Overall, compliance with base-level BOD7 removal requirements was met by most units while 10% of units exceeded Tot -N and >25% exceeded Tot-P limits. Non-compliance rates were high, especially for Tot-P, considering the studied data set was composed mostly of semi-new units (median 3.8 years). Neither weather (air temperature, precipitation, and snowmelt), age or load factors were found to strongly explain the data variability in either soil -based systems (SBS) or package plants (PP). Tot-N and Tot-P effluent concentrations of the two systems were not significantly different. Effluent BOD7 concentrations were lower in SBS (median 3.0 mg/L) when compared to PP (median 7.7 mg/L). Units with P-sorbing filters (median 0.69 mg/L) and chemical precipitation (median 1.54 mg/L), presented lower Tot-P effluent concentrations in contrast to traditional sand filters (median 4.0 mg/L). The biological process used in PP had a measurable effect on effluent BOD7 concentrations, with attached growth units presenting higher values (median 8.1 mg/L) than suspended growth units (median 7.1 mg/L). Although the data set utilized was large, its analysis revealed intrinsic bias in data collection, especially regarding system types and sampling seasonality with colder winter periods sampling underrepresented. There is a need for data collection to improve to allow conclusive treatment efficiency assessment including possible effects of climate and process-related factors.

AB  - Understanding the public's views and acceptability of shared micromobility (SMM) is crucial for uncovering barriers to incorporating SMM into sustainable urban mobility. This research studies stereotypes of SMM and their impacts on SMM's public acceptability. We focus on shared e-scooters and shared bikes/e-bikes in England, the Netherlands, and Sweden. We conceptualise stereotypes of SMM, developing a scale for their measurement. Factor analysis reveals that stereotypes of SMM are structured around two cognitive dimensions, namely, warmth and competence, which aligns with the stereotype content model. Warmth captures individuals' stereotyped SMM user images regarding how the users interact with other road users; competence reflects individuals' stereotyped SMM's capabilities to improve existing transport systems. Overall, stereotypes of SMM, characterised by low levels of warmth and high levels of competence, are ambivalent. Yet, they are also variable. Analysis of covariance unveils variations in SMM stereotypes across countries, sociodemographics, and travel patterns. Swedish residents, older adults, individuals from households without children, SMM users, and car-oriented individuals hold lower levels of warmth (for both types of SMM) and competence (for shared e-scooters) than their counterparts. Finally, the public acceptability of shared e-scooters is neutral, whilst that of shared bikes/ebikes is mildly positive. Multivariate analyses show that stereotypes' warmth and competence are positively associated with individuals' acceptability of SMM, cumulatively accounting for over 50% of the variation in acceptability. Our findings help inform policies and planning on SMM. The developed scale holds the potential for evaluating stereotypes of SMM in particular and emerging transport services in general.

AB  - The Baltic Sea ecosystem has undergone dramatic changes, so-called ecosystem regime shifts, during the past four decades. Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus) spawning-stock biomass has declined to a third, and weight-at-age has halved as a result of food shortages and competition with sprat (Sprattus sprattus). The management objective for the herring stock is currently in transition from precautionary to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The main basin Baltic Sea herring was modelled under the current ecosystem regime and the effect of a recovery of the cod (Gadus morhua) stock and the availability of planktonic food to levels found in the early 1980s analysed. A target of F-MSY = 0.16 for herring, which should decline to F-MSY = 0.10 with recovery of the cod stock, is proposed. An increase in the availability of planktonic food is estimated to more than double the yield at F-MSY = 0.27, overriding the negative effects of cod predation should there be a simultaneous increase in both cod and availability of planktonic food. The estimated net increase in yield is 40% at F-MSY = 0.20. Functions are presented to calculate FMSY and to estimate the expected yield depending on the abundance of cod and food availability. Retrospective application of the functions is indicative of overfishing of herring in the 1990s and early 2000s, and a net loss in yield, with a landing value of some E440 million.

TI  - A framework for prioritizing domestic animal breeds for conservation purposes at the national level: a Norwegian case study
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - EUROPE
AB  - Although encompassing only a handful of species, domestic animals have had profound effects on food production for humankind and on human societies. On a global basis, a large proportion of breeds are currently in danger of becoming extinct in the near future. At this critical time, resources are limited and only a selected number of breeds may be supported by concrete conservation programs. I present a framework! to facilitate decision making on a national level as to which breeds to support for conservation. These decisions should be made by a national committee of experts experienced with the different breeds and species. First, they must define the species of interest. Second, they should collate as much data as Possible and score each breed for Ley criteria: degree of endangerment, presence of traits of current economic value, presence of traits of current scientific value, agroecological value in a special landscape, cultural-historical value, and genetic uniqueness. The degree of endangerment is the most important criterion because great uncertainty about the future means that all breeds may have traits of future economic or scientific value, so the main aim should therefore be to minimize loss of breeds. To illustrate use of the framework, I considered breed prioritization in Norway. I compared and scored 45 breeds from 17 domestic animal species for these key criteria and thus identified Norwegian breeds of high priority for conservation.

AB  - This paper explores the importance of selecting appropriate communication styles when facing conflict in client-contractor relationships. By means of a case from the Norwegian oil and gas industry, which ended in a lengthy and fierce court battle, important sources to the outcome are identified. Communication strategies employed by the project partners, characterized by high degrees of "self-orientation" and "indirect" communication, prevented a "beautiful exit". The paper suggests that managerial awareness of how conflict episodes should be communicated not only reduces the risks of a devastating dissolution process, but can bring the parties back to a "normal" level of interaction. The managerial awareness is specified in terms of four propositions that conclude the paper.

AB  - Spatial patterns of non-indigenous species show scale-dependent properties. Sargassum muticum is an invasive macroalga widely distributed along the Atlantic Iberian Peninsula. Despite being quite abundant from Norway to South Portugal, there is little information about its patterns of distribution, particularly at a large spatial scale (i.e. thousands of kilometres). Here, we examined the spatial variation in the invasion success of S. muticum from rockpools at multiple spatial scales using a hierarchical design. In addition, we analysed how the richness of native assemblages was related to its invasion success and how this relationship changed over different scales. Most of the variation in the invasion success was found at the smallest scales of pool and plot. Furthermore, the invasibility of native macroalgal assemblages was related to the native species richness, but causes that determined invasion success could not be separated from the effects provoked by the invader. Results suggest that small-scale (centimetres to metres) processes contribute considerably to the heterogeneity of S. muticum invasion success. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data from the literature concerning stand aerial biomass, stand nutrient amount (i.e. N, P, K, Ca and Mg) of four major forest tree species of the temperate area were compiled in order to propose simple general relationships to quantify nutrient depletion associated with biomass harvesting. The objectives was to identify the tree species effect on nutrient loss through biomass removal. Mean weighted nutrient concentrations of aerial biomass decreased rapidly until the maximum current annual increment of stands was reached ("adult stands"); the concentration then became more or less constant. For adult stands, linear relations existed between aerial biomass and their nutrient amount. Using total aerial biomass (TAB) or stem biomass including bark (SBB) as references against the corresponding nutrient amount showed: i) that correlation coefficients were higher in the latter case, ii) that nutrient amount per unit of biomass was lower for SBB than for TAB, and iii) that these relations were species-dependent. For a same SBB, species were ranked as follows: mean concentration of N and K, European beech > Douglas fir = Norway spruce = Scots pine; Ca, European beech = Norway spruce greater than or equal to Scots pine greater than or equal to Douglas fir; Mg, European beech greater than or equal to Scots pine greater than or equal to Norway spruce greater than or equal to Douglas fir. For P, no significant difference was found for the tested species. The relationships between biomass and nutrient amount can be easily used by foresters to quantify the nutrient amount exported from a site during both thinning and harvesting operations, as well as the nutrients which remain in the logging residues left on the site and which will slowly yield available elements to the new plantation or the naturally regenerated stand.

AB  - Previous studies have identified implementation problems connected to sustainable mobility. These difficulties raise the question of which strategies can be successfully pursued to break path dependencies in urban policy making. This article is focused on corporate mobility management as one specific example of sustainable mobility initiatives, and analyses the formation and implementation of a travel policy for employees at the city administration of Orebro, Sweden. The analysis reveals how controversies can evolve into major implementation barriers for sustainable mobility initiatives. The analysis centres on the playing out of power relations between politicians and groups of officers in the development of interventions to break path dependencies. The strategy pursued in Orebro turned out to be very challenging within the municipality, since it required significant transformation of the officials' personal travel behaviour, and so led to open conflicts within the city administration. The case demonstrates that radical and confrontational attempts to break path dependencies may result in the same watering down as less controversial, more consensual strategies. When handling controversial sustainable mobility measures there may be more benefit in deliberative strategies of raising awareness, creating new consciousness or institutionalising desired discursive shifts.

AB  - Among the largest disturbances affecting the health of spruce forests is the large-scale appearance of bark beetles. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of infected-spruce areas is vital for effective and sustainable forest management. Medium-spatial-resolution (20-30 m) satellite images are well-suited for spruce forest disturbance monitoring at a landscape and regional scale following bark beetle outbreaks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the health of a Norway spruce stand after a bark beetle outbreak based on Landsat 8 images and thematic and vector data, supplemented with selected climate variables. This research was conducted for a spruce stand in the Bialowie(z) over dota Forest District in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. We hypothesised that the changes in spruce health would significantly influence the NDVI distributions during the studied years. Our research revealed that the weather conditions in the period of May-September were beneficial for beetle development and detrimental for the spruce stand, particularly in 2015, 2018, and 2019. SWIR-NIR-G and NDVI images showed a gradual deterioration in spruce health. The quantitative NDVI distributions varied; the minimum, mean, and median decreased; and the distribution shape of the index values changed over the studied years. An analysis of the spatial NDVI distributions revealed that the threshold NDVI value separating spruce stand areas in good and poor health was ca. 0.6. This study confirmed the applicability of NDVI for monitoring alterations in spruce stands, and indicated that spatial NDVI distributions can provide valuable support in forest monitoring at a landscape scale, since medium-resolution, ready-to-use NDVI images are easily available from the Landsat archives, facilitating the routine assessment of stand health.

AB  - To further the understanding of climate change adaptation processes, more attention needs to be paid to the various contextual factors that shape whether and how climate-related knowledge and information is received and acted upon by actors involved. This study sets out to examine the characteristics of forest owners' in Sweden, the information and knowledge-sharing networks they draw upon for decision-making, and their perceptions of climate risks, their forests' resilience, the need for adaptation, and perceived adaptive capacity. By applying the concept of ego-network analysis, the empirical data was generated by a quantitative survey distributed to 3000 private forest owners' in Sweden in 2014 with a response rate of 31%. The results show that there is a positive correlation, even though it is generally weak, between forest owner climate perceptions and (i) network features, i.e. network size and heterogeneity, and (ii) presence of certain alter groups (i.e. network members or actors). Results indicate that forest owners' social networks currently serve only a minimal function of sharing knowledge of climate change and adaptation. Moreover, considering the fairly infrequent contact between respondents and alter groups, the timing of knowledge sharing is important. In conclusion we suggest those actors that forest owners' most frequently communicate with, especially forestry experts providing advisory services (e.g. forest owner associations, companies, and authorities) have a clear role to communicate both the risks of climate change and opportunities for adaptation. Peers are valuable in connecting information about climate risks and adaptation to the actual forest property.

AB  - Forests with single tree species are hypothesized to be more susceptible to pest outbreaks than mixed forests. Population densities of two insect species, Ips subelongatus Motschulsky and Lymantria dispar L., with different dietary spectra were investigated in pure and mixed stands using window and light traps in Aershan forestry bureau, northeastern China in 2009. I. subelongatus is a monophagous pest of Larix gmelinii (Rupr.) Rupr. in the study area, while L. dispar is a highly polyphagous pest species feeding on both coniferous and deciduous tree species. The individual number and dominance index of the two indicator species were investigated and analyzed in 21 forest stands in a thinning-caused gradient of larch-birch mixture ranging from pure larch stands to pure birch stands (seven types in the present study). The results showed that the number of individuals of I. subelongatus was significantly related to the proportion of larch trees, i.e. the number of individuals decreased with the rising birch ratio in the canopy layer. Similar decrease was observed in the dominance index of I. subelongatus. However, no significantly obvious effects of canopy mixture on the individual number or dominance index were observed in L. dispar.

AB  - Marine growth has strong implications for reproductive potential and ultimate fitness of sea trout. Hence, the effects of anthropogenic factors on marine growth are important when evaluating population responses and implementing management measures. Temporal changes in growth patterns of sea trout from three Norwegian and two Irish watercourses were examined, covering time spans of 25-65 years. Elemental chemistry Ba:Ca profiles and visual reading of fish scales were used to estimate smolt length and lifetime growth after first sea entry. Reduced growth after the first sea entry coincided with periods of nearby (<14 km) salmon-farming activity in impacted watersheds in both countries. Increased Ba:Ca levels were also recorded during these periods, likely indicating reduced residency in marine habitats caused by premature return to freshwater and estuaries. An increase in estimated length at first sea entry coinciding with salmon-farming activity, for groups of fish sampled after sea migration, suggests a size-selective marine mortality, with the smallest individuals experiencing a larger mortality.

AB  - Knowledge about the environmental impact of alcohol is limited and as an effect alcohol is often excluded from environmental studies of diets or included in incomplete ways. This paper describes the climate impact of beer, wine and liquor by using life cycle assessment. The climate impact is quantified per litre of specific alcoholic beverages and per total amount of alcohol consumed based on self-reported data of 50 000 individuals from 2009 within two population-based cohorts in Sweden. The results show that alcoholic beverages generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the range of 0.73-2.38 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) per litre. Alcohol consumption in the population studied generates on average 52 kg CO(2)e per person and year. Within the 10% of the population with the highest intake of alcohol GHG emissions are up to 202 kg CO(2)e per person and year. Consumption of wine is responsible for the largest share of GHG emissions from alcoholic beverages (61%) followed by beer (33%), while liquor and strong wine account for a smaller share (6%). Alcohol consumption among men generates 90% higher GHG emissions than among women. Alcohol consumption and in consequence alcohol-related emissions are decreasing with increasing age of men and women. Our results indicate that alcohol consumption in Swedish men and women is responsible for an average of 3% of total diet-related GHG emissions and in sub-populations with the highest consumption up to 6-11%. Limiting alcohol could be an effective option to reduce the climate impact of diets, especially among men. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Some ecological restoration projects include elements of trial and error where new measures are repeatedly tried, evaluated, and modified until satisfactory results are achieved. Thereafter, the resulting methods may be applied on larger scales. A difficult step is judging whether developed "best-practice" methods have become reasonably ecologically functional or whether further experimentation "demonstration" methods can lead to yet better results. Here, we use a stream restoration project as a case study for evaluating methods and abiotic effects and outlining stakeholder support for demonstration restoration measures, rather than only using best-practice methods. Our work was located in the Vindel River system, a free-flowing river that is part of the Natura 2000 network. The river was exploited for timber floating from 1850-1976, and rapids in the main channel and tributaries below timberline were channelized to increase timber transport capacity. Several side channels in multi-channeled rapids were blocked and the flow was concentrated to a single channel from which boulders and large wood were removed. Hence, previously heterogeneous environments were replaced by more homogeneous systems with limited habitat for riverine species. The restoration project strives to alleviate the effects of fragmentation and channelization in affected rapids by returning coarse sediment from channel margins to the main channel. However, only smaller, angular sediment is available given blasting of large boulders, and large (old-growth) wood is largely absent; therefore, original levels of large boulders and large wood in channels cannot be achieved with standard restoration practices. In 10 demonstration sites, we compensated for this by adding large boulders and large wood (i.e., entire trees) from adjacent upland areas to previously best-practice restored reaches and compared their hydraulic characteristics with 10 other best-practice sites. The demonstration sites exhibited significantly reduced and more variable current velocities, and wider channels, but with less variation than pre-restoration. The ecological response to this restoration has not yet been studied, but potential outcomes are discussed.

AB  - Ant-aphid mutualisms, in which ants tend aphids, which in turn provide honeydew to the ants, are widespread and have been shown to affect plant growth. In boreal forests the effect of ant-aphid mutualism on tree growth can vary with stand age, because forest clear-cutting harms the ecologically most dominant ant partner in such mutualisms, wood ants (Formica rufa group). We studied whether the mutualism between wood ants and Cinara aphids affects the growth of boreal Norway spruces (Picea abies L Karst.) in stands of different ages. In boreal forests, conifers, unlike deciduous trees, have only few defoliating insects, and therefore we expected the growth loss of conifers due to sap sucking by aphids not to be compensated by reduced insect herbivory due to predation by wood ants. The study was conducted in medium-fertile spruce-dominated stands in eastern Finland. We used stands of four different age classes (5, 30, 60 and 100 years) and selected ten spruces heavily visited and ten spruces lightly visited by ants around five medium-sized ant mounds in each stand age class. The access of ants was blocked on half of the trees in both groups. In the 5-year-old stands, the mean annual height growth of individual heavily visited seedlings was 16.3% greater than in the ones where ant traffic was blocked, but this difference was not significant. In the 30-year-old stands, the mean annual radial growth of the heavily visited spruces was 7.3% smaller than in trees where ant traffic was blocked, and this difference was significant. The mutualism had no significant effect on the radial growth in the 60- and 100-year-old stands. In the 60-year-old stands, however, the spruces that were visited heavily prior to the beginning of the study grew significantly less relative to their past growth than the initially lightly visited trees during the study. This suggests that the ant-aphid mutualism may have long-term effects on tree growth. The ant-aphid mutualism had no significant effect on the growth at the stand level. The results indicate that ant-aphid mutualism can have a significant effect on the growth of individual spruces, but the effect is negligible at ecosystem level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Beaches along the northern coast of Estonia form an interesting class of almost equilibrium, bayhead beaches located in bays deeply cut into the mainland in an essentially non-tidal, highly compartmentalised coastal landscape, and that develop mostly under the influence of wave action. These beaches, although often suffering from a certain sediment deficit, are stabilised by the postglacial land uplift. We describe the basic features of their appearance and functioning from the viewpoint of sediment transport processes. Wave action normally impacts a relatively narrow nearshore band and additionally stabilises the beaches through littoral drift of sandy sediment and gravel towards the bayheads. Eolian transport and fluvial sediment supply have typically very modest magnitude. Such beaches, in general, evolve quite slowly and may represent an almost equilibrium stage, even when the active sand mass is very limited. The concept of the equilibrium beach profile is an adequate tool for their analysis. As an example, its parameters and longshore transport patterns are evaluated for Pirita Beach based on a granulometric survey and long-term simulation of wave climate. It is demonstrated that net sand changes for such beaches can be estimated directly from the properties of the equilibrium profile, land uplift rate, and loss or gain of the dry beach area. Another type of highly dynamic equilibrium exists owing to interplay of the effects of river flow and wave action at the mouths of large rivers such as the Narva River.

AB  - Exploring energy use-growth nexus can proffer valuable clues to policymakers and stakeholders on both economic and environmental sustainability targets. Unlike extant studies, this study focuses on the effects of renewable energy consumption on the economic progress of the Nordic countries including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland. The empirical analysis encompasses two distinctive renewable energy consumption indicators while accounting for influential factors like research and development (R&D) expenditures, and both human and physical capital components within the traditional growth model framework. The DCCE estimator was deployed for the empirical analysis covering the available sample data between 1995 and 2020. From the results, the estimated impact of renewable energy consumption on economic progress varies according to its measurement vis-a-vis the utilized indicator 1 (renewable as % of total energy use) and indicator 2 (distinctive renewable power sources and biofuels). In the case of the former indicator, the impacts were insignificant while a positive significant impact on growth was seen across all model evaluations using both the GDP and per capita income levels of the Nordic countries in the latter indicator. Furthermore, both R&D expenditures and human capital component are essential significant long-run drivers of both economic growth and income levels in the bloc while physical capital formation produced contrary evidence on economic progress in the bloc. As such, policy implications and recommendations to enhance economic progress were suggested in the main text for the Nordic countries in view of renewable energy development and the bloc's environmental sustainability drive. Notably, strategic policy implementation should be geared towards encouraging more R&D expenditures, especially in renewable energy developments to facilitate economic growth and income levels while further positioning the Nordic bloc on environmental sustainability path.

AB  - The population dynamics of two polycarpic perennials, Agrimonia eupatoria and Geum rivale, characteristic of semi-natural grasslands in Scandinavia, were examined in south-eastern Sweden. The perennial forbs were studied for several years in two populations each, located in habitats characteristic for the species in the study area. Demographic transition probabilities varied significantly between populations and among years for the species. Transition matrix modelling yielded lambda-values (population growth rates) that ranged from 0.89 to 1.14 for A. eupatoria and from 0.94 to 1.04 for G. rivale. The elasticity analysis showed that stasis in the adult stage classes contributed most to lambda. The life-table response experiment analysis produced similar results as the elasticity analysis, where stasis together with progression in the adult stage classes made a large contribution to the observed spatial variation in lambda. Simulations of expected time to extinction were in the order of centuries for the study populations. Seedling recruitment was enhanced by seed addition and small scale disturbance in populations. For the intermediately abundant and more patchily distributed A. eupatoria, a regional survey of local populations was conducted in the study area which revealed that most populations were relatively small (< 100 individuals) and restricted to grassland fragments in road verges. Furthermore, an attempt was made to estimate fruit dispersal from local populations.

AB  - Safe recycling of nutrients found in human excreta back to agriculture is an important component of a circular economy that can protect waterways and stabilize food prices. Although many technological advances for the recovery of these nutrients exist, large-scale implementation is lacking. A commonly cited barrier is a lack of acceptance of fertilizers from human excreta and for food products grown with such fertilizers. The food retail sector, as an intermediary between producers and consumers, is an important actor with power to influence opinions and purchasing practices. In this study, we surveyed 127 food retailers (stores) and reviewed publicly available retailer sustainability policies to assess acceptance of the use of recycled fertilizers. We gauged acceptance of three products relevant for the Swedish market - struvite, phosphorus from ash, and dehydrated urine. Most respondents felt that all three recovery techniques were unlikely to be harmful either to themselves or to the environment. It was more acceptable to use products further away from human consumption. In general, struvite and phosphorus from ash were perceived more positively. Acceptance of wastewater-derived fertilizers was largely dependent on perceived risks, especially the fate of pharmaceutical residues. While re-tailers in Sweden are not negative to reuse, they seem unlikely to provide strong support for nutrient recircu-lation from human excreta unless it becomes a greater concern for the public.

AB  - River-aquifer interfaces are essential for ecosystem functioning in terms of nutrient exchange and biological habitat, but are greatly threatened world-wide. This study examined geochemical aspects of river-aquifer interaction in one regulated and one unregulated boreal river in Northern Sweden to determine whether the geochemical functioning of the hyporheic zone is affected by hydrological alterations, e.g. regulated river discharge and river-aquifer connectivity. In the unregulated Kalix River, the hyporheic pore water was well-oxygenated with orthogonal fluxes (approximate to 0.6-0.7 m d(-1)) and acted as a sink for Fe, Mn, Al, NH4, and Ca, with fractional losses of 95%, 92%, 45%, 31%, and 15%, respectively. A corresponding elevation in the concentrations of these elements in the hyporheic sediment was observed, with higher saturation indices of Fe-, Mn-, and Al-bearing secondary minerals in hyporheic waters. In the regulated Lule River, hydraulic connectivity at the river-aquifer interface was altered by the presence of a clogging layer (0.04 m d(-1)). In addition, the river discharge oscillated daily, severely reducing exchange flows across the riverbed (<0.01 m d(-1)). As a result, the hyporheic pore water was suboxic, with elevated concentrations of filtered Fe and Mn (fractional increases of approximate to 3700% and approximate to 2500%, respectively) and other solutes (NH4, Si, S, Ca). A conceptual model revealed functional differences between geochemical features of the hyporheic zone of regulated and unregulated rivers. Overall, the results showed that hyporheic processes are altered along regulated rivers, with resulting impacts on the geochemistry of riverine, riparian and related marine ecosystems.

AB  - Dead wood dependent (saproxylic) insects have been identified as vulnerable to the effects of modern forestry practices. We examined the effects of variable retention harvesting on saproxylic beetle assemblages. Variable retention of living green trees seeks to leave more forest structure on the landscape with the goal of maintaining ecosystem function and biodiversity. Ninety flight-intercept traps were divided between recently dead natural snags and snags killed by girdling in three replicated forest stands with 10%, 20%, 50%, and 75% residual structure and in uncut control stands. Beetles were collected and identified during the second and third summers post harvest and grouped for analyses as (i) wood- and bark-borers, (ii) fungivores, and (iii) predators. Harvesting intensity explained a relatively small amount of the variability in the beetle assemblages. However, all groups responded strongly to coarse woody debris variables and especially to snag decay class during the third postharvest summer, suggesting that factors associated with coarse woody debris quality and quantity determine the initial responses and successional trajectories of saproxylic beetle assemblages. The main effects of variable retention on saproxylic assemblages are expected to be mediated through differences in amount of coarse woody debris expected to materialize with the death and decay of green trees left as residual elements.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were measured in sediment cores from 13 locations in South-Western Barents Sea as part of a detailed study of the Norwegian seabed under the MAREANO program. The generally low PAH levels found, an average around 200 ng g(-1) dry weight for SLIM PAH, indicate low inputs of petroleum hydrocarbons to the marine environment in the area. Differences in PAH composition and various PAH ratios indicate a natural, mostly petrogenic origin of PAH in sediments from the open sea locations, while the fjord locations show higher pyrogenic PAH contents with an increase towards upper sediment layers, indicating low inputs from human activities. Petrogenic PAH levels increase in deeper sediments at open sea locations, also when normalised to total organic carbon (TOC) contents, suggesting natural leakages of oil-related hydrocarbons in the area.

TI  - The 'civil wars' revisited (12th-century Scandinavia)
T2  - HISTORISK TIDSSKRIFT
LA  - English
AB  - In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, protracted 'civil wars' began in the 1130s. Many studies have been devoted to these conflicts and their causes, but few in a Scandinavian perspective, and too little attention has been given to the fact that they broke out all at the same time in three countries. Early accounts of this period treat the wars as personal struggles for power between rivals and their adherents. In the twentieth century, few historians were satisfied with these simple and personal explanations and therefore began to look for more fundamental causes - ideological, constitutional, economic or regional. It cannot be denied that such factors had a role, but here it is argued that rivalry for royal power was much more important, and attention is drawn to the individuals involved and the strategies planned by and for them. Throughout Scandinavia, these involved the creation of power networks in which women were not only pawns but also important agents. Finally, the description of these conflicts as 'civil wars' is questioned, and a plea is made for trying to escape the limitations of national 'strait-jackets' and of retrospective interpretations.

AB  - With Norway currently representing one of the few successful electric car markets in the world, our study provides early insights into the emerging electric vehicle culture. In this article, we argue that this culture challenges and modifies previous gendered constructions of cars as well as actual driving practices. When interviewing electric vehicle (EV) owners about the process of buying and owning an EV, we found stereotypical claims of feminine environmentalism and masculine fascination with technology. However, we also observed counter-narratives that destabilise such accounts, reframing the car in more hybrid terms. As a hybrid construction, the EV seems to appeal equally to both women and men, framing their enthusiasm within differently gendered narratives. We also found that owning and using EVs influenced driver identities and actual driving practices. Factors attracting EV users in Norway are many, extending beyond environmental concerns and financial savings. These insights bring crucial nuance to EV user representations and illustrate the significance of cultural inquiries in mobility transitions.

AB  - Regulation of lake water level for power production and flood control is among the major anthropogenic disturbances in boreal aquatic ecosystems. In Finland, over 300 lakes, representing one third of the total inland water area of the country, are artificially regulated. To study the effects of regulation on lake littoral macroinvertebrate communities, samples were taken from upper stony littoral and from lower soft bottom littoral habitats of 11 lakes with different regulation amplitudes (wintertime fall in water level 1.19-6.75 m). Twelve unregulated (wintertime fall in water level 0.11-0.55 m) lakes with otherwise similar characteristics were used as a reference. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordinations showed that the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages was strongly associated with the amplitude of water level regulation. Taxon richness also decreased with increasing intensity of regulation. Freezing and flushing of sediments in late winter are probably the most important factors leading to the impoverished littoral macroinvertebrate fauna. Invertebrates with long life cycle seem to be particularly vulnerable to unnatural water level fluctuation. Our results show that regulation of water level has a major impact on functionally significant lake littoral macroinvertebrates.

The interaction of legumes with other crops (rotational effects) requires an assessment at the cropping system scale. The objective of this work is to introduce a cropping system framework to assess the impacts of changes in cropping systems in a participatory approach with experts, i.e., the integration of legumes into crop rotations and to demonstrate its application in two case studies. The framework consists of a rule-based rotation generator and a set of algorithms to calculate impact indicators. It follows a three-step approach: (i) generate rotations, (ii) evaluate crop production activities using environmental, economic and phytosanitary indicators, and (iii) design cropping systems and assess their impacts. Experienced agronomists and environmental scientists were involved at several stages of the framework development and testing in order to ensure the practicability of designed cropping systems. The framework was tested in Vastra Gotaland (Sweden) and Brandenburg (Germany) by comparing cropping systems with and without legumes. In both case studies, cropping systems with legumes reduced nitrous oxide emissions with comparable or slightly lower nitrate-N leaching, and had positive phytosanitary effects. In arable systems with grain legumes, gross margins were lower than in cropping systems without legumes despite taking pre-crop effects into account. Forage cropping systems with legumes had higher or equivalent gross margins and at the same time higher environmental benefits than cropping systems without legumes. The framework supports agronomists to design sustainable legume-supported cropping systems and to assess their impacts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Local authorities are important actors in the transition towards sustainable development. They can play important roles for the promotion of industrial ecology systems oriented management of resources and pollutants on the local and regional level. In this context, the method of substance flow analysis (SFA) has been argued to be supportive to municipal environmental management, although, performing an SFA is often time consuming and demands great deal of work. It may be a task hard to fulfil on a regular basis for many local authorities. A crucial issue is, then, to what extent it is possible to learn from other SFA studies? Aiming to contribute to this understanding, this paper analyses comparative results of SFA case studies of the cadmium metabolism in three structurally different municipalities in Sweden. The analyses illustrate that in addition to specific knowledge gained from a single case study, there is also general knowledge that may constitute important information for environmental decision-making in other local authorities.

AB  - 1. Comparative studies of distinct, but not ecologically isolated, systems such as lakes and streams may improve our understanding of the importance of ecological linkages in aquatic ecosystems.
   2. In this study we compared the macroinvertebrate benthos of stony habitats in Swedish lakes and streams. Community composition was used to evaluate zoogeographic patterns and functional feeding guilds were used to identify mechanisms potentially affecting such patterns.
   3. Stream communities were generally more diverse and species-rich and had a higher proportion of grazers, shredders and passive-filter feeders than lakes. Lake communities had a higher proportion of predators and collector-gatherers. Of the 10 most common taxa, only Leptophlebia mayflies, clams (Sphaeriidae) and the isopod Asellus aquaticus were recorded in both lakes and streams.
   4. Among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities accounted for by regional-scale variables was low (6.4% for lakes and 10.1% for streams), compared with that by local-scale variables (21% for lakes and 37.6% for streams). For lakes, the among-site variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by habitat-scale characteristics followed by ecosystem, riparian, catchment, geographic position and ecoregion. For streams, the variance in macroinvertebrate communities was best explained by ecosystem characteristics followed by habitat, catchment, riparian, ecoregion and geographic position.
   5. Conspicuous differences in spatial pattern were revealed between lakes and streams. For lakes, the most unequivocal differences in community composition and function occurred at the transition zone between the mixed forests in the south and the boreal coniferous forests in the north. Surprisingly, streams did not respond as strongly to profound landscape-level differences in climate and vegetation cover.
   6. The spatial differences noted between macroinvertebrate communities of lakes and streams may be because of differences in retention of detrital matter. Our findings imply that detrital inputs are qualitatively similar, but that the retention and processing of coarse particulate organic matter was presumably higher in lake littoral regions than in stream riffle habitats.
   7. Although our findings support the conjecture that species distribution is determined fundamentally by conditions prevailing at the local-scale, regional factors such as land use/type and the role of history were important and seemingly act as strong determinants of large-scale patterns in biodiversity.

AB  - This article focuses on shifts in the use of natural resources by referencing a theoretical discussion of post-productivism and neo-productivism. Transitions from one form of nature use to another are not straightforward but entail various cycles and combinations. Neo-productivism appears to be a versatile concept fit for describing the use of natural resources, which is becoming more complex and difficult to describe. Neo-productivism describes a renewed form of productivism that emphasises environmental perspectives and sustainability in addition to the production of natural resources. It includes new characteristics in the material utilisation of nature, including pressures towards production increase. Our case studies present two Finnish natural resource peripheries: in the Forest Karelia, forests have been central to landscapes and incomes, whereas livelihoods in the archipelago have been dependent on sea and fish stocks.

AB  - The importance and volume of aquaculture is increasing world-wide. Rearing practices play a key role in determining growth rate, survival and disease resistance in aquaculture fishes. Recent evidence suggests that in comparison with a standard stimulus-poor rearing environment, an enriched or variable rearing environment has significant positive effects on several traits underlying growth and well-being of fish. However, the effect of enriched rearing on one of the most important threats for aquaculture development, occurrence of parasitic infections, remains unknown.
   We used surveillance data of experimental salmonid populations of wild and hatchery origin under semi-natural parasite exposure to explore effects of enriched rearing on outbreaks of important aquaculture pathogens and associated fish mortalities in production-scale fish densities. We also conducted controlled parasite exposures to investigate if enriched rearing reduces susceptibility of fish to infection in comparison with standard rearing conditions.
   We found evidence of enriched rearing influencing survival and disease resistance of aquaculture fish during parasite epidemics. Essentially, populations from enriched rearing had a higher survival rate, lower parasite occurrence and greater resistance to most infections compared to fish held in standard rearing conditions. Similarly, fish of wild genetic background had lower mortality during some of the epidemics compared to fish of hatchery origin. However, we also demonstrate significant variation in these patterns and in some cases a tendency for opposite effects of enriched rearing and genetic background depending on the fish species and nature of the epidemic.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that parasitic infections and epidemics can be managed through enriched rearing conditions. This may have important implications for economically and ecologically sustainable parasite and disease prevention strategies in aquaculture.

AB  - Improved energy efficiency in supply chains can reduce both environmental impact and lifecycle costs, and thus becomes a competitive advantage in the work towards a sustainable global economy. Viewing the supply chain as a system provides the holistic perspective needed to avoid sub-optimal energy use. This article studies measures relating to technology and management that can increase energy efficiency in the supply chains of five aluminium products made in Sweden. Additionally, energy efficiency potentials related to the flows of material, energy, and knowledge between the actors in the supply chains are studied. Empirical data was collected using focus group interviews and one focus group per product was completed. The results show that there are several areas for potential energy efficiency improvement; for example, product design, communication and collaboration, transportation, and reduced material waste. Demands from other actors that can have direct or indirect effects on energy use in the supply chains were identified. Despite the fact that companies can save money through improved energy efficiency, demands from customers and the authorities would provide the additional incentives needed for companies to work harder to improve energy efficiency.

LA  - English
AB  - In the Nordic countries planning at regional and local (municipal) level seems to have a high normative status as an operative means for implementing national policies. In particular planning is regarded as a useful and effective tool for national and local integration and coordination of environmental concerns in a system of highly dispersed and decentralized responsibilities. Planning Is supposed to give professional guidance for political and administrative decisions to act on local problems within a framework of overall national policies.
   Empirical studies observe substantial disparities between the ideals of environmental planning and actual practice in regional and local authorities. Real co-ordinated and committed efforts from various government sectors seem difficult to obtain, conflicting policies are not easily resolved and the actual effect on local politics and decision making seem to be far less than assumed in the normative planning models.
   The article discusses some of these observations and experiences in a Norwegian context and suggests possible explanations to this gap between planning norms and realities.

AB  - Fragmentation of forest ecosystems increases the proportion of edge habitat and is accompanied by a change in plant species composition. The recreational use of urban forests leads to decreased vegetation cover and the formation of paths, and thus, to fragmentation at small scales. We studied the impacts of forest and path edge effects on the soil microbial community structure (by using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method) and microbial activity (measured as basal respiration) in 34 mesic boreal urban forest fragments in Finland. We sampled the humus layer 1) from the forest edge into the interior (0-80 m), and 2) at different distances from paths. Microbial community structure was only slightly affected by the forest edge but differences were found between distances of 0-10 m and over 50 m from the edge. These changes correlated with changes in soil pH. Although changes in the microbial community structure were not pronounced, microbial biomass and activity were 30-45% lower at the first 20 m into the forest fragments, due to a low moisture content of the humus near the edge. The decreased microbial activity detected at forest edges implies decreased litter decomposition rates, and thus, a change in ecosystem nutrient cycling. The microbial community structure differed between paths and surrounding areas and correlated with changes in soil pH. Paths also supported approximately 25-30% higher microbial biomass with a transition zone of at least 1 m from the path edge. Path associated disturbances (mainly alterations in vegetation and soil pH) were reflected in the soil microbial community structure up to 1.5 m from the paths. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Promoting and attaining sustainable use of resources through community participation is a central tenet of the European Union's (EU) 2013 Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. A systematic review approach was used to identify participatory fisheries management arrangements within the EU. Following this, the participatory arrangements were categorized based on the nature of the decision-making arrangement, influence and empowerment of the fishing industry. The study identified 40 management arrangements distributed through 8 member states, with a variety of fisheries and institutional settings for participation in fisheries management in the EU. The majority of the partnerships identified are "Functional participation", i.e., the participatory arrangement is based in pre-determined goals encouraged by higher decision-making levels in order to increase efficiency of management decisions. Interactive partnership was the highest level of participation identified in the systematic review, and is usually more conducive with local arrangements in coastal and small-scale fisheries targeting low mobility species.

AB  - We present pollen-based reconstructions of the spatio-temporal dynamics of northern European regional vegetation abundance through the Holocene. We apply the Regional Estimates of VEgetation Abundance from Large Sites (REVEALS) model using fossil pollen records from eighteen sites within five modern biomes in the region. The eighteen sites are classified into four time-trajectory types on the basis of principal components analysis of both the REVEALS-based vegetation estimates (RVs) and the pollen percentage (PPs). The four trajectory types are more clearly separated for RVs than PPs. Further, the timing of major Holocene shifts, rates of compositional change, and diversity indices (turnover and evenness) differ between RVs and PPs. The differences are due to the reduction by REVEALS of biases in fossil pollen assemblages caused by different basin size, and inter-taxonomic differences in pollen productivity and dispersal properties. For example, in comparison to the PPs, the RVs show an earlier increase in Corylus and Ulmus in the early-Holocene and a more pronounced increase in grassland and deforested areas since the mid-Holocene. The results suggest that the influence of deforestation and agricultural activities on plant composition and abundance from Neolithic times was stronger than previously inferred from PPs. Relative to PPs, RVs show a more rapid compositional change, a largest decrease in turnover, and less variable evenness in most of northern Europe since 5200 cal yr BP. All these changes are primarily related to the strong impact of human activities on the vegetation. This study demonstrates that RV-based estimates of diversity indices, timing of shifts, and rates of change in reconstructed vegetation provide new insights into the timing and magnitude of major human distribution on Holocene regional, vegetation, feature that are critical in the assessment of human impact on vegetation, land-cover, biodiversity, and climate in the past.

AB  - We studied the ten-year response of understory vegetation and lichens in mature boreal Norway spruce forests to five felling treatments in southern Finland. The stand level treatments represent a range in intensity of overstory removal: clear felling (CF) with site preparation and planting, retention felling (RF) (7% of stand volume retained) with site preparation and planting, gap felling with site preparation (GFs) (50% retained) and without planting, gap felling (GF) (50% retained) without site preparation or planting, and selection felling (SF) (67% retained) without site preparation or planting. Disc trenching was used for site preparation. Vegetation was sampled before and 1, 2, 3 and 10 years after the treatments. Both species cover and number decreased significantly immediately after all treatments. The resistance of understory vegetation, defined as the amount of change in the community structure caused by the treatments, increased in the order CF < RF < GFs < SF < GF. The dynamics of vascular plants depended on the felling intensity. The dynamics of non-vascular species depended both on the felling intensity and site preparation. CF and RF caused almost similar effects on understory vegetation composition. Local extinctions of mosses and liverworts were caused especially by CF and RF. However, even with 67% retention, 18 bryophyte species were lost during the study period. Loss of bryophyte species was higher after SF than after GF treatments, suggesting that aggregated retention is better for maintaining bryophyte species in felling areas. The resilience of understory vegetation increased in the order CF < RF < GFs < GF < SF. The abundance of mosses, liverworts and dwarf shrubs had not recovered ten years after treatments. Herb species were the most resilient compared to other species groups. We conclude that in intensively managed forest landscapes, GF and SF can be recommended as alternatives to CF to better maintain understory diversity on the stand level. However, the aim with GF and SF treatments was to further harvest the stands. Subsequent removal of the residual stands may cause substantial changes in understory vegetation for the whole treatment area. To protect late-successional bryophytes in felling areas in mesic spruce forests, high levels of retention and minimizing soil disturbance would be required. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It would be very useful for conservation biologists to be able to predict threat status from ecological characteristics of species, and past studies have shown promising results. Regarding one important threat indicator taxon, the butterflies, results from a study on Finnish species by Kotiaho et al. (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:1963-1967, 2005), suggested that threatened butterflies on average have narrower niches, more restricted distributions of the larval host plants, poorer dispersal abilities and shorter flight periods. However, this study did not control for phylogenetic relatedness of species. To examine the effects of phylogenetic control, and to see how far it is possible to generalize from specific investigations, we compared the ecological characteristics of threatened and non-threatened butterfly species at two different geographical scales: Sweden and Europe. Our results illustrate the difficulties of generalizing between sites, geographical scales, scoring methods, and phylogenetic versus non-phylogenetic analyses. Controlling for phylogeny is shown to be essential. The most robust result is that threatened species have narrower habitat ranges at the local scale.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the biodiversity and community structure of Swedish meiofaunal eukaryotes using metabarcoding. To validate the reliability of the metabarcoding approach, we compare the taxonomic resolution obtained using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (COI) Thini-barcode' and nuclear 18S small ribosomal subunit (18S) V1-V2 region, with traditional morphology-based identification of Xenacoelomorpha and Nematoda.
   Location: 30 samples were analysed from two ecologically distinct locations along the west coast of Sweden. 18 replicate samples of coarse shell sand were collected along the northeastern side of Hallo island near Smogen, while 12 replicate samples of soft mud were collected in the Gullmarn Fjord near Lysekil.
   Methods: Meiofauna was extracted using flotation and siphoning methods. Both COI and 18S regions were amplified from total DNA samples using Metazoan specific primers and subsequently sequenced using Illumina MiSeq, producing in total 24 132 875 paired-end reads of 300 bp in length, of which 15 883 274 COI reads and 8 249 601 18S reads. These were quality filtered resulting in 7 954 017 COI sequences and 890 370 18S sequences, clustered into 2805 and 1472 representative OTUs respectively, yielding 190 metazoan OTUs for COI and 121 metazoan OTUs for 18S using a 97% sequence similarity threshold.
   Results: The Metazoan fraction represents 7% of the total dataset for COI (190 OTUs) and 8% of sequences for 18S (121 OTUs). Annelida (30% of COI metazoan OTUs and 23.97% of 18S metazoan OTUs) and Arthropoda (27.37% of COI metazoan OTUs and 11.57% of 18S metazoan OTUs), were the most OTU rich phyla identified in all samples combined. As well as Annelida and Arthropoda, other OTU rich phyla represented in our samples include Mollusca, Platyhelminthes and Nematoda. In total, 213 COI OTUs and 243 18S OTUs were identified to species using a 97% sequence similarity threshold, revealing some non-native species and highlighting the potential of metabarcoding for biological recording. Taxonomic community composition shows as expected clear differentiation between the two habitat types (soft mud versus coarse shell sand), and diversity observed varies according to choice of meiofaunal sampling method and primer pair used.

AB  - The idea of continued economic growth is increasingly questioned and critically analysed on the basis of its potential negative sustainability impact. Along with the critique, visions and strategies for alternative systems need also be brought onto the agenda. The aim of this paper is to present the qualitative content of scenarios that explore sustainability strategies for the Swedish society when economic growth is not seen as an end in itself, and instead the objective is other values/targets that society might wish to achieve. Multi-target backcasting scenarios are developed that illustrate future states in which four sustainability targets (climate, land use, participation, and resource security) are to be attained. The focus of these four scenarios is: 1) a Collaborative economy, 2) Local self-sufficiency, 3) Automation for quality of life, and 4) Circular economy in the welfare state. In the paper, we also present the process of the development of the scenarios, and feedback from stakeholders. Although the focus is on Sweden, the process and scenarios may also be relevant for other similar countries. The scenarios are discussed in terms of their relevance and their purpose, the fulfilment of the sustainability targets, and the multi-target approach.

AB  - Current knowledge of the beginnings of crop cultivation in Lithuania is based mainly on Cerealia-type pollen data supplemented by other indirect evidence such as agricultural tools. We argue that these records, predating carbonized remains of cultivated plants, are not substantial enough indicators of the early stages of agriculture in Lithuania. Here, we demonstrate that the macroremains of cultural plants that were previously reported from two Neolithic settlements in Lithuania were either mistakenly identified as domestic crops or incorrectly ascribed to the Neolithic period due to movement through the stratigraphic sequence and the absence of direct dating of cereal grains. Furthermore, we present a charred Hordeum vulgare grain from the Bronze Age settlement of Kvietiniai in western Lithuania. It was AMS-dated to 1392-1123 cal BC, and at present represents the earliest definite evidence for a crop in the eastern Baltic region. We conclude that, presently, there are no grounds to suggest that crop cultivation took place in Lithuania during the Neolithic.

AB  - The differences in the scarlet rosefinch (Carpodacus erythrinus) song were described for three individual parts of its breeding area: southwestern coast of Baikal Lake, southeastern coast of Ladoga Lake, and southeastern coast of Finnish Gulf. The most significant differences in specific features were revealed between the songs of birds from the most distant parts of this species area - the southwestern coast of Baikal Lake and the southeastern coasts of Ladoga Lake and of Finnish Gulf (combined sampling). Based on the pattern of the frequency modulation, 10 main elements in the bird song structure were distinguished. The occurrence of these elements in the song of scarlet rosefinch from different parts of the area varied to some extent. Some hypothetical sources of these differences, such as the cultural evolution hypothesis and the acoustic adaptation hypothesis are discussed.

AB  - An analysis of energy and material flows has been elaborated for the Swedish region Jamtland with the aim of monitoring and comparing regional sustainability by following the work energy flow method developed in a study of the Danish island of Samso (Nielsen & Jorgensen, 2011).
   In the region of Jamtland about 46,000 TJ of energy flows into society, of which 88% is renewable. From this an amount corresponding to 30,800 TJ is exported as electricity from the region, while another 410 TJ is exported as waste to be incinerated. The remaining part, about 15,200 TJ (63% renewable), drives Jamtland. From an energy flow perspective, the most important production from the region, apart from electricity production, is biomass from the forest: 49,000 TJ estimated as energy content in the biomass harvested. Another 55,000 TJ is added to the standing biomass every year as forest growth (only productive forest land area has been calculated).
   Some suggested indices of sustainability have been calculated and Jamtland shows high values. However, it will be a challenge to transform the quite large transport sector of Jamtland, and therefore the potential to become fully sustainable (ref to indexes used for the Samso study) might not be quite as high. In order to reduce the use of non-renewable energy, a major conversion of the transport fleet is needed, and this should be given high priority. The private sector is the largest single user of non-renewable energy (2,200 TJ). One successful transition is the Swedish diesel mix with 19% FAME/HVO derived from vegetable or animal sources and regarded as renewable. The consumption of FAME/HVO is predicted to increase significantly, increasing the importance of the forest as a source.
   A sustainability analysis based at work energy flows shows for both Samso and Jamtland that large natural resources producing a high work energy output combined with low work energy use due to low population density, gives high sustainability indicators. This indicates that regions with high population density and the absence of natural resources (high import), as in most regions in the world, will show low sustainability indicators.

AB  - The restoration of floodplain woodlands demands an understanding of the linkages between process, form and past management history at both a local and catchment scale. Site and reach scale processes that influence the species composition of floodplain woodland species are described with a particular focus on the relationships between hydrological and sediment inputs to floodplains and the regeneration response by tree species. The importance of integrating natural science knowledge gained at the site reach scale with decisions taken at the catchment scale on water allocation priorities is then discussed.
   Research was carried out on the River Ore in Sweden, The River Ouse in the United Kingdom and the River Is re and River Garonne in France. Research results at the site and reach scale allow broad definition of ideal conditions for the regeneration and growth of floodplain tree species and the flows that provide them: (1) channel movement has to occur for the creation of sedimentation sites required for the regeneration of early successional species and the flows that provide them; (2) flooding events should occur periodically to cause both channel movement and recharge floodplain water tables; (3) water table decline rates following a flood event must be slow enough that seedling roots can maintain contact with the retreating water front; (4) unseasonal flood events can cause high mortality of seedlings and prevent successful regeneration in any season. Some of the requirements for the restoration of floodplain woodlands can be delivered through site and reach scale restoration projects with reasonably predictable ecological outcomes. A more holistic approach to the provision of regeneration sites for floodplain woodlands would also include water allocation decisions targeted at providing flow conditions which could restore geomorphological processes. However, it is difficult to predict ecosystem responses to catchment scale flow allocation measures and, therefore, in the intensively managed river corridors of Western Europe, river restoration initiatives tend to be restricted to the site and reach scale.

AB  - Successful reconstruction of vegetation from fossil pollen data in the arctic and alpine tundra, and at the forest-tundra ecotone, is hampered by low pollen production of the major taxa in these environments and the likely dominance of the background pollen component. New approaches to the quantification of vegetation from pollen data (the REVEALS and LOVE models) rely on quantification of background and local pollen by applying models of pollen dispersal and deposition to modern pollen vegetation survey work. To date, research within this emerging area has focused on lowland environments. This paper presents pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) from the forest-tundra ecotone derived from west central Sweden, discusses the relevant source area of pollen (RSAP) in this environment and estimates the background pollen contribution. The results suggest that the RSAP for moss polsters at the forest-tundra ecotone is c. 500 m, and that PPEs for the major forest tundra ecotone taxa show significant differences compared with previous studies from southern Sweden. Proximity to range limits (controlled by climatic factors) appears to be the main factor causing generally lower pollen production; however, individual taxa respond in different ways, depending on differences in growth behaviour, reproductive strategy and the species and subspecies that represent the pollen taxa. The background pollen component was dominated by arboreal taxa, and contributed c. 60% of the total pollen loading. Graminoids dominated the local component. The PPEs presented here are to date the most appropriate parameters to use for quantification of vegetation at the tundra treeline; however, the data demonstrate that caution needs to be exercised with regards to selection of appropriate PPEs for accurate quantification of taxa at their ecological range.

AB  - The global redistribution of biodiversity will intensify in the coming decades of climate change, making projections of species range shifts and of associated genetic losses important components of conservation planning. Highly-structured marine species, notably brown seaweeds, often harbor unique genetic variation at warmer low-latitude rear edges and thus are of particular concern. Here, a combination of Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) and molecular data is used to forecast the potential near-future impacts of climate change for a warm-temperate, canopy forming seaweed, Bifurcaria bifurcata. ENMs for B. bifurcata were developed using marine and terrestrial climatic variables, and its range projected for 2040-50 and 2090-2100 under two greenhouse emission scenarios. Geographical patterns of genetic diversity were assessed by screening 18 populations spawning the entire distribution for two organelle genes and 6 microsatellite markers. The southern limit of B. bifurcata was predicted to shift northwards to central Morocco by the mid-century. By 2090-2100, depending on the emission scenario, it could either retreat further north to western Iberia or be relocated back to Western Sahara. At the opposing margin, B. bifurcata was predicted to expand its range to Scotland or even Norway. Microsatellite diversity and endemism were highest in Morocco, where a unique and very restricted lineage was also identified. Our results imply that B. bifurcata will maintain a relatively broad latitudinal distribution. Although its persistence is not threatened, the predicted extirpation of a unique southern lineage or even the entire Moroccan diversity hotspot will erase a rich evolutionary legacy and shrink global diversity to current (low) European levels. NW Africa and similarly understudied southern regions should receive added attention if expected range changes and diversity loss of warm-temperate species is not to occur unnoticed.

AB  - Most food in developed countries, including organic fruits and vegetables, is sold through supply chains run by large wholesalers and supermarket chains. A certain share is sold through local marketing channels such as speciality stores, food box schemes, farmers' markets, and community-supported agriculture (CSA). This study uses qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey to expose the differences between mainstream and local marketing of organic fruits and vegetables in Norway, why and to what extent farmers selling through these two sales channels are different. We find that the supermarket chains' requirements to provide large quantities of uniform product are burdensome for smaller farmers to match. Farmers supplying the mainstream supermarkets tend to be larger and more rurally located. Farmers selling through local marketing are likely to be smaller, closer to urban areas and more diversified in their production. For local marketing farmers, it is more feasible to produce according to organic principles, using local resources and crop rotation. Survey results also show that local marketing farmers are less motivated to produce fruits and vegetables by income and more motivated to produce organically to achieve better quality and sustainability. At the same time, there are also many similarities between the two groups, and we do not find evidence of a general "conventionalisation" of organic agriculture in Norway.

AB  - Granite rapakivi was widely used in the construction of historical buildings in St. Petersburg. This rock was mined in Karelia and southern part of Finland where old quarries are preserved. Biofouling of granite can be observed both in urban environments and in natural outcrops. Biofilms on granite rapakivi have a different structure, composition, speed of development. The aim of this work is the complex analysis of biological colonization of granite rapakivi in different environment. The biodiversity of biofilms was studied on granite monuments of Saint Petersburg as well as in the abandoned quarries of the southern part of Finland. The composition of micromycetes, cyanobacteria and organotrophic bacteria in biofilms was determined at different stages of colonization and destruction of the granite rapakivi. The composition of metabolites in biofilms and sediments on the surface of the rock was determined. More than 200 compounds were found in the samples from the quarry and about 60-100 low molecular weight organic compounds were detected in the samples from the urban environment. Concentration of certain compounds, especially polyols, was significantly higher in biofilms in the urban environment. The main features of biological colonization of granite rapakivi in the urban environment and natural outcrops were shown by scanning electron microscopy. The differences in the character of colonization of feldspar, quartz and mica were revealed. It was found that under the influence of bacteria Bacillus subtilis the intensity of elements leaching from granite minerals in the aquatic environment (model experiment) was significantly increased. Feldspars and mica were destroyed first of all.

AB  - Stump harvesting is defined as an intensification of forest management in comparison with stem-only harvesting and removal of tops and branches. It increases soil mixing and the proportion of bare soil. In contrast to earlier hypotheses, stump harvesting was found to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane in the short term. In the long term, heterotrophic soil CO2 evolution is reduced. Both model and empirical studies indicate that stump removal can reduce the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in the short term, but long-term experiments (32-39 years) could not verify any SOC decline. Life cycle assessment studies showed that stumps as fuel resulted in markedly lower emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere, viewed over a whole forest rotation compared to heating by natural gas and coal. Stump removal does not seem to affect timber production in the next forest rotation and often reduces the infection rate of root rot. It increases the natural regeneration of birch and pine, it can increase nitrate leaching at N-rich sites, and it can increase the number of water-filled cavities where methylmercury is formed. Stump extraction decreases the amount of dwarf shrubs in young clear-cuts, but after 1-2 decades, these species are generally recovered. Many species dependent on dead wood are adversely affected by intense stump harvest. Model studies suggest that the risk of species extinction is small when only 10% of the total clear-cut area in the forest landscape is stump harvested, but the risk of extinction rises at increasing extraction intensities.

AB  - Cities worldwide face the need to reduce the usage of private cars and the emissions. Desirability of public transportation and its services is thus of major importance. When developing novel services for public transportation, it is crucial to consider the user - the traveler - perspective. We present results of a qualitative study of user needs and expectations of future traveling services, with the focus on the bus and its potential associated services. We interviewed ten students living in Finland who had a broad range of experiences of public transportation in various parts of the world. Our findings reveal topics that can be used as a basis of digital services that support or enrich the traveling experience. The results provide insights for the design of services for future buses, including the user needs at the bus stop, the bus itself and external functionalities that could be linked to the bus ride.

AB  - Nowadays the cooperation between firms and academic sector is crucial for any industry to compete in turbulent environments of business world. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate gap analysis among academic, public and business sectors by SCA method in Ostrobothnia region of Finland. This research applies SCA method in Smart specialization project for the first time and helps firms to estimate their cooperation with other firms, public and academic sector. In fact, this research shows in wich part the connection is not strong. Companies can apply the results of this research to determine their weakness point to have better improvements plan in order to compete in today's business world. The paper is based on 15 case studies from Ostrobothnia region. The cases were selected from manufacturing industry including cases focusing on manufacturing product dividing on energy, boat and fur industries in three main sectors (academic, public and business sector) in Ostrobothnia region of Finland. The results of paper show that there is cooperation between company and other companies (business - business sector) highly in deferent level consist of regional, national and international level but the cooperation between academic sector and public sector with business sector is in question and needs to be centered of attention in improvements plan. Another main finding is related to SCA risk level which improved mainly from past condition to future situation meaning that company internal resource allocation supports more cooperation for future among these three sectors.

AB  - In 2015 the National Library of Sweden finished digitising all Governmental Official Reports (SOU) from 1922 to 1999. Traditionally, SOU reports - and work performed within different governmental committees - were tasked with preparing the Swedish government for apt and rational decision-making. The range of subjects covered by governmental committees and SOU reports basically includes every area of the Swedish welfare state, from issues focused on migration and the environment to cultural and media policy.
   The article departs from an analysis of all SOU reports during 1945-89 as one massive dataset; in all 3,154 SOU reports that contain 87 million tokens. Research has been performed within a Jupyter Lab environment, a web application with executable Python code that can be run to perform data analysis. The Jupyter Lab environment has been developed at the digital humanities hub Humlab at Umea University, and research is related to the project Welfare State Analytics: Text Mining and Modelling Swedish Politics, Media & Culture, 1945-89. This is a digital humanities and digital history project that will digitise literature, curate already digitised collections, and perform research via probabilistic methods and text mining models.
   If all SOU reports were to be considered one single text written by the state, which themes in this vast text is software able to read and perceive? It is possible to answer such a broad question by way of topic modelling, a computational method to study themes in texts by accentuating words that tend to co-occur and together create different topics. Via co-occurrence, topic modelling creates topics in the form of clusters of similar words (topics); a term or a word may be a part of several topics with different degrees of probability. Topics also occur in relation to each other, and clusters and networks can be visualised by using software such as Gephi.
   The article focuses on topics related to media and media policy. Depending on how many topics a topic model displays - in the article models of 50, 100, 200, and 500 topics are used - different media topics can be detected. In the so model, one media topic was found, whereas in the 500 model, there were several, with more specific traits such as film censorship or daily press subsidies. One finding is that film was the single medium to which the SOU genre between 1945-89 devoted the most attention. Another finding is that archival issues were closely linked to media topics during the same period. Governmental committees and SOU reports on media were primarily focused on future-oriented policies, above all how media should be supported or regulated. Yet, archiving the same media forms was also something that the state was repeatedly interested in.
   In conclusion, the article explains what topic modelling is in general, how the method can be used in digital historical research - not least in relation to close reading and how statistical analysis of the distribution of words in the form of topics can generate interesting results. The SOU data is rich; topics can be traced with many different themes. As a researcher, however, one must learn to work with data: to load different models into the Jupyter Lab environment, to compute various input values, change parameters, and often curate outcomes in a way that differs from traditional historical research practices.

AB  - Modern pollen assemblages from grazed vegetation in the Pyrenees Mountains (France) were studied with the aim of providing a calibrated model for reconstructing past pastoral activities. The modern analogues were selected to cover the major gradients of grazing pressure and degree of openness. The vegetation was surveyed by means of the synusial integrated method. assessing the structure and the patchiness of the pastoral phytoceonoses. A correlative model (Redundancy analysis) was devised relating 61 modern pollen spectra with 37 explanatory vegetation and land-use variables. It was shown that wooded, open grazed and nitrophilous sites are clearly separated from one another and that the model can be simplified using three relevant vegetation types as explanatory variables: dry heathland, semi-open oak forest and overgrazed community, respectively related to gradients of openness, soil richness and grazing pressure. When reconstructing past pastoral activities with fossil pollen spectra, it is important to consider scale-dependent influences of plant species. Low frequencies of well-dispersed taxa such as Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Plantago lanceolata and Plantago major/media must be interpreted with care since they reflect more regional, rather than local, input into the pastoral landscape. In contrast. the simultaneous occurrence of Asteroideae, Cichorioideae; Cirsium-type. Galium-type. Ranunculaceae. Stellaria-type and Potentilla-type pollen is clearly related to grazing on a local scale. Calculation of Davis indices also shows that Cichorioideae, Galium-type and Potentilla-type indicate the very local presence of the corresponding plants. These pastoral plant indicators may have a limited geographical validity, ie. mountainous regions with crystalline bedrock, which may indeed also provide the framework for the application to fossil spectra of the modern pollen/vegetation/land-use models presented here.

AB  - In the public and scientific discussion on the political scope of action for improving employment opportunities for mothers, cultural aspects of female labour market participation often remain ignored. This study argues that employment decisions of mothers vary not only with the institutional settings but also with the dominant representative culture of a region. In order to study the effects of culture and institutions on maternal employment, Belgium, East, and West Germany are selected for empirical analysis. In a first step the article demonstrates that these regions differ considerably in terms of family political measures but also in terms of the cultural orientations with regard to female employment. While both Belgium and East Germany (but not West Germany) have well-developed public childcare systems for the under-3s, East Germans have a more favourable opinion towards female employment than Belgians. In a second step the study shows by means of panel analyses that these cultural differences strongly determine female employment behavior. Results indicate that both East and West German mothers have significantly higher employment probabilities in the long-run than Belgian mothers. The well-developed childcare infrastructure and the short parental leave lead only temporarily - right after childbirth - to higher employment rates among Belgian mothers. With increasing age of the child the significance of cultural dispositions result in higher overall employment probabilities among German mothers. These empirical findings support the theoretical approach of Pfau-Effinger in treating both institutional structures and culture as (equally) crucial factors in explaining cross-national differences in mothers' employment.

AB  - The reach of different tree species' crowns and the velocity of gap closure during the occupation of canopy gaps resulting from mortality and thinning during stand development determine species-specific competition and productivity within forest stands. However, classical dendrometric methods are rather inaccurate or even incapable of time-and cost-effectively measuring 3D tree structure, crown dynamics and space occupation non-destructively. Therefore, we applied terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in order to measure the structural dynamics at tree and stand level from gap cutting in 2006 until 2012 in pure and mixed stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). In conclusion, our results suggest that Norway spruce invests newly available above-ground resources primarily into DBH as well as biomass growth and indicate a stronger resilience against loss of crown mass induced by mechanical damage. European beech showed a vastly different reaction, investing gains from additional above-ground resources primarily into faster occupation of canopy space. Whether our sample trees were located in pure or mixed groups around the gaps had no significant impact on their behavior during the years after gap cutting.

AB  - The achievement of sustainable forest management requires the incorporation of ongoing environmental changes into long-term planning. Moreover, in time of climatic change and changing company demands, importance of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is still increasing at the expense of other tree species due to its low ecological requirements. The aim of the study was to compare the structure and production of Scots pine stands managed under different silvicultural systems on four research plots, assess the structural and diversity indices, and analyse the increment structure using tree-ring dating in the Czech Republic and Spain. Area of study was Western Bohemian and Guadarrama Mountain range in Central Spain. The results indicate that stand volume on the investigated plots ranged from 231 to 441 m(3).ha(-1) with tree density 276-996 trees.ha(-1). Intensively managed (uneven-aged) permanent research plots showed increased growth on basal area. The difference was evident also for older trees. The transition to uneven-aged forest does not negatively influence stocking and wood production and provide higher benefits for diversity and structural complexity in comparison to regular stands.

AB  - Purpose - Food is an important element of a holiday. An in depth understanding of factors that influence tourists' perception of food is central in increased tourist satisfaction and repurchase intentions. However, tourists may differ in innovativeness and thus in their willingness to buy unfamiliar food and food souvenirs. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the special context in which tourists choose food during holidays and the associated food-cultural distance involved in this context.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study was based on data collected by using a questionnaire completed by 277 tourists on board a small Norwegian cruise ship sailing along the coast of Norway. The main focus in the questionnaire was on factors that influence tourists when considering buying food in general and food souvenirs in particular.
   Findings - The main finding was that food souvenirs should be adapted to the needs of tourists with high and low innovativeness to fulfil the needs of the whole target tourist population. Even though highly innovative tourists were more willing to buy food souvenirs that are characteristic of the country visited, tourists with low innovativeness may have been more comfortable with the purchase of food that is less innovative, within a different food-culture. The main factors influencing tourists in choosing and buying food and food souvenirs on holiday are quality, taste, local origin and the perceived authenticity of the food.
   Originality/value - This paper provides data that reveal similarities and most interestingly differences in food choice behaviour of consumers in the context of being tourists. It describes the relationship of choice with innovativeness, which may vary while being at home vs being a tourist and exposed to a distant food culture. It brings together perspectives on local food, authenticity, familiarity, innovativeness, budget management/price and their interaction during a real life situation that is rarely studied in the consumer research literature. This study adds a refreshing sample to the existing literature about food choice; tourists.

AB  - This paper employs newly collected historical data from Finland to present evidence of historically contingent, long-run consequences of a famine. We document high levels of local inequality in terms of income and land distribution until a violent uprising in 1918. These inequalities partly originated from the famine of 1866-1868, which increased the concentration of land and power to large landowners. We further show that regions with more exposure to the famine had more labor coercion by the early 1900s. These inner tensions led to violent conflict following the Russian Revolution and the Finnish independence from the Russian Empire. Using microdata on all the casualties of the 1918 Finnish Civil War, we demonstrate that the famine plausibly contributed to local insurgency participation through these factors. Although unsuccessful in replacing the government, the insurgency led to significant policy changes, including radical land redistribution and a full extension of the franchise. These national reforms led to a more drastic shift toward equality in locations more affected by the famine with greater pre-conflict inequality. Our findings highlight how historical shocks can have large and long-lasting, but not straightforward impacts.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a key element of global conservation strategies aiming to protect habitats and species from various threats such as non-natives species (NNS) with negative ecological impacts. Yet little is known about the mechanisms by which PAs are colonized by NNS, and more specifically the role of colonizing events from surrounding areas. Here, we compared terrestrial and freshwater non-native plants and animals recorded in Norwegian PAs and in 5-km belts around them, using the database of the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre Species Map Service. Our analysis included 1,602 NNS and 671 PAs. We found that NNS were recorded in only 23% of the PAs, despite the fact that 90% of the 5-km belts were colonized by at least one NNS. A Zero-inflated negative binomial regression model showed that the number of NNS in the 5-km belts was a strong explanatory variable of the NNS richness inside PAs. Other significant variables included the surface area of the PA, mean human population density in the PA, main type of habitat and accessibility of PAs. We also observed similarity in the species in and around the PAs, with, on average, two thirds of the NNS present in a specific PA also present in its 5-km belt. Furthermore, NNS were recorded in PAs on average 4.5 years after being recorded in the 0-5 km belts, suggesting a dynamic of rapid colonization from the belts to the PAs. Invasive NNS represented 12% of NNS in the belts but 40% in the PAs. This difference was related to the higher abundance of invasive NNS in the belts. Our results highlight the necessity of expanding the focus of NNS management in PAs beyond their boundaries, in particular to prevent incursions of NNS with high negative ecological impact.

AB  - To address the sustainability challenges related to travel behavior, technological innovations will not be enough. Behavioral changes are also called for. The aim of the present study is to examine the influence of sociodemography, geography, and personality on car driving and use of public transportation. Sociodemographic factors have been defined by age, gender, income, and education. Geographic factors have been studied through residential area (e.g., rural and urban areas). Personality has been studied through the Five-Factor-Model of personality-degree of Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. The analysis is based on a survey with 1812 respondents, representative for the Swedish population. Regarding sociodemographic factors, car driving is explained by being male, higher age, higher income, while use of public transportation is explained by lower age and higher education. The user profile of a car driver is the opposite to that of a public transport passenger when it comes to geographic factors; urban residential area explains public transportation while rural area explains car driving. Some personality factors are also opposites; a low degree of Openness and a high degree of Extraversion explain car driving, while a high degree of Openness and a low degree of Extraversion explain use of public transportation. Moreover, car driving is explained by a low degree of Neuroticism, while use of public transportation is explained by a low degree of Conscientiousness and a high degree of Agreeableness. Since sociodemography, geography, and personality influence how people process information and evaluate market propositions (e.g., products and services), the findings presented here are useful for policymakers and transportations planners who would like to change behavior from car driving to public transportation use. Caution should be taken in interpreting the relationship between personality traits and transportation modes, since the personality traits are measured by a short scale (i.e., Big Five Inventory (BFI)-10), with limitations in the factor structure for a representative sample of the Swedish population.

AB  - The article reviews the documents of the Novorossiya Committee stored in the Russian State Historical Archive (fond 1307). The Novorossiya Committee was established by Emperor Alexander I in 1801 to discuss and develop plans for optimal development of Novorossiya (New Russia). The Committee included top officials of the time: V. P. Kochubei, N. P. Rumyantsev, G. R. Derzhavin, N. S. Mordvinov, P. A. Zubov, K. L. Hablitz, and others. The most important problems discussed at the meetings of the Novorossiya Committee included plans for administrative and territorial transformations in the region; ideas for improvement and development of Odessa (later implemented by I. O. Richelieu); settlement of land conflicts in the Crimea; general analysis of trade and economic projects for the development of the Crimea and other Circum-Pontic territories. The Novorossiya Committee and archivl files from the said RGIA fond are cited in the historiography in a piecemeal manner. Having reviewed the activities of the Novorossiya Committee, the author underscores its significant influence on the transformations of the region in the reign of Alexander I. Many discussed initiatives and issues were implemented. A more detailed study of the Novorossiya Committee activities and its comparison with hereafter established committees for the administration of Finland, the Crimea, and the Caucasus, Siberian and Central Asian gubernias may provide a new look at principles of and approaches to the management of macro-regions and national outskirts of the Russian Empire in the reign of Alexander I.

AB  - The development of mobile systems for the decentralized pelletizing of forest-based residual biomass is currently underway. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the environmental impacts of such systems that needs to be developed for correct judgements on the most sustainable developing paths. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of a decentralized mobile production system for pelletizing logging residues in Northern Sweden operating at either the forest landing or forest terminal from a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective.
   The results showed that the landing- and terminal-based scenarios showed similar environmental profiles. The pelleting, transportation and drying stages of both scenarios were identified as environmental hotspots. These production stages accounted for 62%, 14% and 14% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Key factors influencing the system were the use of electricity at terminals, the increase in pelletizer capacity, and long transportation distances. The use of a Swedish electricity mix instead of diesel based electricity in the terminal-based scenario reduced all of the environmental impacts by between 68% and 83%, with the exception of fresh water eutrophication potential, which increased by 26%.
   In conclusion, our findings indicate that an electrified mobile pellet production system with high operational efficiency and situated at a terminal close to the harvesting sites could, from an LCA point of view, be an interesting option for pelletizing Nordic logging residues, especially in regions with long transportation distances to industry.

AB  - Air pollution due to shipping is a serious concern for coastal regions in Europe. Shipping emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in air over the Baltic Sea are of similar magnitude (330 kt yr(-1)) as the combined land-based NOx emissions from Finland and Sweden in all emission sectors. Deposition of nitrogen compounds originating from shipping activities contribute to eutrophication of the Baltic Sea and coastal areas in the Baltic Sea region. For the North Sea and the Baltic Sea a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) will become effective in 2021; in accordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) target of reducing NOx emissions from ships. Future scenarios for 2040 were designed to study the effect of enforced and planned regulation of ship emissions and the fuel efficiency development on air quality and nitrogen deposition. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to simulate the current and future air quality situation. The meteorological fields, the emissions from ship traffic and the emissions from land-based sources were considered at a grid resolution of 4 x 4 km(2) for the Baltic Sea region in nested CMAQ simulations. Model simulations for the present-day (2012) air quality show that shipping emissions are the major contributor to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over the Baltic Sea. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, with the introduction of the NECA, NOx emissions from ship traffic in the Baltic Sea are reduced by about 80 % in 2040. An approximate linear relationship was found between ship emissions of NOx and the simulated levels of annual average NO2 over the Baltic Sea in the year 2040, when following different future shipping scenarios. The burden of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) over the Baltic Sea region is predicted to decrease by 35 %-37 % between 2012 and 2040. The reduction in PM2.5 is larger over sea, where it drops by 50 %-60 % along the main shipping routes, and is smaller over the coastal areas. The introduction of NECA is critical for reducing ship emissions of NOx to levels that are low enough to sustainably dampen ozone (O-3) production in the Baltic Sea region. A second important effect of the NECA over the Baltic Sea region is the reduction in secondary formation of particulate nitrate. This lowers the ship-related PM2.5 by 72% in 2040 compared to the present day, while it is reduced by only 48% without implementation of the NECA. The effect of a lower fuel efficiency development on the absolute ship contribution of air pollutants is limited. Still, the annual mean ship contributions in 2040 to NO2, sulfur dioxide and PM2.5 and daily maximum O-3 are significantly higher if a slower fuel efficiency development is assumed. Nitrogen deposition to the seawater of the Baltic Sea decreases on average by 40 %-44 % between 2012 and 2040 in the simulations. The effect of the NECA on nitrogen deposition is most significant in the western part of the Baltic Sea. It will be important to closely monitor compliance of individual ships with the enforced and planned emission regulations.

AB  - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are considered to hold promise for addressing the pressing and multi-faceted challenges of climate resilience. Addressing this contemporary agenda, this research paper explores the potential value of NbS in urban contexts based on the experience of implementing four NbS pilots to address climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction in an informal settlement in Honiara, Solomon Islands. The project, funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), employed an inclusive co-production approach, with the project team engaging closely with community members and local stakeholders throughout the planning, design and implementation stages. Findings reinforce the importance of long-term engagement and trust-building with members of the community and also underscore the value of empowering local partners in project design and implementation in Pacific Island Nations. The paper details the local processes that were involved and highlights the key insights and lessons learned from the proof-of-concept project which can usefully inform the scaling up of NbS initiatives to achieve multiple benefits in other similar urban contexts in the Global South.

AB  - Most phosphorus (P) modeling studies of water quality have focused on surface runoff loses. However, a growing number of experimental studies have shown that P losses can occur in drainage water from artificially drained fields. In this review, we assess the applicability of nine models to predict this type of P loss. A model of P movement in artificially drained systems will likely need to account for the partitioning of water and P into runoff, macropore flow, and matrix flow. Within the soil profile, sorption and desorption of dissolved P and filtering of particulate P will be important. Eight models are reviewed (ADAPT, APEX, DRAINMOD, HSPF, HYDRUS, ICECREAMDB, PLEASE, and SWAT) along with P Indexes. Few of the models are designed to address P loss in drainage waters. Although the SWAT model has been used extensively for modeling P loss in runoff and includes tile drain flow, P losses are not simulated in tile drain flow. ADAPT, HSPF, and most P Indexes do not simulate flow to tiles or drains. DRAINMOD simulates drains but does not simulate P. The ICECREAMDB model from Sweden is an exception in that it is designed specifically for P losses in drainage water. This model seems to be a promising, parsimonious approach in simulating critical processes, but it needs to be tested. Field experiments using a nested, paired research design are needed to improve P models for artificially drained fields. Regardless of the model used, it is imperative that uncertainty in model predictions be assessed.

CP  - 10th World Congress on Engineering Asset Management (WCEAM)
AB  - Decisions on strategic asset management are crucial from the perspective of improving the sustainability of companies. The new ISO 55000 series of AM standards is a means of improving the AM strategies and practices of companies, and thus their sustainability performance. For this study, three Finnish companies were interviewed about their asset management, especially related to their asset information management practices and sustainability. The results are compared with the asset information management guidelines given in the AM standard. The goal of the research is to find best practices and areas of improvement in asset information management, and thus to improve asset management related decision-making and the sustainability of companies. All the interviewed companies gather and analyse data from their machinery and infrastructure and the analysis and utilization of asset related information is considered important. The economic perspective of AM is seen crucial in decision-making, but also sustainability reporting, maintenance and operating information, value of assets and fault data are utilized. The asset information is scattered in different systems and behind different organisational barriers. Companies, however, strive towards unified asset information management systems.

AB  - Maintaining legitimacy is a crucial objective for public officials to ensure effectiveness. Without legitimacy, political costs rise as the trust in government decreases and policy implementation is delayed; thus, officials handling resource development are encouraged to improve the acceptability of their processes. Therefore, it is essential for the government to understand the values and expectations of the citizens affected by resource development. Such an understanding assists the government in accomplishing its goals. This paper examines two cases, Norrbotten, Sweden, and Saskatchewan, Canada, both of which have established mining operations and similar regulatory frameworks and, during the commodities boom, experienced increased foreign investment and applications for new mines. While most mining projects in Saskatchewan faced little public opposition, some Norrbotten mines met contestation and protest. This paper utilizes survey data that focus on the perspectives of the residents close to the proposed mining operations, as well as interview data from public officials responsible for mine permitting, to examine the relationship between stakeholder influence and trust in government on the acceptability of mining.

AB  - In a small importing country in an open economy, the competitiveness of domestic production relies heavily on consumer preferences, as is the case with Swedish apple growers. Domestic production is facing increasing competition. Organic apples are imported from Italy, Argentina, New Zealand, France and The Netherlands. While the total market for organic fruit is expanding, less than 8% of the Swedish apple area, and much less of total harvest, is organic. The reasons for this are examined in the paper, the hypothesis being that conversion into organic production might be a way of diversification on a competitive market. The paper describes the structural development and the strategic moves of the apple sector and discusses its potential competitiveness in the global marketplace. The study consists of a review of market research during the past ten years and of expert interviews with actors in the marketing chain. Specific data are collected by interviews with 36 individual growers: 29 growers representing 50% of all organic production, two potential organic growers and a sample of five leading Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) growers.
   Two-thirds of the organic growers state ideological reasons as the most important reason for choice of production method, while only one out of 29 states financial reasons. Our results show that, rather than using strategies that correspond with the dominant marketing system, the organic growers use alternative, direct sales channels. In marketing, they promote the philosophy of their small company as an added value, but very little added value originates from product development or processing. Sales to supermarkets to reach a larger number of consumers are the key to market expansion, and IFP is thus taking the role of sustainable and environmentally friendly domestic production. Meanwhile, imports of organic apples are increasing. The conclusions from the paper have implications for exporters to Sweden.

AB  - Questions Agricultural intensification has led to the decline of biodiverse meadows and other semi-natural grasslands. Road verges offer potential alternative habitats for meadow species, but they may not be suitable for all meadow species due to different soil properties, frequent disturbances, pollution or suboptimal management. Are their communities of vascular plants and bryophytes similar or dissimilar to those in mown or grazed meadows? What kind of species are associated with road verges, mown meadows or grazed meadows? How do the habitat types differ in their soil conditions and disturbance intensity? Location The study was conducted at 36 sites in central Finland. Methods We compared the vascular plant and bryophyte flora and the habitat characteristics of road verges, mown meadows and grazed meadows. Results The community composition of both vascular plants and bryophytes differed among the habitat types. Many species occurred in all three habitat types, but several meadow specialists were absent or less frequent in the road verges. In contrast, road verges hosted more forest species and ruderal species, especially bryophytes. Road verges differed from meadows in their soil conditions. Conclusions We conclude that although road verges may host some species typical to meadows, their value as alternative habitats could be increased by improved soil preparation and vegetation management. Meanwhile, the continued decline of quality habitats for meadow species underscores the need to maintain, increase and improve meadow management.

AB  - Marine macroalgae are used worldwide for human consumption, animal feed, cosmetics and agriculture. In addition to beneficial nutrients, macroalgae contain halogenated natural products (HNPs), some of which have toxic properties similar to those of well-known anthropogenic contaminants. Sixteen species of red, green and brown macroalgae were collected in 2017-2018 from coastal waters of the northern Baltic Sea, Sweden Atlantic and Norway Atlantic, and analyzed for bromoanisoles (BAs) and methoxylated bromodiphenyl ethers (MeO-BDEs). Target compounds were quantified by gas chromatography-low resolution mass spectrometry (GC-LRMS), with qualitative confirmation in selected species by GC-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). Quantified compounds were 2,4-diBA, 2,4,6-triBA, 2'-MeO-BDE68, 6-MeO-BDE47, and two tribromo-MeO-BDEs and one tetrabromo-MeO-BDE with unknown bromine substituent positions. Semiquantitative results for pentabromo-MeO-BDEs were also obtained for a few species by GC-HRMS. Three extraction methods were compared; soaking in methanol, soaking in methanol-dichloromethane, and blending with mixed solvents. Extraction yields of BAs did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) with the three methods and the two soaking methods gave equivalent yields of MeO-BDEs. Extraction efficiencies of MeO-BDEs were significantly lower using the blend method (p < 0.05). For reasons of simplicity and efficiency, the soaking methods are preferred. Concentrations varied by orders of magnitude among species: Sigma 2BAs 57 to 57 700 and Sigma 5MeO-BDEs < 10 to 476 pg g(-1) wet weight (ww). Macroalgae standing out with Sigma 2BAs > 1000 pg g(-1) ww were Ascophyllum nodosum, Ceramium tenuicorne, Ceramium virgatum, Fucus radicans, Fucus serratus, Fucus vesiculosus, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata, and Acrosiphonia/Spongomorpha sp. Species A. nodosum, C. tenuicorne, Chara virgata, F. radicans and F. vesiculosus (Sweden Atlantic only) had Sigma 5MeO-BDEs > 100 pg g(-1) ww. Profiles of individual compounds showed distinct differences among species and locations.

AB  - European wild apple (Malus sylvestris L.) is the only Malus wild species native to Europe which is a relative of cultivated apples (Malus x domestica Borkh.). It grows on forests' edges, farmland hedges, and marginal sites; by living in those scattered meta-populations, it is exposed to genetic erosion in relation to hybridization and habitat degradation. In Finland, it grows at the northern edge of its distribution in Europe and is considered as a near-threatened taxon requiring urgent conservation. In order to evaluate the molecular genetic diversity of M. sylvestris, five populations including 43 trees were analyzed using 15 microsatellite markers. Additionally, a similar number of samples from cultivated apples, which are common to the same region, was included in order to estimate gene diversity gaps and give an insight into putative hybridization. European wild apple in Finland proved to be populationally structured, and seems not to be threatened by introgression events from its cultivated relative. They were all separated into different clusters, except for one individual. However, urgent conservation is indeed needed, especially due to the very low total number of trees (four) in some of the analyzed populations. These populations should be restored in order to enable permanent access to the wild relatives' diversity, as they might be a critical source of gene variants for future needs.

AB  - Research on the actions of anti-extraction movements has primarily comprised single-case studies in developing countries. Despite increasing mobilization and policy objectives to increase mineral extraction in the EU, we have little systematic knowledge of forms of resistance in a European setting. This paper exhaustively and comparatively maps anti-extraction movements in Sweden and investigates how movements' actions relate to their socio-political contexts. Sixteen place-specific movements are identified and studied using frame analysis and political process theory. The results suggest that anti-extraction movements occur across Sweden and that their socio-political contexts differ in access to indigenous rights institutions, project owner engagement, and support/opposition from host municipalities and national interest groups. The frame analysis indicates that movements share several goals, sometimes interpret similar contexts differently, and that differences in actions reflect differences in interpretations of contextual opportunities. Our results show that anti-extraction movements in Sweden involve diverse actors, including environmental interest groups, new networks mobilizing against extraction projects, indigenous Sami organizations, farmers' organizations, and landowners. Broad repertoires of actions, including civil disobedience, are used to influence the public, permitting processes, political actors at various scales, and project owners. Differences in socio-political contexts often align with movements' interpretations of opportunities and relate with differences in action choices.

AB  - Long-term grassland fallow and short-term meadow fallow represent alternative fallowing strategies for biodiversity conservation on farmland. Conventional grassland mixtures are used to establish long-term grassland fallows, whereas short-term meadow fallows are sown with specific meadow seed mixtures and require regular re-establishment to maintain the abundance of sown species. This study examined the impact of fallow type and landscape structure on the species richness and abundance of four taxa: plants, bumblebees, butterflies and birds. Long-term grassland fallows and short-term meadow fallows were studied in four contrasting landscape types in Finland, differing in the cover of forest and perennial grasslands. The fallow type and landscape structure affected each species group differently, and the value of a particular fallow type was also modified by landscape setting. Bumblebees were most abundant in short-term meadow fallows, whereas butterflies benefited more from long-term grassland fallows. Species richness of plants and butterflies were higher in forested than in open landscapes. Long-term grassland fallows promoted species richness of butterflies as well as the abundance of foraging edge birds in forested landscapes, whereas short-term meadow fallows enhanced the abundance of foraging edge birds in open landscapes. In landscapes with high grassland cover, the breeding density of open farmland birds was higher in meadow fallows than in grassland fallows, while the reverse was true in landscapes with low perennial grassland cover. The fallowing strategy thus can be adapted to the landscape context depending on the specific objectives. For overall biodiversity enhancement, establishing and managing different kinds of fallows is important. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aims to compare the strategies that Finland and Spain have taken in order to get the Gold license from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Core and Shell (LEED-C-and-S) rating system. LEED-C-and-S version 3 (v3) and version 4 (v4) were considered. The absolute effect size is used to evaluate the performance of the LEED-C-and-S points. To assess the difference between Finland and Spain, we use the natural logarithm of the odds ratio and Fisher's exact 2 x 2 test with Lancaster's mid-p-value when analyzing the dichotomous data, and Cliff's S and the exact Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests when analyzing ordinal data. As a result, in order to achieve the Gold level in LEED-C-and-S office-type projects, Finland and Spain demonstrated similarities and differences in credit values in v3 and v4. In v4 (latest version), the similarly high credits were location and transportation (LT) and water efficiency (WE) and similarly low credits were material and resource (MR) and environmental quality (EQ); different credit values were in the energy and atmosphere (EA) category, in which Finland outperformed Spain, and the sustainable sites (SS) strategy category, in which Spain outperformed Finland. Thus, Finland used the LT-WE-EA strategy, whereas Spain used the LT-WE-SS strategy. Knowing these strategies can be helpful in better understanding green building development in these countries.

It influences and is influenced by public and policy agendas on a regime level. On a niche level, it can spread or screen out information and motivate or discourage actors to adopt new technologies and practices. However, relatively few studies have specifically addressed the role of media in energy transitions. Newspaper coverage of biogas is studied here as a case of media framing of a potential renewable energy solution.
   Methods: This article examines the long-term development of newspaper coverage of biogas in Finland. The aim of the quantitative content analysis is to draw an overall picture of the main phases of biogas coverage of a widely read newspaper focusing on agriculture and forestry, actors using discursive power in this coverage and key framings of the discussion. The results are discussed from the perspective of energy transition studies. In particular, future expectations created by the media are explored.
   Results: The results show a lack of newspaper coverage on biogas in the early 2000s, followed by a rapid increase and stabilisation of the volume of newspaper coverage. Biogas was most often mentioned as a secondary topic of broader discussions related to renewable energy. The core discussion focusing on biogas was characterised by very positive framings of biogas as a preferable energy solution fully compatible with the principle of circular economy. The news stories often had a strong future orientation, and examples of enthusiastic forerunners were frequently presented. However, the coverage also emphasised the poor economic profitability of biogas technologies and a need for considerable public subsidies that are inherently unpredictable.
   Conclusions: The future of niche-level energy technologies such as biogas can be strongly shaped by information flows, public perceptions and expectations created in part by media coverage. The analysed newspaper coverage in Finland was ambivalent from the perspective of energy transition. On the one hand, biogas production was represented as a preferable, environmentally friendly niche-level energy technology that should be encouraged. On the other hand, by emphasising the economic unviability of biogas technologies, the analysed newspaper coverage did not promote the adoption of biogas.

AB  - Cluster theory and cluster policy have lacked a focus on how to achieve 'directionality' in cluster evolution, and the literature lacks discussions regarding how to achieve green reorientation of clusters and how policy can support this. In contributing towards this gap, we argue for a more thorough integration of Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG) and Transition Studies (TS), two frameworks that separately have been applied extensively in studies of technological and industrial change. We draw on a discussion of Technology-Organization-Discourse (TOD) dynamics in exemplifying how EEG and TS can inform cluster theory and policy. Empirically, we investigate how cluster strategies are linked to differentiated TOD dynamics by examining Norwegian cluster policy and the strategic responses of facilitators of a petroleum, a marine, and a maritime cluster in Western Norway. We identify two 'routes' to reorientation of clusters - a 'neutral' and a 'normative' route - and argue that the investigated cluster projects have, as a matter of differentiated TOD dynamics, taken different stances towards green reorientation. Furthermore, we argue that cluster theory and policy should take into consideration that several policy domains influence these dynamics, not just cluster policy.

AB  - We studied seasonal variation in the use of winter roosts by five bat species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis brandtii/mystacinus, Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus) in south-east Finland during the winters of 2003/2004 and 2004/2005. At the beginning of the bat hibernation season all species used higher temperatures and humidity than by the season's end. Hibernacula were at their coldest in mid-hibernation season and became warmer towards the end of the season. However, no species hibernated in warmer locations at the end of the season than in mid-season. Results suggest that bats tend to use different strategies throughout the hibernation season, minimizing the cost of hibernation early in the season by hibernating in warmer locations and minimizing energy expenditure later in the season by hibernating in colder locations. M. brandtii/mystacinus were found in locations with stable temperature and humidity, moving to increasingly stable conditions (chambers, crevices, clusters, ceiling) towards spring. All other species hibernated in more variable microclimates throughout the hibernation season.

AB  - Conifers are key species of many boreal and temperate forests, providing crucial resources to human activities. Adaptation to local climate and long life span make tree species highly susceptible to both short- and long-term environmental changes. Thus, a substantial effect of ongoing climate change on forest viability and production potential is expected. A deeper understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control the adaptive ability of forests can be used for management strategies to assist forests through climate change. Indeed, a reliable and systematic genetic assessment of Norway spruce provenances for their response to extreme climatic conditions could be a prerequisite for a successful assisted migration of this species in a changing environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate, by mean of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), the genetic bases of local adaptation along altitudinal gradients in 18 natural Alpine populations of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst), sampled on a regional scale in Trentino-South Tyrol (Eastern Italian Alps). To account for patterns of gene flow and spatial genetic structure due to alpine landscape features, sampled stands were subdivided into three geographical groups, each including at least one sampled altitudinal gradient. As expected, hierarchical analyses of molecular variance revealed that most of the genetic variability was found within stands, though a little but significant variation was found among geographical groups. To detect potentially adaptive markers, two distinct approaches were used. First, classical outlier loci detection was applied along the altitudinal gradients using both a Bayesian analysis and a Hierarchical Island Model (HIM), which showed contrasting results. Subsequently, Moran's Eigenvector Maps (MEM) variables, which may account for spatial variation and un-accounted environmental factors, were applied to an allele distribution model, and 19 loci significantly associated to environmental variation were identified. Four of these loci were also detected as outliers by the HIM. The combined approach of selection scan and spatial analysis method allowed for a parallel investigation of Norway spruce adaptive potential in alpine stands, providing evidence for selective forces acting on adaptive loci that could be relevant in forest management.

AB  - This article investigates the political efforts to establish ethanol as a national fuel in Sweden in 1924 - 1934. Drawing on official records - the transcripts of parliamentary debates, governmental commission reports, and government bills and legislation - ethanol is considered as a technological and political artefact, with a particular focus on a strongly ideological fuel policy intended to bring about technological change.
   At the time, considerable political effort went into finding and establishing a national fuel, efficient and abundant enough to support the nation's requirements for essential products. This was by no means a uniquely Swedish undertaking. Nation-states all over the industrialized world sought domestic fuel alternatives, prompted by the expected depletion of oil reserves and the fear of renewed international conflict. In that period, Swedish ethanol was distilled from fermented sulphite lye, a waste product from paper and pulp production. It was therefore presented as a lucrative solution for a waste problem, and, as it was produced within the nation-state's borders, a promising wartime surrogate. However, ethanol was more expensive than petrol, which made it less marketable during peacetime. To cover losses, the ethanol industry requested state support in the form of tax exemptions and legislation to force petrol importers to blend ethanol into all marketed petrol.
   Those who argued in favour of the ethanol industry's requests were mainly right-wing politicians, who based their arguments on a nationalist ideology that national collective benefit justified state intervention in the free market. Opposition was mainly mounted by a faction in the Social Democrat party. For them, any measure that made products more expensive for consumers was unthinkable. They also argued that the ethanol industry had reached the end of the line; any production without the means and capacity to support itself should make way for its competitors. Concerns about the anticipated international conflict, however, led the Social Democrat minister for finance, Ernst Wigforss, to concede to the demands of the ethanol industry. In 1934, he thus proposed legislation that largely corresponded to claims made by right-wing politicians and the influential forestry industry, of which ethanol production was a part.

AB  - The majority of microclimate studies have been done in topographically complex landscapes to quantify and predict how near-ground temperatures vary as a function of terrain properties. However, in forests understory temperatures can be strongly influenced also by vegetation. We quantified the relative influence of vegetation features and physiography (topography and moisture-related variables) on understory temperatures in managed boreal forests in central Sweden. We used a multivariate regression approach to relate near-ground temperature of 203 loggers over the snow-free seasons in an area of similar to 16,000 km(2) to remotely sensed and on-site measured variables of forest structure and physiography. We produced climate grids of monthly minimum and maximum temperatures at 25 m resolution by using only remotely sensed and mapped predictors. The quality and predictions of the models containing only remotely sensed predictors (MAP models) were compared with the models containing also on-site measured predictors (OS models). Our data suggest that during the warm season, where landscape microclimate variability is largest, canopy cover and basal area were the most important microclimatic drivers for both minimum and maximum temperatures, while physiographic drivers (mainly elevation) dominated maximum temperatures during autumn and early winter. The MAP models were able to reproduce findings from the OS models but tended to underestimate high and overestimate low temperatures. Including important microclimatic drivers, particularly soil moisture, that are yet lacking in a mapped form should improve the microclimate maps. Because of the dynamic nature of managed forests, continuous updates of mapped forest structure parameters are needed to accurately predict temperatures. Our results suggest that forest management (e.g. stand size, structure and composition) and conservation may play a key role in amplifying or impeding the effects of climate-forcing factors on near-ground temperature and may locally modify the impact of global warming.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate the preliminary effects of collaborative learning and simulation on readiness to engage in and attitudes toward future interprofessional learning activities. We translated into Norwegian and validated the original Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RILLS) (part 1) to measure the efficacy and feasibility of a structured collaborative learning activity (part 2).
   Materials and Methods: Undergraduate social and health care professional students from five Norwegian universities (n = 307) participated in the validation stage of this study (part 1). A Norwegian version of the RIPLS was developed using forward and backward translation. An expert panel discussed discrepancies between the translations and professional concepts. We planned to conduct a principal component analysis to evaluate the structure, reliability, and internal consistency of the Norwegian version of the RIPLS, after investigating the skewness, kurtosis, and range of items included. One hundred fifty students participated in collaborative learning activities; 72 (48%) of these individuals answered the translated RIPLS questionnaire.
   Results: We found a substantial ceiling effect in the majority of items in the RIPLS, making it difficult to use the instrument as a measure of change. We evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of the collaborative activities based on the changes in the single items that had sufficient univariate normality and ultimately confirmed positive changes in two of these items.
   Conclusion: Norwegian students appear ready for interprofessional learning; however, due to significant ceiling effects, the majority of items in the RIPLS no longer seem suitable for measuring and evaluating the effects of interprofessional learning (part 1). Single-item analysis revealed a potential effect of collaborative learning (part 2). A new questionnaire is needed where readiness is instead understood as self-efficacy in areas such as role awareness and interprofessional communication. Researchers should be aware that even previously validated questionnaires may lose their applicability over time and require revision. Demands for interprofessional learning and practice are continuously evolving, and evaluation methods should be adjusted accordingly.

TI  - Predicting germination capacity of <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and <i>Picea abies </i>seeds using temperature data from weather stations
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE
LA  - English
AB  - In Fennoscandia, both Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) often fail to produce mature seed, especially in the northern parts of their range. Therefore, cone and seed crop predictions are of major strategic importance for maintaining sustainable multipurpose forestry. We present functions for predicting germination capacity of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies seed over a wide geographic area. The functions are based on germination analyses for 1297 Pinus sylvestris and 597 Picea abies natural stands in Sweden during 1971-1994. Meteorological data from 71 weather stations were used to calculate heat sums with threshold values from 4 to 10 degrees C and two durations of growing season (ending August 31 or September 30). Logistic regression was utilised for parameter estimates. Accumulated heat sum (threshold 5 degrees C) from start of growing season until August 31 in combination with number of days from estimated time of fertilisation until approximate time for embryo growth cessation gave the best function. The function shows that Picea abies has lower temperature requirements for producing mature seed than Pinus sylvestris. A germination capacity of 95% is reached at a heat sum of 875 degree-days for Picea abies and at 975 degree-days for Pinus sylvestris.

AB  - This article describes the development of the Swedish post in the 17th century as part of a << revolution in communications >> that took place all over Europe. The fast introduction of postal organizations, newspapers and the diligence traffic entailed new modes of communication with long ranging consequences for the state and the societies. The article particularly emphasizes the pivotal role of the postmasters in this process. They were an expert group, whose economical and social credit was as important for their job as their intricate knowledge on the means to establish the necessary postal institutions. The article also discusses the way in which cultural agents used the post and what methods were taken to ensure the delivery of their letters.

AB  - This article is based on a case study of the media narratives of the neo-Nazi organisation Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM) and situates this particular actor within the broader landscape of violent extremism in Sweden today. Drawing on a qualitative content analysis informed by narrative inquiry, I examine various cultural expressions of neo-Nazi ideology in NRM's extensive repertoire of online media. Theoretically, I turn to cultural perspectives on violent extremism to bring to centre stage the role of popular culture and entertainment in the construction of a meaningful narrative of community and belonging built around neo-Nazism in Sweden today. The analysis explores the convergence between different genres, styles, and content into new cultural expressions of national socialism which bleed into mainstream Internet culture and political discourse in new ways. In the online universe of NRM, the extreme blends with the mainstream, the mundane and ordinary with the spectacular and provocative, and the serious with the silly. In this manner, the analysis lays bare the strategies through which NRM seeks to soften, trivialise, and normalise neo-Nazi discourse using the power and appeal of culture and entertainment.

AB  - The number of species-rich seminatural grasslands in Northern Europe has decreased significantly due to the abandonment of traditional land use practices. To preserve these habitats, an increasing number of abandoned and overgrown grasslands have been restored by cutting down trees and shrubs and reintroducing grazing. These practices are considered a useful tool to recover the species richness of vascular plants, but their impact on other taxa is hardly known. Here we studied ants as one important group of grassland insects. We investigated (1) the effects of restoration of nongrazed and afforested seminatural grasslands, compared to continuously managed reference sites; and (2) the modulating impacts of habitat characteristics and time elapsed since restoration. We found a total of 27 ant species, 11 of these were characteristic of open habitats and seven characteristic of forests. Neither species richness per site nor the number of open-habitat species, nor the number of forest species differed between restored and reference sites. Yet, within the restored sites, the total species richness and the number of open-habitat species was positively related to the time since restoration and the percentage of bare rock. High frequencies of most open-habitat species were associated with low vegetation, older restored sites, and reference sites. Most forest species showed their highest frequencies in tree- and shrub-dominated habitat. We conclude that restoration efforts have been successful in terms of retrieving species richness. A regular and moderate grazing regime subsequent to the restoration is suggested in order to support a high abundance of open-habitat species.

AB  - The promotion of active transportation (AT-utilitarian trips including walking, cycling, and public transit use), represents a well-recognized opportunity for increasing physical activity. This study examines the strong AT success achieved in Helsinki, Finland (in 2013, the share of daily trips in Helsinki completed by AT was 77 per cent) froma political perspective. Helsinki represents a noteworthy example of AT success given important challenges including the region's relatively low population density, its difficult winter climate, and Finland's high driving rate. This research applied the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), a formal policy process theory from political science. Interviews were conducted with 23 AT experts in Helsinki. Document review was employed as a secondary method. Overall, the research indicates that Helsinki's success may be attributed to the long-term dominance of municipal transportation policy by a pro-AT advocacy coalition. When viewed from the perspective of health promotion, it is striking that this success is not strongly attributable to health considerations or efforts from health-related fields. Rather, the data suggest that the coalition, comprised of members from a variety of non-health fields, was most strongly motivated by a desire to protect a high degree of livability. Importantly, a number of significant historical events and background-level factors greatly facilitated success. Overall, these results suggest that health promotion advocates may have very useful allies in non-health sectors, and that awareness of the importance of political factors is likely to contribute to stronger health promotion efforts. Finally, several possibilities for related and further research are suggested.

AB  - Insect pollinators are declining, which often is related to intensified agriculture. Less focus has been on the effect of forestry. In many boreal forests, clear-cutting has replaced fire as the main disturbance agent, which has been negative for many species. Therefore, prescribed burning is performed, often on clear-cuts. Knowledge on the effect of fire on pollinators is, however, scarce. We sampled pollinators and their resources in 22 burned and 15 unburned clear-cuts in and around a large wildfire area in Sweden, three years after fire. We compared potential pollinator resources as well as richness, abundance and community composition of four groups of pollinators: bees (totaling 583 individuals), wasps (1226), hoverflies (416), and butterflies (7 2 8) between burned and unburned clear-cuts. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of burn severity (depth of remaining humus). We show that the diversity and cover of potential nectar/pollen plants were clearly lower in burned clear-cuts, while potential nesting resources were higher. Butterfly richness was 67% lower and abundance 89% lower in burned clear-cuts. Differences in richness and abundance were smaller for bees, wasps, and hoverflies, but their species composition differed. We found no effect of burn severity on pollinators or their resources. We conclude that burned clear-cuts have fewer pollinators three years after fire, which is driven by a loss of butterflies. However, changes in species composition from clear-cut fires could complement the fauna of unburned sites when mixed at landscape level. Future studies should follow vegetation and pollinator communities over longer time periods following clear-cut burning.

AB  - Here, we present stationarity criteria for forest stands and establish ecological embodiments using an empirical stand development model. We introduced human interference in terms of diameter-limit cutting. Financial sustainability was investigated as a function of the cutting limit diameter. It was found that nonoperative capitalization along with its appreciation rate dictates the sustainability of management practices. In the absence of nonoperative capitalization, stationary forestry produces high capital return rates at a rather small volume of growing trees. In the case of large but constant nonoperative capitalization, a large operative capitalization resulting in a large harvesting yield provides the best capital returns. A high nonoperative appreciation rate requires a small volume of growing trees.

AB  - Meat consumption with large environmental and ethical implications is expected to grow in the future. Some studies, however, take the opposite view, that meat consumption is at a turning point because of a growing number of vegetarians and other factors in industrialized countries. This paper examines thirty nine Finnish experts' views on the development of meat consumption and analyses the explanatory grounds used by the experts in order to identify possible factors affecting meat consumption in the future. To ensure that different types of views would be represented, a new method of categorization of the experts was developed. In answer to the question; "What would constitute a preferable amount of meat consumption in Finland in the year 2030?", the average answer given by the experts was 66 kg per person per year and the median 71 kg, both of which would mean a drop from the current level of 72 kg. However, the average probable consumption foreseen by the experts was 75 kg and the median was also 75 kg. By analysing the grounds presented by the experts, the discussion part of the paper presents a selection of strategies that can be used to help decrease meat consumption: 1) aid the technological development of products that could replace foodstuffs that originate from animals, 2) use ad campaigns to increase consumer knowledge about animal rights and vegetarianism, 3) make political decisions to transfer agricultural production away from meat production and promote the broadening of the selection of alternatives to meat products in stores, and 4) place higher taxes on meat products.

AB  - In the last decades, the focus on waste and wastewater treatment systems has shifted towards increased recovery of energy and nutrients. Separation of urban food waste (FW) and domestic wastewaters using source control systems could aid this increase; however, their effect on overall sustainability is unknown. To obtain indicators for sustainability assessments, five urban systems for collection, transport, treatment and nutrient recovery from blackwater, greywater and FW were investigated using data from implementations in Sweden or northern Europe. The systems were evaluated against their potential for biogas production and nutrient recovery by the use of mass balances for organic material, nutrients and metals over the system components. The resulting indicators are presented in units suitable for use in future sustainability studies or life-cycle assessment of urban waste and wastewater systems. The indicators show that source control systems have the potential to increase biogas production by more than 70% compared with a conventional system and give a high recovery of phosphorus and nitrogen as biofertilizer. The total potential increase in gross energy equivalence for source control systems was 20-100%; the greatest increase shown is for vacuum-based systems.

AB  - Salvage logging is one of most frequently applied management responses to forest disturbances world-wide. As forest disturbances are increasing, so too is the application of salvage logging, yet its effects on ecosystems remains incompletely understood. In the Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests of Europe, salvaging of windfelled trees is inter alia applied to reduce the risk of bark beetle outbreaks (mainly Ips typographus L.). By preventing further disturbances, salvage logging can conserve live tree carbon (C) in forest landscapes. At the same time salvage logging reduces C stocks in detrital pools via the extraction of disturbed trees, its net effect thus remains unclear. We used the forest landscape model iLand to explore the effect of a wide range of salvaging intensities on (a) subsequent bark beetle outbreaks, and (b) landscape-scale forest C stocks in a Norway spruce-dominated production forest in Slovakia under past and future climatic conditions. Climate change resulted in a two- to three-fold increase in bark beetle disturbances throughout the 21st century in our simulations. We found that removing >95% of disturbed trees can effectively buffer the effect of increasing disturbances, dampening bark beetle infestations and increasing live tree C. Total ecosystem C followed a U-shaped pattern over salvaging intensity, with highest values in no salvage and 100% salvage scenarios. However, realistic rates of salvaging (<95% of disturbed trees detected and removed) had no significant effect on bark beetle dynamics and live tree C, and reduced the total ecosystem C stored in the landscape. Furthermore, the effect of reduced bark beetle disturbance under intensive salvaging was partly offset by increased wind disturbance. Synthesis and applications. Clearing disturbed areas to prevent future disturbances from bark beetles and conserve live tree carbon should only be applied where very high salvaging rates are feasible (i.e. small and concentrated disturbances). Considering that changing disturbance regimes make high-intensity salvaging increasingly challenging, alternative disturbance management approaches need to be developed.

AB  - In Norway, approximately 2000 landslides and avalanches affect the road network every year. Projected climate changes will give a milder and wetter climate in Norway with more extreme weather events. These changes are expected to affect the avalanche and landslide frequency. In order to adapt to expected climate changes, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration initiated a 4-year R&D programme in 2007 called "Climate and Transport". One of the main topics in the programme is landslides and avalanches, and how climate changes are expected to change the probability for and frequency of these events. Within the subject of avalanche and landslide risk on the road network, the level of acceptable risk has not been established, and in an attempt to describe the avalanche and landslide risk more thoroughly, a risk model concerning these conditions has been developed. The model is still in a premature state, and testing on certain road sections will be done in near future.

AB  - In Sweden, outdoor organic pig production is gaining interest. However, the excretory behaviour of pigs may create plant nutrient hotspots in outdoor areas, increasing the environmental impact. This study examined fluxes and balances of N, P, K, Cu and Zn at pen level, and determined the effects of the excretory behaviour of fattening pigs on nutrient load, manure distribution and N, P, K, Cu and Zn concentration in soil within pens at two farms with different outdoor systems (mobile and stationary). A pen in the mobile system had about 72 pigs ha(-1) and in the stationary system about 91 pigs ha(-1). The average pen balance in the mobile system was 270 kg N, 60 kg P, 110 kg K, 0.4 kg Cu and 1.3 kg Zn ha(-1) and in the stationary system 205 kg N, 57 kg P, 99 kg K, 0.4 kg Cu and 1.5 kg Zn ha(-1). The smaller net accumulation of nutrients in the stationary system was due to about 30% of excrement nutrients being excreted indoors. A substantial proportion of nutrients (43-95%) from one pig group was found to be concentrated in an area of arable land representing 4-24% of the total pen area. In the mobile system the major part of the defecating was deposited on the hut, feeding and drinking sub-areas. The manure mapping also revealed pig behaviour of avoiding defecation in certain zones. In the stationary system, the concentration of exchangeable P and K in soil (0-30 cm depth) in areas preferred for excretion was more than four-fold higher and the concentration of mineral-N (0-90 cm depth) was about eight-fold higher than in other areas of the pen by the end of the fattening period. Preferred areas for excretion within the pen were affected both by the present pig groups and by previous pig groups 4 years back in time. In the mobile system, the concentration of mineral-N in soil was about three-fold higher in preferred excretion areas compared with other areas. Neither of the two outdoor systems succeeded in avoiding excessive point loads of N within the pen. The flexibility of the mobile outdoor system has to be further improved so that no harmful point loads of nutrients can occur. In the stationary system, a nutrient management technique for collecting the manure on the preferred excretion areas on arable land needs to be developed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study contributes to transition studies through an empirical analysis of scientists at the Norwegian Research Center for Solar Cell Technology. From a policy perspective, this research centre is a concrete undertaking within transitions politics. How do solar energy scientists make sense of this mission and what strategies do they adopt? The analysis adopts a bottom-up perspective focusing on the politics involved in actor-networks constructing and empowering sustainable innovations. I suggest the micro/macro-divide characterising transition studies may be discarded, if we recognise that actors operate both on niche, regime, and landscape level. Instead of presuming a multi-level perspective, transition studies could analyse the multi-actor politics of translations in arenas of development. Adopting this approach, I argue that solar scientists pursue mainly two lines of activities: improving efficiency (translations to fit and conform) and challenging negative hegemonic representations of solar energy (translations to stretch and transform).

AB  - During 2007-2013, the Swedish Board of Agriculture granted support within a national program to about 1000 wetlands, corresponding to a 5300-hectare wetland area, with the dual goal to remove nutrients from water and to improve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects on nutrient transports that are realized within the national program to what could be obtained with the same area of wetlands if location and design of wetlands were optimized. In single, highly nutrient-loaded wetlands, a removal of around 1000 kg nitrogen and 100 kg phosphorus per hectare wetland area and year was estimated from monitoring data. Statistical models were developed to estimate the overall nutrient removal effects of wetlands created within the national program. Depending on model, the effect of the national program as a whole was estimated to between 27 and 38 kg nitrogen and between 2.7 and 4.5 kg phosphorus per hectare created wetland area and year. Comparison of what is achieved in individual wetlands to what was achieved in the national program indicates that nutrient removal effects could be increased substantially in future wetland programs by emphasising location and design of wetlands.

AB  - The current increase in European forest resources forms a singularity across the globe. Whether this trend will persist, and how biological and economic trends feature it form crucial issues to green economy challenges and C sequestration. The present screening of Forest Europe 2015 statistics explored the features, inertia and limits of this expansion, and its relationships with countries' development, forest management and trade, intense in this area of the world. Persisting footprint of past demographic pressure on forests was identified, with opposed traces on their area and growing stock density. Steady growing stock (GS) increases, proportional to GS, not density-limited, and sustained by forest area increases, supported the view of an inflationary forest dynamic. Economic development and liberalism fostered both forest exploitation and production, yielding no significant impact on GS changes. Wood exports exerted a tension on forest exploitation and GS changes, thus lowering GS inflation but providing a resource security margin in the face of expected climate threats. Conflicting a common view, GS inflation and moderate felling-to-increment ratios make increased use of wood resources and C sequestration reconcilable, and GS expansion timely for ongoing EU forest policy processes. Anticipated adverse impacts of ongoing climate change were not clearly identified in these statistics.

AB  - Background: Small, genetically uniform populations may face an elevated risk of extinction due to reduced environmental adaptability and individual fitness. Fragmentation can intensify these genetic adversities and, therefore, dispersal and gene flow among subpopulations within an isolated population is often essential for maintaining its viability. Using microsatellite and mtDNA data, we examined genetic diversity, spatial differentiation, interregional gene flow, and effective population sizes in the critically endangered Saimaa ringed seal (Phoca hispida saimensis), which is endemic to the large but highly fragmented Lake Saimaa in southeastern Finland.
   Results: Microsatellite diversity within the subspecies (H-E = 0.36) ranks among the lowest thus far recorded within the order Pinnipedia, with signs of ongoing loss of individual heterozygosity, reflecting very low effective subpopulation sizes. Bayesian assignment analyses of the microsatellite data revealed clear genetic differentiation among the main breeding areas, but interregional structuring was substantially weaker in biparentally inherited microsatellites (F-ST = 0.107) than in maternally inherited mtDNA (F-ST = 0.444), indicating a sevenfold difference in the gene flow mediated by males versus females.
   Conclusions: Genetic structuring in the population appears to arise from the joint effects of multiple factors, including small effective subpopulation sizes, a fragmented lacustrine habitat, and behavioural dispersal limitation. The fine-scale differentiation found in the landlocked Saimaa ringed seal is especially surprising when contrasted with marine ringed seals, which often exhibit near-panmixia among subpopulations separated by hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. Our results demonstrate that population structures of endangered animals cannot be predicted based on data on even closely related species or subspecies.

AB  - Management of forest sites has the potential to modulate soil organic matter decomposition by changing the catalytic properties of soil microorganisms within a soil profile. In this study we examined the impact of forest management intensity and soil physico-chemical properties on the variation of enzyme activities (beta-glucosidase, beta-xylosidase, alpha-glucosidase, phenol oxidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, phosphatase) in the topsoil and two subsoil horizons in three German regions (Schorfheide-Chorin, Hainich-Dun, Schwabische Alb). The sandy soils in the Schorfheide-Chorin (SCH) showed lower ratios of the activity of carbon (C) acquiring enzymes (beta-glucosidase) relative to nitrogen (N) acquiring enzymes (N-acetyl-glucosaminidase + L-leucine aminopeptidase), and activity of C acquiring enzymes relative to phosphorous (P) acquiring enzymes (phosphatase) than the finer textured soils in the Hainich-Dun (HAI) and Schwabische Alb (ALB), indicating a shift in investment to N and P acquisition in the SCH. All enzyme activities, except phenol oxidase activity, decreased in deeper soil horizons as concentrations of organic C and total N did, while the decrease was much stronger from the topsoil to the first subsoil horizon than from the first subsoil to the second subsoil horizon. In contrast, phenol oxidase activity showed no significant decrease towards deeper soil horizons. Additionally, enzyme activities responsible for the degradation of more recalcitrant C relative to labile C compounds increased in the two subsoil horizons. Subsoil horizons in all regions also indicate a shift to higher N acquisition, while the strength of the shift depended on the soil type. Further, our results clearly showed that soil properties explained most of the total variance of enzyme activities in all soil horizons followed by study region, while forest management intensity had no significant impact on enzyme activities. Among all included soil properties, the clay content was the variable that explained the highest proportion of variance in enzyme activities with higher enzyme activities in clay rich soils. Our results highlight the need for large scale studies including different regions and their environmental conditions in order to derive general conclusions on which factors (anthropogenic or environmental) are most influential on enzyme activities in the whole soil profile in the long term at the regional scale.

AB  - Aims: The present study is the first-ever attempt to generate information on the potential present and future distribution of Impatiens capensis (orange balsam) under various climate change scenarios. Moreover, the differences in bioclimatic preferences of native and non-native populations were evaluated.
   Location: Global.
   Taxon: Angiosperms.
   Methods: A database of I. capensis localities was compiled based on the public database - the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), herbarium specimens, and a field survey in Poland. The initial dataset was verified, and each record was assigned to one of two groups - native (3664 records from North America) or non-native (750 records from Europe and the western part of North America). The analyses involved bioclimatic variables in 2.5 arc-minutes of interpolated climate surface downloaded from WorldClim v. 2.1. MaxEnt version 3.3.2 was used to conduct the ecological niche modeling based on presence-only observations of I. capensis. Forecasts of the future distribution of the climatic niches of the studied species in 2080-2100 were made based on climate projections developed by the CNRM/CERFACS modeling and Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC-6).
   Main conclusions: Distribution models created for "present time" showed slightly broader potential geographical ranges of both native and invasive populations of orange balsam. On the other hand, some areas (e.g. NW Poland, SW Finland), settled by the species, are far outside the modeled climate niche, which indicates a much greater adaptation potential of I. capensis. In addition, the models have shown that climate change will shift the native range of orange balsamto the north and the range of its European populations to the northwest. Moreover, while the coverage of niches suitable for I. capensis in America will extend due to climate change, the European populations will face 31-95 % habitat loss.

AB  - Common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.) is a popular landscaping plant. Our aim was to obtain a large set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, to reveal the precise identities of the investigated S. vulgaris accessions, and to discover genetic relationships among them. The studied plant material included local Finnish, previously unidentified accessions, known reference cultivars, and so-called historical accessions i.e., old shrubs growing in historic cultural landscapes. We intended to verify cultivar names for some valuable local common lilac accessions and to provide insights into the history of common lilac cultivation in Finland. In the analyses, we used a set of 15,007 SNP markers. First, polymorphic information contents were calculated (mean 0.190, range 0.012-0.500 per marker). Then, to investigate genetic relationships among genotypes, a phylogenetic tree was constructed, and a principal coordinate analysis was conducted. A Bayesian analysis of population structure was performed to determine the number and distribution of genetic clusters among samples. Genetic marker data combined with existing historical and phenotypic knowledge revealed novel information on the unidentified cultivars and on the genetic relationships among studied accessions and solved the arrival and early history of common lilac in Finland. Overall, such comprehensive genomic characterization and deep understanding of genetic relationships of S. vulgaris can be used when utilizing present cultivars and developing new ones in future breeding programs.

AB  - Objectives The objectives of the study were: 1) Describe the thematic structure and evolution of the field of physical therapy; 2) identify the main research producers (i.e. countries and institutions); and 3) compare their research output and citation impact. Methods Papers related to physical therapy indexed in Web of Science (2000-2018) were identified to delineate the field, using keywords, journals, and citation networks. VOSviewer software, advanced bibliometric text mining, and visualization techniques were used to evaluate the thematic structure. We collected data about the country and institutional affiliation of all the authors and calculated production and citation impact indicators. Results 85,697 papers were analyzed. Eleven thematic clusters were identified: 1) "health care and education"; 2) "biomechanics"; 3) "psychosocial, chronic pain and quality of life outcomes"; 4) "evidence-based physical therapy research methods"; 5) "traumatology and orthopedics"; 6) "neurological rehabilitation"; 7) "psychometrics and cross-cultural adaptation"; 8) "gait-balance analysis and Parkinson's disease"; 9) "exercise"; 10) "respiratory physical therapy"; and 11) "back pain." The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia were the most productive countries. Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden had the highest citation impact. Conclusions Our bibliometric visualization approach makes it possible to comprehensively study the thematic structure of physical therapy. The ranking of producers has evolved and now includes China and Brazil. High research production does not imply a high citation impact.

AB  - Knowledge about the timing, amplitude and spatial gradients of Holocene environmental variability in the circum-Baltic region is key to understanding its responses to ongoing climate change. Based on a multi-dating and proxy approach, we reconstruct changes in productivity using total organic carbon (TOC) contents in sediments of Lake Kalksjon (KKJ) from west-central Sweden spanning the last 9612 (+255/-114) years. An exception is the period from 1878 CE until today, in which sedimentation was dominated by anthropogenic lake level lowering and land use. In-lake productivity was higher during periods of warmer winters with shortened ice cover and prolonged growing seasons. A multi-millennial increase in productivity throughout the last & SIM; 9600 years is associated with progressively warmer winters in northwestern Europe, likely triggered by the coinciding increase in Northern Hemisphere winter insolation. Decadal to centennial periods of higher productivity in KKJ tend to correspond to warmer winters during a more positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) polarity, as reconstructed for the last 8000 years. In consequence, we assume our decadal to centennial productivity record from KKJ sediments for the complete & SIM; 9600 years to provide a qualitative record of NAO polarity. A shift towards higher productivity variability at & SIM; 5450 cal a BP is hypothesized to reflect a reinforcement of NAO-like atmospheric circulation variability, possibly driven by more vigorous changes in North Atlantic deep-water formation.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) are main tree species of Central Europe that are currently highly vulnerable in times of global climate change. The research deals with the effect of climate and air pollution on radial growth of silver fir and Norway spruce in mixed age-varied (56 - 146 years) forests in the Jeseniky Protected Landscape Area, the Czech Republic. The objectives were to evaluate biodiversity, structure and production, specifically interaction of radial growth of fir and spruce to air pollution (SO2, NOX, tropospheric ozone) and climatic factors (precipitation, air temperature). Concentration of SO2 and NOX had negative effect on radial growth of fir, while radial growth of spruce was more negatively influenced by tropospheric ozone. Fir showed higher variability in radial growth and was more sensitive to climatic factors compared to spruce. On the other hand, fir was relatively adaptable tree species that regenerated very well when the pressure of stress factors subsided (air pollution load, Caucasian bark beetle, frost damage). Low temperature was a limiting factor of radial growth in the study mountainous area, especially for fir. Fir was significantly sensitive to late frost, respectively, spruce to winter desiccation and spring droughts with synergism of air pollution load. Generally, older forest stands were more negatively influenced by air pollution load and climatic extremes compared to young trees.

AB  - The population declines of waders in Europe are widely considered to have resulted from habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural changes. However, recent empirical evidence suggests that levels of predation on wader nests are unsustainably high in many cases, even in some situations where breeding habitat is otherwise favourable. We review the published and 'grey' literature on nest predation on waders in Europe and quantify the relative importance of the major predators. Nest cameras offer the least biased method of identifying and quantifying nest predators. A small number of camera studies, in combination with others utilizing nest temperature loggers, indicate that nocturnal/mammalian predators make the largest contribution to wader nest predation. More than half of site-years or studies reviewed reported clutch failure rates of over 50% attributable to predation alone, a rate that is likely to be associated with declining populations, although parameters such as chick and adult survival will also affect population trends. Correlates of wader nest predation are documented, with time of season, field type and management, distance to habitat/field edge, wader nest density, and abundance of mammalian predators being most consistently identified. Future directions of research into wader productivity are discussed, and we suggest that studies quantify additional life-history parameters such as chick survival, as well as examining the predator community, wherever possible.

AB  - Mass-flowering crops lead to spatial redistributions of pollinators and to transient shortages within nearby semi-natural grasslands, but the impacts on plant-pollinator interactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterised which pollinator species are attracted by oilseed rape and how this affected the structure of plant-pollinator networks in nearby grasslands. We surveyed 177 networks from three countries (Germany, Sweden and United Kingdom) in 24 landscapes with high crop cover, and compared them to 24 landscapes with low or no oilseed rape during and after crop blooming. On average 55% of grassland pollinator species were found on the crop, which attracted 8-35% of individuals away from grasslands. However, networks in the grasslands were resistant to these reductions, since mainly abundant and highly mobile species were attracted. Nonetheless, simulations indicated that network structural changes could be triggered if 50% of individuals were attracted to the crop (a value well-above that found in our study system), which could affect community stability and resilience to further disturbance.

AB  - Quantifying the sustainability of the agriculture, livestock, and agri-food industry under a homogeneous criterion is essential to strategize the implementation of sustainable development in the agri-food sector and increase the commitment of stakeholders using aids to reduce the socio-economic impact of the expansion of sustainability. In order to homogenize the quantification methodology in the European context, a composite indicator was developed from a system of indices of the European agri-food system. Results unveiled a moderate level of sustainability in the food production and processing in the European Union. The French agri-food system (0.46) had the highest overall sustainability according to the composite indicator of this study, followed by Austria (0.44), Italy (0.43), Estonia (0.43), Germany (0.42), Belgium (0.40), Finland (0.40), Denmark (0.40), Spain (0.40), Latvia (0.39), Czech Republic (0.39), Sweden (0.38), Greece (0.38), Netherlands (0.38) and Slovakia (0.38), all of them above the EU-27 average (0.37). The more significant economic and social progress of agricultural activity was associated with a lower quality of environmental indicators. Overall agri-food system sustainability can be predicted from ten indicators. The results suggest the necessity of implementing a policy that prioritizes the development of Local Productive Systems based on the framework of the circular economy to favor territorial balance.

AB  - Recent research suggests that self-employment among immigrants is due to a combination of multiple situational, cultural and institutional factors, all acting together. Using multilevel regression and unique data on the entire population of Sweden for the year 2007, this study attempts to quantify the relative importance for the self-employed of embeddedness in ethnic contexts (country of birth) and regional business and public regulatory frameworks (labour market areas). This information indicates whether the layers under consideration are valid constructs of the surroundings that influence individual self-employment. The results show that 10% (women) and 8% (men) of the total variation in individual differences in self-employment can be attributed to the country of birth. When labour market areas are included in the analyses, the share of the total variation increases to 14% for women and 12% for men. The results show that the ethnic context and the economic environment play a minor role in understanding individual differences in self-employment levels. The results can have important implications when planning interventions or other actions focusing on self-employment as public measures to promote self-employment often are based on geographic areas and ethnic contexts.

AB  - The need for reducing poverty and to develop the standard of living in rural areas around the world is enormous. Ideas for new approaches have to be created, developed and implemented. Design thinking and methods combined with innovation in practice and management - as Design Inspired Innovation could be such a concept to provide for rural people to empower themselves and improve their living conditions. On the other hand it is important to learn from the sustainable lifestyle practices being followed in rural villages and extrapolate them to the urban setting. The purpose of this paper is to discuss an initiative between Swedish and Indian researchers, MBA students and their networks. It is based on appropriate design research methodology, ethnographic design research and innovation science. Experiences from initial empirical studies show that master students gathering data in the field (focusing in the areas such as ICT, banking & finance, health care, entrepreneurship, energy and agribusiness), analyzing and interpreting the data together with researchers can get new insights of opportunities in innovation and entrepreneurship at the 'bottom of the pyramid'.

AB  - A life history strategy that favours somatic growth over reproduction is well known for long-lived iteroparous species, especially in unpredictable environments. Risk-sensitive female reproductive allocation can be achieved by a reduced reproductive effort at conception, or the subsequent adjustment of investment during gestation or lactation in response to unexpected environmental conditions or resource availability. We investigated the relative importance of reduced investment at conception compared with later in the reproductive cycle (i.e. prenatal, perinatal or neonatal mortality) in explaining reproductive failure in two high-density moose (Alces alces) populations in southern Norway. We followed 65 multiparous, global positioning system (GPS)-collared females throughout the reproductive cycle and focused on the role of maternal nutrition during gestation in determining reproductive success using a quasi-experimental approach to manipulate winter forage availability. Pregnancy rates in early winter were normal (a parts per thousand yen0.8) in all years while spring calving rates ranged from 0.4 to 0.83, with prenatal mortality accounting for most of the difference. Further losses over summer reduced autumn recruitment rates to 0.23-0.69, despite negligible predation. Over-winter mass loss explained variation in both spring calving and autumn recruitment success better than absolute body mass in early or late winter. Although pregnancy was related to body mass in early winter, overall reproductive success was unrelated to pre-winter body condition. We therefore concluded that reproductive success was limited by winter nutritional conditions. However, we could not determine whether the observed reproductive allocation adjustment was a bet-hedging strategy to maximise reproduction without compromising survival or whether females were simply unable to invest more resources in their offspring.

AB  - Dead wood (DW) is an important forest carbon (C) pool for which the reporting of C stock changes within the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report (NIR) is mandatory. The use of DW volume-to-carbon conversion factors by decay classes, i.e. DW basic density (DWBD) and C fraction (CF), or C density (CD) as their product, facilitates more accurate estimates of DW C stocks and C stock changes. We present DW conversion factors, namely DWBD, CF, and CD, by decay classes for six broadleaf (Quercus robur L., Carpinus betulus L., Alnus glutinosa Garnet., Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl., Fagus sylvatica L., and Quercus ilex L.) and four conifer (Abies alba Mill., Picea abies (L.) Karst., Pinus nigra Arnold and Pinus pinaster Aiton) tree species from Continental, Alpine and Mediterranean biogeographical regions of Croatia. For each tree species DW logs (diameter from 5 to 30 cm) were visually categorized into four decay classes and nine discs per decay class were sampled. In addition, three healthy trees of each species were felled down at the same location for estimating the basic density of fresh wood (BWD, decay class 0) and calculation of species-specific relative density reduction patterns. In total, 390 discs were sampled and analysed in the laboratory. Our results show that broadleaves, on average, have higher DWBD than conifers (p < 0.05) for decay classes 0-3, but for decay class 4 no difference (p < 0.05) was observed between these two tree species groups. Unlike for DWBD, CF showed no trend with decay class, but a difference (p < 0.05) in the average CF was found between broadleaves and conifers with the mean (s.e.) of 47.65% (0.12%) and 50.67% (0.23%), respectively. The application of decay class-specific CD by forest land use strata used in the Croatian NIR yielded 11.1% - 26.6% lower DW C pool estimates, compared to the current ones calculated using BWDs and default CF. DWBD data from our study was compared with DWBD data from the literature. We observed good agreement between national species-specific DWBD and global genus-specific DWBD for the great majority of investigated tree genera and decay classes. Therefore, we combined our results with the published data to provide a global DWBD meta-means with confidence intervals by decay classes for eight tree genera. Our results suggest that in the absence of local or national DWBD data, the use of genus-specific DWBD meta-means is justified.

AB  - Topographic heterogeneity causes gradients in altitude, potential solar radiation and soil humidity on a range of scales from micro- to macro-habitat These gradients are important determinants for the distribution of many organisms but have been largely neglected in studies of species associated with dead wood, a group of great conservation concern. In this study, we evaluated the effects of topography-related gradients (altitude, potential solar radiation and soil humidity) and habitat characteristics (bark cover, ground contact and dead wood volume) on saproxylic (wood-inhabiting) beetle assemblages. We sampled boreal saproxylic beetles hatching from 750 experimentally exposed spruce and birch logs in a regional scale field experiment including 10 landscapes and spanning gradients of altitude (range 85-510 m asl), potential solar radiation (based on slope and slope aspect and highest in equator-facing slopes, PADIR, range 0.24-0.71) and soil humidity (humidity index, range 2.3-3.1). The logs were placed in north Swedish forests and clear-cuts and beetles were sampled with emergence traps the 4th summer after the logs were introduced. Saproxylic assemblage composition varied considerably in response to altitude, potential solar radiation and soil humidity. The response was evident in both forests and clear-cuts and for both birch and spruce logs. Species density and abundance responses differed among trophic groups. For birch logs, fungivore species density increased significantly with increased potential solar radiation. For spruce logs, altitude affected total species density and density of cambium consumers positively and abundance of fungivores negatively, suggesting a delay in succession due to slower decomposition at higher altitudes. In addition to the topography-related gradients, ground contact and bark cover of logs as well as the availability of dead wood in the vicinity influenced the beetle assemblages. Our results clearly show that topography-related gradients affect assemblage composition of saproxylic beetles. These factors should be considered in the management of saproxylic biodiversity. To ensure the safeguarding of intact saproxylic assemblages it is important that the full range of dead wood habitats is conserved. Topographic heterogeneity may provide opportunities for landscape scale survival in response to rapid climate change but there is also a risk that some niches will disappear. Some of the negative effects of climate change could be mitigated by allocating set asides and restoration efforts in areas where gradient in altitude, solar radiation and soil humidity are particularly well developed over short distances.

AB  - Anthropogenic and biotic disturbances have the potential to interact, generating cumulative impacts on animal movement or, alternatively, counterbalancing or masking each other. Despite their importance, those interactions have not been investigated thoroughly. Our study aimed to fill this knowledge gap by assessing the combined effects of a human activity-that is, military exercises-and a biotic disturbance-that is, insect harassment-on movement rates of free-ranging semidomesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus). From 2010 to 2012, we analyzed location data from fifty-one Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared female reindeer in the largest European military test range, situated in northern Sweden. In the presence of both military exercises and mosquito harassment, reindeer reacted by increasing their movement rates but not as much as when mosquito harassment occurred alone. Conversely, reindeer reduced their movement rates during military exercises performed with aircraft. Moreover, the effect of military exercises performed with vehicles was evident only when combined with mosquito harassment. These results stress the value of evaluating the effects of the interaction between biotic disturbances and human activities, especially in northern ecosystems, because of the predicted climate warming and the growing interest toward natural resource extraction and other forms of land use.

AB  - There is a widely recognized need to understand and reduce the incidental effects of marine fishing on non-target animals. Previous research on marine bycatch has largely focused on simply quantifying mortality. However, much less is known about the organism-level sublethal effects, including the potential for behavioural alterations, physiological and energetic costs, and associated reductions in feeding, growth, or reproduction (i.e., fitness) which can occur undetected following escape or release from fishing gear. We reviewed the literature and found 133 marine bycatch papers that included sublethal endpoints such as physiological disturbance, behavioural impairment, injury, reflex impairment, and effects on reproduction, feeding, and growth for animals that survived a fisheries interaction. Of the 133 identified articles, 22 documented sublethal effects of capture using metrics directly related to fitness, life history, or population-level processes. Sublethal effects were classified as either short-term (e.g., acute stress response), which could lead to long-term or delayed sublethal outcomes (e.g., growth, reproduction), which are directly fitness-relevant and could have had population-level effects. We recommend further investigation into the effects of injury on fitness, and the effects of capture stress on reproduction. It is completely unknown whether sublethal effects can have significant consequences at the population-or ecosystem-level. To date, the potential for discards to suffer from sublethal fitness effects has been almost entirely ignored, and added knowledge on the topic could benefit both conservation and management.

AB  - The Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands submit-ted a proposal to the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) in February 2023 calling for a ban in the use of toxic indus-trial chemicals per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). These chemicals are highly toxic causing elevated cholesterol, immune suppression, reproductive failure, cancer and neuro-endocrine disruption in humans and wildlife being a significant threat to biodiversity and human health. The main reason for the submitted proposal is recent find-ings of significant flaws in the transition to PFAS replacements that is leading to a widespread pollution. Denmark was the first country banning PFAS, and now other EU countries support the restrictions of these carcinogenic, endocrine disruptive and immunotoxic chemicals. The proposed plan is among the most extensive received by the ECHA for 50 years. Denmark is now the first EU country to initiate the establishment of groundwater parks to try and protect its drinking water. These parks are areas free of agricultural activities and nutritious sewage sludge to secure drinking water free of xenobiotic including PFAS. The PFAS pollution also reflects the lack of comprehensive spatial and tem-poral environmental monitoring programs in the EU. Such monitoring programs should include key indicator species across ecosystems of livestock, fish and wildlife, to facilitate detection of early ecological warning signals and sustain public health. Simultaneously with inferring a total PFAS ban, the EU should also push for more persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) PFAS substances to be listed on the Stockholm Convention (SC) Annex A such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid) that is currently listed on the SCs Annex B. The combination of these regulative restrictions combined with groundwater parks and pan-European biomonitoring programs, would pave the way for-ward for a cleaner environment to sustain health across the EU.

AB  - Governmental programmes and international agreements to counteract eutrophication have largely not attained agreed goals (e.g. reduction by half of the anthropogenic nitrogen load on Swedish coastal waters and to the Baltic Sea). One explanation to the fact that the goals are not achieved yet might be that the most effective building blocks to counteract diffuse pollution are far from being fully implemented. It is therefore important to stress the potential in some very effective measures and find ways to fully implement them in a strategic way at the watershed level. To avoid overdoses of fertilizers in crop production is very important since overdoses lead to an exponential growth in the leaching magnitude. Field experiments indicate that the use of winter crops or an undersown catch crop outside the main cropping season has cut back the nitrate losses with up to 75% in a single year and close to 50% during a longer period of successive years. In southern Sweden, the area of wetlands has been decreased considerably (more than 90%) by melioration activities. In a recent project, mass balances in full scale restored ponds, verified the importance of ponds and wetlands in nitrogen retention. Per unit area. increased nitrogen loading implied increased nitrogen retention, but often a decreased retention percentage. Sedimentation of organic material must be favoured in order to obtain adequate conditions for denitrification. To achieve the governmental goal in nitrogen load reduction, proper agricultural practices must be combined with restoration of ponds/wetlands. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In order to meet the requirements of the Paris climate agreement, the EU plans to set new goals for forest carbon sinks. This may affect the future development potential in the wood using sectors in Europe and their contribution in the new circular bio-economy. We explore the potential consequences mainly on the forest sector in the region consisting of EU and Norway (EU + N), but also globally, that would arise if the countries in the EU + N constrained economic utilization of their forest resources. For the analysis, we use the global forest sector model EFI-GTM, which also incorporates the trade in wood and wood products.
   Due to the globally growing demand for forest products and available forest resources in the rest of the world (RoW) outside of the EU + N, the leakages of harvests, forest industry production and employment opportunities from EU + N to RoW would be considerable. Decreased wood harvests and forest industry production in the EU + N would raise the wood and forest industry product prices globally, and increase production and employment in the forest sector in RoW. Due to the harvest leakage, climate mitigation benefits of the policy in the form of forest carbon sinks in the EU + N would be considerably reduced. Also, there would be inter-sectoral carbon leakage, as part of the wood consumption would shift to more energy-demanding competing materials.

AB  - The Finnish National Action Plan (NAP) on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products for 2018-2022 was evaluated by a survey indicated to the experts involved in its implementation in 2022. The survey revealed several successes such as the training and certification system of professional users, retailers and advisers, regular inspec-tion of spray equipment, and the web-based register of plant protection products (PPP). Measures, where further improvement is necessary, are, e.g., setting of environmental quality standards for all active substances, and moni-toring of surface and ground waters for PPP residues, which has suffered from a lack of resources during the NAP period. Overall screening of the sustainability goals revealed progress in all aspects, though targeting, resourcing, and monitoring remained the area with least progress compared to the same screening conducted in 2015. The perception of the experts on the constraints that limit the fulfilment of the NAP most seriously remained similar compared to their views in 2014.

When the soil O horizon is collected as topsoil sample, the concentration of again both elements is higher by about a factor of 10 (range 7-30), with median concentrations around 0.2 mg/kg Ag and Hg. Geochemical maps of top-and subsoil at different scales for both elements display regional patterns which reflect mainly geology, climate and topography. Anthropogenic sources like mines, power plants, or major cities visually occur only as local anomalies. For Ag in organogenic topsoil the maximum possible input due to diffuse contamination is estimated to be in the 0.02 mg/kg range, about 10% of the median concentration in the soil O horizon. For Hg this value is slightly higher at 0.03 mg/kg. In the soil O horizon Hg concentrations show less variability than in the C horizon. Substantial Hg soil contamination should lead to noticeably increased Hg/Ag ratios.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) in Europe is in a paradigm shift as all (coastal) European countries now have established practices for the production of marine spatial plans. Though international guidelines and an EU directive for MSP provides policy frameworks, the formulation of national policy designs for MSP remains a national responsibility resulting in vastly different practices. Focusing on three Northern European countries; Denmark, Germany and Norway, this paper presents examples of how national policy designs for marine spatial planning are structured, and how the current practice in each country is influenced by local planning cultures. This mapping gives insights to a number of challenges facing planning authorities when planning for sustainable development. Ambiguity dominates the framework of marine spatial planning and the central sustainability concepts it contains. This paper gives voice to the planning teams, as they are key-players in generating meaning in this ocean of ambiguity, giving insights to their understanding of sustainability in the planning of futures for sustainable seas.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a ranking-type Delphi study on the critical risk factors for the adoption of an electric road system (e-road) for trucks on the main motorways in Sweden. The investment cost of such a system is high, necessitating an upfront evaluation of the adoption risk factors to reduce the likelihood of budget overruns and project delays. Participating Swedish e-road experts (N = 52) from the public sector, private sector, and academia identified 32 unique risk factors, which were divided into five categories. The three most critical risk factors, as ranked by the experts, were 'low expansion rate,' 'low utilization rate,' and 'lengthy public-sector evaluation.' Overall, market and financial risks were ranked as more important than institutional, technological, and sustainability risks. This study has important implications for policymakers in countries considering e-road adoption.

AB  - This article analyses the role of central editors in constructing a national debate in the Norwegian media after the 2011 Oslo terror attacks. A broad literature has documented that after crisis, mainstream media move away from their everyday critical function to a ritual type of journalism that fosters adherence to shared values and support for national authorities. Based on in-depth interviews with debate editors, this article analyses how this type of national crisis discourse is substantiated and guarded through editorial decisions and policies. Second, it gives insights into how changes in the perceived climate of opinion and increasingly vocal critical voices gradually affect editorial practices and challenge consensus. Theoretically, the article combines perspectives from a critical approach (the media as channels for political authorities during crisis) and a cultural approach (the media as constitutive for resilience and recovery) to contribute to the understanding of crisis journalism in a multi-platform, multi-directional media landscape.

AB  - We analyze a multi-stakeholder process that succeeded in creating a joint forest management strategy for the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland. The analysis draws on the participants' own account of the process, elicited via interviews and questionnaires. We attend to critical context and process factors to account for the success of the collaborative process and evaluate the effectiveness of the agreement in terms of ecological and social outcomes. The process created a practical agreement, which increased the share of protected forests and introduced new biodiversity protection measures for commercial and recreational forests. It also created innovative solutions, like the new concept of a nature value forest, which helped the parties to negotiate around their differences. However, disagreement over the impacts of forest management practices, especially continuous cover forestry, remained. The crucial contextual conditions contributing to the agreement were strong initiating leadership and political mandate, which motivated the participants to engage in collaborative dialogue and stick with the process. The key process factors were a third-party facilitation and joint fact-finding. Most importantly, the process was not constrained by a pre-defined agenda or assumptions related to the status quo, but the participants were granted considerable influence over decisions and outputs.

AB  - Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a key tool to help ensure sustainable built development in more than 200 countries worldwide. Ecology is frequently a component of EIA and early reviews of Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) chapters identified scope for improvement at almost every stage of the EcIA process, regardless of country. However, there have been no reviews of UK EcIA chapters since 2000, despite important changes in biodiversity and planning legislation, policy and guidance. In addition, no UK EcIA chapter reviews have attempted to assign a grade or score to EcIA chapters (as has been done for reviews of US, Finnish and Indian EcIA chapters). Furthermore, no EcIA chapter reviews have attempted to use a scoring system to identify which variables determine EcIA chapter information content, beyond straightforward comparisons of EcIA chapters before and after the introduction of guidelines.
   A variant of the Biodiversity Assessment Index (BAD was used to assign scores between zero and one to EcIA chapters based on a series of 47 questions drawn from EU legislation and professional guidance. 112 EcIA chapters for proposed developments that were subsequently granted planning permission in England were assessed. The mean BAI score was less than 0.5, indicating the presence of considerable information gaps in the majority of EcIA chapters.
   Of 13 predictor variables identified as having the potential to affect EcIA chapter quality, 10 were identified as significantly related to the BAI scores. A backward stepwise Generalized Linear Model identified the use of professional guidance, the ecological consultancy type and the length of the EcIA chapter as having the greatest combined explanatory power. As a result, several recommendations are made to help improve future EcIA chapter content, including formal EcIA chapter review, publicising the professional guidance to consultants, the provision of training and the introduction of an accreditation scheme for consultants involved in EcIA
   This approach could be replicated in other countries that conduct EIA. Context-dependent EcIA chapter review criteria (as in this paper) would help to identify targeted recommendations for improvement. Alternatively, a global set of review criteria could highlight areas of best practice that could then be exported to other countries. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Water purification is one of the most essential services provided by wetlands. A lot of concerns regarding wetlands subjected to climate change relate to their susceptibility to hydrological change and the increase in temperature as a result of global warming. A warmer condition may accelerate the rate of decomposition and release of nutrients, which can be exported downstream and cause serious ecological challenges; e.g., eutrophication and acidification. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of climate change on water quality in peatland and constructed wetland ecosystems subject to water level management. For this purpose, the authors simulated the current climate scenario base on the database from Malmo? station (Scania, Sweden) for 2016 and 2017 as well as the future climate scenarios for the last 30 years of the century based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and different regional climate models (RCM) for a region wider than Scania County. For future climate change, the authors simulated low (RCP 2.6), moderate (RCP 4.5) and extreme (RCP 8.5) climate scenarios. All simulations were conducted within climate chambers for experimental peatland and constructed wetland mesocosms. Our results demonstrate that the effect of climate scenario is significantly different for peatlands and constructed wetlands (interactive effect) for the combined chemical variables. The warmest climate scenario RCP 8.5 is linked to a higher water purification function for constructed wetlands, but to a lower water purification function and a subsequent deterioration of peatland water qualities, even if subjected to water level management. The explanation for the different response of constructed wetlands and peatlands to climate change could be due to the fact that the substrate in the constructed wetland mesocosms and peatlands was different in terms of the organic matter quality and quantity. The utilization of nutrients by the plants and microbial community readily exceed the mineralization under a limited nutrient content (as we had in constructed wetland) when the temperature rises. However, concerning the extreme scenario RCP 8.5, the peatlands have shown a tendency to have reverse processes.

AB  - Context Past human land use has received increasing attention as an important driver of ecosystem change also in seemingly natural landscapes. Quantification of historical land use is therefore critical for assessing the degree of human impact and requires integration of ecology, history and archaeology.
   Objective This study aims to assess and compare levels of resource use by different actors during 355 years across a large landscape of northern Sweden.
   Method Data on resource use derived from case studies were extrapolated using demographic data to estimate harvested resources at the landscape scale. Here, we examined the use of the key-specie Scots pine by native Sami peoples and farmers and through commercial logging, and reconstructed historical forest conditions in order to interpret harvest levels and sustainability.
   Results We show that (1) the pre-industrial use of Scots pine resources in Pite Lappmark was sustainable from a landscape perspective, and (2) that the early commercial logging, in contrast, was not sustainable. Large and old Scots pine trees were logged at a very high rate, reaching up to 300 % of the annual ingrowth.
   Conclusion We suggest that historical landscape studies should incorporate analysis at different spatial scales, as such an approach can mirror the overall use of resources. Only then can land use data be applied across larger spatial scales, function as reference values and be compared to those of other regions, time-periods and types of human impact.

AB  - Rotation as the planned average production period of a management unit within the age-class system, and as a central control value for the forest enterprise, has always been a key factor of forest sustainability. It determines, for instance, growing stock, timber yield, tree dimensions and economic success. As a consequence of changes in sawmilling technology, price relations between dimensional assortments of Norway spruce, which is Austria's most abundant tree species, have altered in favour of small diameter logs at least for medium and low quality timber. This trend has been accompanied by advantages in the efficiency of fully mechanised timber harvesting technology for smaller dimension timber in particular. Sawmills have turned to forestry with the request to provide small diameter logs and reduce the production period. Thus, the question arose as to whether a shortening of rotation would make sense in mountainous regions as well.
   As early as in the 1990s a first comprehensive analysis of possible consequences of the aforementioned changes for the rotation period of highest income from the forest came to the conclusion that shortening the rotation period would not be recommendable (Jobstl, 1997). A more recent study was designed to consider also the changes of the past 15 years and compare the results with those of the former study.
   For calculating the net income and its components - contribution margin I (stumpage value; sales revenue minus logging costs) and contribution margin II (stumpage minus costs of silvicultural measures) - the stand development and stand valuation program FOWISIM was applied. The timber prices used were based on forest statistics and expert consultations. Newly available timber harvesting productivity models were integrated into the simulation model. The consequences of changes in the rotation period (decrease and increase) for the sustainability of the enterprise (felling quantities, growing stock, income, etc.) are demonstrated by means of the dynamic transition model FOBSI. Both models applied are deterministic ones with some stochastic elements and cover time increments of 1 or 10 years.
   The conclusions of the first study - no reduction of rotation periods - have been fully confirmed by the recent study. The model simulations showed only small differences between the net income values around the maximum value, which offers a wide range of two or three decades for the choice of the rotation. The development of price relations for dimensional assortments and logging cost relations tends to reduce the optimum length of rotation, while a decreasing timber price level increases the optimum rotation period. However, the changes of the examined factors (i.e. price relations, price level, and logging costs) over the last two decades have not been big enough to give any reason for decreasing or increasing the rotation period.

AB  - This article addresses one of the most comprehensive structural reforms in recent Norwegian administrative history: a merger of the employment and national insurance administrations, combined with more formal collaboration with the local government social services administration. The reform can be seen as a 'whole-of-government' initiative intended to increase the cocoordinative capacity of government to address 'wicked problems' cutting across existing policy areas and government levels in a multi-level governance system. This article examines the following questions: First, what characterizes the organizational thinking related to this reform? Second, how can we understand the reform process in terms of a transformative perspective combining instrumental, cultural and environmental features? Third, what are the potential effects and implications of the new structure for political control and institutional autonomy, for relations between central and local administrations, and for the main goals stated? The theory base for the analyses is a transformative approach.

AB  - The paper discusses social impact assessments (SIA) for mining projects in light of the international principles and guidelines for such assessments and the academic literature in the field. The data consist of environmental impact assessment (EIA) programmes and reports for six mining projects that have started up in northern Finland in the 2000s. A first observation is that the role of the SIAs in the EIA programmes and reports studied was quite minor: measured in number of pages, the assessments account for three or four percent of the total. This study analyses the data collection, research methodology and conceptual premises used in the SIAs. It concludes that the assessments do not fully meet the high standards of the international principles and guidelines set out for them: for example, elderly men are over-represented in the data and no efforts were made to identify and bring to the fore vulnerable groups. Moreover, the reliability of the assessments is difficult to gauge, because the qualitative methods are not described and where quantitative methods were used, details such as non-response rates to questionnaires are not discussed. At the end of the paper, the SIAs are discussed in terms of Jurgen Habermas' theory of knowledge interests, with the conclusion that the assessments continue the empirical analytical tradition of the social sciences and exhibit a technical knowledge interest.

AB  - Coastal pastures and other wet grasslands are important but decreasing breeding habitats for many waders (Charadrii). Since loss of suitable habitat is a major reason for population declines, protection and restoration of these habitats is crucial. Reduction of the often high rate of nest predation is a potentially important tool in future conservation work. Here, we focus on predators' use of raised structures in the landscape when searching for prey. Hooded crows (Corvus corone cornix) use man-made structures such as stone walls and barbed wire fences when foraging on coastal pastures in SW Sweden. However, few studies have examined wader breeding success in relation to man-made structures, and the extent to which such structures are used by searching nest predators. We measured the spatial distribution and rate of predation on wader nests in relation to such structures. Crows spent more time at or near man-made structures than expected by chance, but we found no significant difference in nest predation relative to distance from man-made structures. However, wader nests were placed farther away from man-made structures than expected by chance in two out of three years. Waders thus tend to avoid breeding close to man-made structures, which therefore reduce the suitable breeding area and probably also the local wader population size. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This report presents 20 years' of cancer incidence data by occupational group for the Nordic populations. The study covers the 10 million people aged 25-64 years at the time of the 1970 censuses in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, and the 1 million incident cancer cases diagnosed among these people during the subsequent 20 years. The project was undertaken as a cohort study with linkage of individual records based on the personal identification numbers used in all the Nordic countries.
   In the 1970 censuses, information on occupation for each economically active member of the household was provided in free text in self-administered questionnaires. The data were centrally coded and computerized in the statistical offices. Norway, Sweden, and Finland used the Nordic Classification of Occupations, while Denmark used a national coding scheme. However, all the data could be reclassified into 53 occupational groups and 1 group of economically inactive persons.
   Person-years at risk were accumulated from 1 January 1971 until the date of emigration, date of death or 31 December 1987 in Denmark, 1989 in Sweden, 1990 in Finland, and 1991 in Norway.
   The 4 countries all had nationwide registration of incident cancer cases during the entire study period. All incident cancer cases during the individual risk periods were included in the analysis. Despite minor differences between the countries, the international Classification of Diseases, 7th revision, formed the core basis for the diagnostic coding in all 4 countries. For the present study the incident cancer cases have been classified into 35 broad diagnostic groups.
   The observed number of cancer cases in each group of persons defined by country, gender, and occupation was compared with the expected number calculated from the age-, gender-, and period-specific person-years and the incidence rates for the national population. The result has been presented as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR), defined as the observed number of cases divided by the expected number and multiplied by 100. In the tables of this report, all the SIR values for which the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is below 100 are printed in green and all those for which the lower limit of the confidence interval is above 100 are printed in red.
   For all cancers combined, the study showed a wide variation among the men, from an SIR of 79 for farmers to 159 for waiters. The occupations with the highest SIR values also included seamen and workers producing beverages and tobacco. Among the women the SLR values varied from 83 for gardeners to 129 for tobacco workers. Low SIR values were found for farmers and teachers.
   Outdoor workers such as fishermen and gardeners had the highest risk of lip cancer, while the lowest risk was found among indoor workers such as physicians and artistic workers.
   Almost all pleural cancers are associated with asbestos exposure. Accordingly, plumbers, welders, mechanics, and seamen were the occupations with the highest risk. There was also an excess risk of pleural cancer in the occupational group of technical, chemical, physical, and biological workers, including, among others, engineers and chemists potentially exposed to asbestos.
   The wood workers included in the present study had the highest risk of nasal cancer. Most studies of nasal cancer have shown increased risks associated with exposure to wood dust, both for those in furniture making and for those exposed exclusively to soft wood. Nickel refinery workers are also known for their high risk of nasal cancer. In the present study they were included in the occupational group of smelting workers.
   Lung cancer was the most frequent cancer among men in the present study. Tobacco smoking is the major risk factor for this disease, but occupational exposures also play an important role. Waiters and tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer. Miners and guarry workers also had a high risk of lung cancer, which may be related to their exposure to silica dust and radon daughters. Among women, tobacco workers had the highest risk of lung cancer and farmers and gardeners had the lowest risk.
   Waiters had the highest risk of bladder cancer for men, and they were one of the groups at highest risk among the women. Chimney sweeps and male hairdressers also had high SIR values for bladder cancer. Chimney sweeps are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from chimney soot, and the carcinogenicity of these compounds is well documented. Almost all occupational groups with low SIR values for bladder cancer also had low SIR values for lung cancer, groups such as farmers, gardeners, and those working in pedagogical work.
   Exposure to the known hepatocarcinogens, Hepatitis B virus and aflatoxins is rare in the Nordic countries, and a large proportion of primary liver cancers can therefore be attributed to alcohol consumption. When primary liver cancer was classified by occupation, high risks were found for occupational groups with easy access to alcohol at the workplace or with cultural traditions for high alcohol consumption. Among men, waiters, journalists, cooks, beverage workers, and seamen had the highest risk. The lowest SIR values were found for farmers, forestry workers, teachers, wood workers, and gardeners.
   The risk of colon cancer has been related to sedentary work. The findings in the present study were in agreement, especially for men with this pattern, as journalists and physicians had the highest risk and outdoor workers such as farmers and forestry workers had the lowest risk.
   The occupational categories with the highest risks of breast cancer in the present study are accompanied by a university or equivalent education. This pattern is in agreement with a relatively late age at first birth among the well-educated Nordic women from the relevant birth cohorts.
   Malignant melanoma showed the same strong social gradient as cancers of the colon and breast. The major risk factor for malignant melanoma is intermittent sunlight exposure and sunburns of susceptible persons, which occur particularly during leisure time.
   The Nordic countries are well known for equity and free and equal access to health care for all citizens. The present study shows that the risk of cancer, even under these circumstances, is highly dependent on the person's position in society.

AB  - With the increasing use of forest biomass, concerns about negative impacts have been raised in the debate. The aim of this study was to find out the attitude of university students towards the energy use of forest-based biomass and how different areas of sustainable forest operations were addressed. The survey was conducted over two years (2018-2019) with both full-time students at university and distance learning students who study alongside their work. Background information such as gender, nationality and field of study was collected from students. Most of the students currently considered the energy use of forest biomass to be sustainable. Many replies stressed that the situation could change if the use of forests is increased from the present circumstances. The main factors mentioned that led to forest-based bioenergy being sustainable were positive felling balance, compliance with forest certification, use of waste fractions and implementation of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) directive, while the loss of biodiversity, over-exploitation of forests, C debt and the cascading principle were factors that led to forest-based bioenergy being unsustainable. Student background variables had no effect on responses except for the field of study.

AB  - Several fleets with various fishing strategies operate as a mixed fishery in the Bay of Biscay. Among the main fleets, bottom trawlers target Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and, together with gillnetters, they also catch hake (Merluccius merluccius). Trawling leads to average-size catches that are below the minimum landing size (MLS); such catches are discarded since they cannot be sold. These discards result in negative impacts on stock renewal, as most of them do not survive. This also results in an economic loss for both bottom trawlers and gillnetters since these discards represent a future loss of rent. This study, based on the 2009 and 2010 selectivity experiments at sea, assesses the short-and long-term bio-economic impacts of four experimental selective devices aimed at reducing N. norvegicus and M. merluccius discards over a 20-year simulation period. Tests were conducted at sea on a research trawler. Using the impact assessment model for fisheries management (IAM model), selectivity scenarios for trawlers in the Bay of Biscay were compared to a theoretical selective scenario of adopting an optimal device that catches only N. norvegicus and M. merluccius above MLS (9 cm and 27 cm total length, respectively). Costs and benefits were analyzed with the objective of finding the best compromise between a reduction in discards of undersized fish and a loss of valuable catches among the experimental devices. Selectivity scenarios show positive impacts on stocks but different economic impacts between fleets. The combination of a square mesh cylinder with a grid and square mesh panels gives the closest results to the theoretical scenario tested in terms of stock recovery and economic benefits. This experimental device leads to low economic losses in the short term and eventually to higher N. norvegicus yields, which would be favourable for fleets that greatly contribute to N. norvegicus fishing efforts.

AB  - The history of hunting and campaigning against vermin in Sweden has rarely been a task for historians. Instead, wildlife biological sciences and especially ecology dominate the field. One aim of this study is to show that hunting and managing predators had a greater impact on the peasantry's everyday life than shown in earlier research.
   As the very first Swedish laws reveal, the peasantry and the authorities have been united in their struggle to exterminate vermin ever since the Middle Ages. The wolf especially was a target. The extermination effort was encouraged by bounties but participation was also a universal duty - clerics and single women excepted. Everyone else - even the gentry - were supposed to take part in organized hunts. This centuries-old campaign was finally successful. In the middle of the 19th century, the wolf nearly became extinct and during the last century its range became confined to the far north of Sweden. Only about ten animals remained when the species was put under protection by the Swedish parliament in 1966.
   However, this animal, which was believed to be all but extinct, rebounded and began to expand its habitat again. The return of the wolf was now supported by governmental authorities and, according to recent surveys, a majority of the population. It created a great controversy between the rural population, especially those who lived close to the wolf habitat, and the authorities together with city-dwellers.
   This study begins by examining the scale of the Swedish wolf population in earlier periods. It shows that the wolf was common and that it caused serious trouble for farmers with livestock. During the 18th century, four children were killed by wolves. In around 1820/1821 ten more people were killed, but this time by a more or less domesticated wolf.
   The wolf was a detested animal not only because of the harm it caused, but also because of the myths that surrounded it. The brown bear originally evoked much the same hatred, but in popular mythology the bear was eventually transformed into a friendly being - although it remained in fact far more harmful to humans than the wolf.
   Problems caused by the contemporary population of around 230-315 wolves in Sweden seem small in comparison to those of previous eras. However, the controversy over the future of the wolf illuminates the gap between a decreasing rural population and a growing urban community, which also represents the centre of authority. Memories of the past might validate local concerns, supporting fears that an increased wolf population will do as much harm in the future as it did in the old days. More likely, it will also affect the gap between the authorities and the subjects/citizens/local communities. The authorities and local communities have been united in a struggle against the wolf for at least seven centuries and the ensuing break-up may encourage further polarization.

AB  - Conventional road accident risk is measured by the undesirable events/exposure ratio. Common exposure indicators are activity-based, so event-based exposure is needed to achieve event-based safety assessment. Furthermore, road safety simulation is a growing research field. The influence of some software parameters is still unknown. Besides, the use of simulation for exposure assessment is incipient. This paper aims to validate a preventive event-based risk indicator: traffic conflicts/encounters, extending to risk microsimulation by a novel procedure to identify encounters in VISSIM. We evaluated the safety of a roundabout by three independent methods: [i] Swedish Traffic Conflict Technique using T-Analyst tool, [ii] VISSIM/SSAM conflict analysis, and, [iii] exposure mapping using encounters. Findings show that, once calibrated the safety distance factor of VISSIM conflict areas at 0.5, we got a similar number of observed and simulated conflicts, similar severities and similar number of encounters, resulting in similar observed and simulated risk outcomes.

AB  - The patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity were investigated in Cucumaria frondosa, the most abundant sea cucumber in the North Atlantic, to assist in the management and conservation of this ecologically important marine invertebrate, which is the target of an emerging fishery. Mitochondrial DNA COI sequences of 334 C. frondosa were obtained and analyzed, mainly from its western North Atlantic range, where the commercial fishery is being developed, with complementary sampling in the mid- and eastern North Atlantic. Analysis of molecular variance showed no significant (P > 0.05) differences among subpopulations in the western region suggesting that it constitutes one panmictic population. The same analysis showed low, but significant differences between eastern and western Atlantic populations. Coalescent analyses using isolation with migration models and a Bayesian skyline plot indicated historical divergence and a general increase in population size prior to the last glacial maximum and highly asymmetric gene flow (nearly 100 times lower from west to east) between sea cucumbers from North America and Norway. Results suggest that subpopulations of C. frondosa within the western North Atlantic have been highly connected. We propose that aided by the high-connectivity local subpopulations can recover rapidly from natural (i.e., ice ages) or anthropogenic (i.e., overfishing) population declines through recruitment from deep refugia.

AB  - This paper is part of a project of studying benthic diatom biodiversity on marine coastal regions of Sweden with focus on rare and less known species. Two new species of Cocconeis Ehrenb. are described from Vrango, a small island in the west coast of Sweden. Both species were found as epiphytic on the green alga Ulva intestinalis L. Cocconeis magnoareolata Al-Handal, Riaux-Gob., R.Jahn & A.K.Wulff sp. nov. is a small species not exceeding 9 mu m in length and characterized by having large subquadrangular areolae on the sternum valve. Cocconeis vrangoensis Al-Handal & Riaux-Gob. sp. nov. appears similar to some taxa of the 'Cocconeis scutellum complex', but differs by its stria density on both valves and variable features of the areola and valvocopula ultrastructure. Detailed descriptions based on light and electron microscopy examination, a comparison with closely related taxa, as well as a description of the habitat of both species are here presented.

AB  - Foreign cases and experiences of horizontal cooperation mechanism for cross border water environment management will be introduced in this paper, including the joint implementation of the Convention on Water Quality in Great Lakes by the United States Government and the Government of Canada, the EU Water Framework Directive by EU member governments and the cross-border administrative cooperation within the basin, the cross-border watershed pollution control by the nine countries in Rhine Basin, and the inter-regional coordination and cooperation in the Thames River Basin. Besides, by taking reference of the horizontal coordination and cooperation between the relevant national departments for biological diversity in Norway, analysis and summary were made about these cases in terms of the coordination mechanisms, policies and legal coordination, overall planning, operation process, the scientific and technical support, and so on. The foreign successful experiences in trans-boundary water environment management include: (1) a strong coordinating institution which is able to exert influence on the economic decisions by governments involved with trans-boundary water bodies; (2) strict enforcement of the laws and regulations developed by all the governments involved; (3)coordinated planning which takes the trans-boundary water body as an ecosystem, unify management, and clear responsibilities and obligations for all related parties; (4)the need for an effective technology institution to provide scientific support for rational and sustainable trans-boundary water environment management; (5)continuous innovation and improvement of management technologies. These experiences have important implications for the domestic cross-border water environment management. For the trans-boundary water environment management, the establishment of and innovation in the trans-boundary water management must be compatible with existing economic and social structures and mechanisms; the management of trans-boundary water is a process of constant modification, improvement and complementation; strict enforcement of laws is the guarantee of effective management; academic counseling and support is extremely important for the management; the fully integrated river basin management is the only route leading to success; the international and inter-sectoral cooperation under the same overall framework is an effective way for the trans boundary water management; the transboundary water management is a long-term, arduous task.

AB  - The epiphytic vegetation on 24 pollarded trees of Fraxinus excelsior at the farm Grinde, Leikanger, western Norway was investigated. Each trunk was divided into a basal zone, a middle zone and a top zone. In each zone the four different aspects were analysed (12 sampling units from each trunk). Within a total of 276 sampling units, 162 taxa were recorded (99 lichens, 56 bryophytes, 7 vascular plants). The trunks were covered mainly by an old, thick and occasionally swollen bark, but decaying wood did not occur. Their habitats were different, and each trunk was classified into one of four categories: open meadow. wooded hay meadow, deciduous wood, and spruce plantation. A climate station was established in each habitat to measure important parameters. The floristic and environmental data were analysed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The Aoristic data were classified into eight TWINSPAN groups that have been taken into account in the CCA diagrams. At Grinde all the pollarded trunks grew under fairly homogeneous conditions during a more extensive agricultural period until about 1962. The deciduous wood developed by tree colonization on old meadows and wooded hay meadows, whilst spruce has been planted in a small part of the area. Floristic differences in the epiphytic vegetation between the four different habitats were found, which suggests that changes in the vegetation have developed during the last two or three decades. The spruce plantation was the must shady habitat having a very sparse epiphytic vegetation, mainly remnants from vegetation established during more open area conditions.

AB  - Background: While increased mortality in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is well established, there is conflicting evidence on the association between osteoarthritis (OA) and mortality. Our aim was to estimate all-cause mortality in Swedish patients with RA and OA compared with the general population.
   Methods: Cohort study of the population of Skane region, Sweden (1.3 million), based on physicians' diagnostic codes in a mandatory register covering all health care. We included all subjects aged >= 45 years who between 1998 and 2012 consulted any physician at least once. We identified those who received a diagnosis of RA, knee OA, or hip OA. We followed all subjects until death, relocation outside Skane region, or end of 2013, and analyzed data using Cox proportional hazard regression with attained age as time scale.
   Results: We identified 8,067 patients with RA, 51,939 with knee OA and 29,442 with hip OA among 524,136 in the population aged >= 45 years. The mortality rates adjusted for sex, socioeconomic status, and comorbidities were elevated for RA, hazard ratio 1.86 (95% confidence interval = 1.78, 1.94) but not in knee or hip OA compared with the general population seeking health care, hazard ratio 0.87 (0.85, 0.89) and 0.90 (0.87, 0.92), respectively. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the conclusion of no increased mortality in OA.
   Conclusions: In Sweden, RA is associated with about doubled mortality rate, but we found no increased mortality in patients with knee and hip OA. Possible selection of those seeking physician care for knee or hip pain and/or OA management in health care are plausible explanations.

AB  - Understanding the responses of aquatic animals to temperature variability is essential to predict impacts of future climate change and to inform conservation and management. Most ectotherms such as fish are expected to adjust their behaviour to avoid extreme temperatures and minimize acute changes in body temperature. In coastal Skagerrak, Norway, sea surface temperature (SST) ranges seasonally from 0 to over 20 degrees C, representing a challenge to the fish community which includes cold-, cool- and warm-water affinity species.
   By acoustically tracking 111 individuals of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, pollack Pollachius pollachius and ballan wrasse Labrus bergylta in 2015-2018, we examined how coexisting species within a fish community adjusted their behaviour (i.e. vertical distribution in the water column and habitat selection) to cope with the thermal variation.
   Mixed-effect models showed that thermal preference was a main driver of behaviour and habitat use of the fish community in a southern Norwegian fjord. Cod used colder waters, compared with pollack and ballan wrasse. Increases in SST during summer were associated with the use of deeper, colder waters by cod, especially by larger individuals, and conversely with the occupancy of shallower areas by pollack and ballan wrasse. During winter, when SST dropped and the thermal stratification reversed, pollack and ballan wrasse moved to deeper, relatively warmer areas, while cod selected shallower, colder habitats. Although habitat selection was affected by temperature, species-specific habitat selection was observed even when temperature was similar throughout habitats.
   This study shows how cohabiting fish species respond to thermal heterogeneity, suggesting that (a) temperature regulates the access to the different depths and habitats and (b) behavioural plasticity may be an important factor for coping with temperature variability and potentially for adaptation to climate change.

AB  - The projected climate change for Norway through the 21st century predicts that the temperature will increase significantly. Events with heavy rainfall will be more intense and occur more frequently. Rain floods will increase in magnitude and also occur more frequently. Extreme flooding and heavy rain will significantly impact the sediment dynamics in rivers. In the mountain areas, floods are often associated with erosion, transport and deposition of coarse sediment along the streams. These processes are related to bed load transport and pose a hazard in addition to the elevated water discharge and have to be included in management plans for river basins. This article studies the bed load delivery from sources that contribute the most to the sediment budget in the Gudbrandsdalslagen river basin during the large magnitude floods in 2011 and 2013. More than 100 debris slides and debris flow were triggered in the tributary river Veikleai by the heavy rain and snowmelt during these floods. The volume of the contribution from debris flows and erosion and deposition of the river bed was determined by subtracting digital elevation models acquired during repeated airborne LIDAR surveys. In the river Dorja the supply of sediment from a number of debris flows caused extensive aggradation and channel changes. In their new position, lateral erosion by these channels triggered slides on the adjacent slopes. The contributing volumes of debris flows, lateral erosion, and river bed erosion and deposition were determined from the LIDAR surveys. Relations obtained from studies of sediment transport in modern glacier rivers were used to obtain estimates of the ratio of bed load versus suspended load derived from the Pleistocene moraine deposits. Several monitoring stations using conventional methods for measuring bed load and suspended load recorded very large volumes of sediment delivery during both of the extreme floods. The results of the study may be used to identify necessary locations for check-dams and erosion protection works in order to adapt to climate change.

AB  - Questions We aim to answer three questions: (a) what are the effects of canopy shading of different tree species on seed germination of eight understorey grassland species? (b) how is plant species' occurrence in understorey communities affected by differences in canopy cover and does that depend on tree species composition? and (c) are there mechanistic links between the effects of trees on species' germination and their occurrence in the understorey plant community? Location Semi-natural wooded pastures in the biosphere reserve ostra Vatterbranterna, southern Sweden. Methods In this study, we examined the germination of eight grassland plant species in a seed sowing experiment under natural conditions in the field. Seeds were sown beneath and outside the canopy of two tree species within 48 plots split up by four wooded pasture sites. We combined observed germination responses with a plant community survey to assess the effects of canopy cover in relation to tree species composition on plant community responses. We analysed these data in relation to species' seed mass and vegetative shade tolerance. Results Shade-tolerant species germinated better beneath compared to outside tree canopies, without any clear advantage of large-seeded over small-seeded species. As expected, species' shade tolerance was also positively related to canopy cover within the understorey plant community. Importantly, we found strong tree species-specific effects of canopy shading on the species' germination response, but not on their presence within the plant community. However, optimal canopy cover conditions for germination and for the mature plants differed across grassland species and depended on tree species. Conclusions Our results show that different tree species play key ecosystem engineering roles in shaping wooded grassland plant community composition at the germination stage. Management practices favouring specific tree species may therefore be highly relevant for targeted biodiversity conservation of wooded semi-natural grasslands.

AB  - Building new power lines is required to satisfy increasing demands for the transmission of electricity, and at the same time the road network is expanding. To provide guidelines for the routing of new power lines and roads, it is essential to test whether linear features deter or attract movements of animals in different landscape settings. Using GPS relocation data from 151 moose (Alces alces L.) in central Norway, we tested for barrier and corridor effects of roads, power lines and rivers and accounted for forest cover, the topographical orientation of linear features and the placement of other nearby linear features. We predicted step selection probabilities for different movement options at varying distances from linear features and linear feature combinations. Barrier and corridor effects of linear features altered moose movements, although effects were minor compared to the effects of topography and forest cover. Moose did not avoid crossing power lines, unless the placement of power lines along contour lines impeded movements across them. In contrast, moose avoided crossing of roads and rivers in forests. Moose more likely moved along linear features when getting closer to linear features. Barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/river combinations compared to single linear features. Likewise, the barrier and corridor effects were higher for road/power line combinations, but not power line/river combinations compared to single linear features, when moose were close to the edge of those features. The inconsistent pattern could be due to the low sample size. We found indications of higher disturbance potential of roads compared to power lines and rivers. Managing vegetation in power line rights-of-way to provide abundant browse could counteract possible disturbance, while wildlife overpasses could mitigate road fragmentation effects.

AB  - Waste is a valuable commodity and remains a livelihood source for waste pickers in the global South. Waste to Energy (WtoE) is often described as alternative to landfilling, as it provides cheap fuel while making waste disappear. In some European cities, this method has evolved into an impediment, slowing down the adoption of more sustainable technologies and waste prevention. These plants typically strain municipal budgets and provide fewer jobs than recycling and composting, thereby inhibiting the development of small-scale local recycling businesses. We applied the idea of 'waste regime' with an interdisciplinary and situated lens to provide insights to the following questions: How do different political developments in Brazil and Sweden, frame and reframe waste incineration and energy recovery, in the context of sustainability and waste management on local, regional and national levels? What forms of resistance against WtoE exist and what are the arguments of these protagonists? We evaluated the impact of WtoE and compare it with other waste management options with regard to CO2 balances and general environmental and social impacts. We conclude by suggesting more socially and environmentally appropriate ways of waste management, particularly for the context of global South cities.

AB  - This mixed method study examines Finnish pupils' (N = 825; age groups 12-13, 15-16) views on the place of religion in the public school. Religious landscape in Finnish society has changed significantly in recent years, as the `new' diversity (Vertovec 2015) has supplemented the `old' one. The role of institutionalized religion has diminished, whereas globalism, secularism and an interest in new religious movements have been on the rise. The traditionally strong Evangelical Lutheranism has become a more cultural, secular feature underlying societal history and nationalism. In this changing situation, it is important to obtain knowledge about how the pupils themselves see the position of religion in the public education system. In this article, we examine pupils' views on the place of religion both as a formal part of the National Curriculum and as a part of social interaction and physical environment, and whether background factors explain variance in their conceptions.

AB  - The use of electric-powered vehicles (EV) is experiencing a boom in some countries. Much research has been conducted on the technology per se; however, there is a research gap regarding institutional spatial planning practice concerning EVs. Here, an empirical analysis was made of planners' interpretations of opportunities and obstacles to integration of EVs in southern Sweden. The results revealed a lack of interplay between local and regional administrations and showed that the agenda is run by individual bureaucrats rather than being based on official strategies. Moreover, there appears to be a lack of horizontal interplay within some organisations, while new arenas are being formed by actors within and outside government. The reason for formation of such external EV networks may be a single actor not being able to push the issue forward alone, due to a fragmented organisation, or a lack of clear external task formulation at central government level.

AB  - We studied habitat choice, distribution and reproductive success in the Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca in relation to the spatial structure of a fragmented forest area. Two hierarchical levels of forest habitat structure were used: (I) forest patch size (macrohabitat) and (2) vegetative structure within forest patches (microhabitat), in spring, both males and females settled preferentially in large and medium-sized forest stands (>1 ha) where breeding density was also higher than in small stands (less than or equal to 1 ha). Stands less than or equal to 5 ha were occupied later and the proportion of unpaired males was higher there than in large stands (>5 ha), The known age distributions of breeding birds and breeding success were independent of forest patch size, Nest predation rate was not associated with Stand size or nest distance from the forest edge, The preference of breeding birds for large forest patches was presumably related to the higher amount of resources (nest sites, mates, food) a large patch can offer for reproduction compared with a small patch, At the microhabitat level, territories of old males were characterized by relatively more deciduous trees that contained more invertebrate food than coniferous tree-dominated territories of yearling males. The reproductive success of old males, as measured by the number of fledged young per male, was higher than that of yearling males, This suggests that the larger body size and blacker plumage of old males possibly contributed to male dominance and that old males excluded younger males from preferred habitats through territorial behaviour, Our results suggest that habitat choice of the Pied Flycatcher was affected by both micro-and macrohabitat, On the basis of settlement pattern, density and reproductive success, the distribution of Pied Flycatchers across forest stands of different sizes followed the ideal-free distribution model, whereas at the microhabitat level, age-related unequal distribution of males followed the ideal-despotic model of Fretwell and Lucas.

AB  - Increasing concentrations of organic matter ( OM) in surface waters have been noted over large parts of the boreal/nemoral zone in Europe and North America. This has raised questions about the causes and the likelihood of further increases. A number of drivers have been proposed, including temperature, hydrology, as well as SO42 - and Cl (-) deposition. The data reported so far, however, have been insufficient to define the relative importance of different drivers in landscapes where they interact. Thirty-five years of monthly measurements of absorbance and chemical oxygen demand ( COD), two common proxies for OM, from 28 large Scandinavian catchments provide an unprecedented opportunity to resolve the importance of hypothesized drivers. For 21 of the catchments, there are 18 years of total organic carbon (TOC) measurements as well. Despite the heterogeneity of the catchments with regards to climate, size and land use, there is a high degree of synchronicity in OM across the entire region. Rivers go from widespread trends of decreasing OM to increasing trends and back again three times in the 35-year record. This synchronicity in decadal scale oscillations and long-term trends suggest a common set of dominant OM drivers in these landscapes. Here, we use regression models to test the importance of different potential drivers. We show that flow and SO42 - together can predict most of the interannual variability in OM proxies, up to 88% for absorbance, up to 78% for COD. Two other candidate drivers, air temperature and Cl (-) , add little explanatory value. Declines in anthropogenic SO42 - since the mid-1970s are thus related to the observed OM increases in Scandinavia, but, in contrast to many recent studies, flow emerges as an even more important driver of OM variability. Stabilizing SO42 - levels also mean that hydrology is likely to be the major driver of future variability and trends in OM.

AB  - Parcelisation-induced fragmentation is a common development trend in forest ownership in many Western countries. In Finland, the idea of a jointly-owned forest (JOF) has been introduced to facilitate the effective management of forest resource in parcelised and fragmented forest owning contexts. A JOF is an area of combined holdings intended for the practice of sustainable forestry for the benefit of the shareholders. The establishment of JOFs alters the core idea of ownership as it diminishes individual forest owners' ability to control their holdings. We suggest that the feelings of ownership are important, yet under researched, aspects in the development and operation of JOFs. In this study, we focus on these ownership feelings by asking what kind of owner types are associated with JOFs. We build a qualitative typology of four owner types which we named active owners, investors, legacy fosterers, and detached owners. Our study contributes to the discussion on JOFs by showing that shared ownership can incorporate a variety of owner types with different ownership feelings. We claim that the need to understand these different owner types is important to facilitate the development of tools and policy instruments that will contribute to the establishment and management of jointly-owned forests.

AB  - Studying the uppermost structure of the subsurface is a necessary part of solving many practical problems (exploration of minerals, groundwater studies, geoengineering, etc.). The practical application of active seismic methods for these purposes is not always possible for different reasons, such as logistical difficulties, high cost of work, and a high level of seismic and acoustic noise. That is why developing and improving passive seismic methods is one of the important problems in applied geophysics. In our study, we describe a way of improving the quality of empirical Green's functions (EGFs), evaluated from high-frequency ambient seismic noise, by using the advanced technique of cross-correlation function stacking in the time domain (in this paper we use term "high-frequency" for frequencies higher than 1 Hz). The technique is based on the global optimization algorithm, in which the optimized objective function is a signal-to-noise ratio of an EGF, retrieved at each iteration. In comparison to existing techniques, based, for example, on weight stacking of cross-correlation functions, our technique makes it possible to significantly increase the signal-to-noise ratio and, therefore, the quality of the EGFs. The technique has been tested with the field data acquired in an area with a high level of industrial noise (Pyhasalmi Mine, Finland) and in an area with a low level of anthropogenic noise (Kuusamo Greenstone Belt, Finland). The results show that the proposed technique can be used for the extraction of EGFs from high-frequency seismic noise in practical problems of mapping of the shallow subsurface, both in areas with high and low levels of high-frequency seismic noise.

CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Environmental Geochemistry
AB  - IGCP Project 259, International Geochemical Mapping, and its successor IGCP Project 360, Global Geochemical Baselines, aim at a global geochemical map, which is becoming increasingly an environmental concern. As a pilot survey for Project 259 overbank sediment, till, humus and river water were sampled from 49 large catchment basins in Fennoscandia.
   The deeper layers of overbank sediment were deposited hundreds of years ago and reflect natural preindustrial geochemical background. In this survey the geochemistry of one sample of overbank sediment was found to represent catchment basins up to 7000 km(2) in size, and to correspond to that of composites of 6-20 random till samples taken from the same basin. The surface layers were deposited recently and reflect pollution in the basin. Distinct pollution was detected in some basins with mining activities and industries. A large province with high Pb contents in the southern parts of Sweden and Norway is caused by atmospheric deposition. In some basins metal contents from both anthropogenic and natural sources and exceeding values considered (phyto)toxic were measured. According to other surveys 30% of the river plains in Europe are severely polluted, and many of these plains have toxic contents of heavy metals. Therefore, and because population is concentrated to river valleys, it is of great importance to determine the degree of, and future threats from this pollution. Overbank sediment is a most suitable medium for this purpose, because it can be used in basins ranging from a few up to thousands of km(2) to determine the geochemical background (deep layers), pollution history (profile sample), degree of pollution (deep vs surface sample), and for monitoring change.

AB  - The damage to trees that is caused by ungulate species is a natural result of their presence in ecosystems. High densities of ungulates may have a negative effect on biodiversity and the regeneration and survival of trees. The aim of this study was to identify the factors that affect the probability of the occurrence of damage in forest stands as a result of the presence of European bison (Bison bonasus). We collected data on the presence of European bison in given locations in winter and spring of 2020; this data also concerned damage to trees, forest stand characteristics, and densities of other ungulates.
   European bison was the most important debarking agent. Within the home range of the European bison, 344 forest stands were damaged, which represented 43.5% of all stands. The most frequent damage was bark stripping, 35.9%. The most important factors in terms of bark damage were canopy cover, dominating tree species, dominating tree age, and distance to a feeder. More debarking occurred in stands with open canopies, and coniferous species were more likely to be damaged than broadleaved species. Frequency of damage in forest stands with dominating Norway spruce was higher than 0.5, whereas for forest stands with silver fir and Scots pine it was over 0.4. Other coniferous species also presented a relatively high proportion of damage (0.38). The results of our study indicate a need for rational damage-prevention measures in the ranges of other free-living wisent populations that live in managed forests.

AB  - This article is a sports biography of Bengt-Erik Grahn, a prominent figure in Swedish alpine skiing during the 1960s. By discussing representations of Bengt-Erik Grahn in the Swedish daily press and comparing these with his own life story and memories from his time as an elite alpine skier, the objective is to study the cultural identities that appear in relation to his sports career. Bengt-Erik Grahn grew up in a Sami family in Kittelfjall in the Swedish province of Vasterbotten and spent his early school years at the Sami nomad school in Tarnaby. Due to his Sami background and position as a representative of the Swedish national alpine team, the article focuses in particular on how identity constructs such as "Swedishness" and "Saminess" appear in the source material. For instance, it is argued that his Sami identity served an important function when Bengt-Erik Grahn was depicted as a Swedish sports hero. In addition, his Sami background, meager way of life, odd sporting outfit (a hand-knitted wool sweater and hat) and profession as a forestry worker were all characteristics presented in the press coverage as distinguishing the Swedish sporting identity of amateurism from what was perceived as a jet-set and playboy mentality represented by the professional Continental European alpine skiers. However, simultaneously with this idealization, Bengt-Erik Grahn's Simi heritage was also used as a stereotype to explain his aggressive and risky tactics, which often resulted in crashes in the most important competitions. Bengt-Erik Grahn's own life story in several ways offers nuance to the perceptions of the daily press. In particular, it reveals the challenges facing Bengt-Erik Grahn in his youth as he chose to focus on a career in alpine skiing. For example, there were strong expectations that a Sami skier should devote him- or herself to cross-country skiing, which was considered a traditional Sami sport at the time. Alpine skiing, on the other hand, was perceived as modern and alien to Sami sports culture. In that way, Bengt-Erik Grahn's odd and independent way of skiing appears in his life story as a demonstration of empowerment. Despite the prevailing culture, he chose the sport and how to perform it entirely on his own.

AB  - The dynamics between places and innovation ecosystems and the role that cross-sector partnerships (CSPs) can play in regenerating places and in revitalizing innovation ecosystems remain poorly theorized. In this study we use two cases - Humber (UK) and Southwest Finland - to develop a conceptual model that demonstrates the vicious and virtuous dynamics between places and innovation ecosystems. We show that CSPs can act as herding spaces - arenas where actors from different organizations get together to address a common purpose and connect with the institutional context - and alter these vicious and virtuous dynamics. Specifically, our findings shed light on four mechanisms that enable CSPs to act as herding spaces and so to help break away from the vicious (vitalizing role) and reinforce the virtuous (nurturing role) dynamics between places and innovation ecosystems: recognition of place-based challenges, improvement or utilization of place attachment, development of purpose ecosystems, and direct engagement in place regeneration activities.

AB  - The present study investigated how the abundance and sexual reproduction of herbs and grasses relates to the presence of shrubs of Rosa dumalis in three semi-natural pastures in Sweden. Shrubs may affect grassland plants negatively by competition, positively by serving as grazing refuge, or neutrally. At different distances from shrubs of R. dumalis, data were collected on plant abundance, frequency of reproductive shoots, vegetation height and litter depth. In one grassland, data were collected on seedling density and frequency of reproductive shoots in the presence and absence of grazing. The shrubs functioned as grazing refuges with taller vegetation, deeper litter and higher probability of reproduction by plants. The overall number of plant species remained the same at all distances from shrubs. Most species showed a neutral relationship with shrubs. Proportionately, 0.08-0.26 of the species showed a negative pattern to shrubs and 0.14-0.30 a positive pattern. Seedling density was negatively correlated with litter depth and peaked at 60-90 cm from shrubs. Establishment of seedlings of small-seeded species was negatively related to shrubs probably because of thicker litter layer close to shrubs. The observed patterns were compared with different functional traits, such as Ellenberg values, plant height, growth form and Raunkiaer life form. Plant height from data in the literature was the trait that best explained the relationship of plant species to shrubs because tall species were more common in proximity to shrubs. It was concluded that shrubs increase the heterogeneity in grasslands and that intensive shrub-clearing may negatively affect biodiversity.

AB  - We expanded the existing one-dimensional MyLake model by incorporating a vertically resolved sediment diagenesis module and developing a reaction network that seamlessly couples the water column and sediment biogeochemistry. The application of the MyLake-Sediment model to boreal Lake Vansjo illustrates the model's ability to reproduce daily water quality variables and predict sediment-water column exchange fluxes over a long historical period. In prognostic scenarios, we assessed the importance of sediment processes and the effects of various climatic and anthropogenic drivers on the lake's biogeochemistry and phytoplankton dynamics. First, MyLake-Sediment was used to simulate the potential impacts of increasing air temperature on algal growth and water quality. Second, the key role of ice cover in controlling water column mixing and biogeochemical cycles was analyzed in a series of scenarios that included a fully ice-free end-member. Third, in another end-member scenario P loading from the watershed to the lake was abruptly halted. The model results suggest that remobilization of legacy P stored in the bottom sediments could sustain the lake's primary productivity on a time scale of several centuries. Finally, while the majority of management practices to reduce excessive algal growth in lakes focus on reducing external P loads, other efforts rely on the addition of reactive materials that sequester P in the sediment. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of ferric iron additions in decreasing the dissolved phosphate efflux from the sediment and, consequently, limit phytoplankton growth in Lake Vansjo.

AB  - To explore nurses' practices and influences in relation to urinary incontinence following stroke, in the UK, Sweden and China.
   Urinary incontinence following stroke is common, under-recognised and poorly researched. Before appropriate rehabilitation interventions can be developed, an understanding of nurses' current management approaches and cultural influences is required.
   Qualitative.
   Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with ten registered nurses from at least four different stroke units in three countries (n = 30). Interviews were carried out in the participants' first language, using an agreed interview guide. Following translation, thematic analysis focusing on manifest meaning was undertaken, using an iterative approach involving electronic and face-to-face discussions.
   The consequence of only superficial assessment was no systematic identification of types or causes of urinary incontinence and no individualised plans developed. A process model of practice, common to all three countries, was identified for stroke survivors with urinary incontinence. Routine core activities were followed by the palliative pathway (most frequently), where urinary incontinence was contained to protect the stroke survivors' safety and ensure social continence; or the rehabilitative route (more rarely), where simple continence promoting activities were implemented with the purpose of facilitating recovery of bladder function.
   Nurses' reactively manage urinary incontinence following stroke, adopting a routinised approach based on local custom and practice. Promotion of urinary continence is not a priority area of stroke rehabilitation for nurses in western or eastern countries.
   The dearth of evidence-based interventions available to rehabilitate bladder function following stroke means that stroke nursing practice is an experience-based endeavour. This study explains the nurses' focus on containment and social continence and highlights the need to systematically assess stroke survivors' bladder rehabilitation needs, identify types of urinary incontinence and adopt appropriate urinary continence promoting practices.

AB  - Palaeoclimate records from late-Holocene sediments in Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the USA, provide evidence that both decadal to centennial climate variability and European colonization had severe impacts on the watershed and estuary. Using pollen and dinoflagellate cysts as proxies for mid-Atlantic regional precipitation, estuarine salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) during the last 2300 years, we identified four dry intervals, centred on AD 50 (P1/D1), AD 1000 (P2/D2), AD 1400 (P3) and AD 1600 (P4). Two centennial-scale events, P1/D1 and P2/D2, altered forest composition and led to increased salinity and DO levels in the estuary. Intervals P3 and P4 lasted several decades, leading to decreased production of pine pollen. Periods of dry mid-Atlantic climate correspond to 'megadroughts' identified from tree-ring records in the southeastern and central USA. The observed mid-Atlantic climate variability may be explained by changes in atmospheric circulation resulting in longer-term, perhaps amplified, intervals of meridional flow. After European colonization in the early seventeenth century, forest clearance for agriculture, timber and urbanization altered estuarine water quality, with dinoflagellate assemblages indicating reduced DO and increased turbidity.

AB  - In an effort to ameliorate the impacts of climate change, forest managers in Central Europe increasingly turn to conifer species that produce higher yields and are better adapted to projected future climatic conditions. Though small mammals are an important component of the forest ecosystem, the impacts of enriching native broadleaf forests with conifers on small mammal communities are not well understood. We conducted mark-recapture surveys of small mammals to ascertain differences in their community structure among stands of two conifers (native Norway spruce Picea abies and non-native Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii) and the dominant broadleaf in the region, European beech (Fagus sylvatica). After estimating the density of two common species, the yellow-necked mouse Apodemus flavicollis and bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus, we found that the population density of each is positively related to the proportion of beech and negatively to the proportion of conifers in each stand, though these effects of stand composition are smaller than the positive effect of herb cover. Increasing Norway spruce proportion reduced monthly survival of small mammals, while Douglas fir proportion had a positive effect on survival. We conclude that the two conifer species have similar impacts on small mammal density, though overall small mammal survival was significantly lower on plots with Norway spruce. This suggests that increasing the proportion of Douglas fir at the expense of Norway spruce may be possible without significantly changing local patterns of small mammal population density, but further research is necessary to elucidate the exact impacts of these two conifer species on small mammal demography and behavior.
