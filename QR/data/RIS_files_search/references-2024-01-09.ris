TI  - Heterogeneous response of circumboreal wildfire risk to climate change since the early 1900s
PY  - 2009
AB  - We investigated changes in wildfire risk over the 1901� 2002 (AD) period with an analysis of broad-scale patterns of July monthly drought code (MDC) variability on 28 forested ecoregions of the North American and Eurasian continents. The MDC is an estimate of the net effect of changes in evapotranspiration and precipitation on cumulative moisture depletion in soils, and is well correlated with annual fire statistics across the circumboreal (explaining 25‐61% of the variance in regional area burned). We used linear trend and regime shift analyses to investigate (multi-) decadal changes in MDC and percentage area affected by drought, and kernel function for analysis of temporal changes in the occurrence rates of extreme drought years. Our analyses did not reveal widespread patterns of linear increases in dryness through time as a response to rising Northern Hemisphere land temperatures. Instead, we found heterogeneous patterns of drought severity changes that were inherent to the nonuniformly distributed impacts of climate change on dryness. Notably, significant trends toward increasing summer moisture in southeastern and southwestern boreal Canada were detected. The diminishing wildfire risk in these regions is coherent with widely reported decreases in area burned since about 1850, as reconstructed by dendrochronological dating of forest stands. Conversely, we found evidence for increasing percentage area affected by extreme droughts in Eurasia ( 10.57% per decade; Po0.05) and occurrence rates of extreme drought years in Eurasian taiga (centered principally on the Okhotsk‐Manchurian taiga, P 50.07). Although not statistically significant, temporal changes in occurrence rates are sufficiently important spatially to be paid further attention. The absence of a linear trend in MDC severity, in conjunction with the presence of an increase in the occurrence rate of extreme drought years, suggest that fire disturbance regimes in the Eurasian taiga could be shifting toward being increasingly pulse dependent.

TI  - Disappearing Lakes in Semiarid Northern China: Drivers and Environmental Impact
PY  - 2013
AB  - The widely distributed 241 lakes in the semiarid region of China bordering the Asian Gobi desert provide an irreplaceable environment for the region’s human inhabitants, livestock, and wildlife. Using satellite imagery, we tracked the changing areas of lake water and freshwater/salty marshes during the last four decades and correlated observed changes with concurrent temperature and precipitation. On average, most of the lake size groups across different subregions showed a reduction in area from the 1970s to 2000s, particularly from the 1990s to 2000s (P < 0.05); 121 of the 241 lakes became fully desiccated at the end of the 2000s. Our results confirmed the prevalence of drought-induced lake shrinkage and desiccation at a regional scale, which has been sustained since the year 2000, and highlighted an accelerated shrinkage of individual lakes by human water use in the agriculture-dominated regions. Lake waters have become salinized, and freshwater marsh has been replaced by salty marsh, threatening the p...

TI  - PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BOREAL SPRUCE SWAMP FORESTS: CLOSED DOORS AND WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY
PY  - 2003
AB  - Previous studies point to biogeographic (i.e., evolutionary and demographic) and ecological (i.e., habitat differentiation and disturbance) processes as the most important causes of spatial variation in species richness and species composition (occurrence and abundance). We examined patterns of variation in vascular plant and bryophyte species composition among 150 1-m2 plots distributed semi-randomly over 11 Norwegian boreal swamp-forest localities. Swamp forests are species-rich islands in an otherwise species-poor forest landscape. For each plot, 53 environmental variables were recorded. By using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), we found that ∼20% of the explainable variation in species composition was due to swamp-forest affiliation, in addition to the ∼35% that was due to environmental differences between swamp-forest localities. The uniqueness of the species composition of each swamp forest was also emphasized by analyses of compositional dissimilarity. Plots were significantly more dissimilar if situated in different swamp forests than if situated in the same swamp forest, after environmental differences had been corrected for. The lack of any significant relationship between compositional dissimilarity and geographical distance or swamp-forest area indicated that this pattern was not mainly due to recent successful dispersal and establishment events. We argue that the distinctness of swamp forests, in particular, those richer in species and soil nutrients, is due to a combination of factors among which randomness in establishment in gaps (“windows of opportunity”) and persistence of established clonal species are important. Furthermore, we argue that the probability for successful recruitment may have been higher in previous time periods than it is today. The unique combination of important determinants of the species composition in boreal swamp forests supports the view that there exists a diversity of explanations for diversity, and that these, to a large extent, are system and/or area specific.

TI  - Atmospheric circulation and its impact on ice phenology in Scandinavia
PY  - 2004
AB  - Atmospheric circulation is important in affecting surface climate and ecosystems. In this study, we compared the impact of north-atlantic and regional atmospheric circulation, as represented by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and a set of regional circulation indices, on ice phenology of 50 Scandinavian lakes. Both ice freeze and ice break-up dates were coherent over the whole region and were significantly correlated with both types of circulation indices. Correlations were especially strong for regional circulation indices. The application of regional indices, here for the first time related with ice data over a large area, allowed the determination of the type (i.e. meridional/ zonal wind and cyclonic/anticyclonic conditions) of atmospheric circulation influencing the ice phenology. The results suggest that regional circulation indices are very useful tools, in addition to global circulation, to improve the understanding of the interaction between ecosystem processes and climate.

TI  - Lasting behavioural responses of brown bears to experimental encounters with humans
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. Some large carnivore populations are increasing in Europe and North America, and minimizing interactions between people and carnivores is a major management task. Analysing the effects of human disturbance on wildlife from a predator–prey perspective is also of conservation interest, because individual behavioural responses to the perceived risk of predation may ultimately influence population distribution and demography. 2. The Scandinavian brown bear population provides a good model to study the interactions between an expanding large carnivore population, and people who use forests extensively for professional and recreational activities. We experimentally approached 52 GPS-collared brown bears (293 approaches on foot) from 2006 to 2011, to document the reaction of bears and quantify the effect of disturbance on bear movements. 3. None of the bears reacted aggressively to the observers. Although the location of the animals was known, bears were usually in quite concealed spots and were physically detected in only 16% of the approaches (seen in 42 approaches; heard in 6). However, the bears altered their daily movement patterns after the approaches. Bears increased movement at night-time and moved less at daytime, which was most visible in days 1 and 2 after the approaches, altering their foraging and resting routines. 4. Synthesis and applications. We provide experimental evidence on the effect of human disturbance on a large carnivore. The lack of aggressive reactions to approaching observers reinforces the idea that European brown bears generally avoid people, although bears can respond aggressively if they feel threatened (e.g. when wounded). However, the movement patterns of the bears changed after disturbance. Separating large carnivores and people temporally and spatially is an important goal for conservation and management. Conserving the shrub cover that provides concealment to the carnivores and keeping people away from the most densely vegetated spots in the forests is a way to avoid encounters between carnivores and people, therefore promoting human safety and carnivore conservation.

TI  - Managing Forests and Fire in Changing Climates
PY  - 2013
AB  - With projected climate change, we expect to face much more forest fire in the coming decades. Policy-makers are challenged not to categorize all fires as destructive to ecosystems simply because they have long flame lengths and kill most of the trees within the fire boundary. Ecological context matters: In some ecosystems, high-severity regimes are appropriate, but climate change may modify these fire regimes and ecosystems as well. Some undesirable impacts may be avoided or reduced through global strategies, as well as distinct strategies based on a forest's historical fire regime.

TI  - Behavioural responses to human-induced environmental change.
PY  - 2010
AB  - The initial response of individuals to human-induced environmental change is often behavioural. This can improve the performance of individuals under sudden, large-scale perturbations and maintain viable populations. The response can also give additional time for genetic changes to arise and, hence, facilitate adaptation to new conditions. On the other hand, maladaptive responses, which reduce individual fitness, may occur when individuals encounter conditions that the population has not experienced during its evolutionary history, which can decrease population viability. A growing number of studies find human disturbances to induce behavioural responses, both directly and by altering factors that influence fitness. Common causes of behavioural responses are changes in the transmission of information, the concentration of endocrine disrupters, the availability of resources, the possibility of dispersal, and the abundance of interacting species. Frequent responses are alterations in habitat choice, movements, foraging, social behaviour and reproductive behaviour. Behavioural responses depend on the genetically determined reaction norm of the individuals, which evolves over generations. Populations first respond with individual behavioural plasticity, whereafter changes may arise through innovations and the social transmission of behavioural patterns within and across generations, and, finally, by evolution of the behavioural response over generations. Only a restricted number of species show behavioural adaptations that make them thrive in severely disturbed environments. Hence, rapid human-induced disturbances often decrease the diversity of native species, while facilitating the spread of invasive species with highly plastic behaviours. Consequently, behavioural responses to human-induced environmental change can have profound effects on the distribution, adaptation, speciation and extinction of populations and, hence, on biodiversity. A better understanding of the mechanisms of behavioural responses and their causes and consequences could improve our ability to predict the effects of human-induced environmental change on individual species and on biodiversity.

TI  - Multiscale perspectives of fire, climate and humans in western North America and the Jemez Mountains, USA
PY  - 2016
AB  - Interannual climate variations have been important drivers of wildfire occurrence in ponderosa pine forests across western North America for at least 400 years, but at finer scales of mountain ranges and landscapes human land uses sometimes over-rode climate influences. We reconstruct and analyse effects of high human population densities in forests of the Jemez Mountains, New Mexico from ca 1300 CE to Present. Prior to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, human land uses reduced the occurrence of widespread fires while simultaneously adding more ignitions resulting in many small-extent fires. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wet/dry oscillations and their effects on fuels dynamics controlled widespread fire occurrence. In the late 19th century, intensive livestock grazing disrupted fuels continuity and fire spread and then active fire suppression maintained the absence of widespread surface fires during most of the 20th century. The abundance and continuity of fuels is the most important controlling variable in fire regimes of these semi-arid forests. Reduction of widespread fires owing to reduction of fuel continuity emerges as a hallmark of extensive human impacts on past forests and fire regimes. This article is part of the themed issue ‘The interaction of fire and mankind’.

TI  - The effects of human disturbance on the activity of wild reindeer in different physical condition
PY  - 1988
AB  - We compared two Norwegian wild reindeer herds, Knutsho in excellent physical condition and Hardangervidda in poor physical condition, before and during disturbance by human hunters in order to test whether physical condition effected foraging strategy under stress. Both herds were being regularly hunted (man had been a natural predator on reindeer since prehistoric time). The well-fed Knutsho animals were ca. 30% larger at the start of the hunting season in late August. Before exposure they foraged less and walked more, i.e. were more selective than the Hardangervidda animals which were in energetically lower condition and foraged significantly more and spent less time moving between habitat patches and less time standing. After exposure to hunters disturbed Knutsho animals aggregated into significantly larger groups than before hunting and stood alert more, while Hardangervidda animals spent the same minimum amount of time foraging but moved significantly more and spent almost no time standing. The frequency of disturbance was not significantly different between the two herds and their speeds of movement after disturbances were similar. The hunter kill success rate was also similar in the two areas. The energetic costs, measured as relative body weight loss during the hunting season, was higher for the initially less well-fed Hardangervidda animals, and higher for both herds compared to that from a less disturbed herd (Forelhogna). We hypothezise that while standing still and alert in aggregated groups is risky, it is still more risky to move, but potentially more rewarding if a better habitat could be found. More well-fed Knutsho animals, which aggregated and stood still, conserved allready stored energy, compatible with a time minimizer risk aversive strategy. The Hardangervidda animals which were in poorer condition increased travelling time to an extent that suggested a risky nutrient miximizer strategy in the phase of stress. Effekter av menneskelige forstyrrelser pa aktiviteten til villrein i forskjellig fysisk kondisjon. Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: For a teste om fysisk kondisjon innvirket pa beitestrategien, sammenlignet vi to norske vill-reinflokker, Knutsho i utmerket fysisk kondisjon og Hardangervidda i darlig fysisk kondisjon for og etter forstyrrelser av jegere. Begge flokker er regelmessig jaktet pa (menneske har vaert naturlig predator pa rein siden forhistorisk tid). De velnaerte rein pa Knutsho var 30% tyngre enn sine artsfeller pa Hardangervidda ved starten av jaktsesongen sent i august. For jakten beitet de mindre og gikk mer, d.v.s. var mer selektive enn Hardangerviddareinen. Disse var energetisk sett i en darligere forfatning, beitet mer og brukte mindre tid bade til a ga mellom beiteomradene og til a sta. Etter a ha blitt utsatt for forstyrrelser av jegere, samlet Knutshoreinen seg til storre grupper enn for jakten og sto mer vaktsomme. Hardangerviddareinen derimot, brukte den samme minimumstid til beiting, men gikk signifikant mer enn for jakten. Den brukte heller nesten ingen tid til a sta i ro. Hyppigheten av forstyrrelser var ikke signifikant forskjellig mellom de to grupper og deres bevegelses-hastighet etter forstyrrelse var den samme. Jegernes jaktsuksess i form av fellinger var ogsa den samme i de to omrader. Energiutgiftene, malt som relativt tap av kroppsvekt gjennom jaktsesongen, var hoyere for Hardangerviddareinen med darligere ernaeringsstatus i startfasen. For begge flokker var energiutgiftene hoyere sammenlignet med en mindre forstyrret reinflokk (Forelhogna). Vi tror at, selv om det a sta stille og vaktsomt i samlet flokk er risikofylt, sa er det enda mer risikofylt a bevege seg, noe som dog kan vaere mer lonnsomt, om de finner et bedre beiteomrade. Mer velfodd Knutshorein, som samlet seg og sto i ro, bevarte mer av sin allerede opplagrede naeringsenergi, noe som minimaliserer tidsforbruk til naeringssok og som er en risikoavvergende strategi. Hardangerviddarein, som var i darligere hold, okte tiden for beitesok i en grad som antyder en mer risikofylt strategi under stresspavirk-ning for a maksimalisere beiteopptak.

Abstract in Finnish / Yhteenveto: Vertasimme kahta norjalaista villipeuralaumaa, Knutshoen erittain hyvakuntoista ja Hardanger-viddan huonokuntoista laumaa. Ennen ja jalkeen metsastajien hairinnan testasimme vaikuttaako kunto peu-rojen ravinnon kayttoon stressin aikana. Molempia laumoja on metsastetty saannollisesti (ihminen on olut peurojen luontainen vihollin je esihistoriaaalisista ajoista alkaen). Hyvakuntoisessa Knutshoen laumassa peurat olivat noin 30% suurempia metsastyskauden alkaessa elokuun lopulla. Ennen harinitaa ne laidunsi-vat vahan, vaelsivat enemman ja olivat valikoivampi kuin Hardangerviddan peurat, jotka olivat energeetti-sesti heikommassa kunnossa ja laidunsivat merkitsevasti enemman ja kuluttivat vahemman aikaa liikkumi-seen eri laidunalueiden valilla ja my os seisomiseen. Metsastyksen alettua Knutshoen peurat kokoontiuvat suurempiin ryhmiin kuin aikaisemmin ja sesoskeli-vat pelokkaina eneman. Hardangerviddan peurat kayttivat puolestaan vahan aikaa ruokailuun mutta liikkui-vat merkitsevasti enemman eivatka kayttaneet juuri aikaa seisomiseen. Hairiotilanteiden maariss a eri laumojen valilla ei ollut tilastollista merkitsevyytta ja niiden liikkumisno-peudet hairoiden jalkeen olivat samanlaiset. Metsastajien saaliit oliva samanlaiset nailla kahdella alueella. Energian kulutus mitattuna suhteellisena painon menetysena metsastysaikana oli suurempi jo lahtovaiheessa heikompikuntoisimmilla Hardangerviddan peuroilla, ja se oli my os suurempi molemmilla laumoilla kuin vahemman hairitylla laumalla (Forelhogna). Me oletamme, etta sesominen ja hairinta isoissa laumoissa on riskitekija. Viela suurempi riski on liik-kua, mutta potentiaalisesti se on parempi, jos hyvia laidunalueita lovtyy. Hyvakuntoiset Knutshoen peurat, jotka kokoontuivat ja sesoivat hiljaa, saastivat jo koottuja energiavarastoja. Hardangerviddan peurat, jotka olivat huonommassa kunnossa, lisasivat suuresti vaellusta.

TI  - Application of random effects to the study of resource selection by animals
PY  - 2006
AB  - 1. Resource selection estimated by logistic regression is used increasingly in studies to identify critical resources for animal populations and to predict species occurrence. 2. Most frequently, individual animals are monitored and pooled to estimate population-level effects without regard to group or individual-level variation. Pooling assumes that both observations and their errors are independent, and resource selection is constant given individual variation in resource availability. 3. Although researchers have identified ways to minimize autocorrelation, variation between individuals caused by differences in selection or available resources, including functional responses in resource selection, have not been well addressed. 4. Here we review random-effects models and their application to resource selection modelling to overcome these common limitations. We present a simple case study of an analysis of resource selection by grizzly bears in the foothills of the Canadian Rocky Mountains with and without random effects. 5. Both categorical and continuous variables in the grizzly bear model differed in interpretation, both in statistical significance and coefficient sign, depending on how a random effect was included. We used a simulation approach to clarify the application of random effects under three common situations for telemetry studies: (a) discrepancies in sample sizes among individuals; (b) differences among individuals in selection where availability is constant; and (c) differences in availability with and without a functional response in resource selection. 6. We found that random intercepts accounted for unbalanced sample designs, and models with random intercepts and coefficients improved model fit given the variation in selection among individuals and functional responses in selection. Our empirical example and simulations demonstrate how including random effects in resource selection models can aid interpretation and address difficult assumptions limiting their generality. This approach will allow researchers to appropriately estimate marginal (population) and conditional (individual) responses, and account for complex grouping, unbalanced sample designs and autocorrelation.

TI  - Learning from the past to predict the future: using archaeological findings and GPS data to quantify reindeer sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbance in Norway
PY  - 2012
AB  - Norwegian wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus tarandus are divided into 23 virtually isolated populations, primarily due to the abandonment of traditional migration and movement corridors caused by the development of infrastructures. By conducting a nation-wide, interdisciplinary pre-post study on a temporal scale spanning centuries, we modelled current reindeer movements with respect to archaeological findings to quantify long-term changes in area use related to anthropogenic disturbance. The location of 3,113 pitfall traps and hunting blinds, built 600–2000 years ago and used until 350–400 years ago, testified the location of traditional movement corridors. Current movement routes were delineated using Brownian Bridge Movement Models based on 147 reindeer GPS-monitored during 10 years. Using Path Analysis we quantified direct, indirect and total effects of different infrastructures within multiple scales (1, 5, and 10 km-radius buffers) on the current probability of use of ancient movement corridors. Tourist cabins and roads had the strongest long-term direct effects at most scales: 1 tourist cabin and 1 km road within a 1 km-radius buffer would lead, respectively, to complete area abandonment, and to a 46 % decrease in the probability of use. Power lines and private cabins had significant indirect effects on area use through their effect on roads, while hiking trails and, in particular, hydroelectric dams had highly variable effects, not significant at a nation-wide scale. Finally, we provide a flexible tool to estimate the potential long-term direct and cumulative effects of different types of infrastructures at the desired spatial scale to be used for the development of future sustainable land management plans.

TI  - Life History Patterns of Freshwater Resident and Sea-Run Migrant Brown Trout in Norway
PY  - 1985
AB  - Abstract Brown trout Salmo trutta in Vangsvatnet Lake, Norway, include freshwater residents that mature sexually without any sea run and migrants that smoltify and migrate between fresh water and the sea one or more years before maturing. Migrants leave Vangsvatnet Lake during spring and move in coastal waters up to 100 km from the lake outlet before they return to their home river in summer or autumn; older migrants return earlier than younger migrants, sexually mature fish before immatures. Both residents and migrants spawn together in tributaries to Vangsvatnet Lake. Young brown trout (parr) grow in the tributaries and lake; lake dwellers grow faster than stream dwellers. Parr that become migrants at age 2 grow faster than parr that become residents, but parr that become migrants at age 4 and older grow more slowly than those that become residents. Parr that smoltify or mature at a young age grow faster than parr that do so later. Resident males are 2–8 years of age, and 13–47 cm in tip length, residen...

TI  - Long-term perspective on wildfires in the western USA
PY  - 2012
AB  - a slight decline in burning over the past 3,000 y, with the lowest levels attained during the 20th century and during the Little Ice Age (LIA, ca. 1400-1700 CE (Common Era)). Prominent peaks in forest fires occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (ca. 950-1250 CE) and during the 1800s. Analysis of climate reconstruc- tions beginning from 500 CE and population data show that tem- perature and drought predict changes in biomass burning up to the late 1800s CE. Since the late 1800s , human activities and the ecological effects of recent high fire activity caused a large, abrupt decline in burning similar to the LIA fire decline. Consequently, there is now a forest "fire deficit" in the western United States attributable to the combined effects of human activities, ecologi- cal, and climate changes. Large fires in the late 20th and 21st cen- tury fires have begun to address the fire deficit, but it is continuing to grow.

AB  - Five possible solutions to the problem of over-wintering brent geese (Branta bernicla) grazing on farmers'crops in Britain are described: maintaining the status quo, culling brent geese, paying compensation to farmers and setting up alternative feeding areas on set aside land or reserves. The financial costs and benefits associated with each solution are calculated with respect to society as a whole (the taxpayer), farmers, conservationists and the wildfowlers. A cost-benefit analysis shows the optimal financial solution for society to be the establishment of alternative feeding areas whereas the optimal solution for farmers would be the payment of compensation

TI  - Monitoring visitors to natural areas in wintertime: issues in counter accuracy
PY  - 2013
AB  - The sustainable management of vulnerable natural areas requires accurate measurement of visitor flows, especially in mountain and protected areas. Pyroelectric sensors that detect the heat radiation emitted by human bodies are now commonly used in many regions, including Scandinavia and the UK, to count pedestrian traffic in both urban and natural areas. We used four different tests to investigate pyroelectric counters’ accuracy in mountain winter conditions. Air temperature, distance to sensor, visitor clothing and visitor volume were all found to affect counter error rates. For tests within moderate winter temperatures (between 0°C and −18°C) counters reported within manufacturer's claimed accuracy at 5% for 2 m range, but for −21°C and below visitor numbers were over reported by 10.9%. Counter accuracy was generally unaffected by visitor clothing within 2 m of the sensor, but at a 4 m distance counters frequently failed to detect individuals in insulating down jackets more than fleece jackets. Counter ...

TI  - Light penetration in different types of lakes in Central Finland
PY  - 1978
AB  - Light penetration measurements of blue (Schott filter BG 12), green (VG 9), and red (RG 630) light was made in 30 Finnish lakes with different degree of humus content and eutrophy for the comparison of the structure of phytoplankton communities and the light environment in the waters. The relations between Secchi disc visibility and the penetrations of different spectral regions and relations between the light conditions and the colour of the water was examined. The increase of ɛmin m−1 caused by humus material is 0.008 In units per colour unit (mg Pt l−1). The optical depth was especially in brown waters smaller than calculated by Formula after Talling (1965).

TI  - Thermal performance of juvenile Atlantic Salmon, Salmo salar L.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary 1 Experimental data for maximum growth and food consumption of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr from five Norwegian rivers situated between 59 and 70°N were analysed and modelled. The growth and feeding models were also applied to groups of Atlantic Salmon growing and feeding at rates below the maximum. The data were fitted to the Ratkowsky model, originally developed for bacterial growth. 2 The rates of growth and food consumption varied significantly among populations but the variation appeared unrelated to thermal conditions in the river of population origins. No correlation was found between the thermal conditions and limits for growth, thermal growth optima or maximum growth, and hypotheses of population-specific thermal adaptation were not supported. Estimated optimum temperatures for growth were between 16 and 20 °C. 3 Model parameter estimates differed among growth-groups in that maximum growth and the performance breadth decreased from fast to slow growing individuals. The optimum temperature for growth did not change with growth rate. 4 The model for food consumption (expressed in energy terms) peaked at 19–21 °C, which is only slightly higher than the optimal temperature for growth. Growth appeared directly related to food consumption. Consumption was initiated ≈2 °C below the lower temperature for growth and terminated ≈1·5 °C above the upper critical temperature for growth. Model parameter estimates for consumption differed among growth-groups in a manner similar to the growth models. 5 By combining the growth and consumption models, growth efficiencies were estimated. The maximum efficiencies were high, 42–58%, and higher in rivers offering hostile than benign feeding and growth opportunities.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of river inundation area, stage, and discharge: a review
PY  - 1997
AB  - The growing availability of multi-temporal satellite data has increased opportunities for monitoring large rivers from space. A variety of passive and active sensors operating in the visible and microwave range are currently operating, or planned, which can estimate inundation area and delineate flood boundaries. Radar altimeters show great promise for directly measuring stage variation in large rivers. It also appears to be possible to obtain estimates of river discharge from space, using ground measurements and satellite data to construct empirical curves that relate water surface area to discharge. Extrapolation of these curves to ungauged sites may be possible for the special case of braided rivers. Where clouds, trees and floating vegetation do not obscure the water surface, high-resolution visible/infrared sensors provide good delineation of inundated areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can penetrate clouds and can also detect standing water through emergent aquatic plants and forest canopies. However, multiple frequencies and polarizations are required for optimal discrimination of various inundated vegetation cover types. Existing singlepolarization, fixed-frequency SARs are not suAcient for mapping inundation area in all riverine environments. In the absence of a space-borne multi-parameter SAR, a synergistic approach using single-frequency, fixed-polarization SAR and visible/infrared data will provide the best results over densely vegetated river floodplains. #1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Critical habitat during the transition from maternal provisioning in freshwater fish, with emphasis on Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta)
PY  - 2006
AB  - In freshwater fish, the transition from dependence on maternal yolk reserves to independent foraging can be an early critical period, with survival during this stage having a strong influence on population abundance and cohort strength. Information concerning Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta as model species is reviewed to show how population dynamics are influenced by habitat use during the transitional stage and illustrate the role of maternal provisioning along with density-dependent and -independent factors. The allocation of resources in yolk and timing and position of spawning strongly influence the biotic and abiotic environments of juveniles and their subsequent performance. Vulnerability to predators, adverse environmental conditions and restricted conditions over which they can successfully forage result in specific habitat requirements for newly independent juveniles. The availability of slow-flowing habitats at stream margins during the first month of independence is crucial. Alteration of natural flow regimes and physical habitat structure, associated with a wide range of anthropogenic influences, can have significant deleterious effects on the availability of critical juvenile habitat. A model combining habitat structure and the relationship between density-dependent and -independent mortality is presented to explore the range of conditions under which the transitional period would have a strong influence on population abundance. This model provides a framework for establishing thresholds or optima for habitat availability that will favour sufficient recruitment out of the transitional stage. Using the modelling framework, managers can make informed decisions on the utility and cost effectiveness of fisheries and habitat management activities designed to increase juvenile survival during the transition to independence. A range of management options is outlined for improving habitat quality and increasing juvenile survival during the transitional period, including restoration of structural complexity, provision of suitable flow regimes, and tailoring stocking and reintroduction strategies to mimic natural dynamics.

TI  - How Well Does LCA Model Land Use Impacts on Biodiversity?--A Comparison with Approaches from Ecology and Conservation.
PY  - 2016
AB  - The modeling of land use impacts on biodiversity is considered a priority in life cycle assessment (LCA). Many diverging approaches have been proposed in an expanding literature on the topic. The UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative is engaged in building consensus on a shared modeling framework to highlight best-practice and guide model application by practitioners. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of 31 models from both the LCA and the ecology/conservation literature (20 from LCA, 11 from non-LCA fields) according to a set of criteria reflecting (i) model completeness, (ii) biodiversity representation, (iii) impact pathway coverage, (iv) scientific quality, and (v) stakeholder acceptance. We show that LCA models tend to perform worse than those from ecology and conservation (although not significantly), implying room for improvement. We identify seven best-practice recommendations that can be implemented immediately to improve LCA models based on existing approaches in the literature. We further ...

TI  - Phosphorus control is critical to mitigating eutrophication
PY  - 2008
AB  - The Midwest floods of 2008 added more than just water to the region's lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. Runoff from farms and towns carries a heavy load of silt, nutrients, and other pollutants. The nutrients trigger blooms of algae, which taint drinking water. Death and decay of the algae depletes oxygen, kills fish and bottom-dwelling animals, and thereby creates “dead zones” in the body of water. The syndrome of excessive nutrients, noxious algae, foul water, and dead zones—which ecologists call eutrophication—is depressingly familiar to those who depend on water from rich agricultural regions.

TI  - Climate and forest fires in Finland - influence of lightning-caused ignitions and fuel moisture
PY  - 2005
AB  - The objectives of this research were to examine how lightning characteristics influence ignition probability of a lightning stroke, to study the distribution of lightning-ignited forest fires and to examine fuel moisture variation. This research utilized the comprehensive forest fire records collected by the Finnish Ministry of the Interior. Individual fires were systematically linked with individual lightning strokes to compute probabilities that a stroke has ignited a fire. A method of grouping lightning flashes into thunderstorms was developed in order to compare the ignition probability of a stroke and the characteristics of the thunderstorm to which the stroke belongs. To examine fuel moisture variation, the spatial and temporal variation in ignition probability was studied based on meteorological data, ignition experiments and Finnish forest fire risk index model. The results supported the hypothesis that a stroke in a small thunderstorm is more likely to result in ignition than a stroke in a large thunderstorm. However, the results contradicted theories predicting that positive strokes or flashes of high multiplicity would more likely result in ignition than negative strokes or flashes of low multiplicity. Positive and negative strokes were equally likely to ignite a fire and that the ignition probability of a stroke decreases with increasing multiplicity of a flash. Fuels were at their driest in late May and June in southern Finland and in late June in northern Finland. Lightning-caused ignitions were most frequent in July. Fuels were significantly dryer and lightning strokes are more frequent in southern Finland than in northern Finland. As a result, the density of lightning caused forest fires was twenty times higher in southern Finland than in northern Finland. Assuming that the natural fire cycle in southern Finland is at least 100 years, the results suggest that in northern Finland the natural fire cycle is several thousand years. If natural disturbance dynamics are mimicked in forest management and restoration, this south-north difference in natural fire regime characteristics, and consequently in forest disturbance dynamics in general, should be taken into account.

TI  - Selecting Habitat to Survive: The Impact of Road Density on Survival in a Large Carnivore
PY  - 2013
AB  - Habitat selection studies generally assume that animals select habitat and food resources at multiple scales to maximise their fitness. However, animals sometimes prefer habitats of apparently low quality, especially when considering the costs associated with spatially heterogeneous human disturbance. We used spatial variation in human disturbance, and its consequences on lynx survival, a direct fitness component, to test the Hierarchical Habitat Selection hypothesis from a population of Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in southern Norway. Data from 46 lynx monitored with telemetry indicated that a high proportion of forest strongly reduced the risk of mortality from legal hunting at the home range scale, while increasing road density strongly increased such risk at the finer scale within the home range. We found hierarchical effects of the impact of human disturbance, with a higher road density at a large scale reinforcing its negative impact at a fine scale. Conversely, we demonstrated that lynx shifted their habitat selection to avoid areas with the highest road densities within their home ranges, thus supporting a compensatory mechanism at fine scale enabling lynx to mitigate the impact of large-scale disturbance. Human impact, positively associated with high road accessibility, was thus a stronger driver of lynx space use at a finer scale, with home range characteristics nevertheless constraining habitat selection. Our study demonstrates the truly hierarchical nature of habitat selection, which aims at maximising fitness by selecting against limiting factors at multiple spatial scales, and indicates that scale-specific heterogeneity of the environment is driving individual spatial behaviour, by means of trade-offs across spatial scales.

The detailed dynamics of the changeover were controlled by catastrophic disturbances 2500 and 2200 years ago. 3. Two long periods of disturbance by burning and grazing kept the woodland open in structure. Eventual abandonment of this management practice initiated a succession that resulted in the present dominance of Picea, over 2000 years after its immigration into Fiby

TI  - Extreme Methane Emissions from a Swiss Hydropower Reservoir: Contribution from Bubbling Sediments
PY  - 2010
AB  - Methane emission pathways and their importance were quantified during a yearlong survey of a temperate hydropower reservoir. Measurements using gas traps indicated very high ebullition rates, but due to the stochastic nature of ebullition a mass balance approach was crucial to deduce system-wide methane sources and losses. Methane diffusion from the sediment was generally low and seasonally stable and did not account for the high concentration of dissolved methane measured in the reservoir discharge. A strong positive correlation between water temperature and the observed dissolved methane concentration enabled us to quantify the dissolved methane addition from bubble dissolution using a system-wide mass balance. Finally, knowing the contribution due to bubble dissolution, we used a bubble model to estimate bubble emission directly to the atmosphere. Our results indicated that the total methane emission from Lake Wohlen was on average >150 mg CH4 m−2 d−1, which is the highest ever documented for a midlati...

TI  - Wolves in Context: Using Survey Data to Situate Attitudes Within a Wider Cultural Framework
PY  - 2007
AB  - Studies of public attitudes toward wolves tend to be descriptive in nature, and few sophisticated analyses of complex attitude patterns have been conducted. Drawing on findings from qualitative studies, the present study analyzed nationally representative survey data from Norway in order to probe the relationships between attitudes toward wolves and such factors as education, urban/rural place of residence, cultural capital, and various value orientations: environmental orientation, general political values, and trust in formal or informal information sources. Structural equation modeling confirmed that attitudes are embedded in more general cultural patterns. Although the cultural level is influenced by structural factors, effects of the background variables were reduced or disappeared in a model that included value orientations. This finding demonstrates that in order to access the level of meaning by means of survey methods, carefully constructed instruments and causal models must be employed.

TI  - ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF HYDROPOWER RESERVOIRS ON WILD MAMMALS AND FRESHWATER TURTLES IN AMAZONIA: A REVIEW
PY  - 2011
AB  - Brazilian legislation only grants the necessary licenses to build hydroelectric plants (previous license, installation and operation licenses) if environmental impact assessment studies are carried out, and if mitigation and compensatory measures are taken. The formation of a reservoir causes natural habitat loss and significant alteration for wild terrestrial and aquatic mammals, and hydroelectric plants in Amazonia have affected ecological feeding and reproductive habitats of aquatic mammals and chelonians. Monitoring programs carried out in those reservoirs have shown mammals and chelonians fitting their feeding and reproductive behavior repertoire to the new habitat created by reservoirs. During the initial phase of implantation of the hydroelectric reservoir, terrestrial mammal species are taken out of their usual home ranges to already occupied areas, a phenomenon known as the dam’s extended effect. The reservoir formed in an area previously without that body of water now has an influence on the phenological rhythms of the surrounding vegetation as well as altering the seasonal phases of the hydrological cycle (flood phase, drying phase, drought, and flooding phase) which aquatic mammals and freshwater turtles’ movements fit in with, in function of food availability and appropriate reproductive habitats. Programs to monitor those animal populations can establish guidelines to mitigate environmental impacts by means of proper management procedures for conservation and sustainable

TI  - Evaluating Single-Pass Catch as a Tool for Identifying Spatial Pattern in Fish Distribution
PY  - 2005
AB  - ABSTRACT We evaluate the efficacy of single-pass electrofishing without blocknets as a tool for collecting spatially continuous fish distribution data in headwater streams. We compare spatial patterns in abundance, sampling effort, and length-frequency distributions from single-pass sampling of coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki clarki) to data obtained from a more precise multiple-pass removal electrofishing method in two mid-sized (500–1000 ha) forested watersheds in western Oregon. Abundance estimates from single- and multiple-pass removal electrofishing were positively correlated in both watersheds, r = 0.99 and 0.86. There were no significant trends in capture probabilities at the watershed scale (P > 0.05). Moreover, among-sample variation in fish abundance was higher than within-sample error in both streams indicating that increased precision of unit-scale abundance estimates would provide less information on patterns of abundance than increasing the fraction of habitat units sampled.

PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract This paper explores some of the implications for policy-makers and administrators of introducing effective public participation in landscape protection, management and planning in accordance with the European Landscape Convention. The paper discusses justifications for public participation and what participation entails, and engages with the questions of who is entitled to participate and whether there are landscapes that participation does not apply to. The article then suggests different forms that participation may take. It presents two typologies of participation and what they imply for public participation in practice. Examples from Norway are taken as illustrations.

TI  - Relations between change in spring habitat selection and daily energetics of Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus
PY  - 1985
AB  - During the month prior to spring departure to the breeding grounds the Svalbard population of Pink-footed Geese staging in west Jutland, Denmark shifts from pasture to grain feeding on newly sown fields. This paper compares the daily energy expenditure and net energy intake in the two habitats. On pastures the geese spent 80% of the feeding day feeding vs 54% on newly sown barley fields, but due to more frequent disturbance flights in the latter habitat, the estimated daily energy expenditure on pastures was lower (1088 kJ vs 1280 kJ). Daily food intake on pastures was estimated at 158.5 g organic matter and on newly sown fields at 229.8 g organic matter, equivalent to a daily net energy intake of 1267 kJ and 2824 kJ, respectively. The net energy intake per peck during a feeding bout was 14 J on pastures and 219 J on newly sown fields. Thus, from an energetic point of view, feeding on newly sown fields was advantageous compared with feeding on pastures, and the observed habitat shift can be seen as a choice of the most profitable food source. The grain provides sufficient carbohydrates to build up fat reserves for later reproduction, but not sufficient protein.

TI  - Tree species dynamics and disturbance in three Swedish boreal forest stands during the last two thousand years
PY  - 1993
AB  - . Data from three forest stands for the past 2000 yr show how the shade-intolerant species Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens maintain significant populations in the Swedish boreal landscape. Age structure data from a northern stand close to the range limits of Picea abies and Pinus complement a local pollen diagram, and reveal cyclic population fluctuations which can be related to periods of climatic stress and fire. Pollen data from two southern stands show that high fire frequencies in the past prevented the expansion of Picea populations. Reduction of the fire frequency during the last 200 yr has favoured Picea. A long time perspective reveals the population dynamics of long-lived species and indicates the controlling factors. Such knowledge permits assessment of the current status and likely future of forest stands.

TI  - Five hundred years of gridded high-resolution precipitation reconstructions over Europe and the connection to large-scale circulation
PY  - 2005
AB  - We present seasonal precipitation reconstructions for European land areas (30°W to 40°E/30–71°N; given on a 0.5°×0.5° resolved grid) covering the period 1500–1900 together with gridded reanalysis from 1901 to 2000 (Mitchell and Jones 2005). Principal component regression techniques were applied to develop this dataset. A large variety of long instrumental precipitation series, precipitation indices based on documentary evidence and natural proxies (tree-ring chronologies, ice cores, corals and a speleothem) that are sensitive to precipitation signals were used as predictors. Transfer functions were derived over the 1901–1983 calibration period and applied to 1500–1900 in order to reconstruct the large-scale precipitation fields over Europe. The performance (quality estimation based on unresolved variance within the calibration period) of the reconstructions varies over centuries, seasons and space. Highest reconstructive skill was found for winter over central Europe and the Iberian Peninsula. Precipitation variability over the last half millennium reveals both large interannual and decadal fluctuations. Applying running correlations, we found major non-stationarities in the relation between large-scale circulation and regional precipitation. For several periods during the last 500 years, we identified key atmospheric modes for southern Spain/northern Morocco and central Europe as representations of two precipitation regimes. Using scaled composite analysis, we show that precipitation extremes over central Europe and southern Spain are linked to distinct pressure patterns. Due to its high spatial and temporal resolution, this dataset allows detailed studies of regional precipitation variability for all seasons, impact studies on different time and space scales, comparisons with high-resolution climate models as well as analysis of connections with regional temperature reconstructions.

TI  - Forest fires: An example of self-organized critical behavior
PY  - 1998
AB  - Despite the many complexities concerning their initiation and propagation, forest fires exhibit power-law frequency-area statistics over many orders of magnitude. A simple forest fire model, which is an example of self-organized criticality, exhibits similar behavior. One practical implication of this result is that the frequency-area distribution of small and medium fires can be used to quantify the risk of large fires, as is routinely done for earthquakes.

TI  - Reflexive tradition Young working–class hunters between wolves and modernity
PY  - 2007
AB  - This article is based on a qualitative study of young working–class men who are dedicated hunters and hardcore wolf adversaries. Our aim is to make sense of their attitudes and practices regarding the re–appearance of wolves. They see the wolves as impeding their life projects: being hunters and outdoorsmen. Therefore, we discuss attitude formation in the light of theories of identity, paying special attention to the idea that identity formation is strongly affected by individualization in ‘late modernity’. Norwegian media tend to depict rural ways of life as rooted in traditionalism, implying an antagonism between the modern and the traditional along an urban–rural axis. Yet, even if important choices made by the young men include distinct elements of local tradition, these choices are no less reflexive than those made by more mobile peers. The article argues that the young hunters are simultaneously traditional and modern and that they transgress such artificial antagonisms through their everyday practices.

TI  - A Changing Paradigm of Pelagic Food Webs
PY  - 2008
AB  - The paper catalogues the development of knowledge that has increasingly challenged the conventional understanding (the paradigm) that the predominant pathway of energy flow in pelagic systems is founded on the primary production of phytoplankton, its consumption by herbivorous zooplankton and, in turn, the feeding of larger carnivorous animals, including fish of commercial value. Aquatic food webs are now recognised to be more diverse in their carbon sources, more complex in structure and more versatile in their function. Adjacent terrestrial catchments supply nutrients and, crucially, dissolved inorganic carbon, dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon. Pivotal roles in the processing of autochthonous organic carbon are often fulfilled by pelagic microbes and bacterivorous nanoplankton and microplankton. Mesozooplankton consumes algae directly if sufficiently concentrated but is itself a limiting resource to pelagic fish, which either must be specially adapted to gather sufficient zooplankton or must switch to benthic or littoral foods. Opportunistic feeding by such fish, though primarily nourished in the inshore, continues to control abundant zooplankton. Mobility and dietary electivity of adult fish integrate the pelagic food web into that of the benthos. Except in very large lakes and in the open ocean, the influence of benthic food webs influences the flow of carbon within the pelagic and beyond, serving to invalidate the traditional paradigm of trophic relationships and demanding formulation of another. The flows of matter and energy … result from a simple composition of the activity of individuals and of species R. Margalef, 1997. (© 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)

TI  - Special Issue: Environmental flows: science and management.
PY  - 2009
AB  - SUMMARY 1. Natural biogeochemical processes and diverse communities of aquatic biota regulate freshwater quantity and quality in ways that are not sufficiently acknowledged nor appreciated by the water resources management community. The establishment and enforcement of environmental flow requirements offer promising means to improve and care for these critical environmental services. This Special Issue provides new insights and novel techniques to determine, protect and restore ecologically and socially sustainable flow regimes, and thereby help achieve the water-related goals of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2. Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems – and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans – ‘environmental flows’ left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation ⁄ restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and floodplains. 3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales – applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA). 4. Advances in the allocation of flood flows along the River Murray in Australia, an Ecosystems Function Model (HEC-EFM) for the Bill Williams River restoration programme in Arizona (U.S.A), the European Water Framework Directive, and improved management of hydroelectric dams demonstrate the potential for significant ecological recovery following partial restoration of natural river flow regimes. 5. Based on contributions to this Special Issue, the action agenda of the 2007 Brisbane Declaration on environmental flows and the wider literature, we propose an invigorated global research programme to construct and calibrate hydro-ecological

TI  - Review of ecological effects of roads on terrestrial and aquatic communities.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific liter- ature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, move- ment, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the pres- ence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to com- plement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding con- struction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.

TI  - Littoral energy mobilization dominates energy supply for top consumers in subarctic lakes
PY  - 2005
AB  - We used stable carbon (d 13 C) and nitrogen (d 15 N) isotopes to assess the energy sources supporting the top consumer (Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus) in nine subarctic lakes in northern Sweden. The d 13 C of littoral (epipelic algae) and pelagic (bacterioplankton and phytoplankton) energy sources were clearly separated in the lakes, as reflected in habitat-specific consumers (zoobenthos, zooplankton). Char were enriched in 13 C compared with pelagic energy sources and prey and isotopically more similar to littoral energy sources and prey. The contribution of littoral energy sources to char body carbon was estimated to range between 62% and 94% among the lakes. The reliance on littoral energy sources was independent of char size and did not change when char coexisted with a small-sized prey fish (nine-spined stickleback, Pungitus pungitus). The strong reliance of top consumers in subarctic lakes on littoral energy sources may be due to the higher energy mobilization and larger sizes of primary consumers in littoral than in pelagic habitats. The energy flow through the ecosystem, i.e., from the energy mobilizers at the base of the food web to top energy consumers, is of fundamental importance for the function of lake ecosystems. Mobilization and transfer of energy within the food web sets the limit for production at higher trophic levels, and the presence of several diverse energy-flow pathways may affect ecosystem properties such as food-web dynamics and nutrient cycling (Polis et al. 1997). Still, energy flow between benthic and pelagic compartments has received little attention, reflecting both methodological constraints and a scarcity of whole-lake studies (Vadeboncoeur et al. 2002). Research into lake energy flow has largely focused on pelagic food webs. Pelagic energy mobilization derives from photosynthesis and from bacterioplankton growing on allochthonous organic carbon (Tranvik 1989; Jones 1992; Karlsson et al. 2002). The energy mobilization at the base of the food web is consumed, redistributed in the food web, and subsequently transferred to top consumers such as fish. However, recent studies have shown that benthic resources are of great importance for lake food webs, since fish communities may make considerable use of zoobenthos (Schindler and Scheuerell 2002). In the profundal zone, exploitation of benthic resources can be regarded as mainly comprising the re

TI  - Estimating biodiversity impacts without field surveys: A case study in northern Borneo
PY  - 2015
AB  - In many regions of the world, biodiversity surveys are not routinely conducted prior to activities that lead to land conversion, such as development projects. Here we use top-down methods based on global range maps and bottom-up methods based on macroecological scaling laws to illuminate the otherwise hidden biodiversity impacts of three large hydroelectric dams in the state of Sarawak in northern Borneo. Our retrospective impact assessment finds that the three reservoirs inundate habitat for 331 species of birds (3 million individuals) and 164 species of mammals (110 million individuals). A minimum of 2100 species of trees (900 million individuals) and 17 700 species of arthropods (34 billion individuals) are estimated to be affected by the dams. No extinctions of bird, mammal, or tree species are expected due to habitat loss following reservoir inundation, while 4-7 arthropod species extinctions are predicted. These assessment methods are applicable to any data-limited system undergoing land-use change.

TI  - Forest Management and Biodiversity Conservation Based on Natural Ecosystem Dynamics in Northern Europe: The Complexity Challenge
PY  - 2009
AB  - Recent research in northern Europe has revised many long-held conceptions of the complexity of forest ecosystems and their natural structure and dynamics. The unveiling of the picture of natural characteristics of forest ecosystem structure and dynamics reveals much more diversity than its traditional complement, highlighting the importance of non-stand-replacing disturbances and the associated heterogeneous and dynamic stand and landscape structures. This increasing detail is a reflection of a fundamental change in the ecological understanding of forests as complex ecosystems. In particular, the generalization that the boreal forest is regulated by fierce stand-replacing disturbances, leading to the dominance of even-aged stand successions, has been disproved. However, this misconception has, until now, been repeated and used to legitimize the dominant practice of clear-cutting as a nature-based way to manage the forest. The practical conclusion of this review paper is that the dominating forest management model in North European boreal forests, which is based on the clear-cut harvesting of timber and growing of even-aged stands, is in contradiction with the variable and complex characteristics of the disturbance-succession cycle observed in naturally dynamic forests with negligible human impact. As a consequence, the structural variation of the boreal forest under management has been grossly truncated compared with its natural range. Because of this, and due to the scarcity of protection areas in many regions of northern Europe, it is not likely that the conservation of native biodiversity and ecological sustainability will be attained, assuming that the model of forest management remains unchanged. Thus, there is a strong incentive for change in the prevailing forest management model toward one that is based on natural ecosystem dynamics and an understanding of forests as complex systems.

TI  - The spatial scale of competition from recruits on an older cohort in Atlantic salmon
PY  - 2011
AB  - Competitive effects of younger cohorts on older ones are frequently assumed to be negligible in species where older, larger individuals dominate in pairwise behavioural interactions. Here, we provide field estimates of such competition by recruits on an older age class in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a species where observational studies have documented strong body size advantages which should favour older individuals in direct interactions. By creating realistic levels of spatial variation in the density of underyearling (YOY) recruits over a 1-km stretch of a stream, and obtaining accurate measurements of individual growth rates of overyearlings (parr) from capture–mark–recapture data on a fine spatial scale, we demonstrate that high YOY density can substantially decrease parr growth. Models integrating multiple spatial scales indicated that parr were influenced by YOY density within 16 m. The preferred model suggested parr daily mass increase to be reduced by 39% when increasing YOY density from 0.0 to 1.0 m−2, which is well within the range of naturally occurring densities. Reduced juvenile growth rates will in general be expected to reduce juvenile survival (via increased length of exposure to freshwater mortality) and increase generation times (via increased age at seaward migrations). Thus, increased recruitment can significantly affect the performance of older cohorts, with important implications for population dynamics. Our results highlight that, even for the wide range of organisms that rely on defendable resources, the direction of competition among age classes cannot be assumed a priori or be inferred from behavioural observations alone.

TI  - Linking visitor motivation with attitude towards management restrictions on use in a national park
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract The increasing demand for visiting wilderness areas often requires management actions that both conserve the natural resources and ensure a high quality visitor experience. Many of the alpine national parks in southern Norway hold the last remaining populations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Europe. Therefore management needs more effective tools to reduce or remove recreational impact on wild reindeer populations. Management actions should also consult research-based knowledge on visitors. Therefore, this study explores the link between visitor motivations and their attitudes towards management actions on track-related (trail, path, trampling, track) and area-related (zoning, legal restrictions) use. The results show that two of the visitor motivations (i.e. hiking and place attachment) affect visitors’ attitudes towards management restrictions on use significantly. For instance, those visiting the national park for hiking are more positive to area-related restrictions while individuals attached to the place are more positive to track-related restrictions. Practical and theoretical implications are also discussed. Management implications When attempting to find socio-ecological solutions for conflicts between a wild reindeer population and recreational use, the following management recommendations should be considered: – A management solution should regard the fact that local users differ significantly from non-local visitors. – The strategy of ‘area restriction’ is highly controversial for local communities, due to their long tradition with subsistence harvesting, grazing and traditional agriculture; therefore such a strategy will receive only low approval among the locals and leave the management with low legitimacy at the local level. – The strategy of ‘management of the track system’ will affect most non-local visitors, but these visitors are more flexible in adapting to a new trail system in the area, or may shift to another area. – Visitors with strong place attachment, as well as wilderness seekers who desire solitude are difficult to influence with physical management actions. – A management strategy that will limit the area of use and behaviour of off-track visitors should include information about ecosystem vulnerability.

TI  - Human effects on ecological connectivity in aquatic ecosystems: Integrating scientific approaches to support management and mitigation
PY  - 2015
AB  - Understanding the drivers and implications of anthropogenic disturbance of ecological connectivity is a key concern for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Here, we review human activities that affect the movements and dispersal of aquatic organisms, including damming of rivers, river regulation, habitat loss and alteration, human-assisted dispersal of organisms and climate change. Using a series of case studies, we show that the insight needed to understand the nature and implications of connectivity, and to underpin conservation and management, is best achieved via data synthesis from multiple analytical approaches. We identify four key knowledge requirements for progressing our understanding of the effects of anthropogenic impacts on ecological connectivity: autecology; population structure; movement characteristics; and environmental tolerance/phenotypic plasticity. Structuring empirical research around these four broad data requirements, and using this information to parameterise appropriate models and develop management approaches, will allow for mitigation of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ecological connectivity in aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Impacts of river water consumption on aquatic biodiversity in life cycle assessment--a proposed method, and a case study for Europe.
PY  - 2014
AB  - In the context of climate change and food provisioning for a growing global population, the impacts of water consumption on aquatic biodiversity (e.g., river water consumption for irrigation) should be considered in Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). A previous LCIA method quantifying the potential impacts of river water consumption on fish biodiversity, using a species-discharge relationship (SDR), constituted an essential first step. This method is however limited in terms of regionalization and taxa considered, and predicts the potential risk of local species loss only. Here, we address these shortcomings by developing region-specific SDRs for Europe at various scales (continent, country, and eco-region), and including macro-invertebrate biodiversity. SDR exponents vary from 0.06 to 0.45 between regions, underlining the importance of such regionalization. Furthermore, we provide a new regionalized method which considers the location of water consumption within a river basin, by integrating the concep...

AB  - Ce texte se base sur des donnees tirees des interviews ouverts et de reserche ethnographique avec des travailleurs(euses) des forets du nord-ouest de l'Ontario. II tente a analyser les relations entre ces travailleurs(euses) et l'environnement aussi bien que leurs images des environnementalistes. L'argument fait est que les interpretations des travailleurs(euses) des forets sur les sujets environnementaux et les environnementalistes ne sont pas seulement determinees par les interets etroitement economiques. L'environnementalisme et les environnementalistes sont connotativement lies a des oppositions de classe et de region et done, deviennent des symboles metaphoriques et metonymiques d'autres conflits de classe et de region. La comprehension de quoi les sujets environnementaux signifient dans la culture des travailleurs(euses) des forets demande une analyse de la maniere par laquelle cette signification est surdeterminee par les discours existants a propos les divisions sociales enracinees en classe et en espace, dans le proces que les travailleurs(euses) des forets constituent leur identite. This paper draws on data from open-ended interviews and ethnographic research with forest workers in northwestern Ontario to analyse their relationship to the environment and their representations of environmentalists. It argues that forest workers' interpretations of environmental issues and environmentalists are not solely determined by narrow economic concerns. Environmentalism and environmentalists are connotatively linked to class and regional oppositions so that they become metaphoric and metonymic symbols of other class and regional conflicts. Understanding the specific meaning of environmental issues in forest workers' culture requires an analysis of the way in which their meaning is overdetermined by existing narratives about social divisions rooted in class and space in the process by which forest workers constitute their identity.

TI  - Cannibalizing kids: Rumor and resistance in Latin America
PY  - 2002
AB  - In recent years, stories of illicit traffic in children's organs have circulated in the international press; they allege that poor children are being mutilated and killed to procure healthy organs for wealthier ones. The A. examines the baby parts story in order to illuminate the role of rumors in building communal resistance and precipitating social movements. Rumors index collective fears and anxieties and participate in constructing these fears and anxieties as social problems - a process that sometimes leads to collective action, as rumors help build the social cohesion necessary to mobilize a public against perceived threats or social ills. Using the baby parts story in Latin America as a case study, the A. further argues that rumors occupy a middle ground between individual, covert tactics of resistance and community-based overt strategies. In this particular case, rumors led to a sustained international dialogue about inter-country adoption.

TI  - The dynamics of landscape change and snow geese in mid‐continent North America
PY  - 2005
AB  - The Mid-Continent Population of the lesser snow goose, which breeds in the eastern and central Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic, and winters in the southern United States and northern Mexico has increased 5–7% annually from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s, largely because of increased survival in response to an agricultural food subsidy. The rise in numbers complements the increased use of nitrogen fertilizers and a corresponding rise in yields of rice, corn, and wheat along the flyways and on the wintering grounds. In sub-Arctic migration areas and at Arctic breeding colonies, foraging by high numbers of birds has led to loss of coastal vegetation, adverse changes in soil properties and the establishment of an alternative stable state of exposed sediment, which can be detected with LANDSAT imagery. At a local scale, gosling growth, size and survival decreased in affected areas and other taxa have been adversely affected. The food subsidy on wintering and migration areas appears insufficient to meet reproductive demands as foraging in spring continues to occur on southern Hudson Bay staging and nesting areas. The recent introduction of liberal hunting regulations may reduce population size in the near term, but the revegetation of these coastal ecosystems will take decades to achieve. The present pattern of vegetation loss in these Arctic coastal systems is likely to continue in the forseeable future.

TI  - What shapes Eurasian lynx distribution in human dominated landscapes: selecting prey or avoiding people?
PY  - 2009
AB  - In the multi-use landscape of southern Norway, the distribution of lynx is likely to be determined both by the abundance of their favoured prey the roe deer and the risk associated with the presence of humans because most lynx mortalities are caused by humans (recreational harvest, poaching, vehicle collisions). We described the distribution of the reproductive portion of the lynx population based on snow-track observations of females with dependent kittens collected over 10 yr (19972006) in southern Norway. We used the ecological-niche factor analysis to examine how lynx distribution was influenced by roe deer, human activity, habitat type, environmental productivity and elevation. Our first prediction that lynx should be found in areas of relatively high roe deer abundance was supported. However, our second prediction that lynx should avoid human activity was rejected, and lynx instead occupied areas more disturbed in average than those available (with the exception of the most densely occupied areas). Lynx, however, avoided the most disturbed areas and our third prediction of a trade-off between abundance of prey and avoidance of human activity was supported. On the one hand, roe deer in the most disturbed areas benefit to a large extent from current human land use practices, potentially allowing them to escape predation from lynx. On the other hand, the situation is not so favourable for the predators who are restricted in competition refuges with medium to low prey densities. The consequence is that lynx conservation will have to be achieved in a human modifed environment where the potential for a range of conflicts and high human-caused mortality will remain a constant threat.

TI  - Predicting the continuum between corridors and barriers to animal movements using Step Selection Functions and Randomized Shortest Paths.
PY  - 2015
AB  - The loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitat everywhere on Earth prompts increasing attention to identifying landscape features that support animal movement (corridors) or impedes it (barriers). Most algorithms used to predict corridors assume that animals move through preferred habitat either optimally (e.g. least cost path) or as random walkers (e.g. current models), but neither extreme is realistic. We propose that corridors and barriers are two sides of the same coin and that animals experience landscapes as spatiotemporally dynamic corridor-barrier continua connecting (separating) functional areas where individuals fulfil specific ecological processes. Based on this conceptual framework, we propose a novel methodological approach that uses high-resolution individual-based movement data to predict corridor-barrier continua with increased realism. Our approach consists of two innovations. First, we use step selection functions (SSF) to predict friction maps quantifying corridor-barrier continua for tactical steps between consecutive locations. Secondly, we introduce to movement ecology the randomized shortest path algorithm (RSP) which operates on friction maps to predict the corridor-barrier continuum for strategic movements between functional areas. By modulating the parameter Ѳ, which controls the trade-off between exploration and optimal exploitation of the environment, RSP bridges the gap between algorithms assuming optimal movements (when Ѳ approaches infinity, RSP is equivalent to LCP) or random walk (when Ѳ → 0, RSP → current models). Using this approach, we identify migration corridors for GPS-monitored wild reindeer (Rangifer t. tarandus) in Norway. We demonstrate that reindeer movement is best predicted by an intermediate value of Ѳ, indicative of a movement trade-off between optimization and exploration. Model calibration allows identification of a corridor-barrier continuum that closely fits empirical data and demonstrates that RSP outperforms models that assume either optimality or random walk. The proposed approach models the multiscale cognitive maps by which animals likely navigate real landscapes and generalizes the most common algorithms for identifying corridors. Because suboptimal, but non-random, movement strategies are likely widespread, our approach has the potential to predict more realistic corridor-barrier continua for a wide range of species.

TI  - Testing the linearity of the response to combined greenhouse gas and sulfate aerosol forcing
PY  - 2004
AB  - [1] Detection and attribution studies of the temperature response to anthropogenic greenhouse gases and tropospheric sulfate aerosol have relied on the assumption that the responses to each of these forcings add linearly. Using surface temperature from three ensembles of integrations of the second Hadley Centre coupled model (HadCM2) forced with observed changes in greenhouse gases alone, the direct effect of sulfate aerosol alone, and combined changes in greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol, we test this assumption. We examine the residual, defined as the response to the combined forcings, minus the sum of the responses to the individual forcings, and compare its distribution with that of control variability. Considering both global mean changes and changes at each grid point, we find no evidence that the responses to greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol combine nonlinearly in HadCM2.

TI  - Water‐level fluctuations regulate the structure and functioning of natural lakes
PY  - 2015
AB  - Summary Despite becoming one of the main pressures on aquatic ecosystems globally, understanding of the ecological impacts of altered water-level regimes in lakes lags far behind that of other human disturbances (e.g. eutrophication, acidification). We employed a multifaceted approach to explore the potential importance of water-level fluctuations (WLF) for the structure and functioning of littoral zones and multiple trait responses of primary producers and benthic consumers across a range of natural lakes. We found that lakes with high WLF had significantly more coarse littoral substrata with less coverage of macrophyte vegetation in the shallows than in lakes with low WLF. Lakes with high WLF also had greater proportions of motile diatom species and omnivorous benthic invertebrates in shallow waters, altered taxonomic and trophic structure of benthic consumers and more homogeneous algal and benthic invertebrate assemblages. Variation along the littoral depth gradient needs to be examined when assessing the impacts of hydrological pressures in lakes. We found that depth interacted with WLF in its effects on habitat structure and mediated the response of both producer and consumer benthic assemblages to WLF. Our results indicate that amplified WLF significantly affect both the structure and functioning of lake ecosystems. Given the growing importance of WLF as an increasingly pervasive pressure on lake ecosystems worldwide, our findings have important implications for the conservation and management of global aquatic biodiversity. Inclusion of both biological traits and sampling along a depth gradient in existing and in future monitoring programmes could improve significantly the ability to detect and predict effects of altered patterns of WLF on lake ecosystems.

TI  - Characterization factors for water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions based on freshwater fish species extinction.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Human-induced changes in water consumption and global warming are likely to reduce the species richness of freshwater ecosystems. So far, these impacts have not been addressed in the context of life cycle assessment (LCA). Here, we derived characterization factors for water consumption and global warming based on freshwater fish species loss. Calculation of characterization factors for potential freshwater fish losses from water consumption were estimated using a generic species-river discharge curve for 214 global river basins. We also derived characterization factors for potential freshwater fish species losses per unit of greenhouse gas emission. Based on five global climate scenarios, characterization factors for 63 greenhouse gas emissions were calculated. Depending on the river considered, characterization factors for water consumption can differ up to 3 orders of magnitude. Characterization factors for greenhouse gas emissions can vary up to 5 orders of magnitude, depending on the atmospheric residence time and radiative forcing efficiency of greenhouse gas emissions. An emission of 1 ton of CO₂ is expected to cause the same impact on potential fish species disappearance as the water consumption of 10-1000 m³, depending on the river basin considered. Our results make it possible to compare the impact of water consumption with greenhouse gas emissions.

PY  - 1998
AB  - <jats:p>The tolerance of lynxes <jats:italic>Lynx lynx</jats:italic> to human presence and disturbance in a hunted population in Norway was studied using telemetry. Forest land within 200 metres from the nearest road or house was avoided by lynxes when resting (P &lt; 0.01). The tolerance distance of resting lynxes towards intruding people was short (median 50 m), though strongly correlated with the horizontal vegetation cover (partial correlation, P &lt; 0.02) and forest maturation stage (partial correlation, P &lt; 0.02), but not with terrain inclination (partial correlation, P &gt; 0.3). The lynxes did not enter steeper country (P &gt; 0.4) or alter their daily walking distance (P &gt; 0.7) after being disturbed. The data indicate that lynxes, even when suffering extensive, man‐induced mortality, may tolerate high human activity within their range as long as sufficient stands of undisturbed, mature forest with dense horizontal cover are present.</jats:p>

TI  - Anthropogenic impact on past and present fire regimes in a boreal forest landscape of southeastern Norway
PY  - 2005
AB  - Fire-scarred wood samples from 50 stumps, snags, and living trees of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were dendrochronologically cross-dated to describe an 800 year long fire history of Eldferdalen Nature Reserve (~6 ha) and its surroundings (~4000 ha) in southeastern Norway. In the western part of the study area, we recorded 55 different fires within a 200 ha area around the reserve between 1511 and 1759 and a mean fire interval in single samples of 24.6 years. The composite mean fire interval for the nature reserve was 10.5 years. Fire intervals were longer in the eastern part of the study area, with a single sample mean fire interval of 49.1 years. Only three fires were detected af- ter 1759, the last one in 1822. Based on historical accounts, we assume that the high number of fires and short fire in- tervals were influenced by deliberate ignition for agricultural purposes, most likely burning to improve the conditions for cattle grazing and slash-and-burn cultivation. We suggest that the cessation of fires was influenced by the increased value of timber and mining activity, thereby leading to increased interest in conservation of the timber resources. Resume : Des echantillons de bois portant des cicatrices de feu et provenant de 50 souches, chicots et tiges vivantes de pin sylvestre (Pinus sylvestris L.) ont ete dates par recoupement a l'aide de la dendrochronologie pour reconstituer l'historique des incendies sur une periode de 800 ans dans la reserve naturelle Eldferdalen (~6 ha) et aux alentours (~4000 ha) dans le sud-est de la Norvege. Dans la partie ouest de l'aire d'etude, les auteurs ont identifie 55 incendies differents a l'interieur d'une zone de 200 ha autour de la reserve entre 1511 et 1759 et un intervalle moyen entre les incendies dans les echantillons uniques de 24,6 annees. L'intervalle moyen compose entre les incendies pour la reserve naturelle etait de 10,5 annees. Les intervalles entre les incendies etaient plus longs dans la partie est de l'aire d'etude avec un intervalle moyen entre les incendies dans les echantillons uniques de 49,1 ans. Seulement trois incendies ont ete detectes apres 1759, le dernier etant survenu en 1822. Sur la base de comptes rendus historiques, ils assument que le nombre et la frequence eleves des incendies ont ete influences par des allumages deliberes a des fins agricoles, fort probablement le brulage pour ameliorer les conditions de pâturage pour le betail et la culture itinerante sur brulis. Les auteurs croient que les incendies ont cesse a cause de la valeur accrue du bois et de l'activite miniere et, par conse- quent, de l'interet croissant pour la conservation des ressources ligneuses.

TI  - How effective are European agri‐environment schemes in conserving and promoting biodiversity?
PY  - 2003
AB  - Summary 1. Increasing concern over the environmental impact of agriculture in Europe has led to the introduction of agri-environment schemes. These schemes compensate farmers financially for any loss of income associated with measures that aim to benefit the environment or biodiversity. There are currently agri-environment schemes in 26 out of 44 European countries. 2. Agri-environment schemes vary markedly between countries even within the European Union. The main objectives include reducing nutrient and pesticide emissions, protecting biodiversity, restoring landscapes and preventing rural depopulation. In virtually all countries the uptake of schemes is highest in areas of extensive agriculture where biodiversity is still relatively high and lowest in intensively farmed areas where biodiversity is low. 3. Approximately $ 24·3 billion has been spent on agri-environment schemes in the European Union (EU) since 1994, an unknown proportion of it on schemes with biodiversity conservation aims. We carried out a comprehensive search for studies that test the effectiveness of agri-environment schemes in published papers or reports. Only 62 evaluation studies were found originating from just five EU countries and Switzerland (5). Indeed 76% of the studies were from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where until now only c . 6% of the EU agri-environmental budget has been spent. Other studies were from Germany (6), Ireland (3) and Portugal (1). 4. In the majority of studies, the research design was inadequate to assess reliably the effectiveness of the schemes. Thirty-one percent did not contain a statistical analysis. Where an experimental approach was used, designs were usually weak and biased towards giving a favourable result. The commonest experimental design (37% of the studies) was a comparison of biodiversity in agri-environment schemes and control areas. However, there is a risk of bias if either farmers or scheme co-ordinators select the sites for agri-environment schemes. In such cases the sites are likely to have a higher biodiversity at the outset compared to the controls. This problem may be addressed by collecting baseline data (34% of studies), comparing trends (32%) or changes (26%) in biodiversity between areas with and without schemes or by pairing scheme and control sites that experience similar environmental conditions (16%). 5. Overall, 54% of the examined species (groups) demonstrated increases and 6% decreases in species richness or abundance compared with controls. Seventeen percent showed increases for some species and decreases for other species, while 23% showed no change at all in response to agri-environment schemes. The response varied between taxa. Of 19 studies examining the response of birds that included a statistical analysis, four showed significant increases in species richness or abundance, two showed decreases and nine showed both increases and decreases. Comparative figures for 20 arthropod studies yielded 11 studies that showed an increase in species richness or abundance, no study showed a decrease and three showed both increases and

TI  - Size‐Specific Interactions in Lake Systems: Predator Gape Limitation and prey Growth Rate and Mortality
PY  - 1996
AB  - To study the effects of different predators on the behavior and dynamics of their prey, we compared the performance of perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the abundance of their prey resource in four lakes with two different types of piscivory. In two of the lakes, perch were the only fish species present and piscivory was restricted to cannibalism. In the other two lakes, perch co-occurred with piscivorous pike (Esox lucius). Pike grow to larger sizes and can capture larger prey than piscivorous perch. Therefore, perch reach a size refuge earlier in the lakes without pike. Perch in the lakes lacking pike used both the epilimnion and hypolimnion habitats of the lakes, and a high proportion of the perch occurred below the thermocline. In contrast, perch in the lakes with pike were mainly captured along the littoral zone and were never captured below the thermocline. This difference in habitat use was reflected in different diets of perch in the different lakes. Perch in the lakes with pike were also less abundant than those in the lakes lacking pike and the growth rates of individual perch and the densities of predator-sensitive prey (pelagic and littoral) were higher, indicating that the presence of pike resulted in decreased intraspecific competition in perch. Evidence for a behavioral response to predation risk was found in 1+ (1 yr old) perch, which was suggested to be due to predation risk from both larger perch and pike. It is hypothesized that the use of the cold-water hypolimnion habitat by perch in the lakes lacking pike was a response of perch to reduce metabolic demands under conditions of severe resource limitation. Differences in gape limitation between predators species are suggested to have major effects on size-dependent mortalities and growth rates in prey and thereby on overall community dynamics. Evidence for this latter effect was observed in differences in zoo- plankton size structure between the lakes with and without pike.

TI  - Fire Management for Biodiversity in the European Boreal Forest
PY  - 2001
AB  - Past fire regimes may indicate under what conditions species have been able to exist in the past, but they do not provide clear and easy answers as to how the boreal landscape should be managed today. First, fire regimes have changed considerably over time through the effects of a changing climate, and sometimes even more dramatically through the influence of humans. Therefore it is unlikely that a close quantitative link exists between fire regime and biodiversity. Alternatively, if there is such a link, then biodiversity should have been highly variable in the past, even at the landscape scale. Second, it is impossible to re-enact all fire variables within forestry, particularly those operating at the landscape scale. An alternative to the superficial ''emulation'' of the past, which is so often claimed in today's forest management, would be to identify critical processes and habitats at the stand and landscape scale and find ways to maintain these at sufficient levels. This requires detailed knowledge ...

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation in lightning ignitions in Sweden
PY  - 1993
AB  - Analysis of fire statistics revealed that there are steep gradients in the distribution of lightning-caused fire ignitions in Sweden. The highest ignition density was found in the southeastern provinces of Kalmar and Osterg6tland, ca. 0.23/10 000 ha/yr. From there, densities generally declined both to the north and to the west, with a density averaging ca. 0.05 in the six northernmost provinces, and an equally low density in the southwestern province of Halland. For both northern and southern Sweden, lightning ignitions peaked in early July, but in the south the season for ignitions started 2 - 3 weeks earlier and ended 2 - 3 weeks later. The geographical gradients in lightning ignition density correspond to the aver- age precipitation during summer. The patterns of lightning ignition densities may also indicate gradients in natural fire frequencies. This hypothesis is supported by the distribution of certain fire-adapted plant species.

TI  - Remote sensing and GIS for habitat quality monitoring: New approaches and future research
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat quality is the ability of the environment to provide conditions appropriate for individual and species persistence. Measuring or monitoring habitat quality requires complex integration of many properties of the ecosystem, where traditional terrestrial data collection methods have proven extremely time-demanding. Remote sensing has known potential to map various ecosystem properties, also allowing rigorous checking of accuracy and supporting standardized processing. Our Special Issue presents examples where remote sensing has been successfully used for habitat mapping, quantification of habitat quality parameters, or multi-parameter modelling of habitat quality itself. New frontiers such as bathymetric scanning, grassland vegetation classification and operational use were explored, various new ecological verification methods were introduced and integration with ongoing habitat conservation schemes was demonstrated. These studies show that remote sensing and Geoinformation Science for habitat quality analysis have evolved from isolated experimental studies to an active field of research with a dedicated community. It is expected that these new methods will substantially contribute to biodiversity conservation worldwide.

TI  - From overlooking to concealed: predator avoidance in an apex carnivore
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many prey species select bed sites that reduce the risk of being caught off guard. We investigated bed sites used by an apex predator (gray wolf, Canis lupus) before and after individuals were approached by humans (N = 48 trials). On 9 out of 10 days, the unprovoked wolves rested at sites high in the terrain with a good overview (overlooking sites). After being approached, they resettled on more concealed sites lower in the terrain. Solitary yearlings used less overlooking sites than adults both before and after disturbance. The study provides experimental evidence that wolves’ behavioural response to approaching humans is analogous to predator avoidance in prey species.

TI  - Does Repeated Human Intrusion Cause Cumulative Declines in Avian Richness and Abundance
PY  - 1996
AB  - Human intrusion, the mere presence of people in the environment, has be- come a dominant form of disturbance in many landscapes. Some forms of intrusion from recreationists and other groups occur repeatedly and can seriously alter avian reproduction, survival, and habitat use. Accordingly, repeated intrusion has the potential to cause impacts that accumulate through time and that are manifested as progressive declines in avian richness and abundance. From 1989 to 1993, we experimentally assessed whether or not temporally cumulative impacts occurred in Wyoming bird communities as a result of re- peated intrusion by solitary hikers; the intrusions lasted 1-2 h each week during 10 con- secutive weeks of each year's breeding season. We tested a priori hypotheses about declines in overall richness and abundance, relative richness and abundance for sets of common and uncommon species, richness and abundance for six guilds, and separate abundances of four common species. Relative richness and abundance for the set of common species were the only metrics to exhibit significant declines between years during the 5-yr period. The declines in these variables, however, were not cumulative. At a statistical power level of 0.85, minimum detectable differences for many variables were small enough to have allowed easy detection of substantive declines, had any occurred. The yearly effects we detected for some richness and abundance variables may not have led to cumulative declines because individuals displaced one year may have been replaced in subsequent years, and some individuals each year may have habituated to or learned to tolerate the intrusions. For the avian communities and intrusion levels we studied, managers should focus on trying to preclude or ameliorate short-term impacts. Attempts to identify the types and intensities of intrusion that actually cause cumulative declines in richness and abundance should continue. Data about intrusions that do not generate cumulative declines, such as those presented here, are just as important as data about intrusions that do cause cumulative declines; managers need both to define the scope of intrusion disturbances that can lead to cumulative impacts in avian communities. Information about the cumulative effects of intrusion should be used by conservation biologists, wildlife managers, and land-use plan- ners to decide whether or how to control intrusion.

TI  - Human Culture and Large Carnivore Conservation in North America
PY  - 1996
AB  - We examined and compared human attitudes toward wolves (Canis lupus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis), and mountain lions (Puma concolor) in North America, with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada. Primary research, literature review, and secondary data were in- cluded in the analysis. Wolves were historically persecuted by Euro-American settlers, but they have been the focus of a significant attitudinal transformation during the latter half of this century. Many now view the wolf in positive and protective ways. Considerable variation remains, however, in contemporary attitudes. At- titudes toward mountain lions have been highly ambivalent, never assuming the prominence or clarity of views on wolves. The behavior and physiology of the species, along with human psychological factors, are im- portant reasons for the difference in human perceptions of wolves and mountain lions. We also examined at- titudes toward grizzly bears. Many indigenous cultures revered grizzly bears, although European settlers were interested in exploiting and eliminating them. Today, perceptions of grizzly bears range from positive to negative. Our recommendations include targeting key groups with education programs, building support through the use of spokespeople within the target groups, integrating human and ecological concerns, and de- signing species-specific education initiatives in some cases.

TI  - Fire as the dominant driver of central Canadian boreal forest carbon balance
PY  - 2007
AB  - Changes in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and fire regimes have been occurring for decades in the global boreal forest, with future climate change likely to increase fire frequency--the primary disturbance agent in most boreal forests. Previous attempts to assess quantitatively the effect of changing environmental conditions on the net boreal forest carbon balance have not taken into account the competition between different vegetation types on a large scale. Here we use a process model with three competing vascular and non-vascular vegetation types to examine the effects of climate, carbon dioxide concentrations and fire disturbance on net biome production, net primary production and vegetation dominance in 100 Mha of Canadian boreal forest. We find that the carbon balance of this region was driven by changes in fire disturbance from 1948 to 2005. Climate changes affected the variability, but not the mean, of the landscape carbon balance, with precipitation exerting a more significant effect than temperature. We show that more frequent and larger fires in the late twentieth century resulted in deciduous trees and mosses increasing production at the expense of coniferous trees. Our model did not however exhibit the increases in total forest net primary production that have been inferred from satellite data. We find that poor soil drainage decreased the variability of the landscape carbon balance, which suggests that increased climate and hydrological changes have the potential to affect disproportionately the carbon dynamics of these areas. Overall, we conclude that direct ecophysiological changes resulting from global climate change have not yet been felt in this large boreal region. Variations in the landscape carbon balance and vegetation dominance have so far been driven largely by increases in fire frequency.

TI  - NUMBERS AND SIZES OF FIRES: LONG-TERM SPATIALLY EXPLICIT FIRE HISTORY IN A SWEDISH BOREAL LANDSCAPE
PY  - 2000
AB  - The spatial display of fire over time on the landscape is ecologically important, and spatially explicit analyses offer a possibility of revealing anthropogenic influence on fire regimes. Nonetheless few such analyses have been attempted for longer time frames. We identified past fires in a northern Swedish boreal landscape using fire scars on Pinus sylvestris trees. Within a 19 × 32 km area, local fire chronologies were established at 203 points by cross-dating fire scars on 1133 wood samples, the earliest dating back to the 1100s. A total of 349 separate fires were identified to location and size. The estimated number of fires per unit area and time (after correcting for varying sample density over time) was relatively constant at 0.095 fires·(104 ha)−1·yr−1 from 1350 to 1650. It increased gradually thereafter, except for a low period in the early 1700s, peaked at 1.17 fires·(104 ha)−1·yr−1 in the mid-1800s, and then dropped dramatically after 1860. The proportion of the area burned per unit time also increased after 1650, in parallel with the increase in the number of fires (although much less strongly due to a counteracting trend in fire size), from an annual rate of 0.8% prior to 1650 to 2.8% in the mid-1800s. Prior to 1650, 90% of the total burned area was due to fires larger than 1000 ha, compared to 55% after 1650. This decrease in fire size with increasing number of fires may be an intrinsic property of the system: a negative feedback caused by lack of fuel in early succession. Fire intervals shorter than 15 yr were rare, and there was an increase in the hazard of burning during the first 3–5 decades after fire, suggesting an effect of fuel accumulation. Thus, the proportion of the area burned per unit time does not increase linearly with the number of fires in the landscape, because the probability that fires will stop at boundaries with recently burned areas increases over fires. The changes in the number of fires per unit time mirror changes in the cultural use of the land, i.e., the gradual expansion of permanent settlements in the area after the late 1600s. They are not explained by changes in climate records. This suggests that the increase in fire numbers from the second half of the 1600s represents an increase in anthropogenic fires. Before 1650, the number of fires detected per unit area and time was only marginally different from the present-day density of lightning ignitions in the region (∼ 0.1 fires·(104 ha)−1·yr−1), whereas during the mid 1800s it was 11.7 times higher. These results show that large alterations in the fire regime can occur without substantial changes in the proportion of area burned per unit time, as exemplified by the trend after 1650, when there were concurrent changes in the number of fires and in average fire size. Therefore, the number of fire events per unit area and time should be an important variable in the analysis of fire history and its underlying causes.

TI  - The influence of humic substances on lacustrine planktonic food chains.
PY  - 1992
AB  - Humic substances (HS) might influence planktonic food chains in lakes in two ways: 1) by altering the physical or chemical environment and thus modifying autotrophic primary production and the dependent food chains; 2) by acting as a direct carbon/energy source for food chains. HS compete with phytoplankton for available quanta underwater and this effect is seen in the reduced euphotic zone depth in lakes with high concentrations of HS. Thus potential photosynthetic production is lower in the presence of HS. However, this effect can be offset in small lakes in which the depth of mixing is also reduced when HS concentrations are high. Complexation by HS of important nutrients such as iron and phosphorus may also restrict primary production. Evidence is accumulating that photosynthetic primary production is insufficient to support measured metabolic activity in humic lakes, which implies that metabolism of allochthonous HS underpins much of the observed activity. Studies of bacterial abundance and growth in the presence of HS support the view that bacteria are the most significant utilisers of HS. This use is apparently facilitated by photolysis of HS, particularly by short wavelength radiation. Bacteria are grazed by both micro-zooplankton (heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates and ciliates) and macrozooplankton. It is within this microbial community that the food chains derived from autotrophic and allotrophic sources interact. These effects of HS on food chains are discussed in relation to possible implications for the response of different lake types to eutrophication.

TI  - Can scar-based fire history reconstructions be biased? An experimental study in boreal Scots pine
PY  - 2013
AB  - Determining forest fire history is commonly based on fire scar dating with dendrochronological methods. We used an experimental setup to investigate the impacts of low-intensity prescribed fire on fire scar formation 8 years after fire in 12 young managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. Five stands were between 30 and 35 years old and seven were 45 years old at the time of burning. A total of 217 fire scars were recorded in 142 trees. The number of separate scars per tree originating from a single fire ranged from 1 to 6, with 67% of the trees having just one scar. The proportion of fire-scarred trees out of all trees per plot ranged from 0% to 30%, averaging 16.5% in young stands and 2.8% in older stands. Four of the 12 burned plots did not have any trees with fire scars, and these were all in the older age group. This means that in the older stands, in only three of seven plots (43%) did the fire leave scars from which fire can potentially be detected and dated afterwards. Our results suggest t...

TI  - The link between travel motives and activities in nature‐based tourism
PY  - 2013
AB  - Purpose – The essence of the demand for nature‐based tourism is an important issue seen from both an academic and practitioner's perspective. One approach to understanding it is to examine the relationship between tourists' travel motivations and activities. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to conduct an empirical study of the links between travel motivations and travel activities within the nature‐based tourism context.Design/methodology/approach – Performing a series of logistic regression analyses, the authors have adopted this approach to empirically investigate the travel motivations and activities (participated/planned to participate) of a sample of nature‐based tourists in Northern Norway.Findings – The study clearly confirms the strong link between travel motivations and activities. More specifically, the study findings are moderated by the fact that “Novelty”, “Prestige”, and “Physical activity” are the main sources of motivation for participating in whale safaris, fishing and hiking respe...

TI  - Demographic Side Effects of Selective Hunting in Ungulates and Carnivores
PY  - 2006
AB  - Selective harvesting regimes are often implemented because age and sex classes contribute differently to population dynamics and hunters show preferences associated with body size and trophy value. We reviewed the literature on how such cropping regimes affect the demography of the remaining population (here termed demographic side effects). First, we examined the implications of removing a large proportion of a specific age or sex class. Such harvesting strategies often bias the population sex ratio toward females and reduce the mean age of males, which may consequently delay birth dates, reduce birth synchrony, delay body mass development, and alter offspring sex ratios. Second, we reviewed the side effects associated with the selective removal of relatively few specific individuals, often large trophy males. Such selective harvesting can destabilize social structures and the dominance hierarchy and may cause loss of social knowledge, sexually selected infanticide, habitat changes among reproductive females, and changes in offspring sex ratio. A common feature of many of the reported mechanisms is that they ultimately depress recruitment and in some extreme cases even cause total reproductive collapse. These effects could act additively and destabilize the dynamics of populations, thus having a stronger effect on population growth rate than first anticipated. Although more experimental than observational studies reported demographic side effects, we argue that this may reflect the quite subtle mechanisms involved, which are unlikely to be detected in observational studies without rigorous monitoring regimes. We call for more detailed studies of hunted populations with marked individuals that address how the expression of these effects varies across mating systems, habitats, and with population density. Theoretical models investigating how strongly these effects influence population growth rates are also required.

TI  - Human-caused Disturbance Stimuli as a Form of Predation Risk
PY  - 2002
AB  - A growing number of studies quantify the impact of nonlethal human disturbance on the behavior and reproductive success of animals. Athough many are well designed and analytically sophisticated, most lack a theoretical framework for making predictions and for understanding why particular responses occur. Behavioral ecologists have recently begun to fill this theoretical vacuum by applying economic models of antipredator behavior to disturbance studies. In this emerging paradigm, predation and nonlethal disturbance stimuli create similar trade-offs between avoiding perceived risk and other fitness-enhancing activities, such as feeding, parental care, or mating. A vast literature supports the hypothesis that antipredator behavior has a cost to other activities, and that this trade-off is optimized when investment in antipredator behavior tracks short-term changes in predation risk. Prey have evolved antipredator responses to generalized threatening stimuli, such as loud noises and rapidly approaching objects. Thus, when encountering disturbance stimuli ranging from the dramatic, lowflying helicopter to the quiet wildlife photographer, animal responses are likely to follow the same economic principles used by prey encountering predators. Some authors have argued that, similar to predation risk, disturbance stimuli can indirectly affect fitness and population dynamics via the energetic and lost opportunity costs of risk avoidance. We elaborate on this argument by discussing why, from an evolutionary perspective, disturbance stimuli should be analogous to predation risk. We then consider disturbance effects on the behavior of individuals—vigilance, fleeing, habitat selection, mating displays, and parental investment—as well as indirect effects on populations and communities. A wider application of predation risk theory to disturbance studies should increase the generality of predictions and make mitigation more effective without over-regulating human activities.

TI  - An Introduction to Tree-Ring Dating
PY  - 1996
AB  - Tree-ring dating, or dendrochronology, is the study of the chronological sequence of annual growth rings in trees. This book--a seminal study in its field--provides a simple yet eloquent introduction to the discipline, explaining what a dendrochronologist does both in the field and in the laboratory. Authors Stokes and Smiley first explain the basic principles of tree-ring dating, then describe details of the process, step by step, from the time a sample is collected until it is incorporated into a master chronology. The book focuses on coniferous evergreens of the Southwest, particularly pinons, because they have wide geographic distribution, constitute a large population, and show excellent growth response to certain controlling factors. The book is specifically concerned with the task of establishing a calendar date for a wood or charcoal specimen. This concise but thorough explication of an important discipline will make dendrochonology more meaningful to students and professionals in archaeology, forestry, hydrology, and global change.

TI  - Meeting the ecological challenges of agricultural change: editors' introduction
PY  - 2003
AB  - 1. The global need for agricultural production has never been greater. Nor has it ever been more complex due to the needs to balance global food security, optimum production, technological innovation, the preservation of environmental functions and the protection of biodiversity. The role of ecologists in finding this balance is pivotal. 2. In support of this role, ecologists now have very substantial experience of agricultural systems. We can understand, recognize and sometimes predict, at least qualitatively, the effects of pesticide applications, fertilizer use, drainage, crop choices and habitat modifications on farmland organisms, agro-ecosystems or other ecosystems influenced by agricultural land. 3. In instances of greater uncertainty, for example under changing climates, where environmental stresses on ecosystems are interactive, and where ecosystem management or restoration must adapt to new technologies, the investigative skills and experience of ecologists are even more crucial in problem solving. 4. There are, nevertheless, contrasting examples of good and bad practice in knowledge-transfer between ecologists and the communities who need our knowledge. The UK farm-scale evaluations of genetically modified crops, for example, involved ecologists at all stages from design and data collection to advocating policy. By contrast, many European agri-environment projects appear to have been developed and evaluated with only modest ecological advice. We advocate fuller involvement of ecologists in the development and evaluation of the European Union Common Agricultural Policy. 5. This special profile of seven agriculturally related papers illustrates effectively the array of approaches used by applied ecologists in addressing agricultural questions: modelling, meta-analysis, surveys, transect studies, classical experiments, seedbank assays and process studies based on modern ecological methods. With over 20% of recent papers in the Journal of Applied Ecology reflecting agricultural issues, agro-ecology continues to represent one of the pre-eminent areas of applied ecology that is unlikely to diminish in importance.

TI  - From Greenland to green lakes: Cultural eutrophication and the loss of benthic pathways in lakes
PY  - 2003
AB  - Benthic community responses to lake eutrophication are poorly understood relative to pelagic responses. We compared phytoplankton and periphyton productivity along a eutrophication gradient in Greenland, U.S., and Danish lakes. Phytoplankton productivity increased along the phosphorus gradient (total phosphorus [TP] 5 2‐430 mg m 23 ), but whole-lake benthic algal productivity decreased, substantially depressing increases in primary productivity at the whole-lake scale. In shallow, oligotrophic Greenland lakes, periphyton was responsible for 80‐98% of primary production, whereas in Danish lakes with TP . 100 mg m 23 , phytoplankton were responsible for nearly 100% of primary production. Benthic contributions ranged from 5 to 80% depending on morphometry and littoral habitat composition in lakes with intermediate phosphorus concentrations. Thus, eutrophication was characterized by a switch from benthic to pelagic dominance of primary productivity. Carbon stable isotope analysis showed that the redistribution of primary production entailed a similar shift from periphyton to phytoplankton in the diets of zoobenthos. Benthic and pelagic habitats were energetically linked through food web interactions, but eutrophication eroded the benthic primary production pathway.

TI  - Hydropower-Induced Land Use Change in Fincha'a Watershed, Western Ethiopia: Analysis and Impacts
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract The present article analyzes the land use dynamics caused by hydropower dam construction in 1973 in the Fincha'a watershed (1318 km2), a tributary of the Blue Nile. Aerial photos (1957 and 1980) and an ASTER satellite image of 2001 were used to make 3 land use maps of the watershed using a geographic information system (GIS). The 239-km2 water reservoir inundated 100 km2 of grazing land, 120 km2 of swamp, 18 km2 of cropland, and 1.2 km2 of forestland. In 2001, cropland covered 77% of the land potentially available for community use, indicating that there is hardly any free land available for expansion to accommodate new farmers. Relocated communities operate on relatively small parcels of land situated either on steep slopes or in flood-prone areas. Consequently, they exhaustively utilize the trees available on their holdings, and convert grassland and bush-land to cropland, without applying sufficient soil conservation measures. Farmers resettled at or near bodies of water and swamps, however, a...

TI  - Edge Effects and the Extinction of Populations Inside Protected Areas
PY  - 1998
AB  - Theory predicts that small populations may be driven to extinction by random fluctuations in demography and loss of genetic diversity through drift. However, population size is a poor predictor of extinction in large carnivores inhabiting protected areas. Conflict with people on reserve borders is the major cause of mortality in such populations, so that border areas represent population sinks. The species most likely to disappear from small reserves are those that range widely-and are therefore most exposed to threats on reserve borders-irrespective of population size. Conservation efforts that combat only stochastic processes are therefore unlikely to avert extinction.

TI  - Fires and Climate in Forested Landscapes of the U.S. Rocky Mountains
PY  - 2003
AB  - Scattered reports indicate that the number of fires or area burned has increased recently in parts of the northern temperate zone, but is climatic change responsible? Annual number of fires and area burned have generally increased since about 1950 in Canada and Sweden (Stocks 1991), the Rocky Mountains (Qu and Omi 1994; Fig. 5.1a) and the western United States (Arno 1996; Fig. 5.1b). However, trends in fire statistics may in part reflect increasing ability to monitor fires (Ryan 1976; Qu and Omi 1994). Moreover, in Canada and in Yellowstone National Park, trends are dominated by a few exceptional fire years in the 1980s (Stocks 1991; Balling, Meyer, and Wells 1992a). Also suppression of fires decades ago may have increased fuel loads, leading to the larger fires seen now (Covington and Moore 1994). Finally the landscape may shape potential responses to climatic change, leading to disequilibrium between climate and fires (Baker 1995). Identifying a climatic signal in historical fire data may thus require more understanding of how climate, fuels, the landscape, and land-use practices separately and jointly shape fire regimes. To organize a discussion of the present state of understanding in the Rocky Mountains, I contrast a view that emphasizes how broad-scale patterns of climate and fuels control fire regimes, with a contingent view in which local spatial constraints and historical legacies may limit general trends. While these perspectives on what is important underlie models, empirical studies, and theories, they are seldom explicit. Models that represent the broad-scale view, for example, suggest that fires may hasten the response of vegetation to climatic

TI  - Monitoring archaeological sites in a changing landscape–using multitemporal satellite remote sensing as an ‘early warning’ method for detecting regrowth processes†
PY  - 2007
AB  - In the coastal areas of North Norway farm abandonment followed by regrowth and reforestation is a major factor leading to landscape change. One consequence of this change is that archaeological sites are lost. A survey programme started by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage in 1997, aimed at monitoring the condition of archaeological sites listed in the Norwegian National Sites and Monuments Record, has documented that regrowth processes represent a threat to the sites. The extent of the problem of regrowth and reforestation of archaeological sites is mostly unknown, however, and efficient coping strategies are not developed. In this article we present a change detec- tionmethodbased onthe use ofthe Normalized DifferenceVegetation Index (NDVI) applied to Landsat images with different acquisition dates, followed by image differencing. This procedure results in an easilyinterpretable andextremelyquick approach to change detection ofland coveraswellas change in biomass, and it can be used as a'first warning'method to indicate archaeological sites threatened by regrowth processes. The method as it is applied in this study appears to be most suitable for monitoring changesin the infield areaswhere contrasts are clearest.Furtherdevelopment ispossible, both at the regional level using medium resolution satellite remote sensing where the aim is to detect significant changes in the agricultural as well as the cultural landscape, and at the site level, where use ofthe same method on data from high-resolution sensorswillallowmonitoring ofthe site on avery detailed scale.

TI  - Tolerance to humans of resting lynxes Lynx lynx in a hunted population
PY  - 1998
AB  - The tolerance of lynxes Lynx lynx to human presence and disturbance in a hunted population in Norway was studied using telemetry. Forest land within 200 metres from the nearest road or house was avoided by lynxes when resting (P 0.3). The lynxes did not enter steeper country (P > 0.4) or alter their daily walking distance (P > 0.7) after being disturbed. The data indicate that lynxes, even when suffering extensive, man-induced mortality, may tolerate high human activity within their range as long as sufficient stands of undisturbed, mature forest with dense horizontal cover are present.

TI  - Fire history recorded on pine trunks and stumps: Influence of land use and fires on forest structure in North Karelia
PY  - 1998
AB  - Dendrochronological dating of fire scars was used to determine the history of forest fires, and the effects of the fires and of slash‐and‐burn cultivation on forest structure were studied in eastern Finland. A total of 67 fire years were dated over an area of 26 km2. Forest fires increased towards the end of the 17th century and again towards the end of the 18th century, but decreased markedly in the middle of the 19th century. The mean fire interval was shorter near the historically known slash‐and‐burn cultivation areas than elsewhere. A forest survey map from 1913 was used to reconstruct the forest structure after the cessation of slash‐and‐burn cultivation and forest fires. This map showed that most of the younger forests were situated near old slash‐and‐burn cultivation areas, while the older forests were situated farther away from these. The proportion of deciduous trees decreased with increasing distance from slash‐and‐burn cultivation areas.

TI  - ECOSYSTEM SUBSIDIES: TERRESTRIAL SUPPORT OF AQUATIC FOOD WEBS FROM 13C ADDITION TO CONTRASTING LAKES
PY  - 2005
AB  - Whole-lake additions of dissolved inorganic C-13 were used to measure allochthony (the terrestrial contribution of organic carbon to aquatic consumers) in two unproductive lakes (Paul and Peter Lakes in 2001), a nutrient-enriched lake (Peter Lake in 2002), and a dystrophic lake (Tuesday Lake in 2002). Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of delta(13)CO(2); and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of delta(13)C in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony. In the three experiments without nutrient enrichment, flows of terrestrial carbon to dissolved and particulate organic carbon, zooplankton, Chaoborus, and fishes were substantial. For example, terrestrial sources accounted for more than half the carbon flow to juvenile and adult largemouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiners, brook sticklebacks, and fathead minnows in the unenriched experiments. Allochthony was highest in the dystrophic lake and lowest in the nutrient-enriched lake. Nutrient enrichment of Peter Lake decreased allochthony of zooplankton from 0.34-0.48 to 0-0.12, and of fishes from 0.51-0.80 to 0.25-0.55. These experiments show that lake ecosystem carbon cycles, including carbon flows to consumers, are heavily subsidized by organic carbon from the surrounding landscape.

TI  - Century-scale climate forcing of fire regimes in the American Southwest
PY  - 2000
AB  - Interannual time-scale associations between fire occurrence and drought indices, the Southern Oscil- lation, and other synoptic patterns demonstrate that large-scale, long-term atmospheric features are precursors to regional fire activity. However, our knowledge of fire-climate relations over longer (century) timescales is fragmentary because of the rarity of comparable climate and fire time-series with sufficient resolution, length and regional extent. In this study, we develop reconstructions of wildfire occurrence from tree-ring data col- lected from northwestern New Mexico to compare with a millennium-length dendroclimatic reconstruction of precipitation. Reconstructions of both wildfires and climate show simultaneous changes since ad 1700 that indicate climate forcing of wildfire regimes on interannual to century timescales. Following a centuries-long dry period with high fire frequency (c. ad 1400-1790), annual precipitation increased, fire frequency decreased, and the season of fire shifted from predominantly midsummer to late spring. We hypothesize that these shifts in fire regimes reflect long-term changes in rainfall patterns associated with changes in synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and the Southern Oscillation. Our evidence supports century-scale climate forcing of fire regimes in the American Southwest, providing a useful analogue of future wildfire regimes expected under changing global climate conditions.

TI  - Holocene fire disturbance in the boreal forest of central Sweden
PY  - 2013
AB  - Holocene fire disturbance and vegetation history were reconstructed using macroscopic charcoal and pollen accumulation rates from two lake sediment records (Holtjarnen and Klotjarnen) collected in the boreal forest of central Sweden. The records were used to examine the potential drivers associated with changes in fire regime. Climate, vegetation and human activity were all identified as factors variously influencing the fire regime. In the early Holocene, near bicentennial fire return intervals were regionally widespread, suggesting that fire disturbance was largely regulated by climate at that time. In the mid- and late Holocene, vegetation exerted an important control on the fire regime. During the mid-Holocene, the expansion of thermophilous broadleaf vegetation offset the influence of warmer climate by altering the local microclimate and by changing the structure and flammability of the available fuels. During the transition to the late Holocene, thermophilous vegetation decreased in abundance and Pinus increased, resulting in a more flammable forest even though the climate was cooling and moistening. Fire disturbance correspondingly increased. The modern boreal forest was established in the late Holocene as Picea expanded regionally as the climate cooled, moistened, and became increasingly continental. Although no change in the frequency of fire was apparent at this time, increased stand densities likely facilitated greater fuel consumption in subsequent fires. Within the last millennium, human action markedly modified the forested landscape, altering the fire regime.

TI  - Predicting the depth and volume of lakes from map-derived parameters
PY  - 2011
AB  - The volume and depth of a lake are basic properties that greatly affect a wide array of its physical, chemical, and biological properties. Nevertheless, volume and depth data are scarce in lake-rich regions of the world. We coupled the Swedish lake register to GIS-derived geographical and topographical parameters, attempting to predict the volume and depth of 6943 lakes from map-derived parameters only. Lake area and the maximum slope in a 50 m wide zone outside of the lake shoreline were the most important predictors of both lake volume and depth, explaining 92% of the variance in lake volume but ˂40% of the variance in both maximum and mean depth. Regression parameters of regional submodels of lake volume were similar across geographically and topographically different regions, indicating that the model probably is applicable for glacially formed lakes in general. Despite the high degree of explanation for lake volume, the uncertainty in predicted volume for a single lake is considerable (relative standard deviation, ±57%). However, the mean or cumulative lake volume of catchments containing several lakes (n > 15) is predictable from map-derived parameters with a greatly reduced uncertainty.

TI  - The driving forces of landscape change in Europe: a systematic review of the evidence
PY  - 2016
AB  - Over the past decades, landscapes worldwide have experienced changes (e.g., urbanization, agricultural intensification, expansion of renewable energy uses) at magnitudes that put their sustainability at risk. The understanding of the drivers of these landscape changes remains challenging, partly because landscape research is spread across many domains and disciplines. We here provide a systematic synthesis of 144 studies that identify the proximate and underlying drivers of landscape change across Europe. First, we categorize how driving forces have been addressed and find that most studies consider medium-term time scales and local spatial scales. Most studies assessed only one case study area, one spatial scale, and less than four points in time. Second, we analyze geographical coverage of studies and reveal that countries with a non-European Union/European Free Trade Association membership; low Gross Domestic Product; boreal, steppic, and arctic landscapes; as well as forestland systems are underrepresented in the literature. Third, our review shows that land abandonment/extensification is the most prominent (62% of cases) among multiple proximate drivers of landscape change. Fourthly, we find that distinct combinations of mainly political/institutional, cultural, and natural/spatial underlying drivers are determining landscape change, rather than single key drivers. Our systematic review indicates knowledge gaps that can be filled by: (a) expanding the scope of studies to include underrepresented landscapes; (b) clarifying the identification and role of actors in landscape change; (c) deploying more robust tools and methods to quantitatively assess the causalities of landscape change; (d) setting up long-term studies that go beyond mapping land-cover change only; (e) strengthening cross-site and cross-country comparisons of landscape drivers; (f) designing multi-scale studies that consider teleconnections; (g) considering subtle and novel processes of landscape change.

TI  - Atlantic SSTs control regime shifts in forest fire activity of Northern Scandinavia.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Understanding the drivers of the boreal forest fire activity is challenging due to the complexity of the interactions driving fire regimes. We analyzed drivers of forest fire activity in Northern Scandinavia (above 60 N) by combining modern and proxy data over the Holocene. The results suggest that the cold climate in northern Scandinavia was generally characterized by dry conditions favourable to periods of regionally increased fire activity. We propose that the cold conditions over the northern North Atlantic, associated with low SSTs, expansion of sea ice cover, and the southward shift in the position of the subpolar gyre, redirect southward the precipitation over Scandinavia, associated with the westerlies. This dynamics strengthens high pressure systems over Scandinavia and results in increased regional fire activity. Our study reveals a previously undocumented teleconnection between large scale climate and ocean dynamics over the North Atlantic and regional boreal forest fire activity in Northern Scandinavia. Consistency of the pattern observed annually through millennium scales suggests that a strong link between Atlantic SST and fire activity on multiple temporal scales over the entire Holocene is relevant for understanding future fire activity across the European boreal zone.

TI  - Resistance of the boreal forest to high burn rates
PY  - 2014
AB  - Boreal ecosystems and their large carbon stocks are strongly shaped by extensive wildfires. Coupling climate projections with records of area burned during the last 3 decades across the North American boreal zone suggests that area burned will increase by 30–500% by the end of the 21st century, with a cascading effect on ecosystem dynamics and on the boreal carbon balance. Fire size and the frequency of large-fire years are both expected to increase. However, how fire size and time since previous fire will influence future burn rates is poorly understood, mostly because of incomplete records of past fire overlaps. Here, we reconstruct the length of overlapping fires along a 190-km-long transect during the last 200 y in one of the most fire-prone boreal regions of North America to document how fire size and time since previous fire will influence future fire recurrence. We provide direct field evidence that extreme burn rates can be sustained by a few occasional droughts triggering immense fires. However, we also show that the most fire-prone areas of the North American boreal forest are resistant to high burn rates because of overabundant young forest stands, thereby creating a fuel-mediated negative feedback on fire activity. These findings will help refine projections of fire effect on boreal ecosystems and their large carbon stocks.

TI  - Production of juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., and brown trout, Salmo trutta L., within different sections of a small enriched Norwegian river
PY  - 1990
AB  - Growth, density and production of juvenile Atlantic salmon and brown trout were studied in three different sections of the Kvassheimsana River in south-western Norway from 1979 to 1983. Section 1. in the upper part of the river, is located above a waterfall impassable for migratory salmonids and is surrounded by grazing land. Sections 2 and 3, in the middle and lower parts of the river, are influenced by agricultural activity. Total nitrogen concentration varied between 250 and 1000 μg l −1 in section 1 and 1500 and 2500 μg l−1 in sections 2 and 3. Total phosphorus (Tot-P) concentrations also increased with decreasing altitude: 19–46 μg l−1 in section I and 31–101 μg l −1 in sections 2 and 3. The number of 0 + salmon in sections 2 and 3 varied between 30.1 and 167.8 specimens 100 m −2, with means 90.2 and 95.2 specimens 100 m −2:, respectively; the density of 1 + salmon, with mean values of 16.3 and 51.0 specimens 100m−2 was significantly correlated with the original fry density. The growth rate of 0+ salmon was not inversely related to cohort density, but was significantly so for 1 + salmon. Mean annual salmon production in section 2 was 1595 g 100 m−2 year 1, and in section 3 was 841 g 100m−2 year 1. A logarithmic function gave the best curve fit between salmon production and mean annual biomass. Thus, production levelled off for the highest values recorded in section 2, and perhaps approached the carrying capacity of the stream. A multiple regression analysis showed that yearly variation in 1 + salmon density was the single factor accounting for most of the total variability in production (60%). Variation in water temperature and nutrient content were not significantly related to variation in fish production. Densities of brown trout were low in all sections (<20 specimens 100m −2). Fry density was highest in section 3 and parr density in section 1. All age groups of sympatric brown trout grew significantly faster in sections 2 and 3 compared with allopatric brown trout in section 1.

TI  - Detecting the effect of climate change on Canadian forest fires
PY  - 2004
AB  - [1] The area burned by forest fires in Canada has increased over the past four decades, at the same time as summer season temperatures have warmed. Here we use output from a coupled climate model to demonstrate that human emissions of greenhouse gases and sulfate aerosol have made a detectable contribution to this warming. We further show that human-induced climate change has had a detectable influence on the area burned by forest fire in Canada over recent decades. This increase in area burned is likely to have important implications for terrestrial emissions of carbon dioxide and for forest ecosystems.

TI  - Modification of normalised difference water index (NDWI) to enhance open water features in remotely sensed imagery
PY  - 2006
AB  - The normalized difference water index (NDWI) of McFeeters (1996) was modified by substitution of a middle infrared band such as Landsat TM band 5 for the near infrared band used in the NDWI. The modified NDWI (MNDWI) can enhance open water features while efficiently suppressing and even removing built‐up land noise as well as vegetation and soil noise. The enhanced water information using the NDWI is often mixed with built‐up land noise and the area of extracted water is thus overestimated. Accordingly, the MNDWI is more suitable for enhancing and extracting water information for a water region with a background dominated by built‐up land areas because of its advantage in reducing and even removing built‐up land noise over the NDWI.

TI  - Assessing the response of area burned to changing climate in western boreal North America using a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) approach
PY  - 2009
AB  - Fire is a common disturbance in the North American boreal forest that influences ecosystem structure and function. The temporal and spatial dynamics of fire are likely to be altered as climate continues to change. In this study, we ask the question: how will area burned in boreal North America by wildfire respond to future changes in climate? To evaluate this question, we developed temporally and spatially explicit relationships between air temperature and fuel moisture codes derived from the Canadian Fire Weather Index System to estimate annual area burned at 2.5° (latitude x longitude) resolution using a Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) approach across Alaska and Canada. Burned area was substantially more predictable in the western portion of boreal North America than in eastern Canada. Burned area was also not very predictable in areas of substantial topographic relief and in areas along the transition between boreal forest and tundra. At the scale of Alaska and western Canada, the empirical fire models explain on the order of 82% of the variation in annual area burned for the period 1960-2002. July temperature was the most frequently occurring predictor across all models, but the fuel moisture codes for the months June through August (as a group) entered the models as the most important predictors of annual area burned. To predict changes in the temporal and spatial dynamics of fire under future climate, the empirical fire models used output from the Canadian Climate Center CGCM2 global climate model to predict annual area burned through the year 2100 across Alaska and western Canada. Relative to 1991-2000, the results suggest that average area burned per decade will double by 2041-2050 and will increase on the order of 3.5-5.5 times by the last decade of the 21st century. To improve the ability to better predict wildfire across Alaska and Canada, future research should focus on incorporating additional effects of long-term and successional vegetation changes on area burned to account more fully for interactions among fire, climate, and vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Evolution and behavioural responses to human-induced rapid environmental change.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Almost all organisms live in environments that have been altered, to some degree, by human activities. Because behaviour mediates interactions between an individual and its environment, the ability of organisms to behave appropriately under these new conditions is crucial for determining their immediate success or failure in these modified environments. While hundreds of species are suffering dramatically from these environmental changes, others, such as urbanized and pest species, are doing better than ever. Our goal is to provide insights into explaining such variation. We first summarize the responses of some species to novel situations, including novel risks and resources, habitat loss/fragmentation, pollutants and climate change. Using a sensory ecology approach, we present a mechanistic framework for predicting variation in behavioural responses to environmental change, drawing from models of decision-making processes and an understanding of the selective background against which they evolved. Where immediate behavioural responses are inadequate, learning or evolutionary adaptation may prove useful, although these mechanisms are also constrained by evolutionary history. Although predicting the responses of species to environmental change is difficult, we highlight the need for a better understanding of the role of evolutionary history in shaping individuals’ responses to their environment and provide suggestion for future work.

TI  - Home range, activity and movements of a wolf pack in central Italy
PY  - 1997
AB  - Home range, habitat use, activity and movement patterns were studied in a pack of wolves in a mountainous region of Abruzzo, central Italy from June 1986 to March 1987. The home range, estimated by the minimum convex polygon from 421 radio locations, measured 197 km2 and comprised several infrastructures and areas of human presence, including four garbage dumps and two offal sites. Core areas, calculated by the harmonic mean method, were located toward the centre of the home range where human disturbance and road density were lowest but forest cover was highest. During the time-span of the study, home-range use and movement patterns suggested a marked centrality in spatial behaviour and traditionality in retreat areas year-round, both during pup-rearing season and the following months. In addition, by being essentially nocturnal, resident wolves appeared to adopt tactics of temporal segregation from people to exploit food resources safely in the proximity of human settlements. Overall activity correlated with distance travelled (r = 0.90, P << 0.001), and corresponded to cyclic nocturnal movements from retreat to feeding areas. Wolf movement rate between 20:00 and 04:00 h averaged 2.5 km/h but varied up to about 8 km/h, and daily distance travelled (x= 27 km/night; range 17–38 km/night) mostly depended on the location of traditional feeding sites. Home-range configuration, habitat use, activity and movements all appeared highly integrated so as to represent the most functional compromise between avoidance of human inteference and exploitation of the available food resources.

TI  - Outdoor recreation research: Different approaches, different values?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Different approaches to outdoor recreation research influence how recreational values are articulated. The article presents a theoretical comparison between two recreation research traditions that have been influential in both Norwegian outdoor recreation research and American wilderness research and management. The authors compare how both research traditions fit two predefined valuation models, with one model oriented towards economists’ perception of values and the other oriented towards humanistic philosophy. They contend that the two research traditions are connected in their conceptual construct of values. Studies labelled ‘motivational recreation research’ fit with an economic-oriented value model, whereas ‘place-oriented recreation research’ puts greater emphasis on non-utilitarian values compatible with a constitutive value model. Consideration of the kind of values that a given research tradition promotes is very important for research outputs and management practice.

TI  - Water body detection and delineation with Landsat TM data.
PY  - 2000
AB  - The aim of this project was to determine the accuracy of using simple digital image processing techniques to map riverine water bodies with Landsat 5 TM data. This paper quantifies the classification accuracy of single band density slicing of Landsat 5 TM data to delineate water bodies on riverine floodplains. The results of these analyses are then compared to a 6-band maximum likelihood classification over the same area. The water boundaries delineated by each of these digital classification procedures were compared to water boundaries delineated from colour aerial photography acquired on the same day as the TM data. These comparisons show that Landsat TM data can be used to map water bodies accurately. Density slicing of the single mid-infrared band 5 proved as successful as multispectral classification achieving an overall accuracy of 96.9%, a producer's accuracy for water bodies of 81.7% and a user's accuracy for water bodies of 64.5%.

TI  - Extent, Distribution, and Ecological Role of Fire in Russian Forests
PY  - 2000
AB  - Russia has a complex system for classification of land use and land cover of forested areas. All lands managed by the federal government are part of Russia’s forest fund (FF), which in 1993 contained 1,180.9 million ha (64.4% of the total land area of Russia). The FF is divided into two main categories: (1) forestlands (886.5 million ha) that include areas designated for forests; and (2) nonforestlands (294.4 million ha) that include unproductive and unused lands (e.g., bogs, rocks, tundras) and land converted to human use (e.g., roads, pastures, farms). In turn, the forestland category consists of: (1) forested areas occupied by closed forests (763.5 million ha); and (2) unforested areas designated for forests but temporarily unforested, including burns and dead stands, natural sparse forests (open woodlands), and unregenerated clear-cut areas (123.0 million ha).

TI  - Quantifying Land Use Impacts on Biodiversity: Combining Species–Area Models and Vulnerability Indicators
PY  - 2015
AB  - Habitat degradation and subsequent biodiversity damage often take place far from the place of consumption because of globalization and the increasing level of international trade. Informing consumers and policy makers about the biodiversity impacts “hidden” in the life cycle of imported products is an important step toward achieving sustainable consumption patterns. Spatially explicit methods are needed in life cycle assessment to accurately quantify biodiversity impacts of products and processes. We use the Countryside species–area relationship (SAR) to quantify regional species loss due to land occupation and transformation for five taxa and six land use types in 804 terrestrial ecoregions. Further, we calculate vulnerability scores for each ecoregion based on the fraction of each species’ geographic range (endemic richness) hosted by the ecoregion and the IUCN assigned threat level of each species. Vulnerability scores are multiplied with SAR-predicted regional species loss to estimate potential global...

TI  - Modelling wildlife–human relationships for social species with mixed‐effects resource selection models
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary 1. Resource selection functions (RSF) have contributed to the conservation of species negatively affected by human activities. Despite these applications, two assumptions frequent many studies: the assumption of independence among groups in social species, and that selection is proportional to resource availability. This latter case is known as a functional response in resource selection, and may be especially important in human-wildlife relationships where there is a fitness cost of proximity to humans. 2. Recent advances in generalized linear mixed models offer new ways to account for resource selection in social species and functional responses by accommodating correlations within hierarchical groups with random intercepts, and functional responses with random coefficients. 3. We illustrate the application of mixed-effects RSF models using a case study of resource selection by individual wolves Canis lupus living in packs as a function of human activity. 4. In areas of low human activity, wolf resource selection was independent of proximity to humans. As human activity increased, wolves displayed a functional response selecting areas closer to human activity. With increasing human activity, however, wolves displayed spatio-temporal avoidance of human activity during daylight. This could lead to behaviourally induced trophic cascades mediated by wolf avoidance of human activity, and fits within the framework of attractive sink habitats. 5. Accounting for the hierarchical social structure of wolves clearly showed that the response of wolves to human disturbance was strongly correlated, but different, within packs, and that the correlation was strongest during winter and weakest during summer. 6. Syntheses and applications. Failure to consider the social structure of wolves and the functional response to human activity would result in mistaken conclusions about wolf-human relationships. Our approach provides a unifying framework to understand the contradictory results of previous studies of wolf-human relationships and a template for future studies to evaluate effects of increas ing human activity on wildlife.

TI  - Thinking globally and siting locally – renewable energy and biodiversity in a rapidly warming world
PY  - 2014
AB  - Increasing greenhouse gas emissions are projected to raise global average surface temperatures by 3˚-4 °C within this century, dramatically increasing the extinction risk for terrestrial and freshwater species and severely disrupting ecosystems across the globe. Limit- ing the magnitude of warming and its devastating impacts on biodiversity will require deep emissions reductions that include the rapid, large-scale deployment of low-carbon renewable energy. Concerns about potential adverse impacts to species and ecosystems from the expan- sion of renewable energy development will play an important role in determining the pace and scale of emissions reductions and hence, the impact of climate change on global biodiversity. Efforts are underway to reduce uncertainty regarding wildlife impacts from renewable energy development, but such uncertainty cannot be eliminated. We argue the need to accept some and perhaps substantial risk of impacts to wildlife from renewable energy development in order to limit the far greater risks to biodiversity loss owing to climate change. We propose a path forward for better reconciling expedited renewable energy development with wildlife conservation in a warming world.

TI  - Recovery of large carnivores in Europe’s modern human-dominated landscapes
PY  - 2014
AB  - The conservation of large carnivores is a formidable challenge for biodiversity conservation. Using a data set on the past and current status of brown bears (Ursus arctos), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), gray wolves (Canis lupus), and wolverines (Gulo gulo) in European countries, we show that roughly one-third of mainland Europe hosts at least one large carnivore species, with stable or increasing abundance in most cases in 21st-century records. The reasons for this overall conservation success include protective legislation, supportive public opinion, and a variety of practices making coexistence between large carnivores and people possible. The European situation reveals that large carnivores and people can share the same landscape.

TI  - Sport hunting, predator control and conservation of large carnivores
PY  - 2009
AB  - Sport hunting has provided important economic incentives for conserving large predators since the early 1970's, but wildlife managers also face substantial pressure to reduce depredation. Sport hunting is an inherently risky strategy for controlling predators as carnivore populations are difficult to monitor and some species show a propensity for infanticide that is exacerbated by removing adult males. Simulation models predict population declines from even moderate levels of hunting in infanticidal species, and harvest data suggest that African countries and U.S. states with the highest intensity of sport hunting have shown the steepest population declines in African lions and cougars over the past 25 yrs. Similar effects in African leopards may have been masked by mesopredator release owing to declines in sympatric lion populations, whereas there is no evidence of overhunting in non-infanticidal populations of American black bears. Effective conservation of these animals will require new harvest strategies and improved monitoring to counter demands for predator control by livestock producers and local communities.

TI  - Scale Dependent Behavioral Responses to Human Development by a Large Predator, the Puma
PY  - 2013
AB  - The spatial scale at which organisms respond to human activity can affect both ecological function and conservation planning. Yet little is known regarding the spatial scale at which distinct behaviors related to reproduction and survival are impacted by human interference. Here we provide a novel approach to estimating the spatial scale at which a top predator, the puma (Puma concolor), responds to human development when it is moving, feeding, communicating, and denning. We find that reproductive behaviors (communication and denning) require at least a 4× larger buffer from human development than non-reproductive behaviors (movement and feeding). In addition, pumas give a wider berth to types of human development that provide a more consistent source of human interference (neighborhoods) than they do to those in which human presence is more intermittent (arterial roads with speeds >35 mph). Neighborhoods were a deterrent to pumas regardless of behavior, while arterial roads only deterred pumas when they were communicating and denning. Female pumas were less deterred by human development than males, but they showed larger variation in their responses overall. Our behaviorally explicit approach to modeling animal response to human activity can be used as a novel tool to assess habitat quality, identify wildlife corridors, and mitigate human-wildlife conflict.

TI  - Relating juvenile spatial distribution to breeding patterns in anadromous salmonid populations
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. Spatial within-population heterogeneity in density probably affects competition intensity and may have a fundamental role in shaping population dynamics and carrying capacity. This may be particularly relevant for organisms where limitations on juvenile mobility cause maternal choice of breeding locations to influence the spatial distribution of younger life stages. 2. In this study, we mapped redd locations and the resulting densities of juveniles the following year along the entire reach (9·2 km) of a river holding natural populations of anadromous salmonids (Atlantic salmon and brown trout). These data were used to quantify the spatial scale over which breeding influences juvenile densities, and hence becomes important for density-dependent processes. 3. Although the observed cumulative distributions indicated a relatively uniform distribution of breeding along the river, autocorrelation analyses identified spatial patchiness of both breeding and resulting juveniles on a local scale. Furthermore, cross-correlations suggested a close spatial relationship between distribution of redds and juveniles. 4. Using spatially explicit hockey-stick stock–recruitment functions, we found juvenile salmonid density to be mostly influenced by the amount of breeding upstream of a given location. This influence decreased rapidly within the first 75–150 m. Thus, female choice with regard to breeding location gave rise to a heterogeneous distribution of offspring on a spatial scale of almost two orders of magnitude finer than that of the whole population (9·2 km). 5. The results are consistent with smaller scale experimental studies of salmonids, and emphasize the role for maternal choice of breeding locations in causing substantial spatial heterogeneity in juvenile densities within natural populations. Due to effects of density heterogeneity on overall levels of competition, this adds another layer of complexity to the dynamics of salmonid populations even in populations where breeding appears to be relatively uniformly distributed through space, and potentially also for a range of other organisms where juvenile dispersal is constrained.

TI  - Framing the relationship between people and nature in the context of European conservation.
PY  - 2015
AB  - A key controversy in conservation is the framing of the relationship between people and nature. The extent to which the realms of nature and human culture are viewed as separate (dualistic view) or integrated is often discussed in the social sciences. To explore how this relationship is represented in the practice of conservation in Europe, we considered examples of cultural landscapes, wildlife (red deer, reindeer, horses), and protected area management. We found little support, for a dualistic worldview, where people and nature are regarded as separate in the traditional practice of conservation in Europe. The borders between nature and culture, wild and domestic, public land and private land, and between protected areas and the wider landscape were blurred and dynamic. The institutionalized (in practice and legislation) view is of an interactive mutualistic system in which humans and nature share the whole landscape. However, more dualistic ideals, such as wilderness and rewilding that are challenging established practices are expanding. In the context of modern day Europe, wilderness conservation and rewilding are not valid for the whole landscape, although it is possible to integrate some areas of low-intervention management into a wider matrix. A precondition for success is to recognize and plan for a plurality of values concerning the most valid approaches to conservation and to plan for this plurality at the landscape scale.

TI  - Freshwater Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Biogeographic Units for Freshwater Biodiversity Conservation
PY  - 2008
AB  - ABSTRACT We present a new map depicting the first global biogeographic regionalization of Earth's freshwater systems. This map of freshwater ecoregions is based on the distributions and compositions of freshwater fish species and incorporates major ecological and evolutionary patterns. Covering virtually all freshwater habitats on Earth, this ecoregion map, together with associated species data, is a useful tool for underpinning global and regional conservation planning efforts (particularly to identify outstanding and imperiled freshwater systems); for serving as a logical framework for large-scale conservation strategies; and for providing a global-scale knowledge base for increasing freshwater biogeographic literacy. Preliminary data for fish species compiled by ecoregion reveal some previously unrecognized areas of high biodiversity, highlighting the benefit of looking at the world's freshwaters through a new framework.

TI  - Modelling pink-footed goose ( Anser brachyrhynchus ) wintering distributions for the year 2050: potential effects of land-use change in Europe
PY  - 2008
AB  - Feeding on farmland by overwintering populations of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) conflicts with agricultural interests in Northern Europe. In order to forecast the potential future of this conflict, we used generalized linear models to relate the presence and absence of pink-footed geese to variables describing the contemporary landscape, and predicted their future distributions in relation to two land-use scenarios for the year 2050. One future scenario represented a global, economically orientated world (A1) and the other represented a regional, environmentally concerned world (B2). The probability of goose occurrence increased within cropland and grassland, and could be explained by their proximity to coast, elevation, and the degree of habitat closure. Predictions to future scenarios revealed noticeable shifts in the suitability of goose habitat evident at the local and regional scale in response to future shifts in land use. In particular, as grasslands and croplands give way to unsuitable land-use types (e.g. woody biofuel crops, increased urbanization, and forest) under both future scenarios, our models predicted a decrease in habitat suitability for geese. If coupled with continued goose population expansion, we expect that the agricultural conflict will intensify under the A1 and particularly the B2 scenarios.

TI  - FIRE HISTORY IN NORTHERN PATAGONIA: THE ROLES OF HUMANS AND CLIMATIC VARIATION
PY  - 1999
AB  - The effects of humans and climatic variation on fire history in northern Patagonia, Argentina, were examined by dating fire scars on 458 trees at 21 sites in rain forests of Fitzroya cupressoides and xeric woodlands of Austrocedrus chilensis from 39° to 43° S latitude. Climatic variation associated with fires was analyzed on the basis of 20th-century observational records and tree ring proxy records of climatic variation since approximately AD 1500. In the Austrocedrus woodlands, fire frequency increases after about 1850, coincident with greater use of the area by Native American hunters. Increased burning, particularly in the zone of more mesic forests, is also strongly associated with forest clearing by European settlers from about 1880 to the early 1900s. The marked decline in fire frequency during the 20th century coincides with both the demise of Native American hunters in the 1890s and increasingly effective fire exclusion. Strong synchroneity in the years of widespread fire at sample sites disperse...

TI  - A Wolf at the Gate: The Anti-Carnivore Alliance and the Symbolic Construction of Community
PY  - 2003
AB  - Controversies over the return of large carnivores (e.g. wolves) are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural communities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modernization increases their diversity. However, the popular image is one of rural communities united against vermin and urban romantics. An important reason for this is probably the successful construction of the anti-carnivore front as a last line of defence against destructive forces threatening rural life. Drawing on examples from a study in Osterdalen, Norway, the struggle against wolf protection is discussed as an instance of symbolic construction of community. Images of a threatened community are vital to the self-understanding of the wolf adversaries, but cleavages run through the alliance. Three principal groups may be identified: sheep farmers, landowners who lease hunting, and people with strong ties to traditional land use practices (primarily hunting) and a rural working-class culture. These groups have not always been allies, and conflicts of interest run through the ‘resistance front’. The task here is to identify the social forces that now bring them together, and to explain why the carnivore issue is well suited as a significant component in their symbolic construction of community.

TI  - Effect of landscape connectivity on plant communities: a review of response patterns
PY  - 2019
AB  - Context Fragmentation in agricultural landscapes is considered as a major threat to biodiversity. Thus, ecological corridors are deployed at multiple scales to increase connectivity. However, there is limited consensus about their efficiency, especially for plants. Objectives We assimilated existing knowledge to assess whether and how landscape connectivity impacts plant communities. Methods We reviewed published literature across more than 20 years, providing an overview on the influence of connectivity on plant communities. Results We found that landscape connectivity has a varying and complex influence on the composition and diversity of plant communities (i.e. community taxonomic structure), due to the multiplicity of factors that modulate its effect. Our understanding of how of landscape connectivity impacts the dispersal of plants is improved by using biological traits (i.e. community functional structure). Finally, we showed that landscape connectivity promotes actual dispersal between connected communities. Conclusions This review emphasises the pertinence of trait-based and actual dispersal approaches to improve our understanding and ability to predict the effect of connectivity loss on plant communities, allowing us to identify new prospects for future research.

TI  - The ‘Little Ice Age’: Re-evaluation of an evolving concept
PY  - 2005
AB  - Matthews, J.A. and Briffa, K.R., 2005: The 'Little Ice Age': re- evaluation of an evolving concept. Geogr. Ann., 87 A (1): 17-36. ABSTRACT. This review focuses on the develop- ment of the 'Little Ice Age' as a glaciological and cli- matic concept, and evaluates its current usefulness in the light of new data on the glacier and climatic variations of the last millennium and of the Holocene. 'Little Ice Age' glacierization occurred over about 650 years and can be defined most pre- cisely in the European Alps (c. AD 1300-1950) when extended glaciers were larger than before or since. 'Little Ice Age' climate is defined as a shorter time interval of about 330 years (c. AD 1570-1900) when Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures (land areas north of 20°N) fell significantly below the AD 1961-1990 mean. This climatic definition overlaps the times when the Alpine glaciers attained their lat- est two highstands (AD 1650 and 1850). It is empha- sized, however, that 'Little Ice Age' glacierization was highly dependent on winter precipitation and that 'Little Ice Age' climate was not simply a matter of summer temperatures. Both the glacier-centred and the climate-centred concepts necessarily en- compass considerable spatial and temporal varia- bility, which are investigated using maps of mean summer temperature variations over the Northern Hemisphere at 30-year intervals from AD 1571 to 1900. 'Little Ice Age'-type events occurred earlier in the Holocene as exemplified by at least seven gla- cier expansion episodes that have been identified in southern Norway. Such events provide a broader context and renewed relevance for the 'Little Ice Age', which may be viewed as a 'modern analogue' for the earlier events; and the likelihood that similar events will occur in the future has implications for climatic change in the twenty-first century. It is con- cluded that the concept of a 'Little Ice Age' will re- main useful only by (1) continuing to incorporate the temporal and spatial complexities of glacier and climatic variations as they become better known, and (2) by reflecting improved understanding of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system and its forcing factors through the interaction of palaeoclimatic re- construction with climate modelling.

TI  - The effects of disturbance on behaviour, habitat use and energy of spring staging snow geese
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1 For many species, human-induced disturbances can severely influence an individual's pay-off; however, energy-cost variations from different disturbance types have rarely been reported. 2 We evaluated the dynamic behavioural responses of staging greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus to different types of disturbance in southern Quebec, Canada, between 1997 and 2000. We specifically considered the impact of a unique measure, a spring conservation hunt implemented in agricultural habitats in 1999. 3 We tracked 237 radio-tagged females for 2764 h and recorded 697 take-offs following fortuitous disturbance, scaring and hunting in three regions characterized by different habitats. Geese used cornfields in south-western Quebec, Scirpus marshes and hayfields in the upper St Lawrence estuary, and Spartina marshes and hayfields in the lower estuary. 4 Overall, disturbance levels increased in the upper and lower estuary during years with hunting, mostly through an increase in hunting and scaring activities. 5 The probability of geese returning to a refuge after disturbance in agricultural habitats increased in years with hunting except in the corn-growing region. The short-term energy gain of geese resuming feeding after disturbance was less than before disturbance, and this difference was greater in years with hunting. Distances flown after disturbance decreased with flock size and were longer after scaring and hunting than after fortuitous disturbances in the Scirpus region. 6 Overall, habitat use varied among years and associated estimated energy gain decreased markedly in both years with hunting in the Spartina and corn-growing region, but did not change in the Scirpus region. Changes in behaviour due to disturbance, and especially those associated with hunting, probably contributed to the reduced body condition of staging greater snow geese during years with hunting. 7 Synthesis and applications. From a methodological viewpoint, we highlight the importance of tracking the behaviour of individual animals after disturbance to properly evaluate its impact. From a conservation perspective, we provide empirical arguments to limit the hunting of breeding waterfowl during their prenuptial migration in order to facilitate their fattening and forthcoming reproduction. From a management standpoint, we suggest that a side-effect of disturbance induced by spring hunting to control overabundant populations may be reduced fattening and breeding output among birds that survive. Together, these data emphasize further the importance of measuring the direct and indirect effects of disturbance rather than assuming effects from the incidence of the disturbance alone.

TI  - Modeling fire interval data from the American southwest with the Weibull distribution
PY  - 1999
AB  - In this study, the Weibull distribution is tested as a possible model for fire interval data derived from dendrochronologically-dated fire scars from four sites in the American Southwest. Two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions were fit to fire interval data sets, and additional statistical descriptors based on the Weibull were derived to improve our understanding of the range of variability in presettlement fire regimes. The three-parameter models failed to provide improved fits versus the more parsimonious two-parameter models, indicating the Weibull shift parameter may be superfluous for Southwestern fire regimes. The Weibull Modal Interval (MOI) was a superior overall measure of central tendency, and appears to identify a common underlying structure in Southwestern fire regimes independent of habitat type and environmental gradients. Unusually short and long fire intervals were identified by the lower and upper exceedance intervals (LEI and UEI) and the Maximum Hazard Interval (MHI) based on the Weibull hazard function. Model statistics were nearly identical between two pairs of sites that were 260 kilometers distant that differed in topography, vegetation, and land-use history. However, differences were observed between sites only 10 kilometers apart, suggesting the influence of local factors (e.g., topography and substrate) over regional influences (e.g., climate). Although the Weibull models helped quantify the historical range of variability in presettlement fire regimes, ecological interpretations of the Weibull parameters proved difficult.

TI  - Searching for the fundamental niche using individual-based habitat selection modelling across populations
PY  - 2014
AB  - Strictly speaking, fundamental niches are inestimable. Nevertheless, ecologists attempt approximating them to understand species ’ distribution and plasticity to environmental changes, with invaluable repercussions on both theoretical and applied ecology. So far, individual-based habitat selection models only characterized realized niches of populations delimited by physical (e.g. fences), historical (colonization) and biotic (competition) barriers constraining access to a subset of resources available to the species. As populations with diff erent realized niches share the same fundamental niche, we developed a novel framework to scale-up response curves from population-scale habitat selection models to approximate the species ’ optimal habitat choices, unbiased by barriers constraining accessibility. We used GPS-locations from 147 wild mountain reindeer Rangifer t. tarandus , belonging to 7 of the remaining populations scattered throughout the subspecies ’ range. We linked individual choices to accessible habitat features using conditional-logistic regression with log-link function in a use-available design. Focal variables were modeled using 2nd degree polynomials on log-scale, which correspond to a Gaussian curve used to approximate the fundamental niche optimum (curve mean) and breadth (variance). Using both real and simulated data we demonstrate that robust approximations of a fundamental niche optimum and breadth can be estimated using a relatively small number of representative populations with relatively few individuals. While each classical realized niche model had strong predictive power for the focal population but poorly predicted across populations, the approximation of the fundamental niche allowed for robust inter-population comparisons in habitat quality. Th e proposed approach brings individual-based habitat selection models forward along the continuum from investigating the realized niche of a population towards investigating a species ’ fundamental niche, and allows us to quantify empirically the relationship between realized and fundamental niches. Th is allows improving the understanding of diff erences in fi tness among populations, the prediction of species ’ distributions and plasticity to environmental changes, and suggestions for mitigation priorities.

TI  - Life cycle assessment: Part 1: Framework, goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, and applications
PY  - 2004
AB  - Sustainable development requires methods and tools to measure and compare the environmental impacts of human activities for the provision of goods and services (both of which are summarized under the term "products"). Environmental impacts include those from emissions into the environment and through the consumption of resources, as well as other interventions (e.g., land use) associated with providing products that occur when extracting resources, producing materials, manufacturing the products, during consumption/use, and at the products' end-of-life (collection/sorting, reuse, recycling, waste disposal). These emissions and consumptions contribute to a wide range of impacts, such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone (smog) creation, eutrophication, acidification, toxicological stress on human health and ecosystems, the depletion of resources, water use, land use, and noise-among others. A clear need, therefore, exists to be proactive and to provide complimentary insights, apart from current regulatory practices, to help reduce such impacts. Practitioners and researchers from many domains come together in life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate indicators of the aforementioned potential environmental impacts that are linked to products-supporting the identification of opportunities for pollution prevention and reductions in resource consumption while taking the entire product life cycle into consideration. This paper, part 1 in a series of two, introduces the LCA framework and procedure, outlines how to define and model a product's life cycle, and provides an overview of available methods and tools for tabulating and compiling associated emissions and resource consumption data in a life cycle inventory (LCI). It also discusses the application of LCA in industry and policy making. The second paper, by Pennington et al. (Environ. Int. 2003, in press), highlights the key features, summarises available approaches, and outlines the key challenges of assessing the aforementioned inventory data in terms of contributions to environmental impacts (life cycle impact assessment, LCIA).

TI  - Visitors’ acceptance of negative ecological impacts in national parks: comparing the explanatory power of psychographic scales in a Norwegian mountain setting
PY  - 2013
AB  - Even in protected areas, it is inevitable that any human use will produce some impact on natural resources. This study identifies visitors’ tolerance of potential negative ecological impacts from tourism activities and facilities in a Norwegian national park context, based on park visitors’ expressed degree of acceptance of negative effects on particular species of wildlife (wild reindeer and raptors) and on vegetation. Attitudes were analysed using psychographic scales, reflecting respondents’ nature orientations, their specific facility desires, their preferences in a wilderness setting and their concerns about human interaction with the natural environment. Fourteen research hypotheses were tested. Findings demonstrated that the psychographic scales explained more variation in attitudes than most social background and trip characteristics. Higher levels of education among visitors were strongly associated with increased ecological concern; age and gender were not. There was generally strong ecological ...

TI  - Ecological implications of behavioural syndromes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract Interspecific trait variation has long served as a conceptual foundation for our understanding of ecological patterns and dynamics. In particular, ecologists recognise the important role that animal behaviour plays in shaping ecological processes. An emerging area of interest in animal behaviour, the study of behavioural syndromes (animal personalities) considers how limited behavioural plasticity, as well as behavioural correlations affects an individual’s fitness in diverse ecological contexts. In this article we explore how insights from the concept and study of behavioural syndromes provide fresh understanding of major issues in population ecology. We identify several general mechanisms for how population ecology phenomena can be influenced by a species or population’s average behavioural type, by within-species variation in behavioural type, or by behavioural correlations across time or across ecological contexts. We note, in particular, the importance of behavioural type-dependent dispersal in spatial ecology. We then review recent literature and provide new syntheses for how these general mechanisms produce novel insights on five major issues in population ecology: (1) limits to species’ distribution and abundance; (2) species interactions; (3) population dynamics; (4) relative responses to human-induced rapid environmental change; and (5) ecological invasions.

TI  - Relative importance of size-based competitive ability and degree of niche overlap in inter-cohort competition of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) juveniles
PY  - 2011
AB  - The competitive effect of older cohorts on younger cohorts may strengthen with increasing size differences owing to increasing differences in competitive abilities. Alternatively, it may weaken owing to increasing partitioning of resources as a result of ontogenetic niche shifts. Here, we test this by creating spatial variation in densities of one size class of overyearling Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and assess the effects on two size classes of young-of-the-year (YOY). The positive relationship between growth of overyearlings and final body size of YOY (a proxy for their growth) was steeper for the larger size class of YOY than for the smaller size class, which would be expected if the degree of niche overlap between two cohorts depended on their size difference. The negative relationship between overyearling density and YOY body size was also steeper for the larger size class (at least for body mass), suggesting that effects of body size differences on relative competitive abilities appear to be of l...

TI  - Sources, concentrations and characteristics of organic matter in softwater lakes and streams of the Swedish forest region
PY  - 1992
AB  - 18 Swedish forest lakes covering a wide range of dystrophy were studied in order to quantify and characterize the organic matter in the water with respect to origin (allochthonous or autochthonous), physical state (particulate or dissolved) and phosphorus content. Samples were collected repeatedly during a two-year period with unusually variable hydrological conditions. Water from three different depths and from tributaries was analysed with standard monitoring methods, including water colour, Secchi disk transparency, total organic carbon (TOC), CODCr, CODMn, total phosphorus and molybdate reactive phosphorus. Interrelationships were used to compare different methods and to assess the concentration and composition of organic matter. It is estimated that in remote softwater lakes of the Swedish forest region, autochthonous carbon is typically 200 g Pt m−3) the proportion can exceed 90%. Secchi depth readings were related similarly to organic matter from both sources and provided good estimates of TOC with a single optical measurement. Water colour was used to distinguish allochthonous and autochthonous matter. High concentrations of phosphorus were found in humic waters, most of it being molybdate reactive, and probably associated with humic matter rather than as dissolved free inorganic forms. CODMn yielded only 25–60% of TOC and appears to include mainly truly dissolved substances of low molecular weight.

TI  - Interactions between land use, habitat use, and population increase in greater snow geese: what are the consequences for natural wetlands?
PY  - 2005
AB  - The North American greater snow goose population has increased dramatically during the last 40 years. We evaluated whether refuge creation, changes in land use on the wintering and staging grounds, and climate warming have contributed to this expansion by affecting the distribution, habitat use, body condition, and migration phenology of birds. We also reviewed the effects of the increasing population on marshes on the wintering grounds, along the migratory routes and on the tundra in summer. Refuges established before 1970 may have contributed to the initial demographic increase. The most important change, however, was the switch from a diet entirely based on marsh plants in spring and winter (rhizomes of Scirpus/Spartina) to one dominated by crops (corn/young grass shoots) during the 1970s and 1980s. Geese now winter further north along the US Atlantic coast, leading to reduced hunting mortality. Their migratory routes now include portions of southwestern Quebec where corn production has increased exponentially. Since the mid-1960s, average temperatures have increased by 1–2.4°C throughout the geographic range of geese, which may have contributed to the northward shift in wintering range and an earlier migration in spring. Access to spilled corn in spring improved fat reserves upon departure for the Arctic and may have contributed to a high fecundity. The population increase has led to intense grazing of natural wetlands used by geese although these habitats are still largely undamaged. The foraging in fields allowed the population to exceed limits imposed by natural marshes in winter and spring, but also prevented permanent damage because of their overgrazing.

TI  - Potentials and limitations for human control over historic fire regimes in the boreal forest
PY  - 2007
AB  - Fire, being both a natural and cultural phenomenon, presents problems in disentangling the historical effect of humans from that of climate change. Here, we investigate the potential impact of humans on boreal fire regimes from a perspective of fuels, ignitions and culture. Two ways for a low technology culture to impact the fire regime are as follows: (i) by altering the number of ignitions and their spatial distribution and timing and (ii) by hindering fire spread. Different cultures should be expected to have quite different impacts on the fire regimes. In northern Fennoscandia, there is evidence for fire regime changes associated with the following: a reindeer herding culture associated with few ignitions above the natural; an era of cattle husbandry with dramatically increased ignitions and somewhat higher fire frequency; and a timber exploitation era with decreasing fire sizes and diminishing fire frequency. In other regions of the boreal zone, such schemes can look quite different, but we suggest that a close look at the resource extraction and land use of different cultures should be part of any analysis of past fire regimes.

TI  - Fire and age structure of Scots pine and Norway spruce in northern Sweden during the past 700 years
PY  - 1994
AB  - SUMMARY The performance of Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies (L.) Karst has been studied in relation to the fire regime from the 1200s up to present in an old-growth boreal forest area, The J-shaped age distribution of pine during the study period, suggests a stationary pattern in the landscape. The spruce age structure (from the 1600s onwards) also points towards a J-shape, although with slight deviations. No significant changes in total pine or spruce regeneration occurred in response to the significantly prolonged fire cycle (from 187 to 371 yr) around 1870. This break in the fire cycle might possibly have a climatic background.

TI  - Warming and Earlier Spring Increase Western U.S. Forest Wildfire Activity
PY  - 2006
AB  - Western United States forest wildfire activity is widely thought to have increased in recent decades, yet neither the extent of recent changes nor the degree to which climate may be driving regional changes in wildfire has been systematically documented. Much of the public and scientific discussion of changes in western United States wildfire has focused instead on the effects of 19th- and 20th-century land-use history. We compiled a comprehensive database of large wildfires in western United States forests since 1970 and compared it with hydroclimatic and land-surface data. Here, we show that large wildfire activity increased suddenly and markedly in the mid-1980s, with higher large-wildfire frequency, longer wildfire durations, and longer wildfire seasons. The greatest increases occurred in mid-elevation, Northern Rockies forests, where land-use histories have relatively little effect on fire risks and are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier spring snowmelt.

TI  - Ecological effects of water-level fluctuations in lakes: an urgent issue
PY  - 2008
AB  - Water-level fluctuations (WLF) affect the ecological processes and patterns of lakes in several ways. Aquatic habitats and feeding or breeding grounds are gained or lost, as light, climate and wave impacts change to mention only a few phenomena. While the phenomenon of WLF has been studied in many rivers (better known as flood pulse, Junk & Wantzen, 2004) and environmental flows (Coops et al., 2003), so far it has not received due attention in lakes (Coops et al., 2003). A potential reason for why WLF in lakes have been overlooked for such a long time may be that central Europe and North America—the cradles of limnological research—are situated in landscapes which have been shaped by man for long time. Most central European lakes have been regulated since the middle ages; therefore, naturally fluctuating lakes such as Lake Constance (Fig. 1) are rare today.

AB  - Phytoplankton biomass and production in lakes tend to be increased by phosphorus input and decreased by grazing or high levels of colored, dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We estimated and compared the effects of these three factors by using data from three lakes that were manipulated during 1991-1995, and data from a reference lake. Multivariate probability distributions of chlorophyll or primary production, as predicted by P input rate, DOC, and grazer length, were fit to the data. All three factors had substantial effects on chlorophyll, primary production, and their variability. Comparable reductions in the mean and variance of chlorophyll and primary production were achieved by reducing P input rate from 5 to 0.5 mg me2 d-l, increasing DOC from 5 to 17 mg C liter I, or increasing mean crustacean length from 0.2 to 0.85 mm. The negative effect of mean crustacean length (an index of size-selective predation) results from grazing by herbivorous zooplankton. The negative effect of DOC on primary producers could be explained by shading. The results suggest that natural variation in colored DOC concentrations is a major cause of variation in primary production.

In summer, salmon were always observed above the streambed, each holding a station over a single, unshaded stone. About 84% of the entire population occurred in the run habitat-type, 12% in riffles and 5% in pools. Underwater visual censuses showed the salmon to be continuously numerous in summer, but, as soon as water temperature fell to or below 10 °C in autumn, they disappeared from their stations and their visible population decreased by 92–98%. Thereafter, the salmon were found almost exclusively in sheltered substrate chambers beneath surface streambed stones. However, salmon distribution among runs, riffles, and pools (77, 18, and 5%, respectively) did not differ significantly from that in summer. Trapping, marking, and absolute population estimates indicated neither dwindling nor egress of the resident po...

TI  - Impacts of Land-Use Changes on the Lakes across the Yangtze Floodplain in China
PY  - 2017
AB  - The middle and lower Yangtze (MLY) floodplain has one of the most densely distributed lake clusters in China but suffered from long-term lake reclamation and wetland degradation due to intensive cultivation, fish rearing, and urban expansion over the past several decades. As a land-use alternation to support human life, the conversion of lakes to cropland, aquaculture ponds, and human settlements provides essential ecosystem goods at the expense of the deterioration of wetland environment. To quantify the driving factors of lake changes, we investigated the land-use transitions from lakes (≥1 km2) between 1975 and 2015 using Landsat remote sensing data. We found that the dramatic decline in lake area (a net decrease of 13.8 ± 1.4%) over the four decades was largely attributed to human-induced transformation from lakes to cropland, fish ponds, and built-up areas, accounting for 34.6%, 24.2%, and 2.5% of the total area reduction, respectively. The remaining loss, associated with vegetation (37.3%) and bare land (1.4%) and coming mainly from China's two largest freshwater lakes (Poyang and Dongting), can be explained by climate variation, sediment deposition, and hydrological regulation. These findings shed new light on the quantitative impacts of human activities and climate variation on lake changes and provide a scientific foundation for wetland management decision-making.

TI  - Factors regulating periphytic algal biomass
PY  - 1992
AB  - To assess the principal factors regulating periphytic algal communities, I conducted a field study along a productivity gradient of Swedish and Antarctic lakes ranging from extremely low productivity meltwater to highly productive lakes. Because the Antarctic lakes lack fish, as well as molluscs anId insect larvae, the data set provides considerable variation in food web composition, offering a rare opportunity to evaluate the importance of these factors in determining the biomass of periphytic algae. Among the possible factors investigated, water temperature, substrate characteristics, and food web composition seem to be of minor importance. Instead, there was a curvlinear relationship between the biomass of sediment-associated periphytic algae and lake productivity, suggesting a shift from nutrient limitation to light limitation caused by phytoplankton. A temporal study in the littoral zone of one of the lakes included in the spatial study showed that the temporal variation in periphyton biomass within the lake was low compared to the variation between lakes. Th,e temporal study also strengthened suggestions from the spatial study by pointing to nutrient availability as a major factor determining periphytic algal biomass. In phycological as well as in ecological literature, studies on periphytic (attached) algae are far more rare than studies on phytoplankton. In spite of that periphytic algae attain high biomass (Moss 1968; Hansson 1988a) and may contribute up to 80% of the primary production (Persson et al. 1977). Furthermore, periphytic algae are a major food resource for benthic invertebrates (Lamberti et al. 1989) and may retain part of the newly mineralized nutrients at the sediment surface, thereby having a competitive: impact on phytoplankton (Carlton and Wetzel 1988; Hansson 1989, 1990). Hence, the fact that periphytic algae are rare guests in the scientific literature is obviously not due to insignificance in the ecosystem. Instead, the reason is probably that the attached ialgal assemblage is far more difficult to work: with than the phytoplankton. Sampling i,s laborious and complicated and determination of primary production on natural substrata is difficult. Many methodological problems remain unsolved (Sundbgck 1983). Acknowledgments This study was supported with grants from the Crafoord Foundation and the Magnus Bergwall Foundation. Logistic support during fieldwork in Antarctica was provided by the Swedish Antarctic Research Program (SWEDARP). The Abisko Scientific Research Station provided logistic support during field studies in subarctic Sweden. Kathleen McTigue checked the English. Despite the apparent technical problems, it is important to improve the knowledge of periphytic algal dynamics because this life form constitutes an important link in lake ecosystems. My aim was to assess which factors are important -for periphytic algal growth in different types of lakes. My basic hypothesis is that the relative importance of each factor varies temporally within a lake and spatially among lakes. This hypothesis was tested in field survey studies by measuring the temporal and spatial variation in periphyton biomass and in some potentially regulating factors. The temporal study was performed in a southern Swedish lake over 13 months; the spatial study included 18 Antarctic and 16 Swedish lakes that varied in productivity from extremely low to very high. Variation in the biomass of periphytic algae may be caused by several factors, including substratum composition, temperature, grazing, light, and nutrient supply. The importance of these factors in determining periphyton biomass is still unknown, mainly because studies usually focus on one, or a few, of the factors. Several studies have demonstrated that perip hytic algae are co mpetitively depressed by phytoplankton (shading) in eutrophic lakes (Stevenson et al. 1985; Hansson 1988,a), suggesting a negative relation between periphytic algal biomass and productivity of lakes. Moreover, sediment-dwelling algae are known to take

TI  - Wolf response to two kinds of barriers in an agricultural habitat in Spain
PY  - 2005
AB  - We examined the effect of two kinds of barriers on an expanding gray wolf, Canis lupus L., 1758, popula- tion in an agricultural habitat in north-central Spain. The barriers were (i) a four-lane fenced highway along a flat area without wildlife-crossing facilities, and (ii) the River Duero Artery (RDA), comprising the river itself (50-100 m wide) and several small infrastructures along it. From March 1997 to October 2001, all 4 radio-collared wolves living <15 km from the highway (1 adult territorial male, 1 territorial breeder female, 1 dispersing male, and 1 female in 3 periods of her life (territorial immature, disperser, and territorial breeder) crossed it on between 4% and 33% of 45-163 monitor- ing days via vehicle bridges. Moreover, 4 more highways that we monitored in areas without radio-collared wolves have not delayed expansion of the increasing wolf population, suggesting that these highways are not an important bar- rier for wolves in our study area. In contrast, only 3 of 8 wolves radio-collared <5 km from the RDA were detected crossing it, and 2 of those 3 started to cross it only after severe habitat disturbance; in addition, the RDA seems to have delayed wolf expansion for some 15 years, which suggests that it is a semipermeable barrier for wolves. We dis- cuss the likely consequences of the RDA on the recovery of the Iberian wolf population. Resume : Nous examinons les effets de deux types de barrieres a l'expansion d'une population de loups gris, Canis lupus L., 1758, dans un habitat agricole dans le centre nord de l'Espagne. Les barrieres sont (i) une route cloturee a quatre voies dans une region plane sans amenagement prevu pour la traversee des animaux sauvages et (ii) le tronc principal du fleuve Duero (RDA) incluant la riviere elle-meme (50-100 m de large) et plusieurs petits ouvrages rive- rains. De mars 1997 a octobre 2001, les quatre loups munis de colliers emetteurs vivant a <15 km de la route (1 mâle adulte territorial, 1 femelle reproductrice territoriale, 1 mâle en periode de dispersion et 1 femelle durant trois phases de son cycle, soit celles d'immature territoriale, de femelle en dispersion et de reproductrice territoriale) ont traverse la route entr e4%e t 33 %d es44-165 jours d'observation en passant par les ponts pour vehicules. De plus, nous avons surveille quatre autres routes dans des regions ou les loups ne portaient pas de collier et celles-ci n'ont pas entrave l'expansion des populations de loup en croissance, ce qui laisse croire que ces routes ne constituent pas des barrieres serieuses pour les loups dans notre region. En revanche, seulement 3 des 8 loups munis de colliers emetteurs vivant a <5 km du RDA ont ete observes le traverser et 2 de ces 3 loups n'ont commence a le traverser qu'a lui suite d'importantes perturbations de leur habitat. De plus, le RDA semble avoir retarde l'expansion des loups durant environ 15 ans, ce qui laisse croire qu'il forme une barriere semi-permeable pour les loups. Les consequences probables du RDA sur la recuperation de la population iberique de loups fait l'objet d'une discussion. (Traduit par la Redaction) Blanco et al. 323

TI  - Characterizing wildfire regimes in the United States
PY  - 2005
AB  - Wildfires statistics for the conterminous United States (U.S.) are examined in a spatially and temporally explicit manner. We use a high-resolution data set consisting of 88,916 U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service wildfires over the time period 1970-2000 and consider wildfire occurrence as a function of ecoregion (land units classified by climate, vegetation, and topography), ignition source (anthropogenic vs. lightning), and decade. For the conterminous U.S., we (i) find that wildfires exhibit robust frequency-area power-law behavior in 18 different ecoregions; (ii) use normalized power-law exponents to compare the scaling of wildfire-burned areas between ecoregions, finding a systematic change from east to west; (iii) find that wildfires in the eastern third of the U.S. have higher power-law exponents for anthropogenic vs. lightning ignition sources; and (iv) calculate recurrence intervals for wildfires of a given burned area or larger for each ecoregion, allowing for the classification of wildfire regimes for probabilistic hazard estimation in the same vein as is now used for earthquakes.

AB  - Friedland, K. D., Hansen, L. P., Dunkley, D. A., and MacLean, J. C. 2000. Linkage between ocean climate, post-smolt growth, and survival of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in the North Sea area. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 57: 419–429. We examined two long-term tagging studies with wild salmon stocks in the North Sea area. The salmon stocks, the Figgjo in southern Norway and the North Esk in eastern Scotland, reside in relatively un-impacted rivers that continue to sustain healthy runs of salmon. The return rates for one seawinter fish (1SW), the predominant age at maturity for both stocks, were highly correlated. An analysis of sea surface temperature distributions for periods of high versus low return rate showed that when low sea surface temperatures dominate the North Sea and southern coast of Norway during May, salmon survival has been poor. Conversely, when high sea surface temperatures extend northward along the Norwegian coast during May, survival has been good. Ocean conditions can be further related to the recruitment process through growth studies for the North Esk stock. Post-smolt growth increments for returning 1SW fish showed that enhanced growth was associated with years during which temperature conditions were favorable, which in turn resulted in higher survival rates. The implicit linkage between growth and survival suggests that growth-mediated predation is the dominant source of recruitment variability. Mechanisms by which ocean climate may affect post-smolt growth are discussed. 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea

TI  - Human-Carnivore Conflict and Perspectives on Carnivore Management Worldwide
PY  - 2003
AB  - Carnivore conservation depends on the sociopolitical landscape as much as the biological landscape. Changing political attitudes and views of nature have shifted the goals of carnivore management from those based on fear and narrow economic interests to those based on a better understanding of ecosystem function and adaptive management. In parallel, aesthetic and scientific arguments against lethal control techniques are encouraging the development of nonlethal approaches to carnivore management. We anticipate greater success in modifying the manner and frequency with which the activities of humans and domestic animals intersect with those of carnivores. Success should permit carnivore populations to persist for decades despite human population growth and modification of habitat.

TI  - Effects of snow depth on food and habitat selection by roe deer Capreolus capreolus along an altitudinal gradient in south-central Norway
PY  - 1997
AB  - Roe deer Capreolus capreolus food and feeding habitat selection was studied by snow tracking on transects along an altitudinal gradient in Flatdal, the county of Telemark, south-central Norway, during winter 1979/80. The main food was bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus (36.8%), rowan Sorbus aucuparia (24.4%) and arboreal lichens Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryonia spp., Hypogymnia physodes, Usnea spp. (17.4%), which were also the only preferred food plants. The amount of food removed from the field layer was stable through the winter. Roe deer used the lower part of the study area most heavily. At lower altitudes, older mature stands and edges between medium-aged stands and clear-cuts/plantations were preferred, pole-sized stands and edges between older mature stands and clear-cuts/plantations were used as expected from their availabilities, whereas medium-aged stands, clear-cuts and young plantations were avoided. That snow depth was an important factor determining habitat use by roe deer was evident in three ways: 1) use of areas at higher elevations decreased as winter progressed, 2) use of mature forest stands increased from early to late winter relative to open habitats, and 3) use of mature forest stands was more extensive at higher than at lower elevations compared to open habitats.

AB  - Multiproxy reconstructions of monthly and seasonal surface temperature fields for Europe back to 1500 show that the late 20th- and early 21st-century European climate is very likely (>95% confidence level) warmer than that of any time during the past 500 years. This agrees with findings for the entire Northern Hemisphere. European winter average temperatures during the period 1500 to 1900 were reduced by ∼0.5°C (0.25°C for annual mean temperatures) compared to the 20th century. Summer temperatures did not experience systematic century-scale cooling relative to present conditions. The coldest European winter was 1708/1709; 2003 was by far the hottest summer.

TI  - Perception of human-derived risk influences choice at top of the food chain.
PY  - 2013
AB  - On human-used landscapes, animal behavior is a trade-off between maximizing fitness and minimizing human-derived risk. Understanding risk perception in wildlife can allow mitigation of anthropogenic risk, with benefits to long-term animal fitness. Areas where animals choose to rest should minimize risk from predators, which for large carnivores typically equate to humans. We hypothesize that high human activity leads to selection for habitat security, whereas low activity enables trading security for forage. We investigated selection of resting (bedding) sites by GPS radiocollared adult grizzly bears (n = 10) in a low density population on a multiple-use landscape in Canada. We compared security and foods at resting and random locations while accounting for land use, season, and time of day. On reclaimed mines with low human access, bears selected high horizontal cover far from trails, but did not avoid open (herbaceous) areas, resting primarily at night. In protected areas bears also bedded at night, in areas with berry shrubs and Hedysarum spp., with horizontal cover selected in the summer, during high human access. On public lands with substantial human recreation, bears bedded at day, selected resting sites with high horizontal cover in the summer and habitat edges, with bedding associated with herbaceous foods. These spatial and temporal patterns of selection suggest that bears perceive human-related risk differentially in relation to human activity level, season and time of day, and employ a security-food trade-off strategy. Although grizzly bears are presently not hunted in Alberta, their perceived risks associated with humans influence resting-site selection.

TI  - Temperate and boreal forest mega-fires: characteristics and challenges
PY  - 2014
AB  - Mega-fires are often defined according to their size and intensity but are more accurately described by their socioeconomic impacts. Three factors – climate change, fire exclusion, and antecedent disturbance, collectively referred to as the “mega-fire triangle” – likely contribute to today's mega-fires. Some characteristics of mega-fires may emulate historical fire regimes and can therefore sustain healthy fire-prone ecosystems, but other attributes decrease ecosystem resiliency. A good example of a program that seeks to mitigate mega-fires is located in Western Australia, where prescribed burning reduces wildfire intensity while conserving ecosystems. Crown-fire-adapted ecosystems are likely at higher risk of frequent mega-fires as a result of climate change, as compared with other ecosystems once subject to frequent less severe fires. Fire and forest managers should recognize that mega-fires will be a part of future wildland fire regimes and should develop strategies to reduce their undesired impacts.

TI  - Natural fire frequency for the eastern Canadian boreal forest: consequences for sustainable forestry
PY  - 2001
AB  - Given that fire is the most important disturbance of the boreal forest, climatically induced changes in fire frequency (i.e., area burnt per year) can have important consequences on the resulting forest mosaic age-class distribution and composition. Using archives and dendroecological data we reconstructed the fire frequency in four large sectors along a transect from eastern Ontario to central Quebec. Results showed a dramatic decrease in fire frequency that began in the mid-19th century and has been accentuated during the 20th century. Although all areas showed a similar temporal decrease in area burned, we observed a gradual increase in fire frequency from the west to Abitibi east, followed by a slight decrease in central Quebec. The global warming that has been oc- curring since the end of the Little Ice Age (∼1850) may have created a climate less prone to large forest fires in the eastern boreal forest of North America. This interpretation is corroborated by predictions of a decrease in for - est fires for that region of the boreal forest in the future. A longer fire cycle (i.e., the time needed to burn an area equivalent to the study area) has important consequences for sustainable forest management of the boreal for- est of eastern Canada. When considering the important proportion of overmature and old-growth stands in the landscape resulting from the elongation of the fire cycles, it becomes difficult to justify clear-cutting practices over all the entire area as well as short rotations as a means to emulate natural disturbances. Alternative practices involving the uses of variable proportion of clear, partial, and selective cutting are discussed.

TI  - Global monitoring of large reservoir storage from satellite remote sensing
PY  - 2012
AB  - [1] We studied 34 global reservoirs for which good quality surface elevation data could be obtained from a combination of five satellite altimeters for the period from 1992 to 2010. For each of these reservoirs, we used an unsupervised classification approach using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day 250 m vegetation product to estimate the surface water areas over the MODIS period of record (2000 to 2010). We then derived elevation-area relationships for each of the reservoirs by combining the MODIS-based estimates with satellite altimeter-based estimates of reservoir water elevations. Through a combination of direct observations of elevation and surface area along with documented reservoir configurations at capacity, we estimated storage time histories for each reservoir from 1992 to 2010. We evaluated these satellite-based data products in comparison with gauge observations for the five largest reservoirs in the United States (Lakes Mead, Powell, Sakakawea, Oahe, and Fort Peck Reservoir). The storage estimates were highly correlated with observations (R = 0.92 to 0.99), with values for the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) ranging from 3% to 15%. The storage mean absolute error (expressed as a percentage of reservoir capacity) for the reservoirs in this study was 4%. The multidecadal reconstructed reservoir storage variations are in accordance with known droughts and high flow periods on each of the five continents represented in the data set.

In boreal ecosystems such interactions may dictate the response to climatic change, but the interaction of climate, vegetation composition and the fire regime remains poorly understood. 2 Sediment cores from lakes in south-central Alaska were analysed for lithology, macrofossils, pollen and charcoal to investigate the relationships between moisture availability, species composition and mean fire return intervals (MFI). 3 Macrofossil and lithological evidence suggests that variations in effective moisture occurred over the past 7000 years and that the regional climate has been wetter during the past c . 3800 years than before. 4 Boreal forests existed in the region throughout the past 7000 years. Picea glauca and Picea mariana were the prevalent forest species around Chokasna Lake, whereas P. g lauca and hardwood species (e.g. Betula ) co-dominated the landscape around Moose Lake. Picea mariana replaced P. g lauca as the dominant Picea species around Chokasna Lake at c . 2000  . 5 MFI was > 500 years before 3800  , except from 5800 to 5000  at Moose Lake and 5400 to 4550  at Chokasna Lake, when values were c . 200 years. MFI decreased to c . 200 years during the late-Holocene at both sites and to c . 150 years after 2000  at Chokasna Lake. 6 At both sites, fires occurred more frequently under wetter climatic conditions. Our results therefore support other recent studies demonstrating that warmer/drier climatic conditions do not necessarily induce greater fire importance. A combination of increased ignition by lightning strikes and seasonal-moisture variability probably resulted in more frequent fires under wetter conditions.

TI  - Confronting socially generated uncertainty in adaptive management.
PY  - 2010
AB  - As more and more organizations with responsibility for natural resource management adopt adaptive management as the rubric in which they wish to operate, it becomes increasingly important to consider the sources of uncertainty inherent in their endeavors. Without recognizing that uncertainty originates both in the natural world and in human undertakings, efforts to manage adaptively at the least will prove frustrating and at the worst will prove damaging to the very natural resources that are the management targets. There will be more surprises and those surprises potentially may prove at the very least unwanted and at the worst devastating. We illustrate how acknowledging uncertainty associated with the natural world is necessary but not sufficient to avoid surprise using case studies of efforts to manage three wildlife species; Hector's Dolphins, American Alligators and Pallid Sturgeon. Three characteristics of indeterminism are salient to all of them; non-stationarity, irreducibility and an inability to define objective probabilities. As an antidote, we recommend employing a holistic treatment of indeterminism, that includes recognizing that uncertainty originates in ecological systems and in how people perceive, interact and decide about the natural world of which they are integral players.

TI  - Habitat differentiation within the large-carnivore community of Norway's multiple-use landscapes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Summary 1. The re-establishment of large carnivores in Norway has led to increased conflicts and the adoption of regional zoning for these predators. When planning the future distribution of large carnivores, it is important to consider details of their potential habitat tolerances and strength of interspecific differentiation. We studied differentiation in habitat and kill sites within the large-carnivore community of south-eastern Norway. 2. We compared habitat selection of the brown bear Ursus arctos L., Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L., wolf Canis lupus L. and wolverine Gulo gulo L., based on radio-tracking data. Differences in kill site locations were explored using locations of documented predator-killed sheep Ovis aries L. We modelled each species’ selection for, and differentiation in, habitat and kill sites on a landscape scale using resource selection functions and multinomial logistic regression. Based on projected probability of occurrence maps, we estimated continuous patches of habitat within the study area. 3. Although bears, lynx, wolves and wolverines had overlapping distributions, we found a clear differentiation for all four species in both habitat and kill sites. The presence of bears, wolves and lynx was generally associated with rugged, forested areas at lower elevations, whereas wolverines selected rugged terrain at higher elevations. Some degree of sympatry was possible in over 40% of the study area, although only 1·5% could hold all four large carnivores together. 4. Synthesis and applications . A geographically differentiated management policy has been adopted in Norway, aimed at conserving viable populations of large carnivores while minimizing the potential for conflicts. Sympatry of all four carnivores will be most successful if regional zones are established of adequate size spanning an elevational gradient. High prey densities, low carnivore densities, low dietary overlap and scavenging opportunities have most probably led to reduced competitive exclusion. Although regional sympatry enhances the conservation of an intact guild of large carnivores, it may well increase conflict levels and resistance to carnivore conservation locally.

TI  - Status and distribution of mangrove forests of the world using earth observation satellite data
PY  - 2010
AB  - Aim Our scientific understanding of the extent and distribution of mangrove forests of the world is inadequate. The available global mangrove databases, compiled using disparate geospatial data sources and national statistics, need to be improved.Here,we mapped the status and distributions of global mangroves using recently available Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat archive. Methods We interpreted approximately 1000 Landsat scenes using hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. Each image was normalized for variation in solar angle and earth‐sun distance by converting the digital number values to the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance. Ground truth data and existing maps and databases were used to select training samples and also for iterative labelling. Results were validated using existing GIS data and the published literature to map ‘true mangroves’. Results The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was 137,760 km 2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Approximately 75% of world’s mangroves are found in just 15 countries, and only 6.9% are protected under the existing protected areas network (IUCN I-IV). Our study confirms earlier findings that the biogeographic distribution of mangroves is generallyconfinedtothetropicalandsubtropicalregionsandthelargestpercentage of mangroves is found between 5° N and 5° S latitude. Main conclusions We report that the remaining area of mangrove forest in the world is less than previously thought. Our estimate is 12.3% smaller than the most recent estimate by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.We present the most comprehensive, globally consistent and highest resolution (30 m) global mangrove database ever created.We developed and used better mapping techniques and data sources and mapped mangroves with better spatial and thematic details than previous studies.

TI  - Spatial variation in environmental characteristics of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) rivers
PY  - 1998
AB  - Rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) occur across a diverse array of landscapes. This article describes the general ecology of these rivers and streams, including many of the physical and biological variables that are important characteristics of all lotic systems. For analytical purposes, the geographic range of Atlantic salmon rivers is divided into five regions, based on geomorphology and climate. The physical habitat available to anadromous Atlantic salmon is diverse. The geology varies from granitic bedrock to volcanic and glacial substrates, which influence a broad array of other ecological variables, ranging from water chemistry to catchment morphology (e.g., river length). Flood regimes and system hydrology are dependent, as expected, on climate. Many of the catchments receive substantial precipitation in the form of snow; rivers in four of the five regions experience primarily spring freshets. Aquatic temperatures are also variable, representing close to the full range of thermal tolerance of S. salar, with lows just above 0°C in the northernmost latitudes to summer highs in western Europe approaching 25°C. Most rivers are best characterized as oligotrophic with relatively low annual primary productivity. However, physical factors such as availability of suitable spawning and rearing habitat, as well as aquatic temperature and flow regimes, may drive anadromous productivity. In general, most of the rivers have been modified by flow regulation and many suffer from impacts related to other anthropogenic disturbances, principally riparian forest clearing for agriculture, forestry, and urban development. We conclude that the rivers and streams occupied by anadromous Atlantic salmon are diverse across the species' range and have been heavily impacted by anthropogenic disturbances. Resume : On trouve les cours d'eau frequentes par le saumon de l'Atlantique anadrome (Salmo salar) dans divers types de paysages. Le present article decrit l'ecologie generale de ces cours d'eau, dont bon nombre des variables physiques et biologiques qui sont d'importantes caracteristiques de tous les milieux lotiques. Aux fins de l'analyse, l'aire geographique dans laquelle on trouve les rivieres a saumon est divisee en cinq regions sur la base de la geomorphologie et du climat. Le saumon atlantique anadrome frequente des habitats physiques divers. Sur le plan geologique, on trouve aussi bien des substrats granitiques que des substrats volcaniques ou glaciaires, lesquels determinent une vaste gamme d'autres variables ecologiques, comme la chimie de l'eau et la morphologie du bassin versant (p. ex., la longueur des cours d'eau). Les regimes de crue et l'hydrologie des bassins dependent, comme on peut s'y attendre, du climat. Bon nombre de bassins versants recoivent une part substantielle de precipitation sous forme de neige; les cours d'eau de quatre des cinq regions connaissent principalement des crues nivales. Les temperatures de l'eau sont aussi variables : elles couvrent presque entierement la plage de tolerance thermique de S. salar, avec des minimums juste superieurs a 0°C sous les latitudes septentrionales et des maximums estivaux approchant 25°C en Europe de l'Ouest. La plupart des cours d'eau sont oligotrophes et montrent une productivite primaire annuelle relativement faible. Cependant, des facteurs physiques comme la presence d'habitats favorables pour la reproduction et l'alevinage, de meme que la temperature de l'eau et les regimes d'ecoulement, peuvent encourager la productivite du saumon anadrome. En general, la plupart des cours d'eau ont ete modifies par la regulation de leur debit, et bon nombre ont subi des impacts negatifs lies a d'autres perturbations anthropiques, principalement a la coupe des arbres sur leurs rives pour l'agriculture, l'exploitation forestiere ou le developpement urbain. Nous concluons que les cours d'eau frequentes par le saumon atlantique anadrome montrent une grande diversite d'un endroit a l'autre de l'aire de repartition de ce poisson et ont ete fortement perturbes par les activites humaines.

TI  - Long fire cycle in northern boreal Pinus forests in Finnish Lapland
PY  - 2010
AB  - Knowledge of past forest fire regimes is important for developing management plans for conservation areas and for predicting the probable effects of forest management and climate change on the structure and dynamics of forests. In this study, fire scars on living and dead trees were systematically sampled on 256 study plots in three landscapes in northeastern Finland dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). A total of 1030 disks or partial cross sections from different trees, including scars from 98 distinct forest fires, were dendrochronologically dated with an accuracy of 1 year or better. The extraordinarily well-preserved old Pinus snags and stumps allowed us to reconstruct annual tree-ring and fire chronologies beginning from the year AD 653. The fire cycles in the studied landscapes were exceptionally long for a boreal region dominated by Pinus, on average 350 years during the last millennium. This demonstrates that the fire regimes of poorly studied remote regions cannot be extrapolated from ...

TI  - A road in the middle of one of the last wild reindeer migration routes in Norway: crossing behaviour and threats to conservation
PY  - 2013
AB  - The development of roads and associated infrastructure has interrupted several traditional migrations of wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Norway. The population in the Setesdal Austhei wild reindeer area still migrates from winter to calving grounds by semi-annually crossing a cabin-lined road through a narrow corridor, in which further anthropogenic development is planned. To understand if and how infrastructure affected reindeer migration patterns we studied the movements of 10 female reindeer equipped with GPS collars between 2002 and 2010. First, we identified the start and end of the migration period, and then we compared trajectory parameters (net displacement, step length and turning angles) recorded during migration with those recorded in proximity of the road. The analysis of the net displacement indicated that during spring migration reindeer moved at a constant pace towards the calving ground covering a net linear distance of 25 km in 40 days. In the middle of migration, reindeer changed travel direction and roamed parallel to the road for ca. 5 days without approaching further, possibly searching for an undisturbed place and time to cross. Reindeer finally crossed the road before daylight with highly directed movements, increasing their travel speed up to the highest values recorded during migration (4 km/3 hrs vs. 0.5 km/3 hrs). After crossing, reindeer moved quickly toward their calving ground covering the remaining 25 km net distance in less than a week. Migration patterns were markedly affected by disturbance during spring, as the road crossings occurred in the period characterized by the high traffic volume and intense human activities related to Easter holidays; during autumn, on the contrary, the hampering effect of the road was minimal. The results suggest that the current disturbance associated to the road hampers spring migration and might delay the arrival to the calving ground. The planned construction of a large number of recreational cabins in the migration corridor has the potential to threaten the migration and obstruct the access to the calving ground.

TI  - Fire history and climate change in giant sequoia groves.
PY  - 1993
AB  - Fire scars in giant sequoia [Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindley) Buchholz] were used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal pattern of surface fires that burned episodically through five groves during the past 2000 years. Comparisons with independent dendroclimatic reconstructions indicate that regionally synchronous fire occurrence was inversely related to yearly fluctuations in precipitation and directly related to decadal-to-centennial variations in temperature. Frequent small fires occurred during a warm period from about A.D. 1000 to 1300, and less frequent but more widespread fires occurred during cooler periods from about A.D. 500 to 1000 and after A.D. 1300. Regionally synchronous fire histories demonstrate the importance of climate in maintaining nonequilibrium conditions.

TI  - Temporal scales of water-level fluctuations in lakes and their ecological implications
PY  - 2008
AB  - Water-level fluctuations (WLF) of lakes have temporal scales ranging from seconds to hundreds of years. Fluctuations in the lake level generated by an unbalanced water budget resulting from meteorological and hydrological processes, such as precipitation, evaporation and inflow and outflow conditions usually have long temporal scales (days to years) and are here classified as long-term WLF. In contrast, WLF generated by hydrodynamic processes, e.g. basin-scale oscillations and travelling surface waves, have periods in the order of seconds to hours and are classified as short-term WLF. The impact of WLF on abiotic and biotic conditions depends on the temporal scale under consideration and is exemplified using data from Lake Issyk-Kul, the Caspian Sea and Lake Constance. Long-term WLF induce a slow shore line displacement of metres to kilometres, but immediate physical stress due to currents associated with long-term WLF is negligible. Large-scale shore line displacements change the habitat availability for organisms adapted to terrestrial and aquatic conditions over long time scales. Short-term WLF, in contrast, do not significantly displace the boundary between the aquatic and the terrestrial habitat, but impose short-term physical stress on organisms living in the littoral zone and on organic and inorganic particles deposited in the top sediment layers. The interaction of WLF acting on different time scales amplifies their overall impact on the ecosystem, because long-term WLF change the habitat exposed to the physical stress resulting from short-term WLF. Specifically, shore morphology and sediment grain size distribution are the result of a continuous interplay between short- and long-term WLF, the former providing the energy for erosion the latter determining the section of the shore exposed to the erosive power.

TI  - Key Elements in a Framework for Land Use Impact Assessment Within LCA
PY  - 2006
AB  - Background, Aim and Scope Land use by agriculture, forestry, mining, house-building or industry leads to substantial impacts, particularly on biodiversity and on soil quality as a supplier of life support functions. Unfortunately there is no widely accepted assessment method so far for land use impacts. This paper presents an attempt, within the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, to provide a framework for the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of land use. Materials and Methods: This framework builds from previous documents, particularly the SETAC book on LCIA (Lindeijer et al. 2002), developing essential issues such as the reference for occupation impacts; the impact pathways to be included in the analysis; the units of measure in the impact mechanism (land use interventions to impacts); the ways to deal with impacts in the future; and bio-geographical differentiation. Results: The paper describes the selected impact pathways, linking the land use elementary flows (occupation; transformation) and parameters (intensity) registered in the inventory (LCI) to the midpoint impact indicators and to the relevant damage categories (natural environment and natural resources). An impact occurs when the land properties are modified (transformation) and also when the current man-made properties are maintained (occupation). Discussion: The size of impact is the difference between the effect on land quality from the studied case of land use and a suitable reference land use on the same area (dynamic reference situation). The impact depends not only on the type of land use (including coverage and intensity) but is also heavily influenced by the bio-geographical conditions of the area. The time lag between the land use intervention and the impact may be large; thus land use impacts should be calculated over a reasonable time period after the actual land use finishes, at least until a new steady state in land quality is reached. Conclusions: Guidance is provided on the definition of the dynamic reference situation and on methods and time frame to assess the impacts occurring after the actual land use. Including the occupation impacts acknowledges that humans are not the sole users of land. Recommendations and Perspectives: The main damages affected by land use that should be considered by any method to assess land use impacts in LCIA are: biodiversity (existence value); biotic production potential (including soil fertility and use value of biodiversity); ecological soil quality (including life support functions of soil other than biotic production potential). Bio-geographical differentiation is required for land use impacts, because the same intervention may have different consequences depending on the sensitivity and inherent land quality of the environment where it occurs. For the moment, an indication of how such task could be done and likely bio-geographical parameters to be considered are suggested. The recommendation of indicators for the suggested impact categories is a matter of future research.

TI  - Impacts of disturbance on migratory waterfowl
PY  - 1995
AB  - It is well known that disturbance from human activities can cause temporary changes in behaviour and locally affect temporal and spatial distribution of migratory and wintering waterfowl. But it is also known that, to some extent, birds can compensate for disturbance by altering their behaviour or habituating to human activities. Comparatively little is known about how these reactions to disturbance may impact on the large-scale dispersion of waterfowl and, ultimately, on their population dynamics. To be able to answer these questions, a better theoretical framework, based on optimal foraging theory incorporating predation risk, and field experiments are required. Furthermore, we need to study the waterfowl throughout their winter ranges to interpret the overall impacts of disturbance. This paper examines two cases where the impacts of disturbance have been assessed from field experiments. In one study, disturbance effects of shooting were tested by setting up experimental reserves in two Danish coastal wetlands. Over a 5-year period, these became two of the most important staging areas for coastal waterfowl, and the national totals of key species were significantly increased. A national management plan which will establish more than 50 new shooting-free refuges on Danish coastal areas within the next 5 years is likely to boost waterfowl numbers even more. Such retention of birds at more northerly sites on the fiyway should result in a more efficient resource utilization and may positively affect the population dynamics where numbers are affected by winter resources. In a second study, the impacts of disturbance by farmers on spring fattening of Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus were analysed. In undisturbed areas in northern Norway, abdominal profiles of the geese increased rapidly, whereas in disturbed sites they did not. Subsequently, geese that had used undisturbed sites reproduced better than geese from disturbed sites.

TI  - Global effects of land use on local terrestrial biodiversity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Human activities, especially conversion and degradation of habitats, are causing global biodiversity declines. How local ecological assemblages are responding is less clear--a concern given their importance for many ecosystem functions and services. We analysed a terrestrial assemblage database of unprecedented geographic and taxonomic coverage to quantify local biodiversity responses to land use and related changes. Here we show that in the worst-affected habitats, these pressures reduce within-sample species richness by an average of 76.5%, total abundance by 39.5% and rarefaction-based richness by 40.3%. We estimate that, globally, these pressures have already slightly reduced average within-sample richness (by 13.6%), total abundance (10.7%) and rarefaction-based richness (8.1%), with changes showing marked spatial variation. Rapid further losses are predicted under a business-as-usual land-use scenario; within-sample richness is projected to fall by a further 3.4% globally by 2100, with losses concentrated in biodiverse but economically poor countries. Strong mitigation can deliver much more positive biodiversity changes (up to a 1.9% average increase) that are less strongly related to countries' socioeconomic status.

TI  - Good practices for estimating area and assessing accuracy of land change
PY  - 2014
AB  - The remote sensing science and application communities have developed increasingly reliable, consistent, and robust approaches for capturing land dynamics to meet a range of information needs. Statistically robust and transparent approaches for assessing accuracy and estimating area of change are critical to ensure the integrity of land change information. We provide practitioners with a set of “good practice” recommendations for designing and implementing an accuracy assessment of a change map and estimating area based on the reference sample data. The good practice recommendations address the three major components: sampling design, response design and analysis. The primary good practice recommendations for assessing accuracy and estimating area are: (i) implement a probability sampling design that is chosen to achieve the priority objectives of accuracy and area estimation while also satisfying practical constraints such as cost and available sources of reference data; (ii) implement a response design protocol that is based on reference data sources that provide sufficient spatial and temporal representation to accurately label each unit in the sample (i.e., the “reference classification” will be considerably more accurate than the map classification being evaluated); (iii) implement an analysis that is consistent with the sampling design and response design protocols; (iv) summarize the accuracy assessment by reporting the estimated error matrix in terms of proportion of area and estimates of overall accuracy, user's accuracy (or commission error), and producer's accuracy (or omission error); (v) estimate area of classes (e.g., types of change such as wetland loss or types of persistence such as stable forest) based on the reference classification of the sample units; (vi) quantify uncertainty by reporting confidence intervals for accuracy and area parameters; (vii) evaluate variability and potential error in the reference classification; and (viii) document deviations from good practice that may substantially affect the results. An example application is provided to illustrate the recommended process.

TI  - Patterns and regulation of dissolved organic carbon: An analysis of 7,500 widely distributed lakes
PY  - 2007
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key parameter in lakes that can affect numerous features, including microbial metabolism, light climate, acidity, and primary production. In an attempt to understand the factors that regulate DOC in lakes, we assembled a large database (7,514 lakes from 6 continents) of DOC concentrations and other parameters that characterize the conditions in the lakes, the catchment, the soil, and the climate. DOC concentrations were in the range 0.1–332 mg L21, and the median was 5.71 mg L21. A partial least squares regression explained 48% of the variability in lake DOC and showed that altitude, mean annual runoff, and precipitation were negatively correlated with lake DOC, while conductivity, soil carbon density, and soil C : N ratio were positively related with lake DOC. A multiple linear regression using altitude, mean annual runoff, and soil carbon density as predictors explained 40% of the variability in lake DOC. While lake area and drainage ratio (catchment : lake area) were not correlated to lake DOC in the global data set, these two factors explained significant variation of the residuals of the multiple linear regression model in several regional subsets of data. These results suggest a hierarchical regulation of DOC in lakes, where climatic and topographic characteristics set the possible range of DOC concentrations of a certain region, and catchment and lake properties then regulate the DOC concentration in each individual lake. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a major modulator of the structure and function of lake ecosystems. The DOC pool of lakes consists of both autochthonous DOC (i.e., produced in the lake) and allochthonous DOC (i.e., produced in the catchment), although allochthonous DOC is generally believed to represent the larger fraction of the total DOC in lakes. Due to the dark color of many DOC compounds, DOC affects the thermal structure and

TI  - An assessment of social impacts of national parks on communities in Quebec, Canada
PY  - 1999
AB  - Numerous national parks have been established worldwide to protect nature, but this has not been without social consequences for neighbouring communities. Since the social and economic vitality of adjacent communities is being recognized more and more as indispensable for the success of conservation objectives, the quality of park-community relations has become a critical issue. A four-year investigation into the social impacts engendered by two national parks situated in the Saguenay region of Quebec (Canada) was conducted, according to a social impact assessment method. Several impacts and changes were identified on resource management, on the local economy, on the tourist industry, on involvement and participation of local actors and on the social organization of the neighbouring communities. The significance of these impacts varied according to the community and the actors involved. The results of the present research point to the determining role of the government in general, and of the park management in particular, in the process of local community development. In this regard, recommendations are addressed to local communities to improve their partnership with national parks.

TI  - The pitfalls of ignoring behaviour when quantifying habitat selection
PY  - 2013
AB  - Aim: Habitat selection is a behavioural mechanism by which animals attempt to maximize their inclusive fitness while balancing competing demands, such as finding food and rearing offspring while avoiding predation, in a heterogeneous and changing environment. Different habitat characteristics may be associated with each of these demands, implying that habitat selection varies depending on the behavioural motivations of the animal. Here, we investigate behaviour-specific habitat selection in African elephants and discuss its implications for distribution modelling and conservation. Location: Northern Botswana, Africa, case study. Methods: We use Bayesian state-space models to characterize location time series data of elephants into two behavioural states (encamped and exploratory). We then develop habitat selection models for each behavioural state and contrast them to models based on data pooled among behaviours. Results: Spatial predictions of habitat use were often markedly different among the models. Behaviour-specific and pooled habitat selection models differed in model structure, the magnitude of model coefficients and the form of the selection curve (linear or quadratic). Selection was typically strongest in the behaviour-specific models, although this varied according to behavioural state and habitat covariate. Main conclusions: Ignoring behavioural states often had important consequences for quantifying habitat selection. Quantifying selection irrespective of behaviour (among all behaviours) can obscure important species-habitat relationships, thereby risking weak or incorrect inferences. Behaviour-specific habitat selection provides greater insight into the process of habitat selection and can improve predictive habitat selection estimates. As some behaviours are more relevant to specific conservation objectives than others, focusing on behaviour-specific selection could improve how habitats are prioritized for conservation or management.

TI  - Effects of habitat fragmentation and road density on the distribution pattern of the moor frog Rana arvalis
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. The effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution pattern of the moor frog Rana arvalis were investigated. Also, the possible isolation effects of the road network were taken into account. 2. Indications were found that habitat fragmentation partly explains the distribution pattern of the moor frog. The statistical models showed a positive effect of pond size (or marsh area) and a negative effect of road density on the probability of occupation of a moorland pond. 3. Because of the strong correlation between habitat quality variables and isolation variables, no unambiguous effects of isolation, described as the amount of suitable terrestrial habitat (moorland) in the surroundings of a moorland pond in a radius of 100-2000 m, could be demonstrated. 4. Spatial differences in road density can play a role in the selection of optimal locations for nature protection areas. The regression model used in this study predicts a reduced occupation probability in 55% of the study area. In the part of the study area adjacent to a motorway, occupation probability is lowered to less than 30%. 5. European studies of habitat fragmentation on amphibian species revealed a mean distance between occupied ponds of <1 km in all studies. This could be a general rule of thumb for persistent amphibian populations. Effects of pond size on the probability of occupation were more variable. 6. When discussing the effects of habitat fragmentation on amphibians and other ground dwelling species, the negative effects of roads are often underestimated.

TI  - Characterization of wildfire regimes in Canadian boreal terrestrial ecosystems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Wildfire is a major disturbance in boreal terrestrial ecosystems. Characterizing fire regimes and projecting fire recurrence intervals for different biomes are important in managing those ecosystems and quantifying carbon dynamics of those ecosystems. This study used Canadian wildfire datasets, 1980-1999, to characterize relationships between number of fires and burned area for 13 ecozones and to calculate wildfire recurrence intervals in each ecozone. For the study period, wildfires were found to follow power-law relationships between frequency densities (number of fires normalized to unit bins) and burned areas in all ecozones. Power-law frequency-area relationships also held for both anthropogenic fires and natural fires in the 1980s and 1990s. For each Canadian ecozone using the parameters of the power-law frequency-area distributions, fire recurrence intervals were then calculated for wildfires equal to or larger than a given size of burned area. Fire recurrence intervals ranged from 1 to 32 years for burned areas > 2k m 2 , and from 1 to 100 years for burned areas >10 km 2 in every 10 000-km 2 spatial area for each ecozone. The information obtained through characterizing the wildfires and the fire recurrence intervals calculated in this study will provide guidance to wildfire risk managers throughout Canada. The findings of this study will also be a benefit to future efforts in quantifying carbon dynamics in Canadian boreal terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - Food of anadromous brown trout at sea
PY  - 2001
AB  - The food of migratory Salmo trutta in coastal marine waters along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast varied significantly with age, season and habitat of the fish. The main prey categories in terms of frequency of occurrence were fishes followed by crustaceans, surface insects and polychaetes. Seasonal variation in diet and within habitats was found, supporting the view that brown trout is an opportunistic feeder. An ontogenetic niche shift was observed with post-smolts feeding on inshore and shallow water prey communities, while larger brown trout fed mainly on pelagic fishes.

TI  - The onset of spring and timing of migration in two arctic nesting goose populations: the pink-footed goose Anser bachyrhynchus and the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis
PY  - 2008
AB  - An earlier onset of spring has been recorded for many parts of Eurasia in recent decades. This has consequences for migratory species, both in changing the conditions encountered by individuals on reaching migratory sites and in affecting cues regulating the timing of migration where decisions to migrate are influenced by local environmental variables. Here we examine the timing of spring migration for two arctic goose populations, the pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus (during 1990� 2003) and barnacle goose Branta leucopsis (during 1982� 2003), which both breed on Svalbard. The satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to express the onset of spring at their wintering and spring staging sites. Pink-footed geese use several sites during spring migration, ranging from the southernmost wintering areas in Belgium to two spring staging areas in Norway, and distances between sites used along the flyway are relatively short. There was a positive correlation in the onset of spring between neighbouring sites, and the geese migrated earlier in early springs. Barnacle geese, on the other hand, have a long overseas crossing from their wintering grounds in Britain to spring staging areas in Norway. Although spring advanced in both regions, there was no corresponding correlation in the timing of onset of spring between their wintering and spring staging sites, and little evidence for barnacle geese migrating earlier over the whole study period. Hence, where geese can use spring conditions at one site as an indicator of the conditions they might encounter at the next, they have responded quickly to the advancement of spring, whereas in a situation where they cannot predict, they have not yet responded, despite the advancement of spring in the spring staging area.

TI  - Natural disturbance emulation in boreal forest ecosystem management — theories, strategies, and a comparison with conventional even-aged
PY  - 2012
AB  - Natural disturbance emulation (NDE) has been proposed as a general approach to ecologically sustainable forest management. We reviewed the concepts, theories, and strategies related to NDE in boreal forest management. We also re- viewed publications that discussed NDE in the boreal forest in general and those that specifically compared NDE-based management with conventional even-aged management. The papers generally focused on northern North America and land- scape-scale wildfire as the main disturbance factor, whereas information from Eurasia was exclusively theoretical. Within this limited scope, NDE was generally found to have a positive effect on biodiversity in terms of forest structure and species diversity when compared with conventional even-aged management. Studies on timber supply and social implications of NDE were so few that they preclude generalizations. We conclude that the ecological and economic performance of NDE as a management approach still remains poorly examined. To advance the development of NDE, particular attention should be given to (1) augmenting the knowledge base on natural range of variability of unmanaged forest ecosystems and evaluating the validity of this information in a changing climate, (2) fostering multidisciplinary research with better integration of eco- logical theory to both integrative and analytical research on NDE, and (3) better integration of socioeconomic concerns, adaptive management schemes, and international collaboration into NDE initiatives.

TI  - Will climate change drive 21st century burn rates in Canadian boreal forest outside of its natural variability: collating global climate model experiments with sedimentary charcoal data.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Natural ecosystems have developed within ranges of conditions that can serve as references for setting conservation targets or assessing the current ecological integrity of managed ecosystems. Because of their climate determinism, forest fires are likely to have consequences that could exacerbate biophysical and socioeconomical vulnerabilities in the context of climate change. We evaluated future trends in fire activity under climate change in the eastern Canadian boreal forest and investigated whether these changes were included in the variability observed during the last 7000 years from sedimentary charcoal records from three lakes. Prediction of future annual area burned was made using simulated Monthly Drought Code data collected from an ensemble of 19 global climate model experiments. The increase in burn rate that is predicted for the end of the 21st century (0.45% year–1 with 95% confidence interval (0.32, 0.59) falls well within the long‐term past variability (0.37 to 0.90% year–1). Although our results suggest that the predicted change in burn rates per se will not move this ecosystem to new conditions, the effects of increasing fire incidence cumulated with current rates of clear‐cutting or other low‐retention types of harvesting, which still prevail in this region, remain preoccupying.

TI  - The role of reserves and anthropogenic habitats for functional connectivity and resilience of ephemeral wetlands.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Ecological reserves provide important wildlife habitat in many landscapes, and the functional connectivity of reserves and other suitable habitat patches is crucial for the persistence and resilience of spatially structured populations. To maintain or increase connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches, conservation actions may focus on creating and maintaining reserves and/or influencing management on non-reserves. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA, an intensively cultivated agricultural matrix, at four assumed, but ecologically realistic, anuran dispersal distances. We compared connectivity in the current landscape to the historical landscape and putative future landscapes, and evaluated the importance of individual and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape, where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has maintained connectivity in the current landscape by replacing destroyed wetlands, but these pits likely provide suboptimal habitat. Also, because there are fewer total wetlands (i.e., wetlands and irrigation reuse pits) in the current landscape than the historical landscape, and because the distribution of current wetlands is less clustered than that of historical wetlands, larger and longer dispersing, sometimes nonnative species may be favored over smaller, shorter dispersing species of conservation concern. Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves do not affect connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse pits; however, they likely provide the highest quality anuran habitat. To improve future levels of resilience in this wetland habitat network, management could focus on continuing to improve the conservation status of non-reserve wetlands, restoring wetlands at spatial scales that promote movements of shorter dispersing species, and further scrutinizing irrigation reuse pit removal by considering effects on functional connectivity for anurans, an emblematic and threatened group of organisms. However, broader conservation plans will need to give consideration to other wetland-dependent species, incorporate invasive species management, and address additional challenges arising from global change in social-ecological systems like the Rainwater Basin.

TI  - Assessing the integrated effects of landscape fragmentation on plants and plant communities: the challenge of multiprocess–multiresponse dynamics
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary When human activities change the landscape, several processes affecting remnant vegetation take place simultaneously: there is less suitable habitat, populations become isolated and the environmental conditions of the fragments frequently shift. Such changes affect vegetation in different ways – populations become smaller, the genetic exchanges between populations decline and species interactions are altered. The combination of processes taking place during fragmentation and their subsequent consequences generate a large variety of responses, positive and negative, among plants and plant communities. To assess the integrated effects of the processes taking place as a result of fragmentation (isolation, edge effects, fragment size and time since fragmentation) on organisms, we conducted a hierarchical meta-analysis of the studies reporting the effects of landscape fragmentation on plant species and plant communities. Our review included 259 peer-reviewed journal articles and 990 data entries. We found the frequency of reports of positive and negative responses to fragmentation were comparable but largely variable. Negative effects of fragmentation due to isolation, edge effects and fragment size were significant; but only edge effects and fragment size had significant positive effects. When looking at specific types of responses to isolation, we found negative effects on density, fecundity, colonization, succession rates and species richness, while positive effects were found on fecundity, herbivory/predation and colonization. Positive responses to edge effects were significant for density, fecundity, survival, growth and richness, and significantly negative for density, survival, colonization and richness. Effects of patch size were mostly significant for both positive and negative responses. We also assessed the effects of landscape fragmentation for different attributes of the studied system and found no differences among biomes, vegetation types, functional groups or life stages. Synthesis. Results of this integrated assessment indicate that broad generalizations about the effects of fragmentation on remnant vegetation may not be possible due the large variety of processes and responses associated with fragmentation. Results also identified key knowledge gaps, and areas of research needed to improve assessment and future management of plant species and plant communities in fragmented landscapes (e.g. lag effects, the role of the matrix and the patch quality and integrated effects along life cycles).

TI  - Current estimates of goose population sizes in western Europe, a gap analysis and assessment of trends
PY  - 2010
AB  - We estimated the size of 30 defined populations of geese wintering in the Western Palearctic (including five released or reintroduced populations of three species). Fourteen populations were accurately estimated from almost full count coverage or robust sampling and ten were well estimated based on more than 50% of their total being counted. An estimated 5.03 million geese wintered in January 2009, up on 3.10 million in January 1993. Only two populations numbered less than 10,000 birds (Scandinavian Lesser White-fronted Goose and Svalbard/Greenland Light-bellied Brent Goose, the former being critically small within restricted range). Eighteen populations numbered 10,000–100,000, eight 100,000–1,000,000 and the largest 1.2 million individuals. Of 21 populations with known longer term trends, 16 are showing significant exponential increases, 4 are stable and one declining. Amongst these same populations, five are declining since the 1990s. Long term declines in productivity were found in 7 out of 15 populations. Amongst most of the 11 populations for which data exist, there were no significant long-term trends in annual adult survival. Improved monitoring, including demographic, is required to retain populations in favorable conservation status.

TI  - Regionalized life cycle assessment: computational methodology and application to inventory databases.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have shown that site-dependent impact assessment for categories like acidification and eutrophication give more accurate and realistic results than site-generic assessments. To date, existing geography-specific, or regionalized, impact assessment factors have not been applied to LCA databases and software tools. We describe a simple, generic methodology to couple existing regionalized characterization factors with large life cycle inventory databases. This approach allows for detailed geographic life cycle impact assessment results. Case-study results for European country-specific electricity mixes are calculated using the Ecoinvent 2.01 database and the EDIP 2003 and Accumulated Exceedance impact assessment methods and CASES project external energy cost characterization factors. In most cases, regionalization shows different total scores, different processes of high importance, and varying geographic distributions of environmental impacts. As the methodology requires no additional input other than the geographic information already in existing LCA databases, it can be used routinely. Better and more consistent geographic information in life cycle inventory databases and impact assessment methods, tailored to the specific spatial range of all environmental effects considered, would be beneficial.

TI  - Behavioural adjustments of a large carnivore to access secondary prey in a human-dominated landscape
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. Conflict between people and large carnivores is an urgent conservation issue world-wide. Understanding the underlying ecological drivers of livestock depredation by large carnivores is greatly needed. 2. We studied the spatial, foraging and behavioural ecology of African lions Panthera leo in the Botswana Makgadikgadi ecosystem. This ecosystem comprises a protected area, characterized by high seasonal fluctuation in wild prey abundance, and adjacent lands, which are used for livestock grazing and characterized by stable livestock abundance, but also a risk of anthropogenic mortality. 3. Makgadikgadi lions preferentially preyed upon migratory wild herbivores when they were present; however, data from GPS (Global Positioning System) radiocollared lions revealed that the majority of the study lions did not follow the migratory herds but remained resident at one or other border of the park and switched to livestock (abundant and readily available), and to a lesser extent resident wild herbivores (relatively scarce), in periods of migratory wild herbivore scarcity. 4. Resident lions’ use of space differed between periods of wild prey abundance and scarcity. These changes were likely to increase the frequency of encounter with their primary prey in periods of primary prey abundance and with livestock in periods of primary prey scarcity. 5. The risk of conflict with humans was a major driver of lion ecology in the human-dominated landscape surrounding the protected area. Resident lions generally avoided the close vicinity of cattle-posts. When they used such areas, they avoided temporal overlap with periods that humans were most active and travelled at high speed reducing the time spent in these areas. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study suggests that lions balance the benefits of accessing livestock with the costs associated with livestock raiding. Hence, reduction in livestock availability through effective livestock husbandry in periods of wild prey scarcity should lead to reduced conflict.

TI  - Fragmented landscapes, road mortality and patch connectivity: modelling influences on the dispersal of Eurasian lynx
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1. Although many reintroduction schemes for the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Germany have been discussed, the implications of connectivity between suitable patches have not been assessed. 2. We introduce an individual-based, spatially explicit dispersal model to assess the probability of a dispersing animal reaching another suitable patch in the complex heterogeneous German landscape, with its dense transport system. The dispersal model was calibrated using telemetric data from the Swiss Jura and based on a map of potential lynx dispersal habitat. 3. Most suitable patches could be interconnected by movements of dispersing lynx within 10 years of reintroduction. However, when realistic levels of mortality risks on roads were applied, most patches become isolated except along the German‐Czech border. Consequently, patch connectivity is limited not so much by the distribution of dispersal habitat but by the high mortality of dispersing lynx. Accordingly, rather than solely investing in habitat restoration, management efforts should try to reduce road mortality. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our approach illustrates how spatially explicit dispersal models can guide conservation efforts and reintroduction programmes even where data are scarce. Clear limits imposed by substantial road mortality will affect dispersing lynx as well as other large carnivores, unless offset by careful road-crossing management or by the careful selection of release points in reintroduction programmes.

AB  - Summary 1. Anthropogenic disturbances of the physical habitat and corresponding effects on fish performance are key issues in stream conservation and restoration. Reduced habitat complexity because of increased sediment loadings and canalization is of particular importance, but it is not clear to what extent fish populations are influenced directly by changes in the physical environment, or indirectly through changes in the biotic environment affecting the food availability. 2. Here, we test for the direct effect of habitat complexity on the performance (growth) of juvenile Atlantic salmon by manipulating shelter availability (interstitial spaces in the substrate) across 20 semi-natural stream channels without altering the substrate composition, and stocking each channel with a common density of fish. A simple method for measuring salmonid shelters using flexible PVC tubes was developed and tested. Daytime sheltering behaviour and growth rates were compared across the channels differing in shelter availability. 3. Measured shelter availability was strongly negatively correlated with observed number of fish not finding shelters and mass loss rates of the fish (growth performance) increased with decreasing number of measured shelters. Number and mean depth of interstitial spaces explained up to 68% and 24% of the among-channel variation in sheltering behaviour and growth performance, respectively. Furthermore, negative effects of shelter reduction increased with fish body size. Thus, changes in habitat structure may even influence the size selection gradients. 4. Shelter availability is an easily measured variable, possibly affecting the population demographics and long-term evolutionary processes, and is therefore a key habitat factor to be considered in stream restoration and habitat classification.

TI  - Quota hunting of Eurasian lynx in Norway: patterns of hunter selection, hunter efficiency and monitoring accuracy
PY  - 2011
AB  - Harvesting large carnivores is often a controversial issue and thus requires a higher precision than other types of recreational harvest. Despite this, management programmes are often initiated based on very limited knowledge about the state of the population and the composition and magnitude of the harvest. Here we analyse patterns of lynx harvest in Norway based on harvest data from 1994 to 2009. We found clear signs of sex-biased harvest rates, with males generally being more at risk. Further, harvest mortality rates increased with age among males but not among females. In general, the degree of quota filling was high, but there was a tendency for decreasing quota filling with increasing quotas. A population reconstruction of the Norwegian lynx population (1994–2004) based on a modified cohort analysis closely tracked the development in the official monitoring data, suggesting that the managers have access to relatively good information about the development of the population, at least at a larger spatial scale. Despite this, the population trajectory showed large temporal variation, and time lags in the management’s decision-making process are a likely cause of the observed patterns in the Norwegian lynx population.

TI  - Environmentalism and Tourism Preferences: A Study of Outdoor Recreationists in Sweden
PY  - 2011
AB  - This article explores the linkages between nature-based recreation and preferences of individuals classified as “environmentalists”. Following an overview of the literature, this paper reports on an empirical investigation of the nature-based recreation vs. environmentalism nexus using data from a national Swedish survey. Study findings show that environmentalists (environmentally-oriented individuals) behave differently in terms of their recreation-related preferences when compared to non-environmentalists. Environmentalists prefer outdoor activities with little or no impact on the environment as demonstrated, for example, by their avoidance of extractive (e.g. hunting) and motorized activities (e.g. snowmobiling). Despite these differences, the findings were inconsistent in that while environmentalists avoid some extractive and motorized activities, other similar activities were not avoided. Thus, the results question the use of simplistic recreational classification systems for the understanding of act...

TI  - Divergent trends in anadromous salmonid populations in Norwegian and Scottish rivers
PY  - 2008
AB  - The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a charismatic anadromous fish of high conservation and economic value. Concerns have been expressed regarding the long-term viability of fisheries throughout the species’s distributional range because of abundance variations that cannot currently be explained or predicted. Here, we analyse long-term catch data obtained over a wide geographical range and across a range of spatial subscales to understand more fully the factors that drive population abundance. We use rod catch data from 84 Norwegian rivers over 125 years (1876‐2000) and 48 Scottish rivers over 51 years (1952‐2002). The temporal correlation in catches is very long-term, with trends persisting over several decades. The spatial correlation is relatively short-range, indicating strong local-scale effects on catch. Furthermore, Scottish salmon populations exhibit recent negative trends in contrast to some more positive trends in Norway—especially in the north.

TI  - Backpacking: diversity and change.
PY  - 2003
AB  - Backpacking, a relatively little studied form of tourism, is a rapidly expanding phenomenon. This article follows the transition from the tramp to the drifter, and from the latter to the contemporary backpacker, and points to the diversity within this general category of tourists. The discrepancy between the ideal and the common practice of backpacking, and the mechanisms of bridging it deployed by contemporary backpackers, are discussed. It is claimed that backpackers tend to profess modern ideals of tourism (e.g. the quest for 'authenticity') but are 'post-modern' in the praxis. While it is accepted that the model of a 'rite-of-passage' is a useful heuristic device for the study of backpacking, some significant qualifications regarding the applicability of the model are pointed out. The article concludes by stressing the importance of the historical and national contexts of the backpackers' origins for the diversity of their motivations and conduct, and proposes future directions of research.

TI  - Recent burning of boreal forests exceeds fire regime limits of the past 10,000 years
PY  - 2013
AB  - Wildfire activity in boreal forests is anticipated to increase dramatically, with far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences. Paleorecords are indispensible for elucidating boreal fire regime dynamics under changing climate, because fire return intervals and successional cycles in these ecosystems occur over decadal to centennial timescales. We present charcoal records from 14 lakes in the Yukon Flats of interior Alaska, one of the most flammable ecoregions of the boreal forest biome, to infer causes and consequences of fire regime change over the past 10,000 y. Strong correspondence between charcoal-inferred and observational fire records shows the fidelity of sedimentary charcoal records as archives of past fire regimes. Fire frequency and area burned increased ∼6,000–3,000 y ago, probably as a result of elevated landscape flammability associated with increased Picea mariana in the regional vegetation. During the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; ∼1,000–500 cal B.P.), the period most similar to recent decades, warm and dry climatic conditions resulted in peak biomass burning, but severe fires favored less-flammable deciduous vegetation, such that fire frequency remained relatively stationary. These results suggest that boreal forests can sustain high-severity fire regimes for centuries under warm and dry conditions, with vegetation feedbacks modulating climate–fire linkages. The apparent limit to MCA burning has been surpassed by the regional fire regime of recent decades, which is characterized by exceptionally high fire frequency and biomass burning. This extreme combination suggests a transition to a unique regime of unprecedented fire activity. However, vegetation dynamics similar to feedbacks that occurred during the MCA may stabilize the fire regime, despite additional warming.

TI  - The Demonic Place of the 'Not There': Trademark Rumors In the Postindustrial Imaginary
PY  - 1997
AB  - The bizarre rumors that consumers spread about the origins and meanings of corporate trademarks are phenomena of consumer culture that indirectly articulate social anxieties about the intersections of culture, power, and place in the condition of postmodernity. Demonic rumors, I will suggest, provide a means by which people culturally express commercial power's lack of place - the simultaneously pervasive but incorporeal presence of corporate power. Moreover, such rumors serve to remark upon the consumer's own place - making audible her lack of voice - and her sense of powerlessness in the ubiquitous but evanescent world of commercial media culture.

TI  - Deployment of a Geographical Information System Life Cycle Assessment Integrated Framework for Exploring the Opportunities and Challenges of Enhanced Oil Recovery Using Industrial CO2 Supply in the United States
PY  - 2016
AB  - This paper integrated the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach with a geographical information system (GIS) in order to compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process, utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) from three industrial pathways. Pathway 1 is a corn-based ethanol plant with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), while pathways 2 and 3 are coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, respectively, with amine-based postcombustion CCS technology. The pathways were compared to a conventional crude recovery, transport, refinement, and end-use combustion baseline, which had net GHG emissions of 0.47 tCO2-e/bbl. Overall, net GHG emissions from pathways 1, 2, and 3 were lower than in the baseline case. In this LCA study, the system expansion approach was applied and the results indicated that ethanol-based CCS-EOR was notably the better alternative. However, the CO2 supply from ethanol plants is limited; they would have the capacity to produce only about 25 000 bbl/d, compar...

TI  - Relationship between freshwater angling catch of Atlantic salmon and stock size in the River Bush, Northern Ireland
PY  - 2001
AB  - Over 25 years rod catches of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar increased proportionately as stock size increased (r 2 =0.581, P 0.5). On a 15 year sub-set of these data annual effort (P=0.804) and flow (P=0.339) had little significance relative to stock size (P<0.01) on variation in rod catches. Stock size, time effort and flows had no influence on inter-annual variation of rod exploitation rate (r 2 =0.094, P=0.880). Pairwise correlation between variables confirmed these results. In 1998, weekly effort contributed significantly to overall catch variation (P<0.001), while weekly flow did not (P=0.438). These results are discussed in relation to the utility of rod eatch data for deriving estimates of stock for spawning target compliance purposes.

TI  - A 350-year tree-ring fire record from Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland: implications for Central European lowland fire history.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Fires are nowadays small, yet frequent, in temperate Central European conifer forests, but little is known about the fire history in this region. This is likely due to the lack of intact forests that contain old trees and dead wood from which fire history may be reconstructed. An exception is the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF) in Poland for which we were able to reconstruct the fire history in detail. 2. From 886 tree ring samples collected in a 13-ha conifer-dominated area, we reconstructed fire events and tree establishment back to the mid 1600s. From 1653 to the late 1700s fires were very frequent, with mean point (single tree) fire intervals of 18 years and mean stand scale fire intervals of 6 years. After 1781, the intervals between the fires increased dramatically, and since 1874 no major fire was recorded. 3. Tree establishment underwent substantial changes, closely tracking shifts in fire frequency. When fires were frequent, Pinus sylvestris establishment occurred only sporadically. Later, less frequent fires promoted massive establishment of both P. sylvestris and Picea abies. At present, only P. abies and a few deciduous trees regenerate. 4. Synthesis. We present the first high-resolution fire history in the Central European temperate lowland forest area. The discovery of old P. sylvestris trees and stumps with fire scars in many conifer-dominated parts of BPF show that fire was a major component in the past dynamics of this forest. We also show that historically, fires were recurring at very close intervals, supporting an open, Pinus-dominated forest. These result contrasts with the written history of BPF, which focus on a few, large fires from the past. Human influence on the fire regime was probably substantial, although the disentangling of climatic and human impacts needs further studies. We propose that fire should be increasingly taken into consideration in models of disturbance, vegetation development and forest openness in the whole Central European lowland forest region.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wetlands
PY  - 1983
AB  - This paper demonstrates three examples of applying remote-sensing technology to the delineation of wetlands in the United States. First, the results of a technique to identify roseau cane (Phragmites communis) using LANDSAT and aircraft MSS data are presented. Approximately 9700 ha. of Phragmites communis were identified in the Mississippi River delta using LANDSAT data. Second, the results of a technique to identify wetland communities, principally mangroves, in Florida using LANDSAT and aircraft MSS are presented. A cost analysis of the remote versus conventional ground-survey technique is provided. The LANDSAT MSS average classification accuracy for mangroves only versus all classes were 87 percent and 74 percent, respectively. The third example presents the results of a technique to delineate surface cover types in the southeast tidal/riverine system of the Savannah River. Both forested and nonforested wetlands were delineated using multi-temporal LANDSAT MSS data. The average classification accuracy for wetland classes only was about 82 percent and for all cover types was about 78 percent.

TI  - Whispers on the Color Line: Rumor and Race in America
PY  - 2001
AB  - Whispers on the Color Line: Rumor and Race in America. By Gary Alan Fine and Patricia A. Turner. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001. Pp. x + 260, illustration, notes, index. $27.50 cloth) This book presents an important argument for folkloristics as both a valid academic discipline and a valuable intellectual tool for helping American culture work toward honest and productive racial understanding. It is built on Fine's conviction that folklore studies can play a central role in academia and on Turner's penetrating work on folk narrative in the black community, as seen in her classic I Heard it Through the Grapevine (1993). This work extends their scholarship to deal with a variety of persistent and newly emerged traditions, with particular attention given to the role of the Internet in transmitting folklore. Especially telling is the authors' development of Turner's 'Topsy/Eva" concept, holding that similar stories tend to circulate simultaneously in both black and white communities. In some cases, the stories provoke violent clashes, and the role of rumor in race riots throughout the twentieth century is well told. However, in many other cases the stories are distinct and reflect different cultural perspectives on a single concern-mercantilism, suspicion of government, sexually transmitted disease, and violent crime. There are many highlights: the discussion of legends inspired by fried chicken brings together insights from Fine's "Kentucky-fried rat" scholarship and Turner's discussion of the belief that some restaurant chains promote the Klan or add chemicals to their product to sterilize black males. The chapter on government conspiracies extends Turner's previous work into new areas, particularly the complex issues raised by Ron Brown's mysterious death in a plane accident in Bosnia. Turner and Fine reasonably note that rumors have a way of being true and rightly discuss what rumors say about the worldviews of the communities involved without the authors' committing themselves to conclusions about the truth/falsehood of such rumors. In this regard, the work is an important corrective to more popular-based approaches that begin with the assumption that contemporary legends are, above all else, false. On the other hand they do deal thoughtfully with the issues raised by false claims of attacks by the other race, and one of the most disturbing chapters discusses the influence of folk beliefs and narratives on the Tawana Brawley and Susan Smith affairs. A concluding chapter pulls together important lessons drawn from this research and suggests that both folklore and folkloristics could help reduce racial tensions and enhance communication between these historically divided communities. Without sugarcoating the difficulties that remain, Fine and Turner suggest ways in which members of both races could "listen to themselves and each other more carefully and critically" (229). While the book begins with a strong statement of the importance of contemporary legends and academic folkloristics, the key theoretical chapter, "How Rumors Work," says surprisingly little about folkloristic methodology, relying instead on older social science texts like Allport and Postman's Psychology of Rumor (1947) and Shibutani's Improvised News (1966). …

TI  - Spatial distribution of limited resources and local density regulation in juvenile Atlantic salmon
PY  - 2008
AB  - 1. Spatial heterogeneity of resources may influence competition among individuals and thus have a fundamental role in shaping population dynamics and carrying capacity. In the present study, we identify shelter opportunities as a limiting resource for juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.). Experimental and field studies are combined in order to demonstrate how the spatial distribution of shelters may influence population dynamics on both within and among population scales. 2. In closed experimental streams, fish performance scaled negatively with decreasing shelter availability and increasing densities. In contrast, the fish in open stream channels dispersed according to shelter availability and performance of fish remaining in the streams did not depend on initial density or shelters. 3. The field study confirmed that spatial variation in densities of 1-year-old juveniles was governed both by initial recruit density and shelter availability. Strength of density-dependent population regulation, measured as carrying capacity, increased with decreasing number of shelters. 4. Nine rivers were surveyed for spatial variation in shelter availability and increased shelter heterogeneity tended to decrease maximum observed population size (measured using catch statistics of adult salmon as a proxy). 5. Our studies highlight the importance of small-scale within-population spatial structure in population dynamics and demonstrate that not only the absolute amount of limiting resources but also their spatial arrangement can be an important factor influencing population carrying capacity.

TI  - Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Reservoir Water Surfaces: A New Global Synthesis
PY  - 2016
AB  - Collectively, reservoirs created by dams are thought to be an important source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.5-1.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.

TI  - A water level drawdown index for aquatic macrophytes in Nordic lakes
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many northern lakes are regulated to enhance hydropower production and flood protection. This bears hydromorphological pressures which are important factors causing lowered ecological status. Water level fluctuation triggers erosion on the shoreline and, depending on fluctuation range, also affects species composition or disappearance of sensitive aquatic macrophytes. We developed a water level-drawdown index (WIc) for Nordic lakes using macrophyte data from 73 lakes with varying water level fluctuation in Finland, Norway and Sweden. The index is based on the ratio between sensitive and tolerant macrophyte species. The sensitive and tolerant species are identified based on a percentile approach, analysing the presence or absence of species along the winter drawdown range. The index correlates well with winter drawdown in Finnish and Norwegian lakes with strongest correlations with winter drawdown in storage lakes (lakes regulated for hydroelectric power and with a considerable winter drawdown). The WIc-index is applicable in low alkalinity, oligotrophic and ice-covered lakes, and is suggested to be a useful tool to identify and designate heavily modified water bodies in Nordic lakes according to the European Water Framework Directive.

TI  - History of forest fires in eastern Finland from the fifteenth century AD - the possible effects of slash-and-burn cultivation
PY  - 1997
AB  - The history of forest fires in two areas in eastern Finland, Kitsi and Ahvenjarvi, both of about 150 ha, is studied by dendrochronological dating of fire scars. Forty-nine samples were collected from Kitsi and 20 samples from Ahvenjarvi. The history of fires spans the period AD 1403-1994 at Kitsi and 1359-1994 at Ahvenjarvi, within which a total of 23 fire years were dated for Kitsi and 22 for Ahvenjarvi. Over the 400- year period of AD 1500-1900, fires occurred an average of once every 19.2 years in Kitsi and once every 20.6 years in Ahvenjarvi. The mean fire interval at Kitsi was 42.3 years and that at Ahvenjarvi 48.8 years before AD 1650 and 32.2 years after 1650. Forest fires increased towards the end of the seventeenth century and decreased markedly after 1850. There were fewer fires for a time at the beginning of the eighteenth century, especially in Kitsi. The changes in the history of fires reflect changes in the population of North Karelia and the extent of slash-and-burn cultivation. Past forest...

TI  - UNEP-SETAC guideline on global land use impact assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services in LCA
PY  - 2013
AB  - As a consequence of the multi-functionality of land, the impact assessment of land use in Life Cycle Impact Assessment requires the modelling of several impact pathways covering biodiversity and ecosystem services. To provide consistency amongst these separate impact pathways, general principles for their modelling are provided in this paper. These are refinements to the principles that have already been proposed in publications by the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative. In particular, this paper addresses the calculation of land use interventions and land use impacts, the issue of impact reversibility, the spatial and temporal distribution of such impacts and the assessment of absolute or relative ecosystem quality changes. Based on this, we propose a guideline to build methods for land use impact assessment in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Recommendations are given for the development of new characterization models and for which a series of key elements should explicitly be stated, such as the modelled land use impact pathways, the land use/cover typology covered, the level of biogeographical differentiation used for the characterization factors, the reference land use situation used and if relative or absolute quality changes are used to calculate land use impacts. Moreover, for an application of the characterisation factors (CFs) in an LCA study, data collection should be transparent with respect to the data input required from the land use inventory and the regeneration times. Indications on how generic CFs can be used for the background system as well as how spatial-based CFs can be calculated for the foreground system in a specific LCA study and how land use change is to be allocated should be detailed. Finally, it becomes necessary to justify the modelling period for which land use impacts of land transformation and occupation are calculated and how uncertainty is accounted for. The presented guideline is based on a number of assumptions: Discrete land use types are sufficient for an assessment of land use impacts; ecosystem quality remains constant over time of occupation; time and area of occupation are substitutable; transformation time is negligible; regeneration is linear and independent from land use history and landscape configuration; biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services are independent; the ecological impact is linearly increasing with the intervention; and there is no interaction between land use and other drivers such as climate change. These assumptions might influence the results of land use Life Cycle Impact Assessment and need to be critically reflected. In this and the other papers of the special issue, we presented the principles and recommendations for the calculation of land use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services on a global scale. In the framework of LCA, they are mainly used for the assessment of land use impacts in the background system. The main areas for further development are the link to regional ecological models running in the foreground system, relative weighting of the ecosystem services midpoints and indirect land use.

TI  - Seasonal growth patterns of wild juvenile fish: partitioning variation among explanatory variables, based on individual growth trajectories of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parr
PY  - 2004
AB  - We present an empirical, analytical model that estimates both temperature and seasonal response functions for the growth of wild juvenile fish without the need for costly tank experiments in less realistic conditions. 2. Analysis of monthly recapture data on the lengths and weights of individual wild juvenile fish demonstrates that simple temperature-driven models of growth can be less informative than more realistic, empirical, models. 3. A case study of wild Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar) showed that: most growth took place in a 10-week period in spring, at temperatures below those that previous published models report as necessary for rapid growth and at faster rates than the maximum that previous models predicted. 4. Temperature and fish size allometry explained 45% of growth variation, but the effects of temperature were significantly and markedly different at different seasons. 5. Seasonal effects explained an additional 18% of the variation and were strongly associated with the abundance of potential 'drift' food. 6. The seasonal patterns for growth in length and weight were different, implying differential allocation of resources to structural and reserve tissues. 7. The growth patterns of sexually maturing male parr and emigrants also differed in comparison to other parr. 8. Condition factor, length at first capture and seasonal interactions with both early maturity and smolting explained another 7% of the variation. 9. However, individual fish did not grow consistently better, or worse, than the 'average' fish. 10. This study emphasizes the necessity to test the adequacy of laboratory-based physiological models with suitably detailed field data and to focus model refinement by identifying processes which otherwise confound interpretation.

TI  - Regional-scale land-cover change during the 20th century and its consequences for biodiversity.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Extensive changes in land cover during the 20th century are known to have had detrimental effects on biodiversity in rural landscapes, but the magnitude of change and their ecological effects are not well known on regional scales. We digitized historical maps from the beginning of the 20th century over a 1652 km(2) study area in southeastern Sweden, comparing it to modern-day land cover with a focus on valuable habitat types. Semi-natural grassland cover decreased by over 96 % in the study area, being largely lost to afforestation and silviculture. Grasslands on finer soils were more likely to be converted into modern grassland or arable fields. However, in addition to remaining semi-natural grassland, today's valuable deciduous forest and wetland habitats were mostly grazed grassland in 1900. An analysis of the landscape-level biodiversity revealed that plant species richness was generally more related to the modern landscape, with grazing management being a positive influence on species richness.

TI  - GIS-Based Regionalized Life Cycle Assessment: How Big Is Small Enough? Methodology and Case Study of Electricity Generation
PY  - 2011
AB  - We describe a new methodology for performing regionalized life cycle assessment and systematically choosing the spatial scale of regionalized impact assessment methods. We extend standard matrix-based calculations to include matrices that describe the mapping from inventory to impact assessment spatial supports. Uncertainty in inventory spatial data is modeled using a discrete spatial distribution function, which in a case study is derived from empirical data. The minimization of global spatial autocorrelation is used to choose the optimal spatial scale of impact assessment methods. We demonstrate these techniques on electricity production in the United States, using regionalized impact assessment methods for air emissions and freshwater consumption. Case study results show important differences between site-generic and regionalized calculations, and provide specific guidance for future improvements of inventory data sets and impact assessment methods.

TI  - Pre- and post-European settlement fire history of red pine dominated forest ecosystems of Seney National Wildlife Refuge, Upper Michigan
PY  - 2008
AB  - To understand the dynamics of fire in red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) forest ecosystems that once dominated areas of the northern Lake States, we dendrochronologically reconstructed the fire regime prior to European settlement (pre-1860), after European settlement (1860-1935), and postrefuge establishment (post-1935) for different portions (wilder- ness and nonwilderness) and landforms (sand ridges and outwash channels) of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in eastern Upper Michigan. Using data from 50 sites, we found that the cumulative number of fires showed a slow rate of accumulation from the 1700s to 1859, a steeper pattern suggesting higher fire occurrence from 1860 to 1935, and a return to fewer fires after 1935. Prior to European settlement, the fire cycle (FC) of sand ridge landforms inter- spersed within a poorly drained lacustrine plain in the Seney Wilderness Area was 91-144 years. This was longer than on glacial outwash channel landforms (53 years) and on sand ridge landforms interspersed within lacustrine plains located outside of the wilderness (47 years). The FC was also shorter (30 years) during this period and has subsequently increased (149-1090 years) after SNWR establishment. Differences in fire regimes among landform types were minor relative to the temporal variation in fire regimes among the three time periods.

TI  - Effects of spawning distribution on juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) density and growth
PY  - 2011
AB  - We test whether the spatial distribution of spawning sites in a natural population is related to the density and individual growth rate of juvenile stream-dwelling salmonids. For this purpose, fine-scale data on the spatial distribution of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) nest sites, juvenile densities and body size, and habitat characteristics were combined. The area of nests summed over reaches of 25 m in length was positively correlated with local young-of-the-year (YOY) densities and was the strongest predictor of local densities. In turn, increased YOY densities were related to slower growth, and YOY density was the strongest predictor of YOY size. Measured habitat variables had little effect on YOY density over the spatial scale examined, which suggests that redistribution of YOY salmon according to habitat preferences was limited. The distribution of spawning sites was therefore the best predictor of local densities and subsequently YOY growth. Thus, during the YOY stage when dispersal is limited, pat...

TI  - Freshwater fishes, their biodiversity, habitats and fisheries in the Nordic countries
PY  - 2008
AB  - Finland, Norway and Sweden have in total about 126500 lakes larger than four hectares. In Finland and Sweden, approximately 10% of the surface area is freshwater; whereas in Norway, it is about 6%. Altogether 56 fish species are reproducing in the Nordic freshwaters, including four lamprey species. Due to geographical differences, the freshwater fish fauna differs considerably in the northern and southern parts; but species richness increases also from west to east. The proportion of recreational fishermen in Norway, Finland and Sweden was about 50%, 40% and 27 %, respectively, in 2004. Professional freshwater fishing is declining, but is still important in some lakes in Finland and Sweden. In all three countries, fishing rights belong to the water or land owner, with some exceptions. Water quality has improved in recent decades due to decreased nutrient loads from point sources, but the limitation of scattered nutrient loads has been less successful. This development can also be seen in the responses of ...

TI  - Analysis of Dynamic Thresholds for the Normalized Difference Water Index
PY  - 2009
AB  - The normalized difference water index (NDWI) has been successfully used to delineate surface water features. However, two major problems have been often encountered: (a) NDWIs calculated from different band combinations [visible, nearinfrared, or shortwave-infrared (SWIR)] can generate different results, and (b) NDWI thresholds vary depending on the proportions of subpixel water/non-water components. We need to evaluate all the NDWIs for determining the best performing index and to establish appropriate thresholds for clearly identifying water features. We used the spectral data obtained from a spectral library to simulate the satellite sensors Landsat ETM, SPOT-5, ASTER, and MODIS, and calculated the simulated NDWI in different forms. We found that the NDWI calculated from (green ‐ SWIR)/(green SWIR), where SWIR is the shorter wavelength region (1.2 to 1.8 mm), has the most stable threshold. We recommend this NDWI be employed for mapping water, but adjustment of the threshold based on actual situations is necessary.

TI  - COMMUNITY AREA AND FOOD-CHAIN LENGTH: THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
PY  - 1991
AB  - In combination with the simplest forms of the species-area curve (a power function or a simple proportionality between species and area), the cascade model predicts that the maximal chain length of a community food web (the height) should increase more slowly than linearly as a function of the logarithm of area and asymptotically in islands with extremely large area and extremely large numbers of species. The average chain length, according to the cascade model, should exceed 3.5 as soon as islands are large enough to have thirty or more species and should approach a finite limit, approximately 4.0, in webs from arbitrarily large islands. Thus the ratio of the height to the average chain length in the cascade model asymptotically increases without limit in webs from very large islands with very large numbers of species. According to the superlinear homogeneous model, both the height and the average chain length increase as a power, less than one, of the number of species, and therefore as a power, less th...

TI  - Production of juvenile salmonids in small Norwegian streams is affected by agricultural land use
PY  - 2011
AB  - SUMMARY 1. We estimated the biomass and production of juvenile anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) (parr) in 12 streams in the Skagerrak area of Norway to identify controlling environmental factors, such as land-use and water chemistry. 2. Production estimates correlated positively with fish density in early summer, but not with the size of the catchment. The summer biomass of age-0 brown trout and Atlantic salmon was smaller than that of age-1 and constituted 27.4 and 25.7%, respectively, of the total biomass of the two groups. 3. Mean production of brown trout from July to September varied between streams, but in most cases it was below 2 g 100 m )2 day )1 . Yearly cohort production from age-0 in July to age-1 in July was 10 g m )2 or less, with mean annual production of 1.32 g 100 m )2 day )1 , equivalent to 4.8 g m )2 year )1 . The corresponding annual cohort production of Atlantic salmon was 0.38 g 100 m )2 day )1 or 1.4 g m )2 year )1 . Annual production to biomass ratio (P ⁄B) for brown trout of the same cohort in the various streams was between 1.47 and 4.37; the overall mean (±SD) for all streams was 2.25 ± 0.94. Mean turnover rate of Atlantic salmon was 2.73 ± 0.24. 4. Production of 0+ brown trout during the summer correlated significantly with the percentage of agricultural land and forest ⁄ bogs in the catchment, with maxima at 20 and 75%, respectively. Age-0 brown trout production also correlated with concentration of nitrogen and calcium in the water, with maxima at 2.4 and 14 mg L )1 , respectively. 5. The results support the hypothesis that brown trout parr production reflects the quality of their habitat, as indicated by the dome-shaped relationship between percentage of agricultural land and the concentration of nitrogen and calcium in the water.

TI  - Carbon dioxide and methane emissions and the carbon budget of a 10-year old tropical reservoir (Petit Saut, French Guiana)
PY  - 2005
AB  - emissions, 0.07 ± 0.01) the first 3 years after impounding (1994–1996) and then decreased to 0.12 ± 0.01 Mt yr 1 C( CO2, 0.10 ± 0.01; CH4, 0.016 ± 0.006) since 2000. On average over the 10 years, 61% of the CO2 emissions occurred by diffusion from the reservoir surface, 31% from the estuary, 7% by degassing at the outlet of the dam, and a negligible fraction by bubbling. CH4 diffusion and bubbling from the reservoir surface were predominant (40% and 44%, respectively) only the first year after impounding. Since 1995, degassing at an aerating weir downstream of the turbines has become the major pathway for CH4 emissions, reaching 70% of the total CH4 flux. In 2003, river carbon inputs were balanced by carbon outputs to the ocean and were about 3 times lower than the atmospheric flux, which suggests that 10 years after impounding, the flooded terrestrial carbon is still the predominant contributor to the gaseous emissions. In 10 years, about 22% of the 10 Mt C flooded was lost to the atmosphere. Our results confirm the significance of greenhouse gas emissions from tropical reservoir but stress the importance of: (1) considering all the gas pathways upstream and downstream of the dams and (2) taking into account the reservoir age when upscaling emissions rates at the global scale.

TI  - Vehicle traffic shapes grizzly bear behaviour on a multiple‐use landscape
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary Roads cause functional habitat loss, alter movement patterns and can become ecological traps for wildlife. Many of the negative effects of roads are likely to be a function of the human use of roads, not the road itself. However, few studies have examined the effect of temporally and spatially varying traffic patterns on large mammals, which could lead to misinterpretations about the impact of roads on wildlife. We developed models of traffic volume for an entire road network in south-western Alberta, Canada, and documented for the first time the response of grizzly bears Ursus arctos L to a wide range of traffic levels. Traffic patterns caused a clear behavioural shift in grizzly bears, with increased use of areas near roads and movement across roads during the night when traffic was low. Bears selected areas near roads travelled by fewer than 20 vehicles per day and were more likely to cross these roads. Bears avoided roads receiving moderate traffic (20–100 vehicles per day) and strongly avoided high-use roads (>100 vehicles per day) at all times. Synthesis and applications. Grizzly bear responses to traffic caused a departure from typical behavioural patterns, with bears in our study being largely nocturnal. In addition, bears selected private agricultural land, which had lower traffic levels, but higher road density, over multi-use public land. These results improve our understanding of bear responses to roads and can be used to refine management practices. Future management plans should employ a multi-pronged approach aimed at limiting both road density and traffic in core habitats. Access management will be critical in such plans and is an important tool for conserving threatened wildlife populations.

TI  - Climate and wildfires in the North American boreal forest
PY  - 2008
AB  - The area burned in the North American boreal forest is controlled by the frequency of mid-tropospheric blocking highs that cause rapid fuel drying. Climate controls the area burned through changing the dynamics of large-scale teleconnection patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation/El Nino Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation, PDO/ENSO and AO) that control the frequency of blocking highs over the continent at different time scales. Changes in these teleconnections may be caused by the current global warming. Thus, an increase in temperature alone need not be associated with an increase in area burned in the North American boreal forest. Since the end of the Little Ice Age, the climate has been unusually moist and variable: large fire years have occurred in unusual years, fire frequency has decreased and fire–climate relationships have occurred at interannual to decadal time scales. Prolonged and severe droughts were common in the past and were partly associated with changes in the PDO/ENSO system. Under these conditions, large fire years become common, fire frequency increases and fire–climate relationships occur at decadal to centennial time scales. A suggested return to the drier climate regimes of the past would imply major changes in the temporal dynamics of fire–climate relationships and in area burned, a reduction in the mean age of the forest, and changes in species composition of the North American boreal forest.

TI  - Potential effects of ongoing and proposed hydropower development on terrestrial biological diversity in the Indian Himalaya.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Indian Himalayan basins are earmarked for widespread dam building, but aggregate effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems are unknown. We mapped distribution of 292 dams (under construction and proposed) and projected effects of these dams on terrestrial ecosystems under different scenarios of land-cover loss. We analyzed land-cover data of the Himalayan valleys, where dams are located. We estimated dam density on fifth- through seventh-order rivers and compared these estimates with current global figures. We used a species-area relation model (SAR) to predict short- and long-term species extinctions driven by deforestation. We used scatter plots and correlation studies to analyze distribution patterns of species and dams and to reveal potential overlap between species-rich areas and dam sites. We investigated effects of disturbance on community structure of undisturbed forests. Nearly 90% of Indian Himalayan valleys would be affected by dam building and 27% of these dams would affect dense forests. Our model projected that 54,117 ha of forests would be submerged and 114,361 ha would be damaged by dam-related activities. A dam density of 0.3247/1000 km(2) would be nearly 62 times greater than current average global figures; the average of 1 dam for every 32 km of river channel would be 1.5 times higher than figures reported for U.S. rivers. Our results show that most dams would be located in species-rich areas of the Himalaya. The SAR model projected that by 2025, deforestation due to dam building would likely result in extinction of 22 angiosperm and 7 vertebrate taxa. Disturbance due to dam building would likely reduce tree species richness by 35%, tree density by 42%, and tree basal cover by 30% in dense forests. These results, combined with relatively weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, point toward significant loss of species if all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed.

TI  - Impacts of ecosystem fragmentation on plant populations: generalising the idiosyncratic
PY  - 2003
AB  - Fragmentation of natural vegetation is one of the most pervasive changes in terrestrial ecosystems across the Earth. Developing a general understanding of how fragmentation affects plant and animal populations is essential to meet the pressing need for guidelines for the management of fragmented systems. Nevertheless, this general understanding has to take account of differences in ecosystem types and different biogeographic, evolutionary and ecological backgrounds against which fragmentation impacts are played out in different parts of the world. Here, we examine fragmentation impacts on plant populations by considering the processes underlying fragmentation. We suggest that it is critical to focus on the key processes that are important in particular situations, rather than assuming that the same factors are likely to be important everywhere. In other words, there are inevitable limits to generalisation because of the idiosyncratic nature of the geography, history and biota of different regions. Studies on the effects of fragmentation on plant populations have focused on a limited subset of plant types and have concentrated heavily on reproductive output rather than actual regeneration success. These studies have indicated a clear impact of fragmentation on fecundity, but there is no clear signal in terms of the actual importance of this in relation to population viability. Other factors including local habitat conditions, disturbance and competition from weeds may be just as important as the classical biogeographical impacts of fragmentation. Generalisations based on a clear assessment of key life-history processes may be valuable tools in developing management responses to ecosystem fragmentation, but this requires considerably more emphasis on factors affecting successful recruitment as well as factors affecting fecundity.

TI  - Reindeer and caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ) response towards human activities
PY  - 2009
AB  - We address the question of how human activities and infrastructure influence reindeer/caribou’s ( Rangifer tarandus ) behaviour and habitat use and review studies based on current methodologies. Anthropogenic activities have a direct affect on Rangifer behaviour through the senses hearing, sight and smell, and all of these are important tools for behavioural risk assessment. Short term indirect responses, such as habituation, sensitisation, avoidance, and displacement, develop through neutral, positive or negative associations towards stimulus in terms of Rangifer ’s ability to experience, learn, and remember. Long term behavioural responses develop through interaction with predators and, for reindeer, also domestication. A survey of the literature dealing with behavioural studies reveals that although Rangifer in most cases retreat from anthropogenic activities, comfort distances (i.e. distances beyond which animal behaviour or activity are not influenced) are relatively short. In most cases, energetic implications appear moderate and small compared to other natural, biotic influences such as disturbance (and death) caused by insect and/or predator harassment. Unless obstructing access, physical constructions of various kinds apparently have limited effects on Rangifer behaviour or habitat use. On the other hand, constructions that do obstruct or limit access and recreational or other motorized and non-motorized activities appear to have stronger impacts on avoidance and redistribution of Rangifer . Behavioural effects that might decrease survival and reproduction include retreat from favourable habitat near disturbance sources and reduction of time spent feeding with resulting energy depletion over time. Rangifer habitat use, habitat avoidance, and feeding preferences are governed by a complexity of natural interacting factors. Domestication, habituation and sensitisation are essential in shaping Rangifer ’s adaptability, and should be included in future studies on reindeer and caribou responses towards various anthropogenic activities. Although cumulative effects from human activities are likely, it remains difficult to separate these from natural variations in Rangifer habitat use and demography. Habitat avoidance towards various human infrastructures and activities is reported, but most studies reporting relatively far (4-25 km) avoidance distances relied on measurements of range properties and animal distribution recorded on 1-2 days annually in winter to induce a potential response from the animals and lack important environmental variables and/or alternative hypothesises. This methodology should be improved in order to enable identification of correlation versus causation. Studies relying on animal behaviour measurements can more correctly identify and test responses to various stimuli while also controlling for degree of domestication and other various environmental variables, but only in a limited time and spatial scale. Furthermore, such studies may not necessarily capture potential population consequences from disturbances. Thus, there are important weaknesses in the two leading methodologies (measuring animal behaviour and indirectly mapping regional/population movements and habitat use through measurements of range properties). To best study Rangifer ’s responses towards anthropogenic infrastructure and activities, we propose that the two methodologies be combined and supplied with modern GPS/telemetry. Abstract in Norwegian / Sammendrag: Rein og caribous reaksjon pa forskjellige menneskelige aktiviteter og installasjoner Vi adresserer sporsmalet om hvordan menneskelig aktivitet og infrastruktur pavirker rein/caribous ( Rangifer tarandus ) atferd og omradebruk og gjennomgar publiserte arbeider basert pa aktuelle metoder. Antropogene aktiviteter har direkte effekt pa reinens atferd via horsel, syn og lukt; alle er viktige for deres risikovurdering. Kortsiktige indirekte reaksjonsmonstre, slik som habituering, sensitivisering, unnvikelse og fortrengning utvikles gjennom noytrale, positive eller negative opplevelser av stimuli i henhold til erfaring, laering og hukommelse. Utviklingen av permanente atferdsmonstre skjer ved samvirke med predatorer og for reinens del, ogsa ved domestisering. En litteraturoversikt om atferdsstudier viser at selv om Rangifer i de fleste tilfeller unnviker antropogene virksomheter, sa er de avstander dyrene velger a ha mellom seg og infrastruktur uten at normalatferden endres, relativt korte. De energimessige implikasjonene er ogsa beskjedne sammenlignet med virkningen av naturlige stressfaktorer sa som forstyrrelser (og dod) forarsaket av insekter og predatorer. Fysiske installasjoner av ulik art har ogsa begrenset effekt med mindre de fysisk hindrer Rangifer s omradebruk. Pa den annen side vil fysiske installasjoner, som hindrer eller begrenser bruken av omrader, og trafikk, bade fottrafikk og trafikk med motorkjoretoy, kunne ha sterkere virkning pa unnvikelsesatferd og omradebruk. Atferdsmessige effekter som kan redusere overlevelse og reproduksjon omfatter unnvikelse fra beiteomrader naer forstyrrelseskilder. For Rangifer er det negative resultatet av dette oket aktivitet, redusert beitetid og nedbygging av energireserver. Rangifer s omradebruk, unnvikelsesatferd og naeringspreferanser bestemmes ut fra et kompleks av naturlige og gjensidig pavirkende faktorer. Domestisering, habituering og sensitivisering som er sentrale begrep i utformningen av Rangifer s tilpasningsevne, bor inkluderes i fremtidige studier av rein og caribous reaksjon pa antropogene aktiviteter. Selv om en kumulativ atferdseffekt av menneskelige aktiviteter er mulig, er det vanskelig a skille slike fra naturlige variasjoner som folge av variasjoner i omradebruk og bestandsdynamiske forhold. Habitatunnvikelse som folge av menneskelig pavirkning er rapportert. De fleste studiene som rapporterer relativt lange unnvikelsesavstander (4-25 km) er imidlertid basert pa malinger av beiteslitasje og lokalisering av dyr registrert i lopet av 1-2 dager arlig i lopet av vinteren og mangler viktige miljoparametere og/eller alternative hypoteser. Denne metoden bor forbedres for a kunne skille mellom korrelasjon og kausalitet. Malinger av atferd gjor mulig en mer korrekt testing av Rangifer s reaksjon pa ulike antropogene stimuli samtidig som man kontrollerer for graden av domestisering og forskjellige miljofaktorer. Atferdsstudiene avgrenses imidlertid i bade tid og rom og vil vanligvis ikke fange opp eventuelle bestandsdynamiske konsekvenser av forstyrrelser. Det hefter folgelig svakheter ved begge de to dominerende metodene som i dag anvendes; maling av atferd og bestandsfordeling og indirekte kartlegging av omradebruk ved maling av beiteslitasje. For a oppna en bedre studiedesign for maling av Rangifer s reaksjon pa antropogen infrastruktur og tilknyttede aktiviteter foreslar vi at de to metodene kombineres og suppleres med GPS/telemetri teknologi.

TI  - Spatial and temporal corroboration of a fire-scar-based fire history in a frequently burned ponderosa pine forest.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Fire scars are used widely to reconstruct historical fire regime parameters in forests around the world. Because fire scars provide incomplete records of past fire occurrence at discrete points in space, inferences must be made to reconstruct fire frequency and extent across landscapes using spatial networks of fire-scar samples. Assessing the relative accuracy of fire-scar fire history reconstructions has been hampered due to a lack of empirical comparisons with independent fire history data sources. We carried out such a comparison in a 2780-ha ponderosa pine forest on Mica Mountain in southern Arizona (USA) for the time period 1937–2000. Using documentary records of fire perimeter maps and ignition locations, we compared reconstructions of key spatial and temporal fire regime parameters developed from documentary fire maps and independently collected fire-scar data (n = 60 plots). We found that fire-scar data provided spatially representative and complete inventories of all major fire years (>100 ha) i...

TI  - TERRESTRIAL HABITAT USE BY NESTING PAINTED TURTLES IN LANDSCAPES WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF FRAGMENTATION
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract As part of a comprehensive study of the effects of landscape change on the demography of aquatic turtles, we investigated the use of upland habitats by adult female painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) during the nesting season. We intentionally selected three ponds that were surrounded by a range of land uses and development (e.g., road density ranged from 0.9 to 7.3 km/km2). Terrestrial locations of transmitter-equipped turtles (n = 8) and unmarked females that were incidentally encountered (n = 10) were recorded to: i) determine the distance traveled to nesting habitat, ii) estimate the frequency that female turtles crossed roads to reach nesting habitat, and iii) examine how the abundance of potential nesting habitat affected distance traveled. Average straight-line distance from shoreline to the site a female turtle was encountered ranged from 54 to 115 m for the three ponds. We estimated that marked turtles made five road crossings and two turtles were killed by vehicles. Distance traveled was...

TI  - Post‐war changes in arable farming and biodiversity in Great Britain
PY  - 2002
AB  - Summary 1. Agriculture represents the dominant land use throughout much of western Europe, and a significant part of European biodiversity is associated with this habitat. We attempted to quantify the changes in agriculture and biodiversity in Britain since the 1940s. 2. There have been widespread declines in the populations of many groups of organisms associated with farmland in Britain and north-west Europe. The declines have been particularly marked amongst habitat specialists; many of the taxa still common on farmland are habitat generalists. 3. Farming practices have become increasingly intensive in the post-war period, with a dramatic reduction in landscape diversity. Since 1945, there has been a 65% decline in the number of farms, a 77% decline in farm labour and an almost fourfold increase in yield. Farms have become more specialized; the greatly increased use of machinery has made operations quicker and more efficient, but has resulted in the removal of 50% of the hedgerow stock. Autumn sowing of crops has become predominant, with winter stubbles now far less prevalent. The number and extent of chemical applications has increased greatly, but the net amount applied, and their persistence, has decreased in recent years. 4. Intensification has had a wide range of impacts on biodiversity, but data for many taxa are too scarce to permit a detailed assessment of the factors involved. Reduction in habitat diversity was important in the 1950s and 1960s; reduction in habitat quality is probably more important now. 5. As a case study, the declines in populations of seed-eating birds populations were assessed in relation to changing agricultural management. Generally, the declines were likely to be caused by a reduced food supply in the non-breeding season, although other factors may be important for particular species. 6. Agriculture will face a number of challenges in the medium term. While research into the mechanisms underlying species and habitat associations, and their interaction with scale, will be critical in under-pinning management, consideration of farmer attitudes and socio-economic factors is likely to be as important. Biodiversity may benefit from integrated farming techniques but these need to incorporate environmental objectives explicitly, rather than as a fringe benefit.

TI  - Fire in the Virgin Forests of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, Minnesota
PY  - 1973
AB  - Fire largely determined the composition and structure of the presettlement vegetation of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area as well as the vegetation mosaic on the landscape and the habitat patterns for wildlife. It also influenced nutrient cycles, and energy pathways, and helped maintain the diversity, productivity, and long-term stability of the ecosystem. Thus the whole ecosystem was fire-dependent. At least some overstory elements in virtually all forest stands still date from regeneration that followed one or more fires since 1595 A.D. The average interval between significant fire years was about 4 yr in presettlement times, but shortened to 2 yr from 1868 to 1910 during settlement. However, 83% of the area burned before the beginning of suppression programs resulted from just nine fire periods: 1894, 1875, 1863–1964, 1824, 1801, 1755–1959, 1727, 1692, 1681. The average interval between these major fire years was 26 yr. Most present virgin forests date from regeneration that followed fires in these years. Significant areas were also regenerated by fires in 1903, 1910, 1936, and 1971. Most major fire years occurred during prolonged summer droughts of subcontinental extent, such as those of 1864, 1910, and 1936. Many fires were man-caused, but lightning ignitions were also common. Lightning alone is probably a sufficient source of ignitions to guarantee that older stands burned before attaining climax. Dry matter accumulations, spruce budworm outbreaks, blowdowns, and other interactions related to time since fire increase the probability that old stands will burn. Vegetation patterns on the landscape were influenced by such natural firebreaks as lakes, streams, wetlands, and moist slopes. Red and white pine are most common on islands, and to the east, northeast, or southeast of such firebreaks. Jack pine, aspen-birch, and sprout hardwood forests are most common on large uplands distant from or west of such firebreaks. A Natural Fire Rotation of about 100 yr prevailed in presettlement times, but many red and white pine stands remained largely intact for 150–350 yr, and some jack pine and aspen-birch forests probably burned at intervals of 50 yr or less. There is paleoecological evidence that fire was an ecosystem factor before European man arrived, and even before early man migrated to North America. Probably few areas ever attained the postulated fir-spruce-cedar-birch climax in postglacial times. To understand the dynamics of fire-dependent ecosystems fire must be studied as an integral part of the system. The search for stable communities that might develop without fire is futile and avoids the real challenge of understanding nature on her own terms. To restore the natural ecosystem of the Canoe Area fire should soon be reintroduced through a program of prescribed fires and monitored lightning fires. Failing this, major unnatural, perhaps unpredictable, changes in the ecosystem will occur.

TI  - Functional landscape heterogeneity and animal biodiversity in agricultural landscapes
PY  - 2010
AB  - Biodiversity in agricultural landscapes can be increased with conversion of some production lands into 'more-natural'- unmanaged or extensively managed - lands. However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of 'functional landscape heterogeneity'. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - 1. Despite recent interest in linkages between above- and below-ground communities and their consequences for ecosystem processes, much remains unknown about their responses to long-term ecosystem change. We synthesize multiple lines of evidence from a long-term natural experiment to illustrate how ecosystem retrogression (the decline in ecosystem process rates due to long-term absence of major disturbance) drives vegetation change, and thus above-ground and below-ground carbon (C) sequestration, and communities of consumer biota.

TI  - Global biodiversity scenarios for the year 2100.
PY  - 2000
AB  - Scenarios of changes in biodiversity for the year 2100 can now be developed based on scenarios of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide, climate, vegetation, and land use and the known sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. This study identified a ranking of the importance of drivers of change, a ranking of the biomes with respect to expected changes, and the major sources of uncertainties. For terrestrial ecosystems, land-use change probably will have the largest effect, followed by climate change, nitrogen deposition, biotic exchange, and elevated carbon dioxide concentration. For freshwater ecosystems, biotic exchange is much more important. Mediterranean climate and grassland ecosystems likely will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity because of the substantial influence of all drivers of biodiversity change. Northern temperate ecosystems are estimated to experience the least biodiversity change because major land-use change has already occurred. Plausible changes in biodiversity in other biomes depend on interactions among the causes of biodiversity change. These interactions represent one of the largest uncertainties in projections of future biodiversity change.

TI  - Testing for anthropogenic influence on fire regime for a 600-year period in the Jaksha area, Komi Republic, East European Russia
PY  - 2004
AB  - In an attempt to quantitatively evaluate the natural versus anthropogenic signal in site fire histories, the statistical relationship between dendrochronologically dated fire events and tree-ring chronologies (deemed to be an independent proxy for climate variation) was analyzed for 14 sites in a 2600-km(2) area of pine-dominated forests in the Komi Republic (East European Russia) over the period from 1424 to 1954. We developed a cumulative measure of statistical fit between two types of fire events (early- and late-season fires) and ring-width chronologies of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) (total ring- and latewood-width chronologies). For a given site, the statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data tended to decrease with an increasing proportion of unique fire years. Distance from a site to the nearest village (deemed to be a proxy of human impact) explained 50% of the variation in statistical fit between fires and tree-ring data. The fit decreased in the majority of the sites from the earlier (1424-1700) to the later (1700-1960) periods. We interpret this to be a result of increased human impact on the fire regime since 1700 due to intensified colonization of the area.

TI  - Supplementary winter feeding of wild red deer Cervus elaphus in Europe and North America: justifications, feeding practice and effectiveness
PY  - 2004
AB  - Supplementary winter feeding of game animals, and particularly deer, is a common prac- tice throughout northern (continental) Europe and parts of North America. Feeding is normally associated with maintaining high densities of animals for hunting, in terms of: (i) maintaining or increasing body weights and condition overwinter; (ii) improving reproductive performance and fertility; (iii) increasing overwinter survival; and (iv) reducing levels of damage caused to agriculture and forestry or the natural heritage. We consider the balance of evidence on the effectiveness of winter feeding of red deer Cervus elaphus in achieving these objectives. Where that evidence is equivocal, we attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions to evaluate the circumstances under which winter feeding may or may not be effective. 2. In general, feeding of red deer on open range appears to have relatively little effect on body weights or fecundity. Effects on increasing antler size and quality are variable and seem to depend on the degree to which animals may be mineral limited on native range. Effects on survival are similarly ambiguous. It is apparent, however, that to be effective in reducing mortality, any supplementation is required early in the season and not simply when heavy mortalities are already being experienced. If provision of supplementary foods is delayed until animals are perceived already to be in poor condition, such feeding may have little effect. 3. One of the primary goals of winter feeding in both Europe and the USA has become the prevention of environmental damage, particularly damage to commercial and native forests, while maintaining deer populations at densities suitable for hunting. Again, empirical evidence for effectiveness in this regard is inconclusive, with some studies showing a decrease in damage caused, some showing no effect and others showing a significant increase in local impact. 4. There are equally a number of problems associated with the provision of supplementary feeds overwinter. Those animals which come to the feeding stations may develop a reliance on the food supplement provided, reducing intake of natural forages to near zero; where feed provided is less than 100% of daily requirement, such animals may regularly lose, rather than gain condition. Feed provision is also extremely uneven at such feeding stations; dominant stags displace younger stags and hinds from the feed provided until they have themselves finished feeding. Concentrations of high densities of animals around small feed-areas may also increase the risk of infection and lead to development of high parasite burdens. 5. In an attempt to assess the current status and distribution of supplementary winter feeding in Scotland, a questionnaire was circulated to a number of individual across the country. Results of this survey are summarized and conclusions presented on the likely effectiveness of current feeding practices in achieving their aims.

TI  - Mapping Alpine Landscape Values and Related Threats as Perceived by Tourists
PY  - 2014
AB  - ABSTRACTAlpine environments are increasingly appreciated by nature-based tourism, notwithstanding recent economic crises. To benefit from this and maintain the attractiveness of a tourist destination, it is important to recognise the values of landscapes. We developed and tested a qualitative spatial valuation methodology, integrating existing quantitative survey methods, to support destination management and landscape planning at the local level. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and a mapping exercise at a nature-based tourism destination in northern Italy. In identifying and mapping tourists’ perceived landscape values and related threats, we also considered tourist profiles, experiences and preferences. The results indicated three tourist types (active seniors, families and sportive visitors). They identified five different landscape values (scenic, outdoor activity, aesthetic, historical-cultural and tranquillity) and seven categories of threats (urbanisation, lack of maintenance...

TI  - Rescue of a Severely Bottlenecked Wolf (Canis Lupus) Population by a Single Immigrant
PY  - 2003
AB  - The fragmentation of populations is an increasingly important problem in the conservation of endangered species. Under these conditions, rare migration events may have important effects for the rescue of small and inbred populations. However, the relevance of such migration events to genetically depauperate natural populations is not supported by empirical data. We show here that the genetic diversity of the severely bottlenecked and geographically isolated Scandinavian population of grey wolves (Canis lupus), founded by only two individuals, was recovered by the arrival of a single immigrant. Before the arrival of this immigrant, for several generations the population comprised only a single breeding pack, necessarily involving matings between close relatives and resulting in a subsequent decline in individual heterozygosity. With the arrival of just a single immigrant, there is evidence of increased heterozygosity, significant outbreeding (inbreeding avoidance), a rapid spread of new alleles and exponential population growth. Our results imply that even rare interpopulation migration can lead to the rescue and recovery of isolated and endangered natural populations.

TI  - Twentieth-century climate change, fire suppression, and forest production and decomposition in northwestern Minnesota
PY  - 1990
AB  - Long-term fire, climate, and vegetation data were used together with simulation models to estimate the effects of 20th century climate change and fire suppression on fire regime and organic-matter accumulation in mixed-conifer stands of Itasca State Park, northwestern Minnesota. Spatial and temporal patterns of fire occurrence and forest composition over the last 150 years determined by stratigraphic charcoal, fire-scar, tree-ring, and pollen analyses in separate studies provide evidence for vegetation and fire relationships. Water balances constructed from temperature and precipitation data collected since 1840 were used to model fire probability and intensity of burn before fire suppression which began in 1910. Existing patterns of biomass accumulation in forest-floor, herb, shrub, and tree components were compared with fire history and topographic variability to provide a spatial perspective on fire effects. Simulation models used these relationships to estimate (i) how accumulation of organic matter h...

TI  - The use of nitrogen fertilizer on alternative grassland feeding refuges for pink‐footed geese in spring
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary 1 Intensive agriculture often reduces biodiversity on farmed land, but the converse situation, of wildlife damaging agriculture, is also important. A striking example is agricultural damage by increasing populations of wild geese. Alternative feeding refuges, designed to reduce damage, will be most effective if the grass swards are made as attractive to geese as possible. This paper describes an explicitly experimental study in north-east Scotland during 1990–93, which investigated the effectiveness of different rates of application of nitrogenous fertilizer on the amount of grazing by pink-footed geese in spring, compared split-application with single-application of spring fertilizer, and evaluated the use of slow-release fertilizer in winter. 2 The amount of goose grazing, measured from cumulative dropping density, increased with application rates of spring fertilizer, up to around 80 kg N ha−1, in parallel with a similar increase in grass production. Beyond this level there was little further increase, and cost-effectiveness, measured as the percentage increase in dropping density per kg N ha−1 applied, was greatly reduced. 3 Dropping density and grass production did not differ significantly between split-application and single-application of spring fertilizer. Split-application should reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching in cold wet seasons, but the cost of application would be double that of single-application. 4 Overall, cumulative dropping density and grass production in late May were not significantly greater in plots treated over the winter with slow-release fertilizer than in untreated plots. Dropping density was, however, higher in treated plots than in untreated ones during a short mild period in early spring. Slow-release fertilizer may be of benefit in mild winters, but is more expensive than conventional nitrogenous fertilizer. 5 This study has shown that nitrogenous fertilizer can greatly increase goose grazing on sacrificial grassland refuges in spring and is a useful tool in reducing conflict between farmers and increasing goose populations.

TI  - Time, space, and causality in geomorphology
PY  - 1965
AB  - Distinctions between cause and effect in landform development depend on the span of time involved and the size of the geomorphic system under consideration. Depending upon the temporal and areal frame of reference, variables such as channel morphology may be either dependent or independent. In terms of geologic time, landforms represent a stage in an erosion cycle and are dependent on time. On a short-term basis, components of geomorphic systems may be regarded as systems in dynamic equilibrium or in a steady state and are independent of time.

TI  - Effects of recreational cabins, trails and their removal for restoration of reindeer winter ranges.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Conservation efforts have secured the partial recovery of Europe's wild reindeer, although only in 24 separate fragments of their original range, now separated by resorts and roads. Full recovery of the original range will require restoration of migration routes across developed or disturbed areas. We analyzed distribution of around 3500 Rangifer tarandus tarandus (reindeer) during winters (1984–2005) in relation to 10 alpine resorts and prior to and following relocation of ski trails and cabins in Norway done to restore use of former habitat. Reindeer used areas within 15 km of resorts, which is less than expected based on the availability of habitat, most likely as a result of cross-country skiing activity surrounding the resorts, limiting their access to other ranges and historic migration corridors. Reindeer abundance declined and mean distance between reindeer groups and resorts increased with increasing resort size. No apparent habituation to resorts was observed during the 20-year study period. However, when ski trails and an associated tourist cabin were removed to restore access to historic habitat, reindeer moved into the area. No such change in reindeer distribution was observed in the 10 years preceding relocation, or at the other nine resorts where no such experiments were conducted. Regulation of human traffic, relocation of trails, and removal of infrastructure and cabins are apparently effective in restoring access to and use of historic ranges and migration routes. However, restoration of historic migration routes between ranges will likely require the removal of hundreds of recreational cabins in order to become effective.

TI  - Using Zero-Inflated Models to Predict the Relative Distribution and Abundance of Roe Deer Over Very Large Spatial Scales
PY  - 2015
AB  - In Norway, recovering populations of large carnivores commonly prey on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Understanding predator habitat use and ecology requires fine-scaled information on prey distribution and abundance. However, the massive spatial scales at which large carnivores use the landscape presents many practical and statistical challenges for developing functional prey distribution models. Pellet-count data from > 1000 km of transects gathered across southeastern Norway between 2005 and 2011 were used to derive a map of the relative prey abundance for roe deer. These data were modeled using zero-inflated hurdle models using both environmental and anthropogenic variables. Snow depth and agricultural fields were the most significant variables in explaining both presence and abundance. Internal k-cross validation of the model showed medium accuracy (Spearman's r = 0.35), whereas external evaluation carried out on the basis of independently collected snow-tracking data (Spearman's r = 0.37) and hunti...

TI  - The relative role of density‐dependent and density‐independent survival in the life cycle of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar
PY  - 1998
AB  - 1. Density-dependent factors appeared important for the survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa whilst density-independent factors were more important for the older fish at sea. In fresh water, density dependence was indicated by a stock−recruitment relationship with increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density independence was indicated by the lack of a significant relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities. 2. The relationship between smolt density and initial egg density was best described by an asymptotic ‘Cushing’ type relationship with a plateau at densities higher than approximately 60 000 eggs for the total river areas of 10 000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs spawned varied between 350 and 2400. 3. The relationship between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m−2) or energy (kJ 10 000 m−2) and the amount of salmon eggs in the River Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smolt biomass ranged from 13 to 88 kg 10 000 m−2, or 66 000 and 431 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. Variation in egg density accounted for approximately 45% of the variation in smolt biomass (mass or energy). 4. Total wet mass and energy of adults (kg 10 000 m−2 and kJ 10 000 m−2) produced in relation to the amount of eggs at the start of the year-class, were not significantly correlated, due to a high variation among years. The biomass of adults ranged from 73 kg 10 000 m−2 to 655 kg 10 000 m−2 and in energy from 370 000 kJ 10 000 m−2 to 3 270 000 kJ 10 000 m−2. 5. Total adult biomass (adults caught at sea and in rivers) and the returning adults to the River Imsa in mass or energy were correlated with the size of the smolt cohort from which they originated. Yearly total adult biomass ranged between 240 and 3711 kg 10 000 m−2, when the number of smolts ranged from 397 to 2751, respectively. The biomass of adults returning to the River Imsa was between 59 and 614 kg, produced from between 672 and 1621 smolts.

TI  - Strong anthropogenic signals in historic forest fire regime: a detailed spatiotemporal case study from south-central Norway
PY  - 2013
AB  - To better understand the historic range of variability in the fire regime of Fennoscandian boreal forests we cross-dated 736 fire scars of remnant Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) wood samples in a 3.6 km2 section of the Trillemarka-Rollagsfjell Reserve of south-central Norway. Using a kernel range application in GIS we spatially delineated 57 individual forest fires between 1350 and the present. We found a strong anthropogenic signal in the fire regime from 1600 and onwards: (i) infrequent variably sized fires prior to 1600 shifted to frequent fires gradually decreasing in size during the 1600s and 1700s, with only a few small fires after 1800; (ii) time intervals between fires and the hazard of burning showed substantial differences pre- and post-1600; (iii) fire seasonality changed from late- to early-season fires from the 1626 fire and onwards; and (iv) fire severity decreased gradually over time. Written sources corroborated our results, narrating a history where anthropogenic forest fires and slash-...

PY  - 2003
AB  - We studied wolf (Canis lupus) selection of 19 den, 10 rendezvous, and 31 resting sites found between 1986 and 2000 in the Bialowieza Forest (Poland). Our objective was to determine whether wolves selected sites far from villages, forest edges, and roads, and whether these sites had dense ground cover for concealment. We also tested whether wolves selected a particular forest type for their den sites. Den and rendezvous sites were located at greater distances from villages, forest edges, and intensively used roads than random points. Locations of resting sites were not affected by these manmade structures. Wolves selected dry coniferous forests for den sites but also used other forest types. We concluded that the suitability of an area for pup raising depended mainly on the spatial distribution of forest, human settlements, and public roads, and to a lesser extent on habitat characteristics.

TI  - Changes in Visitor Demand: Inter-year Comparisons of Swedish Hikers' Characteristics, Preferences and Experiences
PY  - 2011
AB  - The focus of this study is a comparison over time between two visitor surveys (1980 and 2003) conducted in northern Sweden. The aim is to analyze possible changes and similarities over time in what attracts hikers to visit protected areas and if the type of visitor has changed. Since comparisons over time are rare in tourism and outdoor recreation research, this paper contributes to valuable empirical insights. Long-term data on tourism and recreation is essential to assess visitor experiences and visitor impacts on the resource, and for nature conservation management. The results reveal several variables that have been stable over time. However, many changes have also occurred. For the visitors, it has become more important with adventure and perils, services, marked hiking trails and accessibility, and the average age among the hikers has become higher and they have reduced their length of stay. In the second study, the hikers also accepted infrastructure to a greater extent. The paper discusses possibl...

TI  - New Social Movements and the New Class in the Netherlands
PY  - 1989
AB  - The class base of the so-called new social movements is analyzed using data from the Dutch national election survey of 1986. This analysis is linked to the theory on the "new class," reconceptualized as those in the new middle class who try to defend their relative autonomy against the encroachment of the "technocrats." The analysis shows that, although the Dutch new social movements are supported by broad segments of the population, their inner circles are predominantly constituted by segments of the reconceptualized new class: the young specialists in social and cultural services, and some of the yound administrative specialists in public service. In addition, the analysis documents the liberalizing effect of education for the younger cohorts and suggests a profound change of values in the postwar period.

TI  - Foraging theory upscaled: the behavioural ecology of herbivore movement.
PY  - 2010
AB  - We outline how principles of optimal foraging developed for diet and food patch selection might be applied to movement behaviour expressed over larger spatial and temporal scales. Our focus is on large mammalian herbivores, capable of carrying global positioning system (GPS) collars operating through the seasonal cycle and dependent on vegetation resources that are fixed in space but seasonally variable in availability and nutritional value. The concept of intermittent movement leads to the recognition of distinct movement modes over a hierarchy of spatio-temporal scales. Over larger scales, periods with relatively low displacement may indicate settlement within foraging areas, habitat units or seasonal ranges. Directed movements connect these patches or places used for other activities. Selection is expressed by switches in movement mode and the intensity of utilization by the settlement period relative to the area covered. The type of benefit obtained during settlement periods may be inferred from movement patterns, local environmental features, or the diel activity schedule. Rates of movement indicate changing costs in time and energy over the seasonal cycle, between years and among regions. GPS telemetry potentially enables large-scale movement responses to changing environmental conditions to be linked to population performance.

TI  - The role of wild reindeer as a flagship species in new management models in Norway
PY  - 2014
AB  - Wild reindeer are under pressure from human development projects throughout their habitat. Norway is currently making a significant move to establish a new management model based on national reindeer regions and regional management plans. A focus on wild reindeer as a flagship species allows the species to be included as a broad conservation objective in complex land-use plans. The authors surveyed a representative sample of residents in the Rondane and Setesdal regions to examine their perceptions of the current status of reindeer and how management relates to other social and development issues. Local actors and institutions, including hunters, were perceived as more responsible and suited to make decisions about reindeer population sizes and management objectives than non-local actors. There was little local consensus on the role of human impacts on wild reindeer, and residents rated local knowledge higher than scientific knowledge for management purposes. Rondane residents attached more importance to ...

TI  - Boreal forest fires burn less intensely in Russia than in North America
PY  - 2004
AB  - [1] Around 5–20 million hectares of boreal forest burns annually, mainly in Russia and North America. However, there are reports of significant differences in predominant fire type between these regions, which may have major implications for overall emissions of carbon, gases and aerosols. We examine boreal forest fire intensities via MODIS observations of fire radiative energy release rate. Results support the contention of a consistent difference in fire intensity and mean fuel consumption in Russia and North America, due to differences in dominant fire type. North American fires have higher mean intensities, increasing in proportion to percentage tree cover, characteristics indicating likely crown fire dominance. Russian fires have lower mean intensities, independent of percentage tree cover, characteristics more indicative of surface fire activity. Per unit area burnt, the results suggest Russian fires may burn less fuel and emit fewer products to the atmosphere than do those in North America.

TI  - Fuel succession and fire behavior in the Swedish boreal forest
PY  - 1997
AB  - Successional changes in the potential for fire propagation were analyzed in Vaccinium myrtillus type forests in northern Sweden through fuel sampling and fire simulations in stands with different time since the last fire, and ignition tests in early successional and mature vegetation. Within three decades, fine fuel on the ground reached 0.6 to 0.9 kg·m n2 and was thereafter fairly constant at this level. In the youngest stands this fuel consisted mainly of litter from the tree canopy, whereas in the oldest stands, pleurocarpous mosses made up the majority of the load. The expansion of pleurocarpous mosses from around year 20 resulted in a shift towards a deeper and less compact fuel bed. Simulations using the Rothermel fire spread model predicted no or minimal fire spread in stands younger than 25 years, and this was corroborated by a number of unsuccessful ignitions on recently burnt sites. We suggest three phases in postfire succession with respect to fire propagation and surface fire intensity: (1) up to about 20 years after fire, no or marginal fire spread; (2) between years 20 and 50 a progressive rise in potential fire intensity; (3) from around year 50 a steady state in potential fire intensity. By setting a limit for the shortest possible fire intervals, this pattern of fuel accumulation might have a significant effect on fire frequencies in the landscape.

TI  - CHARACTERIZING PROJECT AND STRATEGIC APPROACHES TO REGIONAL CUMULATIVE EFFECTS ASSESSMENT IN CANADA
PY  - 2008
AB  - Advancing cumulative effects assessments (CEA) to the regional scale, spatially and strategically, has been well argued but slow to evolve. Part of the problem is that "regional" CEA is a flexible concept, varying considerably in form and function from the project to the more strategic levels. This paper steps back from current discussions of assessment frameworks and methodologies to present a typology of regional approaches to CEA based on its multiple characteristics, functions, and expectations. Drawing upon current literature and interviews with international practitioners, we conceptualize regional CEA from two broad perspectives: EIA-driven approaches and SEA-driven approaches, illustrated with Canadian case examples. Each approach to CEA has its own merits that make it suitable to address particular types of cumulative problems at different tiers of assessment, and each of which can be expected to deliver different types of assessment results. The failure to fully recognize this "one concept–multiple form" characteristic is, in part, why the EA community has struggled in developing supportive methodological and institutional frameworks for regional CEA. We demonstrate that many of the disappointments with CEA are not the result of EIA-driven applications per se, but rather the result of mismatched CEA frameworks and expectations.

TI  - A review of the likely effects of climate change on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta, with particular reference to water temperature and flow.
PY  - 2009
AB  - The present paper reviews the effects of water temperature and flow on migrations, embryonic development, hatching, emergence, growth and life-history traits in light of the ongoing climate change with emphasis on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. The expected climate change in the Atlantic is for milder and wetter winters, with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, decrease in ice-covered periods and frequent periods with extreme weather. Overall, thermal limits for salmonids are species specific. Scope for activity and growth and optimal temperature for growth increase with temperature to an optimal point before constrain by the oxygen content of the water. The optimal temperature for growth decreases with increasing fish size and varies little among populations within species, whereas the growth efficiency may be locally adapted to the temperature conditions of the home stream during the growth season. Indirectly, temperature influences age and size at smolting through its effect on growth. Time of spawning, egg hatching and emergence of the larvae vary with temperature and selective effects on time of first feeding. Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality. Future research challenges are summarized at the end of the paper.

TI  - Increased Visitation from National Park Designation
PY  - 2007
AB  - Many national parks around the world are major tourist attractions. While increases in national park tourism provides business opportunities, there are several economic, social and ecological aspects that need to be monitored in order to sustain high quality visitor experiences. This paper reports findings from visitor surveys at Fulufjallet National Park, Sweden–one year prior to and one year after the national park designation in 2002. The purpose is to monitor short term changes in park use. Data from on site visitor counters show a 40% increase in the number of visitors, while follow-up mail surveys reveal several changes in visitor characteristics, use patterns, expenditures and attitudes.

TI  - Bringing Large Mammals Back: Large Carnivores in Europe
PY  - 2015
AB  - The last century has seen a dramatic reversal in the status of large carnivores in Europe. A suite of co-occurring factors has permitted a large-scale recovery of most populations. We currently recognise 10 populations of each species, most of which are transboundary in nature. The sizes of these populations vary from some tens to many thousand, with current estimates being around 17,000 bears, 10,000 wolves and 10,000 lynx in Europe (excluding Russia). As the situation moves from averting extinction to planning recovery it is logical to ask how far the recovery can go, and what our conservation goals should be, especially in light of the emerging rewilding discourse. For a variety of ecological, practical and strategic reasons, it seems unlikely that restoring “wilderness” or “natural ecological processes” (in the sense that human activity and influence are excluded) will serve as general models for large carnivore conservation on a large scale. We suggest a focus on developing a “coexistence” model that aims to create a sustainable interaction between humans and large carnivores by encouraging conservation of these species in very large areas of the European landscape, encouraging the development of a wide range of ecological processes, including predation and scavenging, while accepting that human influence on all trophic levels is pervasive, legitimate, necessary and often even desirable. This constitutes a desire to create a new form of relationship between humans and wildness that has never existed before, and therefore does not fall within the conventional meanings of the rewilding paradigm.

TI  - Global change synergies and trade-offs between renewable energy and biodiversity
PY  - 2015
AB  - Reliance on fossil fuels is causing unprecedented climate change and is accelerating environmental degradation and global biodiversity loss. Together, climate change and biodiversity loss, if not averted urgently, may inflict severe damage on ecosystem processes, functions and services that support the welfare of modern societies. Increasing renewable energy deployment and expanding the current protected area network represent key solutions to these challenges, but conflicts may arise over the use of limited land for energy production as opposed to biodiversity conservation. Here, we compare recently identified core areas for the expansion of the global protected area network with the renewable energy potential available from land-based solar photovoltaic, wind energy and bioenergy (in the form of Miscanthus 9 giganteus). We show that these energy sources have very different biodiversity impacts and net energy contributions. The extent of risks and opportunities deriving from renewable energy development is highly dependent on the type of renewable source harvested, the restrictions imposed on energy harvest and the region considered, with Central America appearing at particularly high potential risk from renewable energy expansion. Without restrictions on power generation due to factors such as production and transport costs, we show that bioenergy production is a major potential threat to biodiversity, while the potential impact of wind and solar appears smaller than that of bioenergy. However, these differences become reduced when energy potential is restricted by external factors including local energy demand. Overall, we found that areas of opportunity for developing solar and wind energy with little harm to biodiversity could exist in several regions of the world, with the magnitude of potential impact being particularly dependent on restrictions imposed by local energy demand. The evidence provided here helps guide sustainable development of renewable energy and contributes to the targeting of global efforts in climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation.

PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract. The Met Office has operated a very low frequency (VLF) lightning location network since 1987. The long-range capabilities of this network, referred to in its current form as ATDnet, allow for relatively continuous detection efficiency across Europe with only a limited number of sensors. The wide coverage and continuous data obtained by Arrival Time Differing NETwork (ATDnet) are here used to create data sets of lightning density across Europe. Results of annual and monthly detected lightning density using data from 2008–2012 are presented, along with more detailed analysis of statistics and features of interest. No adjustment has been made to the data for regional variations in detection efficiency.

PY  - 2011
AB  - AbstractA new set of empirical–statistical downscaled seasonal mean temperature scenarios is presented for locations spread across all continents. These results are based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) simulations, the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B story line, and arguably represent the largest downscaled multimodel ensemble to date in terms of worldwide distribution, length of time interval, and the number of global climate model simulations. The ensemble size of ∼50 members enables a crude uncertainty analysis for simulated future local temperature, and maps have been constructed for Europe, Africa, and the northwestern part of Russia and Scandinavia of the ensemble mean and 95th percentile for seasonal mean temperatures projected for 2100, as well as simulated probabilities for low or high temperatures. The results are stored as matrices of coefficients describing best-fit fifth-order polynomials, used to approximate the long-term trends in the temperatu...

TI  - ECOLOGICAL SUPPORT FOR RURAL LAND-USE PLANNING
PY  - 2005
AB  - How can ecologists be more effective in supporting ecologically informed rural land-use planning and policy? Improved decision making about rural lands requires careful consideration of how ecological information and analyses can inform specific planning and policy needs. We provide a brief overview of rural land-use planning, including recently developed approaches to conservation. Effective participation in land-use planning requires ecologists to understand trade-offs—for example, the need to balance a land owner's desire for a fair and predictable process with the “learn as you go” approach of adaptive management—and the importance of integrating local knowledge with landscape-level information. Four primary challenges require attention from ecologists to improve rural land-use planning. First is the mismatch between the spatial and temporal scales in which ecological processes occur and the scales and tempos of land-use planning. Second, ecologists must engage in interdisciplinary research to critica...

TI  - Tourist Segments for New Facilities in National Park Areas: Profiling Tourists in Norway Based on Psychographics and Demographics
PY  - 2014
AB  - The pursuit of sustainable tourism may involve development of more facilities in the buffer zones of national parks and other pristine nature areas. Two independent samples of domestic and foreign tourists in Norway were segmented based on expressed preferences for a diversity of new facilities in an alpine national park region, all facilities potentially with different impacts on the natural habitat. One sample was recruited inside the alpine area, the other outside. Post hoc market segmentation was carried out using a combined two-stage hierarchical and nonhierarchical clustering of facility quest factors identified from a set of survey items. We assessed stability of the clusters by comparing independent sample solutions against the pooled sample and further assessing the extent to which the clusters differed with respect to demographic or psychographic characteristics.

TI  - Land use and electricity generation: A life-cycle analysis
PY  - 2009
AB  - Renewable-energy sources often are regarded as dispersed and difficult to collect, thus requiring substantial land resources in comparison to conventional energy sources. In this review, we present the normalized land requirements during the life cycles of conventional- and renewable-energy options, covering coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, photovoltaics, wind, and biomass. We compared the land transformation and occupation matrices within a life-cycle framework across those fuel cycles. Although the estimates vary with regional and technological conditions, the photovoltaic (PV) cycle requires the least amount of land among renewable-energy options, while the biomass cycle requires the largest amount. Moreover, we determined that, in most cases, ground-mount PV systems in areas of high insolation transform less land than the coal-fuel cycle coupled with surface mining. In terms of land occupation, the biomass-fuel cycle requires the greatest amount, followed by the nuclear-fuel cycle. Although not detailed in this review, conventional electricity-generation technologies also pose secondary effects on land use, including contamination and disruptions of the ecosystems of adjacent lands, and land disruptions by fuel-cycle-related accidents.

TI  - Vegetation mediated the impacts of postglacial climate change on fire regimes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska
PY  - 2009
AB  - We examined direct and indirect impacts of millennial-scale climate change on fire regimes in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska, USA, using four lake sediment records and existing paleoclimate interpretations. New techniques were introduced to identify charcoal peaks semi-objectively and to detect statistical differences between fire regimes. Peaks in charcoal accumulation rates provided estimates of fire return intervals (FRIs), which were compared among vegetation zones identified by fossil pollen and stomata. Climatic warming between ca. 15 000-9000 yr BP (calendar years before Common Era (CE) 1950) coincided with shifts in vegetation from herb tundra to shrub tundra to deciduous woodlands, all novel species assemblages relative to modern vegetation. Two sites cover this period and show decreased FRIs with the transition from herb to Betula-dominated shrub tundra ca. 13 300- 14 300 yr BP (FRImean ¼ 144 yr; 95% CI ¼ 120-169 yr), when climate warmed but remained cooler than present. Although warming would have favored shorter FRIs in the shrub tundra, the shift to more continuous, flammable fuels relative to herb tundra was probably a more important cause of increased burning. Similarly, a vegetation shift to Populus-dominated deciduous woodlands overrode the influence of warmer- and drier-than-present summers, resulting in lower fire activity from ca. 10 300-8250 yr BP (FRImean ¼ 251 yr; 95% CI ¼ 156- 347 yr). Three sites record the mid-to-late Holocene, when climatic cooling and moistening allowed Picea glauca forest-tundra and P. mariana boreal forests to establish ca. 8000 and 5500 yr BP, respectively. FRIs in forest-tundra were either similar to or shorter than those in the deciduous woodlands (FRImean range ¼ 131-238 yr). The addition of P. mariana ca. 5500 yr BP increased landscape flammability, overrode the effects of climatic cooling and moistening and resulted in lower FRIs (FRImean ¼ 145 yr; 95% CI ¼ 130-163). Overall, shifts in fire regimes were strongly linked to changes in vegetation, which were responding to millennial-scale climate change. We conclude that shifts in vegetation can amplify or override the direct influence of climate change on fire regimes, when vegetation shifts significantly modify landscape flammability. Our findings emphasize the importance of biophysical feedbacks between climate, fire, and vegetation in determining the response of ecosystems to past, and by inference, future climate change.

TI  - Congruence between automatic fish counter data and rod catches of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Scottish rivers
PY  - 2005
AB  - The potential utility of rod catch and automatic fish counter data as measures of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) abundance in Scottish rivers was assessed. The trend (long-term) and residual (short-term) variation in the net annual count for 12 counters were compared with the trend and residual variation in either the annual or spring (FebruaryeMay) rod catch, as appropriate, for the fisheries district in which the counter is located. Trends were fitted using a cubic smoothing spline and compared using reference bands. In eight of the 12 short-term comparisons, the residuals were significantly correlated. The four incongruent short-term comparisons involved the shortest time-series (%12 years) or lowest rod catches. In eight of the 12 long-term comparisons, the trends fell within the reference bands in 50% or more of the years. Rod catch and counter data both contain useful information about Atlantic salmon abundance, albeit on different temporal and spatial scales, which should be integrated into assessment schemes.

TI  - Effects of agricultural change on abundance, fitness components and distribution of two arctic‐nesting goose populations
PY  - 2005
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Intensification of agriculture since the 1950s has enhanced the availability, competitive ability, crude protein content, digestibility and extended growing seasons of forage grasses. Spilled cereal grain also provides a rich food source in autumn and in winter. Long‐distance migratory herbivorous geese have rapidly exploited these feeding opportunities and most species have shown expansions in range and population size in the last 50 years. Results of long‐term studies are presented from two Arctic‐breeding populations, the Svalbard pink‐footed goose and the Greenland white‐fronted goose (GWFG). GWFGs have shown major habitat shifts since the 1950s from winter use of plant storage organs in natural wetlands to feeding on intensively managed farmland. Declines in local density on, and abandonment of, unmodified traditional wintering habitat and increased reproductive success among those birds wintering on farmland suggest that density‐dependent processes were not the cause of the shift in this winter‐site‐faithful population. Based on enhanced nutrient and energy intake rates, we argue that observed shifts in both species from traditionally used natural habitats to intensively managed farmland on spring staging and wintering areas have not necessarily been the result of habitat destruction. Increased food intake rates and potential demographic benefits resulting from shifts to highly profitable foraging opportunities on increasingly intensively managed farmland, more likely explain increases in goose numbers in these populations. The geographically exploratory behaviour of subdominant individuals enables the discovery and exploitation of new winter feeding opportunities and hence range expansion. Recent destruction of traditional habitats and declines in farming at northern latitudes present fresh challenges to the well being of both populations. More urgently, Canada geese colonizing breeding and moulting habitats of white‐fronted geese in Greenland are further affecting their reproductive output.</jats:p>

TI  - Attitudes toward wolves in southeastern Norway
PY  - 1998
AB  - In some Norwegian regions conflicts between sheep farmers and wildlife managers have increased considerably in frequency and intensity. In order to gain more insight into the inhabitants’ attitudes toward one carnivore species, opinions about the preferred size of the wolf population, attitudes and knowledge about wolves, and experience with animal‐related activities were surveyed in southeastern Norway. The attitude typology identified by Kellert (1986) was applied. Of the total sample, 14% wanted wolves extirpated in Norway, 37% wanted the present population reduced, 40% wanted it maintained, and 7% wanted it increased. The proportion wanting wolves extirpated or reduced increased as the perceived size of the wolf population increased, age increased, and educational level decreased. The attitude profiles showed that old persons, pensioners, and those with only basic education expressed high dominionistic, high negativistic and high utilitarian, and low naturalistic scores, whereas young persons with hig...

TI  - Historical logging, productivity, and structural characteristics of boreal coniferous forests in Norway
PY  - 2005
AB  - Conservation of forest biodiversity has brought about an interest in evaluating the naturalness of forests, and to locate and protect semi-natural and old-growth forests in the Fennoscandian countries. However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50−100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at lownor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today.

TI  - Cold shock and fish
PY  - 2008
AB  - Rapid decreases in water temperature may result in a number of physiological, behavioural and fitness consequences for fishes termed ‘cold shock’. Cold-shock stress occurs when a fish has been acclimated to a specific water temperature or range of temperatures and is subsequently exposed to a rapid decrease in temperature, resulting in a cascade of physiological and behavioural responses and, in some cases, death. Rapid temperature decreases may occur from either natural (e.g. thermocline temperature variation, seiches and storm events) or anthropogenic sources (e.g. varied thermal effluents from power generation and production industries). The magnitude, duration and frequency of the temperature change as well as the initial acclimation temperatures of individuals can influence the extent of the consequences of cold shock on fishes. Early research on cold shock focused on documenting mortality events associated with cold shock. However, in recent years, a shift in research has occurred where the focus of cold-shock studies now involves characterizing the sublethal effects of cold shock in terms of the stress response in fishes. This shift has revealed that cold shock can actually be used as a tool for fisheries science (e.g. to induce polyploidy). The cold-shock stress response offers opportunities to develop many exciting research questions, yet to date, cold-shock research has been largely unfocused. Few studies attempt to link laboratory physiology experiments with ecologically relevant field data on behaviour, growth, bioenergetics and fitness. Additional research will allow for the development of more focused and robust management policies and conservation initiatives. This review synthesizes the sublethal physiological and behavioural consequences of cold-shock stress on fishes, identifies natural and anthropogenic sources of cold shock, discusses the benefits of cold shock to fisheries science and describes mitigation and management efforts. Existing knowledge gaps and opportunities for future cold-shock research are presented.

TI  - On the Phosphorus Limitation Paradigm for Lakes
PY  - 2008
AB  - Lakes are often said to be primarily phosphorus limited, but this paradigm has been described in numerous ways and there is considerable evidence that algae in lakes are often limited by other elements too. Crucial whole-ecosystem experiments that support the paradigm of the primacy of P limitation are few in number and have been limited to naturally oligotrophic lakes. A large amount of observational and experimental data seems to contradict the phosphorus limitation paradigm and instead indicates that most lakes are co-limited by N and P as well as, perhaps, by Fe and other resources. The biogeochemical theory behind the phosphorus limitation paradigm is that mechanisms can supplement cycles of C and N (and, discussed here, perhaps Fe) so that ultimately it is P that limits production and biomass. However, no mechanism has been proposed for ecosystems to overshoot this endpoint, meaning one might logically expect to see frequent occurrence of co-limitation by P, N and other resources over short, but still ecologically meaningful time scales that influence, for example, biodiversity patterns in lakes. One point of view has been that small-scale experimentation is simply misleading. However, an alternative is that even if P is ultimately limiting over multi-annual time scales, over shorter but still meaningful time scales, co-limitation of multiple nutrients is expected, and indeed is very common.

TI  - Integrated life-cycle assessment of electricity-supply scenarios confirms global environmental benefit of low-carbon technologies.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Decarbonization of electricity generation can support climate-change mitigation and presents an opportunity to address pollution resulting from fossil-fuel combustion. Generally, renewable technologies require higher initial investments in infrastructure than fossil-based power systems. To assess the tradeoffs of increased up-front emissions and reduced operational emissions, we present, to our knowledge, the first global, integrated life-cycle assessment (LCA) of long-term, wide-scale implementation of electricity generation from renewable sources (i.e., photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and hydropower) and of carbon dioxide capture and storage for fossil power generation. We compare emissions causing particulate matter exposure, freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and climate change for the climate-change-mitigation (BLUE Map) and business-as-usual (Baseline) scenarios of the International Energy Agency up to 2050. We use a vintage stock model to conduct an LCA of newly installed capacity year-by-year for each region, thus accounting for changes in the energy mix used to manufacture future power plants. Under the Baseline scenario, emissions of air and water pollutants more than double whereas the low-carbon technologies introduced in the BLUE Map scenario allow a doubling of electricity supply while stabilizing or even reducing pollution. Material requirements per unit generation for low-carbon technologies can be higher than for conventional fossil generation: 11-40 times more copper for photovoltaic systems and 6-14 times more iron for wind power plants. However, only two years of current global copper and one year of iron production will suffice to build a low-carbon energy system capable of supplying the world's electricity needs in 2050.

TI  - Multi-century reconstruction of fire activity in Northern European boreal forest suggests differences in regional fire regimes and their sensitivity to climate
PY  - 2014
AB  - Forest fires are one of the main disturbance agents in boreal and temperate ecosystems. To decipher large-scale temporal and spatial patterns of past fire activity in Scandinavia, we analysed the synchronicity of dendrochoronologically reconstructed fire events in a large network of sites (n=62; 3296 samples, 392 individual fire years) covering a wide geographical gradient (56.5-67.0 degrees N and 9.3-20.5 degrees E) over AD 1400-1900. We identified large fire years (LFY) as years with regionally increased forest fire activity and located the geographical centres of climatic anomalies associated with synchronous LFY occurrence across the region, termed LFY centroids. The spatial pattern of LFY centroids indicated the presence of two regions with climatically mediated synchronicity of fire occurrence, located south and north from 60 degrees N. The return intervals of LFYs in Scandinavia followed a Weibull distribution in both regions. Intervals, however, differed: a period of 40years would carry a 0.93 probability of LFY occurrence in the southern region, but only a 0.48 probability of LFY occurrence in the northern region. Over 1420-1759, the northern region was characterized by significantly higher temporal variability in LFY occurrence than the southern region. Temporal correlation of LFYs with reconstructed average summer temperature and total precipitation was evident mainly for the northern region. LFYs in this region were associated with positive temperature and negative precipitation anomalies over Scandinavia and with colder and wetter conditions in more southern parts of the European subcontinent. Synthesis. Historical patterns of the occurrence of large fire years (LFY) in Scandinavia point towards the presence of two well-defined zones with characteristic fire activity, with the geographical division at approximately 60 degrees N. The northern and mid-boreal forests, although exhibiting lower LFY frequencies, appeared to be more sensitive to past summer climate, as compared to the southern boreal forests. This would imply that fire regimes across Scandinavia may show an asynchronous response to future climate changes.

TI  - Ecology in an anthropogenic biosphere
PY  - 2015
AB  - Humans, unlike any other multicellular species in Earth's history, have emerged as a global force that is transforming the ecology of an entire planet. It is no longer possible to understand, predict, or successfully manage ecological pattern, process, or change without understanding why and how humans reshape these over the long term. Here, a general causal theory is presented to explain why human societies gained the capacity to globally alter the patterns, processes, and dynamics of ecology and how these anthropogenic alterations unfold over time and space as societies themselves change over human generational time. Building on existing theories of ecosystem engineering, niche construction, inclusive inheritance, cultural evolution, ultrasociality, and social change, this theory of anthroecological change holds that sociocultural evolution of subsistence regimes based on ecosystem engineering, social specialization, and non-kin exchange, or “sociocultural niche construction,” is the main cause of both the long-term upscaling of human societies and their unprecedented transformation of the biosphere. Human sociocultural niche construction can explain, where classic ecological theory cannot, the sustained transformative effects of human societies on biogeography, ecological succession, ecosystem processes, and the ecological patterns and processes of landscapes, biomes, and the biosphere. Anthroecology theory generates empirically testable hypotheses on the forms and trajectories of long-term anthropogenic ecological change that have significant theoretical and practical implications across the subdisciplines of ecology and conservation. Though still at an early stage of development, anthroecology theory aligns with and integrates established theoretical frameworks including social–ecological systems, social metabolism, countryside biogeography, novel ecosystems, and anthromes. The “fluxes of nature” are fast becoming “cultures of nature.” To investigate, understand, and address the ultimate causes of anthropogenic ecological change, not just the consequences, human sociocultural processes must become as much a part of ecological theory and practice as biological and geophysical processes are now. Strategies for achieving this goal and for advancing ecological science and conservation in an increasingly anthropogenic biosphere are presented.

TI  - Ecosystem Properties and Forest Decline in Contrasting Long-Term Chronosequences
PY  - 2004
AB  - During succession, ecosystem development occurs; but in the long-term absence of catastrophic disturbance, a decline phase eventually follows. We studied six long-term chronosequences, in Australia, Sweden, Alaska, Hawaii, and New Zealand; for each, the decline phase was associated with a reduction in tree basal area and an increase in the substrate nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, indicating increasing phosphorus limitation over time. These changes were often associated with reductions in litter decomposition rates, phosphorus release from litter, and biomass and activity of decomposer microbes. Our findings suggest that the maximal biomass phase reached during succession cannot be maintained in the long-term absence of major disturbance, and that similar patterns of decline occur in forested ecosystems spanning the tropical, temperate, and boreal zones.

TI  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in winter: "the season of parr discontent"?
PY  - 1998
AB  - Winter is a dynamic period. Effects of the winter regime on northern streams and rivers is extremely variable and characterized by dramatic alterations in physical habitat to which Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar) must acclimate and adapt to survive. In this paper, we synthesize recent advances in the biological and hydrologic/ geomorphic disciplines, with specific reference to Atlantic salmon overwintering in the freshwater portions of those running waters subject to freezing water temperatures. The specific requirements and adaptations for surviving winter at the three distinct life-stages in freshwater (egg, parr, kelt) are identified in relation to the characteristics of three biophysical phases: early winter (temperature decline and freeze-up), midwinter (ice growth and habitat reduction), and the break-up/warming phase. In a case study of Catamaran Brook (New Brunswick), a hydro-ecological analysis was used to explain interannual variability in juvenile abundance, especially for young-of-the-year salmon. A strong relation was found between winter discharge and interstage survival (egg to 0+, 0+ to 1+, 1+ to 2+) in 5 of 6 years. That is, juvenile salmon abundance in summer was highest following winters with high streamflow, presumably a function of habitat availability, especially beneath ice cover. However, the lowest measured egg-0+ survival (9.2%) was related to an atypical midwinter, dynamic ice break-up triggered by a rain-on-snow event that resulted in severe scouring of the stream-bed and redds. Thus, interannual variability in Atlantic salmon parr abundance from 1990 to 1996 was largely explained by density-independent (environmental) constraints to winter survival. The complexity of stream processes during winter underscores the need for interdisciplinary research to quantify biological change. Resume : L'hiver est une periode dynamique. Les effets du regime hivernal sur les cours d'eau du Nord sont extremement variables et caracterises par des alterations marquees de l'habitat auquel le saumon de l'Atlantique doit s'acclimater et s'adapter pour survivre. Dans cet article, nous faisons une synthese des progres recents en biologie et en hydrologie et geomorphologie, en traitant particulierement du saumon atlantique qui hiverne dans les eaux douces de ces cours d'eau dont les temperatures approchent du point de congelation en hiver. Les exigences et les adaptations specifiques pour la survie hivernale des trois stades dulcicoles distincts (oeuf, tacon, charognard) sont etablies en rapport avec les caracteristiques de trois phases biophysiques : debut de l'hiver (chute de la temperature et englacement), mi-hiver (croissance de la glace et reduction de l'habitat) et la phase de degel et de rechauffement. Dans une etude de cas portant sur le ruisseau Catamaran (Nouveau-Brunswick), on a eu recours a une analyse hydro- ecologique pour expliquer la variabilite interannuelle de l'abondance des juveniles, particulierement chez les jeunes saumons de l'annee. On a observe une forte relation entre le debit hivernal et la survie interstades (oeuf a 0+, 0+ a 1+, 1+ a 2+) dans 5 annees sur 6. Ainsi, l'abondance des saumons juveniles en ete etait grande apres les hivers caracterises par des debits eleves, probablement parce que l'habitat disponible etait plus important, particulierement sous le couvert de glace. Cependant, on a observe le plus faible taux de survie du stade d'oeuf a l'âge 0+ (9,2 %) apres un mi-hiver atypique caracterise par une debâcle dynamique causee par la pluie, qui s'est soldee par un affouillement marque du lit du cours d'eau et des nids de fraye. Ainsi, la variabilite interannuelle de l'abondance des tacons de saumon atlantique de 1990 a 1996 etait largement tributaire de contraintes independantes de la densite (environnementales) pesant sur la survie hivernale. La complexite des processus fluviaux durant l'hiver fait qu'il est necessaire de mener des recherches interdisciplinaires pour quantifier le changement biologique.

PY  - 1983
AB  - Traditional counting of tree rings between fire scars to establish a fire history is examined for a better understanding of factors influencing fire scar formation and wound healing. The problem of dating fires which burn prior to or after the period of cambial activity is emphasized. A methodology for fire history studies based on fire scar and tree -ring analysis developed by Arno and Sneck (1977) is reviewed and elaborated upon. The importance of crossdating, height of sample cross sections, and problems associated with the extrapolation of data are discussed. Ongoing research involving the examination of the mineral concentration of tree rings and the presence of traumatic resin canals as markers of past fires is reviewed.

TI  - An examination of methods to estimate population size in wintering geese
PY  - 2001
AB  - We estimated the size of the Svalbard population of Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus in 1991–98 using three different methods: (a) counts; (b) mark–resight estimates; (c) annual productivity and survival. Count data showed a slight increase of population size, from 33 000 in 1991 to 38 500 in 1998. Mark–resight estimates showed a larger fluctuation, but were almost always greater than counts. By contrast, estimates of survival and productivity suggested stability or at least a less pronounced increase in the population size, the discrepancy in the number estimated when compared to the other methods being especially large in the last two years of the study. A detailed examination of the assumptions underlying each of the methods reveals possible explanations for some, but not all, of the discrepancies. We conclude that goose population estimates derived from total population counts may be less reliable than commonly assumed, and moderate year-to-year trends should not be over-interpreted.

TI  - Trends in goose numbers wintering in Britain & Ireland, 1995 to 2008
PY  - 2010
AB  - <jats:p>Twelve migratory and native goose populations winter in Britain and Ireland and up to date information on their abundance and distribution is provided. Seven populations are increasing: Barnacle Goose (Svalbard, current estimate 26,900 birds), Barnacle Goose (Greenland 70,500), Pink-footed Goose (288,800), North West Scotland Greylag Goose (34,500), re-established Greylag Goose (50,000), Light-bellied Brent Goose (East Canadian High Arctic 34,000) and Light-bellied Brent Goose (Svalbard 3,270). Two populations appear stable: Taiga Bean Goose (432 at two sites) and Icelandic Greylag Goose (98,300). Three populations are decreasing: European White-fronted Goose (2,760) due to short stopping in mainland Europe, Dark-bellied Brent Goose (82,970), due to a recent population decline (due to poor breeding success) and short stopping, and Greenland White-fronted Goose (24,055) due to recent poor breeding success and, up to 2006, hunting. An estimated 120,000 migratory geese wintered in Britain and Ireland in 1960 compared to 500,000 in 2008. Despite many goose species demonstrating high degrees of site faithfulness (responding to safe roosts and regular food supply), shifts in winter distribution of several goose populations have occurred (notably Icelandic Greylag Goose).</jats:p>

TI  - Who's Afraid of the Big, Bad Wolf? Young People's Responses to the Conflicts over Large Carnivores in Eastern Norway.
PY  - 2001
AB  - Controversies over large carnivores are often interpreted as clashes between rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Rural com- munities, however, have never been culturally monolithic, and modern- ization will increase the diversity. To probe such diverse and changing at- titudes towards nature, I conducted a qualitative study of young people in a rural community in eastern Norway. Contrary to popular images of such communities as unified against "pests," all typical views of the car- nivore issue were present. Those in favor of the large carnivores were typically middle-class youths with a strong "outward" orientation, while those who wanted to shoot the predators were mostly working-class boys with strong ties to the local hunting culture. This pattern was interpreted as a conflict between dominant and subordinate forms of knowledge, and between abstraction-oriented and production-oriented cultural forms. Aside from the growth of the pro-carnivore middle-class seg- ments, the most significant effect of modernization appeared to be the removal of many young people from the subject matter of the conflict. A "subculturalization" of the working-class hunting culture also could be discerned, however. After decades of protection, the four species of large carnivores found in mainland Norway (brown bear, lynx, wolverine, and wolf) are now slowly recovering from the brink of extinction. This development is applauded by environmentalists, managers, biolo- gists, and many politicians. Opinion polls also indicate enthusiasm in a majority of the general population. Increasing carnivore populations have spurred fierce conflicts, however. Livestock depredation and competition for huntable game are key issues, but the killing of hunting dogs and the possibility of attacks on people also feature in the controversies. In the public debate it is often suggested that this is a conflict representing a clash between old and new perspectives on nature, or rural traditionalism and urban modernity. Whereas this seems to touch some core issues, we know little about the operative mechanisms. In particular, we know little of how young people are handling such issues. According to other popular images, sup- ported by current sociological theory on individualization in late

TI  - Lake and catchment management in Denmark
PY  - 1999
AB  - The majority of Danish lakes are highly eutrophic due to high nutrient input from domestic sources and agricultural activities. Reduced nutrient retention, and more rapid removal, in catchments as a result of agricultural drainage of wetlands and lakes and channelisation or culverting of streams also play a role. Attempts have recently been made to reduce nutrient loading on lakes by intervening at the source level and by improving the retention capacity of catchment areas. The former measures include phosphorus stripping and nitrogen removal at sewage works, increased use of phosphate-free detergents, and regulations concerning animal fertiliser storage capacity, fertiliser application practices, fertilisation plans and green cover in winter. In order to improve nutrient retention capacity of catchments, wetlands and lakes have been re-established and channelised streams have been remeandered. In addition, cultivation-free buffer strips have been established alongside natural streams and there has been a switch to manual weed control. These measures have resulted in a 73% reduction of the mean total phosphorus concentration of point-source polluted streams since 1978; in contrast, there has been no significant change in the total nitrogen concentration. Despite the major reduction in stream phosphorus concentrations, lake water quality has often not improved. This may reflect a too high external or internal phosphorus loading or biological resistance. Various physico-chemical restoration measures have been used, including dredging and oxidation of the hypolimnion with nitrate and oxygen. Biological restoration measures have been employed in 17 Danish lakes. The methods include reducing the abundance of cyprinids, stocking with 0+ pike (Esox lucius) to control 0+ cyprinids, and promoting macrophyte recolonization by protecting germinal submerged macrophyte beds against grazing waterfowl and transplanting out macrophyte shoots. In several lakes, marked and long-lasting improvements have been obtained. The findings to date indicate that fish manipulation has a long-term effect in shallow lakes, providing nutrient loading is reduced to a level so low as to ensure an equilibrium lake water phosphorus concentration of less than 0.05–0.1 mg phosphorus 1−1. If nitrogen loading is very low, however, positive results may be obtained at higher phosphorus concentrations. Macrophyte refuges and transplantation seem to be the most successful as restoration measures in the same nutrient-phosphorus regime as fish manipulation.

TI  - The wolf in Yellowstone: Science, symbol, or politics? Deconstructing the conflict between environmentalism and wise use
PY  - 1997
AB  - In spring 1995, wolves were returned to the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the first time in five decades. Despite this being hailed as a success, public opposition to the wolf remains intense in many rural communities surrounding the reintroduction site. This study shows that social controversy remains because it is much more than a debate about wolves; it is a conflict between the advocates of two social movements—environmentalism and wise use—struggling to impose their own preferences for land use in the American West. Wolves are merely symbols delineating the battle lines of a much larger conflict. Three underlying social issues drive the debate: (1) differential access to social power, (2) conflicting ideas about private property, and (3) divergent beliefs about nature. Recognizing these deeper levels of social conflict is important, because it is from here that future land use controversies are likely to emerge. By identifying and describing the symbolic nature of the wolf reintroduction conflict...

TI  - Non-compliance with on-site data collection in outdoor recreation monitoring.
PY  - 2009
AB  - ABSTRACT A wide range of methods exists for on-site visitor monitoring in parks and recreation areas. Self-registration methods have proven to be popular because of their low cost and relative ease of administration, but little is known about the extent to which the data collected from self-registration boxes are representative of the population of visitors, and the degree that bias exists as a result of non-compliance. This article examines these concerns based on research at Fulufjallet National Park in Sweden. On-site registration card and follow-up mail survey data from a sample of visitors who did not voluntarily register were compared with the same kind of data for visitors who did register voluntarily. In total, 10 registration card items and 284 mail survey items were tested for variations between compliant and non-compliant visitors. Of these, one third of the card items, 12% and 3% of the survey items for Swedish and German visitors, respectively, yielded statistically significant differences. I...

TI  - Turning National Parks into Tourist Attractions: Nature Orientation and Quest for Facilities
PY  - 2010
AB  - Abstract This paper presents an exploratory analysis of foreign tourists’ quests for facilities in Norwegian national parks, related to their expressed nature orientation. The analysis was based on a survey among German, Dutch and Danish tourists during the summer season of 2008. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to identify underlying dimensions from indicator questions related to nature orientations and to quest for facilities inside and outside the national parks. The indicator questions were primarily inspired by Nils Uddenberg’s classification of modern Swedes’ nature orientations. We found a significant, although fairly weak, relationship between nature orientation and quest for facilities, applying multivariate regression modelling. The strongest relationship was found for the quest for larger management measures – “Infrastructure & services” – supported by nature orientations labelled Challenge or Sightseeing, while these were disapproved of by the traditional outdoor Recreation orientation....

TI  - Long‐term decreasing trend in forest fires in northwestern Canada
PY  - 2011
AB  - The annual area of forest burned has decreased in recent centuries over large areas of Fennoscandia, Siberia and temperate North America. To determine if this same trend extends to a sparsely populated region of northern Canada, fire scars on living and dead trees, forest stand ages and charred wood were systematically sampled in 85 study plots in an area of 564 000 km2 in northwestern Canada. A significant negative trend in the occurrence of forest fires was observed: average area burned per year decreased from 2.0% in the first half of the 19th century to 0.33% in the later half of the 20th century. Annually burned areas correlated significantly with a local tree ring based index, July monthly drought code and the Pacific decadal oscillation but not with June-August mean temperature, distance to the nearest road, or the year of road building. None of the climatic indicators or access history (indicative of the start of local fire suppression) could explain the long-term negative trend in fires. Earlier interpretations that humans dominated the causes of forest fires in the past, even in sparsely populated regions, deserve further attention as a possible explanation for the decreasing trend in fires.

TI  - Changing landscape in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of Yangtze River from 1977 to 2005: land use/land cover, vegetation cover changes estimated using multi-source satellite data.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Abstract The eco-environment in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) in China has received much attention due to the construction of the Three Gorges Hydropower Station. Land use/land cover changes (LUCC) are a major cause of ecological environmental changes. In this paper, the spatial landscape dynamics from 1978 to 2005 in this area are monitored and recent changes are analyzed, using the Landsat TM (MSS) images of 1978, 1988, 1995, 2000 and 2005. Vegetation cover fractions for a vegetation cover analysis are retrieved from MODIS/Terra imagery from 2000 to 2006, being the period before and after the rising water level of the reservoir. Several analytical indices have been used to analyze spatial and temporal changes. Results indicate that cropland, woodland, and grassland areas reduced continuously over the past 30 years, while river and built-up area increased by 2.79% and 4.45% from 2000 to 2005, respectively. The built-up area increased at the cost of decreased cropland, woodland and grassland. The vegetation cover fraction increased slightly. We conclude that significant changes in land use/land cover have occurred in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The main cause is a continuous economic and urban/rural development, followed by environmental management policies after construction of the Three Gorges Dam.

TI  - Reference point based management of Norwegian Atlantic salmon populations
PY  - 2013
AB  - SUMMARY While management according to biological reference points is well established for many commercial marine fisheries, similar systems for more leisure based fisheries for freshwater fishes are less common. This paper describes the scientific foundation for management according to conservation limits and management targets for Norwegian populations of Atlantic salmon, a highly valued and heavily exploited anadromous fish species. Based on stock recruitment relationships during the freshwater phase, the biomass of females necessary to attain the carrying capacity (yielding average maximum recruitment) has been established as conservation limits for each of the 439 Norwegian populations. Using a simulation model based on reported catch and estimates of exploitation rates, the probability and percentage attainment of the conservation limits have been assessed annually since 2008, and exploitation advice provided for 176 of the largest populations. The number of populations that attained their conservation limits increased substantially after the new management scheme was introduced, despite that the number of returning salmon remained at historical low levels. Overall the populations evaluated in 2011 were at 95% of their conservation limits compared to 91% in 2008 and 85% in 2005. The improvement could largely be attributed to reduced exploitation rates, due to new restrictions in both the marine and river fisheries. The new management scheme also improved the catch statistics and stimulated data acquisition for management. Implementation of management according to conservation limits has been a success in terms of attaining the main management goal of protectingtheAtlanticsalmonpopulationsbyensuring that an increasing number of the populations likely are at their maximum reproductive capacity.

TI  - Risk taking by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in a human‐dominated landscape: effects of sex and reproductive status
PY  - 2006
AB  - This study aimed to test how the sex and reproductive status of Eurasian lynx influenced their use of ‘attractive sinks’ – habitats with high prey density and high mortality risks. Locations of 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx were obtained by radiotelemetry in a mixed forest and agricultural habitat in south-eastern Norway. Roe deer, the major food source of lynx in the study area, occurred at higher densities closer to areas of human activity and infrastructure. Proximity of lynx locations to human activity and infrastructure was used as a risk index because the most common causes of death among Scandinavian lynx were of anthropogenic origin. This study shows that distances from lynx locations to human activity were significantly greater for females with newborn kittens than for males, but this decreased with kitten age. The data suggest that this response to human activity is influenced by the reproductive strategies of males and females, and might explain male-biased human-induced mortality in this study and in carnivores more generally.

TI  - The problem of scale in indigenous knowledge: a perspective from Northern Australia
PY  - 2009
AB  - Over the last decade, indigenous knowledge has been widely touted by researchers and natural resource managers as a valuable contributor to natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. In Australia, the concept of indigenous knowledge has gained such rapid currency that it has tended toward an essentialized and universal truth rather than remaining a diverse range of highly localized and contested knowledge. In this paper, I undertake a critical analysis of some of the current issues around the interpretation and application of indigenous knowledge and its relationship with natural resource management in northern Australia. Through a focus on how indigenous knowledge operates at a range of scales, I argue that indigenous knowledge is not adapted to the scales and kinds of disturbances that contemporary society is exerting on natural systems. Rather than being realistic about the limitations of indigenous knowledge, I argue that nonindigenous interpretations of indigenous knowledge have propelled us toward reified meanings, abstracted concepts, and an information-based taxonomy of place. The result can be the diminishing and ossifying of a dynamic living practice and the failure to recognize expressions of indigeneity in contemporary forms.

TI  - Characterization Factors for Global Warming in Life Cycle Assessment Based on Damages to Humans and Ecosystems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Human and ecosystem health damage due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is generally poorly quantified in the life cycle assessment of products, preventing an integrated comparison of the importance of GHGs with other stressor types, such as ozone depletion and acidifying emissions. In this study, we derived new characterization factors for 63 GHGs that quantify the impact of an emission change on human and ecosystem health damage. For human health damage, the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) per unit emission related to malaria, diarrhea, malnutrition, drowning, and cardiovascular diseases were quantified. For ecosystem health damage, the Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) over space and time of various species groups, including plants, butterflies, birds, and mammals, per unit emission was calculated. The influence of value choices in the modeling procedure was analyzed by defining three coherent scenarios, based on Cultural theory perspectives. It was found that the characterization factor for human health damage by carbon dioxide (CO2) ranges from 1.1 x 10(-2) to 1.8 x 10(+1) DALY per kton of emission, while the characterization factor for ecosystem damage by CO2 ranges from 5.4 x 10(-2) to 1.2 x 10(+1) disappeared fraction of species over space and time ((km2 x year)/kton), depending on the scenario chosen. The characterization factor of a GHG can change up to 4 orders of magnitude, depending on the scenario. The scenario-specific differences are mainly explained by the choice for a specific time horizon and stresses the importance of dealing with value choices in the life cycle impact assessment of GHG emissions.

TI  - Recent changes in the landscápe of the marine clays, Østfold, southeast Norway
PY  - 1992
AB  - Grading of gullies for agricultural purposes was heavily subsidized in Norway during the period 1971–1987. Grading activity was very high and has significantly contributed to the recent changes in the rural landscape of Ostfold. Interpretation of aerial photographs indicated that at least one-third of the marine clay areas contained significant grading and similar encroachments. Detailed studies of three test areas revealed that between 60 and 80% of the total length of the observed gullies from the 1950s and 1960s had disappeared. Today it is almost impossible to find large intact gully systems that are not affected by grading. The few gully systems which are still reasonably untouched have therefore a high conservation value.

TI  - Variation in daily activity of the free-living Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) in Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland
PY  - 1999
AB  - The pattern of daily activity of the Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx L. was studied by radio-telemetry in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (eastern Poland). Radio-tracking of 18 lynx was done by 24-h continuous observations and by sampling on a daily basis. Lynx were active mostly at night. There was generally one peak of activity between 15:00 and 07:00 which, however, decreased slightly between 20:00 and 22:00. On average, lynx were moving for 6.5 h/day. In males, 73% of locomotory activity occurred at night, whereas females were active as long during the daylight as during the night. Movement bouts of females were shorter than those of males (1.1 h vs 2.1 h) but more frequent (4.2 vs 3.0 bouts/day). General patterns of activity of females with and without kittens were similar. However, females with kittens were active twice as long per day than non-reproducing females. In May–August (intensive care for kittens), reproducing females were active 26% longer than in September–April. Non-reproducing females showed the opposite pattern; they were active 60% less in May–August compared with September–April. Locomotory activity of adult males was 30–70% longer in January–March (mating season) than in other seasons. The pattern of lynx activity was shaped predominantly by searching for and consuming large prey. The lynx were active for the longest time during the days when they searched for prey but made no kill (12.5 h/day on average) and for the shortest time on the first day after killing a deer (1.6 h/day). Their moving activity increased steadily in the following days, reaching 6.8 h/day on the fourth day of consuming a killed deer. Ambient temperatures and rainfall did not significantly affect lynx activity, but there was little movement most of the time in heavy rain, and all day when the temperature was above 30 °C.

TI  - Modelling behavioural and fitness consequences of disturbance for geese along their spring flyway
PY  - 2005
AB  - For migratory birds the implications of environmental change may be difficult to predict because they use multiple sites during their annual cycle. Moreover, the migrants' use of these sites may be interdependent. Along the flyway of the Svalbard pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus population, Norwegian farmers use organized scaring to minimize goose use of their grasslands in spring. We assessed the consequences of this practice for regional site use of pink-footed geese along their spring migration route. 2. We used dynamic programming to find the sequence of migratory decisions that maximizes the fitness of female geese during spring migration, assuming scaring impinges on both food-intake rates and predation risk. The parameterization of the model was based on data gathered from individually marked pink-footed geese between 1991 and 2003. 3. The effect of scaring in terms of fitness and site use was most noticeable regarding food-intake rate. Scaring resulted in a redistribution of geese along the flyway. Furthermore, the outcomes of the modelling exercises were highly dependent on whether or not the geese were omniscient or naive: at moderate scaring levels naive geese were predicted to succumb. 4. On a qualitative basis there was good correspondence between the predictions from the model and the empirical evidence gathered to date. 5. Synthesis and applications. Besides highlighting the importance of learning and changing behaviour in an adaptive fashion, our modelling exercise indicated the potential vulnerability of the geese to abrupt environmental change. In addition, the exercise emphasized the interdependence of site use along the migratory flyway. The model supports the necessity for an integrated flyway management approach. In Norway, discussion is ongoing about the future management of the spring conflict between [KEYWORDS: Anser brachyrhynchus ; dynamic programming ; environmental change ; flyway ; management ; pink-footed goose ; migration ; scaring]

TI  - Hydropower's Biogenic Carbon Footprint.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Global warming is accelerating and the world urgently needs a shift to clean and renewable energy. Hydropower is currently the largest renewable source of electricity, but its contribution to climate change mitigation is not yet fully understood. Hydroelectric reservoirs are a source of biogenic greenhouse gases and in individual cases can reach the same emission rates as thermal power plants. Little is known about the severity of their emissions at the global scale. Here we show that the carbon footprint of hydropower is far higher than previously assumed, with a global average of 173 kg CO2 and 2.95 kg CH4 emitted per MWh of electricity produced. This results in a combined average carbon footprint of 273 kg CO2e/MWh when using the global warming potential over a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100). Nonetheless, this is still below that of fossil energy sources without the use of carbon capture and sequestration technologies. We identified the dams most promising for capturing methane for use as alternative energy source. The spread among the ~1500 hydropower plants analysed in this study is large and highlights the importance of case-by-case examinations.

TI  - Forest fire history in Viena Karelia, Russia
PY  - 2000
AB  - The history of forest fires was studied in north-west Russia near the Finnish-Russian border on a total of 22 transects within a 3 x 4 km area, 100 m long and 20 m wide, bydendrochronological methods. In total, 25 fires were identified as having occurred in the area between 1400 and 1998. On average, a fire occurred somewhere within the area once every 23 yrs, and once every 13 yrs between 1650 and 1950. The fire frequency (proportion of the area burnt per time unit) broadly followed the changes in the number of fires, but there were also differences. The fire frequency was 1.87% from 1679 to 1872 and 0.40% from 1873 onwards. The mean fire interval was 62 yrs and the median interval 56 yrs. According to the tree-ring width chronology tree growth was significantly lower in the dated fire years than in other years. Forest fire history in north-west Russia is broadly similar to that in many parts of Scandinavia.

TI  - SIMILAR RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PELAGIC PRIMARY AND BACTERIAL PRODUCTION IN CLEARWATER AND HUMIC LAKES
PY  - 2002
AB  - We examined the relationship between planktonic primary production (PP) and bacterial production (BP) in 16 subarctic lakes along an altitude gradient extending from colored coniferous forest lakes to clearwater high alpine lakes. We tested the hypothesis that there was a shift from low to high PP:BP ratios along this gradient. The clearwater alpine lakes had low PP:BP ratios, generally well below 1.0, while the highest ratios were found in the forest lakes. In contradiction to our hypothesis, the pelagic systems of the clearwater lakes were thus dominated by bacterial energy mobilization from external carbon sources. In this respect the alpine lakes were similar to highly humic lakes. We suggest that the relationship between C, N, and P plays a critical role in determining the PP:BP ratio, and that the N:P ratio in particular can be critical for development of PP or BP dominance in the pelagic systems of unproductive lakes.

TI  - Evaluation of Single-Pass Electrofishing and Rapid Habitat Assessment for Monitoring Redside Dace
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract To date, monitoring of the status of the provincially threatened redside dace Clinostomus elongatus in Ontario has been ad hoc or incidental to other sampling programs. We evaluated the efficacy of single-pass backpack electrofishing without block nets to detect redside dace, provide an index of abundance, and characterize size-class distributions. We also examined whether a rapid stream habitat assessment method was suitable for monitoring habitat condition at redside dace sites. Based on 40 sites across 7 Lake Ontario tributaries, catch data and length frequency distributions from single-pass sampling were compared with those from multiple-pass depletion sampling. Single-pass electrofishing captured 47% of estimated redside dace abundance and 34% of biomass. Abundance and biomass data from the single-pass method were positively correlated (abundance r2 = 0.83; biomass r2 = 0.52) with estimates from the multiple-pass depletion method. Probability of detection and precision of single-pass estimat...

TI  - Ecological responses to altered flow regimes: a literature review to inform the science and management of environmental flows
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. In an effort to develop quantitative relationships between various kinds of flow alteration and ecological responses, we reviewed 165 papers published over the last four decades, with a focus on more recent papers. Our aim was to determine if general relationships could be drawn from disparate case studies in the literature that might inform environmental flows science and management. 2. For all 165 papers we characterised flow alteration in terms of magnitude, frequency, duration, timing and rate of change as reported by the individual studies. Ecological responses were characterised according to taxonomic identity (macroinvertebrates, fish, riparian vegetation) and type of response (abundance, diversity, demographic parameters). A ‘qualitative’ or narrative summary of the reported results strongly corroborated previous, less comprehensive, reviews by documenting strong and variable ecological responses to all types of flow alteration. Of the 165 papers, 152 (92%) reported decreased values for recorded ecological metrics in response to a variety of types of flow alteration, whereas 21 papers (13%) reported increased values. 3. Fifty-five papers had information suitable for quantitative analysis of ecological response to flow alteration. Seventy per cent of these papers reported on alteration in flow magnitude, yielding a total of 65 data points suitable for analysis. The quantitative analysis provided some insight into the relative sensitivities of different ecological groups to alteration in flow magnitudes, but robust statistical relationships were not supported. Macroinvertebrates showed mixed responses to changes in flow magnitude, with abundance and diversity both increasing and decreasing in response to elevated flows and to reduced flows. Fish abundance, diversity and demographic rates consistently declined in response to both elevated and reduced flow magnitude. Riparian vegetation metrics both increased and decreased in response to reduced peak flows, with increases reflecting mostly enhanced non-woody vegetative cover or encroachment into the stream channel. 4. Our analyses do not support the use of the existing global literature to develop general, transferable quantitative relationships between flow alteration and ecological response; however, they do support the inference that flow alteration is associated with ecological change and that the risk of ecological change increases with increasing magnitude of flow alteration. 5. New sampling programs and analyses that target sites across well-defined gradients of flow alteration are needed to quantify ecological response and develop robust and general flow alteration–ecological response relationships. Similarly, the collection of pre- and post-alteration data for new water development programs would significantly add to our basic understanding of ecological responses to flow alteration.

TI  - The use of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in the delineation of open water features
PY  - 1996
AB  - The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) is a new method that has been developed to delineate open water features and enhance their presence in remotely-sensed digital imagery. The NDWI makes use of reflected near-infrared radiation and visible green light to enhance the presence of such features while eliminating the presence of soil and terrestrial vegetation features. It is suggested that the NDWI may also provide researchers with turbidity estimations of water bodies using remotely-sensed digital data.

TI  - Fire as a controlling process in the North American boreal forest
PY  - 1992
AB  - Introduction Major patterns of plant communities and species distribution are induced by various disturbance regimes operating at different spatial and temporal scales (Loucks 1970; White 1979; Bormann & Likens 1979 b ; Delcourt, Delcourt & Webb 1983). The development of temperate forests is controlled by canopy disturbance associated with single and multiple treefalls creating small gaps (Henry & Swan 1974; Oliver & Stephens 1977) and, occasionally, larger gaps along windstorm tracks (Canham & Loucks 1984). In contrast, fire disturbance in the boreal forest creates all sizes of canopy gap, and constitutes one of the most important community processes in vegetation development along complex environmental gradients (Heinselman 1981 b ). At the landscape level, ecological disturbances result in the spatiotemporal development of the vegetation mosaic composed of an assemblage of stand patches of different age, areal extent, and floristic composition (Pickett & White 1985). The boreal forest is one of the world's two largest forest belts; it covers more than 12 6 km 2 (Baumgartner 1979). The North American segment of the circumboreal forest, which constitutes a well-delineated biome both geographically and ecologically (Fig. 5.1), will be analyzed here with respect to fire disturbance. The boreal forest (excluding the Cordilleran region) spans more than 10° of latitude in eastern and western Canada; it is somewhat contracted south of Hudson Bay and James Bay, and in Alaska. At the continent scale, the boreal forest is a floristically poor biome (Takhtajan 1986) with only nine tree species dominating regionally or throughout the range, in coexistence with a subdued under-canopy flora in dense stands and an ubiquitous cryptogamic flora in open stands.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation in the Grilse Proportion of Atlantic Salmon in Norwegian Rivers
PY  - 2004
AB  - Abstract Variation in the sea age at maturity of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was studied in 158 Norwegian rivers over large spatial (58–71°N; 5–30°E) and temporal (1983–2000) scales. Age at sexual maturity was expressed as the proportion of grilse (fish with one sea winter) in the nominal salmon catch. No general temporal trend was found in the proportion of grilse in the catches. However, grilse proportion declined significantly in 10 rivers and increased significantly in 11 rivers out of the 55 rivers with data for all 18 years. There were no short-term cycles in grilse proportion within rivers. We found coherence and similarity in the temporal variation in grilse proportion for rivers draining into large fjord systems. Reasons for the temporal variation in grilse proportions must be sought at a river-specific or regional scale. River-specific factors (water discharge, river steepness, and presence of lakes) explained a large percentage of the spatial variation in grilse proportion. Grilse proportion in...

TI  - Fragmentation of riparian floras in rivers with multiple dams
PY  - 2000
AB  - Rivers are increasingly fragmented by dams, resulting in disruption of natural dispersal pathways and subsequent changes of riverine communities. We assessed the effect of dams as barriers to plant dispersal along rivers by comparing the flora of vascular plants between pairs of run-of-river impoundments in northern Sweden. Adjacent impoundments in similar environmental settings develop different riparian floras because species with poor floating capacity become unevenly distributed among impoundments. Such discontinuities were not found along a free-flowing river, suggesting effective dispersal of riparian plants in the absence of dams. Given that dams regulate most of the world's rivers, floristic disruptions of riparian corridors may be a global phenomenon. The extensive fragmentation of other ecosystems may have caused similar obstructions to organism dispersal, with subsequent changes in species composition.

PY  - 1986
AB  - In winter, 1981, 103 reindeer, out of a population of 3600, were herded into a fence by snowmobiles and marked. During the next 4 1/2 years reindeer were followed from the ground, or by radiolocations from an airplane. On the average one animal was tagged per 42 animals in any group. A total sample of 175 locations in all seasons indicated that snow conditions, traffic on a road lying parallel to a railroad, and the damming of a lake significantly affected annual distribution as compared with expected modern as well as prehistoric distribution.

TI  - The effects of power lines on ungulates and implications for power line routing and rights-of-way management
PY  - 2014
AB  - Thousands of kilometres of power lines exist and more are planned. Ungulates that range over large areas are likely to encounter power lines, but a synthesis of power line effects on ungulates is lacking. Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) are suspected to avoid power lines up to distances of 4 km. In contrast, some forest ungulates preferentially forage in power line rights-of-way, cleared areas under power lines. We reviewed the factors that possibly influence avoidance and attraction effects of power lines on ungulates, construct a conceptual framework, and make suggestions on how to mitigate avoidance effects through power line routing and rights-of-way management. Power line construction, noise and electromagnetic fields are possible sources of disturbance, while rights-of-way management influences habitat use under power lines. Disturbance and altered habitat use can induce barrier and corridor effects, thereby influencing connectivity. Species-specific effects influence behavioural disturbance and habitat use. We found little evidence for behavioural disturbance of reindeer or forest ungulates under power lines. Forest ungulates could benefit from browsing in power line rights-of-way if they are managed to provide abundant and preferred forage as well as sufficient cover. However, power lines may facilitate access for hunters and predators. As a precaution, construction of power lines should be avoided in calving areas. To establish a causal relationship between the construction of power lines and potential avoidance, before-after-impact-control studies are recommended. More research is needed to make recommendations for the optimal design of power line networks. Key words: Power lines, rights-of-way, ungulates, disturbance.

TI  - REVIEW: Beyond the fragmentation debate: a conceptual model to predict when habitat configuration really matters
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary 1. Research addressing the effects of habitat fragmentation on species, assemblages or ecosystems has been fraught with difficulties, from its conceptual foundation to statistical analyses and interpretation. Yet, it is critical to address such challenges as ecosystems are rapidly being altered across the world. 2. Many studies have concluded that effects of habitat loss exceed those of fragmentation per se, that is, the degree to which a given amount of habitat is broken apart. There is also evidence from different biomes and taxa that habitat configuration, that is, the spatial arrangement of habitat at a given time, may influence several landscape processes such as functional connectivity, edge and matrix effects, and thus population viability. 3. Instead of focusing attention on the relative influence of either habitat loss or fragmentation, we must identify portions of the gradient in habitat amount where configuration effects are most likely to be observed. Here, we suggest that all species are, to a certain degree, sensitive to landscape change and that, assuming a homogeneous matrix, habitat configuration will have a higher influence on species at intermediate values of habitat amount, where configuration has potentially the greatest variability. 4. On the basis of empirical studies and simulations, we expect that species that are relatively tolerant to fragmentation of their habitat will exhibit a wider band where amount and configuration interact compared to species less tolerant to fragmentation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Reducing habitat loss should be a top priority for conservation planners. However, researchers should also investigate the indirect impacts of habitat loss on biodiversity through fragmentation effects. This research aims to identify windows of opportunity where habitat configuration can mitigate to some extent the effects of habitat loss, particularly through the maintenance of functional connectivity.

PY  - 2000
AB  - Depuis le debut des annees quatre-vingt-dix, le retour du loup en France est objet de debats passionnes opposant les protecteurs de la nature et les eleveurs de montagne. L'A. se propose de depasser les evidences et les slogans et de prendre en compte le discours social generalement devalorise des rumeurs. Tout d'abord, elle decrit l'evolution de la situation depuis le printemps 1993, premiere annonce du retour officiel du loup en France, jusqu'au printemps 2000, lorsqu'un Plan Loup officiel, prevoyant une regulation de la presence de l'espece selon les zones ou elle s'implante, est adopte. Elle presente ensuite les parties qui s'opposent : eleveurs et deputes des zones montagnardes ; associations de protecteurs et mouvements d'amis des loups ; administrations, longtemps passives. Leurs arguments se ressemblent, chacun s'affirmant le plus proche de la nature, terme tres valorise qui recouvre des realites bien differentes. Un aspect de la situation generalement ignore est aborde en troisieme lieu : l'existence d'elevages incontroles de loups, ce qui conduit a des lâchers (volontaires ou accidentels) bien reels. Ce fait est lie a l'evolution de l'image du loup que la quatrieme partie presente ensuite : du plus rejete a l'embleme d'une nature sauvage reconstruite, le loup demeure un animal du comble polarisant les passions. La cinquieme partie analyse les rumeurs de lâchers d'animaux sauvages et les verites qu'elles expriment. L'A. s'interroge en conclusion sur le devenir du loup sauvage en France.

TI  - Predators and people: using human densities to interpret declines of large carnivores
PY  - 2000
AB  - The current extinction crisis is caused primarily by human impacts upon wild populations. Large carnivores are especially sensitive to human activity; because their requirements often conflict with those of local people, predators have been actively persecuted in most regions of the world. In this paper, the impact of people upon predators is analysed by relating local carnivore extinctions to past and projected human population densities. There are strong associations between high human density and the loss of carnivore populations from a region. Interspecific variation in ability to survive at high human densities probably reflects species' ability to adapt to human-modified habitats. However, regional and temporal variation in individual species' sensitivity to human density is more likely to reflect the activities of local people than the phenotypes of local carnivores. Local culture, government policy and international trade all influence human attitudes to predators and, therefore, the impact of people upon carnivore populations. The importance of these factors may mean that extinction risks for carnivores will continue to increase, even though human population growth is projected to deccelerate during the new millennium. This points to an urgent need for techniques to resolve conflicts between people and predators at either the local or landscape level.

TI  - Do bears know they are being hunted
PY  - 2012
AB  - Behavioral effects of living under predation risk may influence the dynamics of prey species more than direct demographic effects. Human recreation, especially hunting, can also force prey to increase their vigilance and can influence distribution and habitat use even more than natural predators. However, behavioral effects do not play a prominent role in conservation or wildlife management. Whereas the demographic consequences of hunting are documented for large carnivores, behavioral effects of hunting on their dynamics remain unexplored. We studied the movement patterns of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Scandinavia as a model species, before and after the start of the annual bear hunting season. Bears were expected to become more active at daytime as the season progressed due to shortening daylight. However, the start of hunting disrupted this pattern. Solitary bears subject to hunting increased movements during the dark hours after hunting started, losing their nocturnal rest, probably to compensate for decreased daytime activity. Females with cubs-of-the-year, which are protected from hunting, also modified their movement pattern, but much less than hunted bears. Bears altered their movement pattern at a critical time of the year, during hyperphagia, when they must store fat reserves before hibernation, which is critical for reproduction. Behavioral effects of hunting should be a relevant issue for the conservation and management of large carnivores, especially when hunting occurs during highly sensitive periods of the year. This concern applies to many species managed under hunting regimes.

TI  - Understanding ecosystem retrogression
PY  - 2010
AB  - Over time scales of thousands to millions of years, and in the absence of rejuvenating disturbances that initiate primary or early secondary succession, ecosystem properties such as net primary productivity, decomposition, and rates of nutrient cycling undergo substantial declines termed ecosystem retrogression. Retrogression results from the depletion or reduction in the availability of nutrients, and can only be reversed through rejuvenating disturbance that resets the system; this differs from age-related declines in forest productivity that are driven by shorter-term depression of nutrient availability and plant ecophysiological process rates that occur during succession. Here we review and synthesize the findings from studies of long-term chronosequences that include retrogressive stages for systems spanning the boreal, temperate, and subtropical zones. Ecosystem retrogression has been described by ecologists, biogeochemists, geologists, and pedologists, each of which has developed somewhat independent conceptual frameworks; our review seeks to unify this literature in order to better understand the causes and consequences of retrogression. Studies of retrogression have improved our knowledge of how long-term pedogenic changes drive shorter-term biological processes, as well as the consequences of these changes for ecosystem development. Our synthesis also reveals that similar patterns of retrogression (involving reduced soil fertility, predictable shifts in organismic traits, and ecological processes) occur in systems with vastly different climatic regimes, geologic substrates, and vegetation types, even though the timescales and mechanisms driving retrogression may vary greatly among sites. Studies on retrogression also provide evidence that in many regions, high biomass or "climax" forests are often transient, and do not persist indefinitely in the absence of rejuvenating disturbance. Finally, our review highlights that studies on retrogressive chronosequences in contrasting regions provide unparalleled opportunities for developing general principles about the long-term feedbacks between biological communities and pedogenic processes, and how these control ecosystem development.

TI  - FAVORABLE FORAGING LOCATIONS FOR YOUNG ATLANTIC SALMON: APPLICATION TO HABITAT AND POPULATION RESTORATION
PY  - 1999
AB  - Declines in the populations of salmonid fishes have generated major interest in conservation and restoration of wild populations and river habitats. We used a foraging-based model, combined with field observations and surveys, to predict individual habitat use, and to assess the effects of stream habitat conditions and management practices on the potential for reestablishing Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. Using a model based on a simple trade-off between increasing prey encounter rate and decreasing salmon capture success with increasing stream current velocity, we predicted favorable foraging locations for salmon in their first (age-0) spring and summer. We tested, in six streams, whether (1) salmon preferred locations (=microhabitats) that were predicted to yield high consumption rates, (2) salmon growth and survival was greater in streams with a greater proportion of preferred, profitable, microhabitats, and (3) stream habitat remediation (introduction of large in-stream structures such as large woody d...

TI  - Do human activity and infrastructure disturb domesticated reindeer? The need for the reindeer's perspective
PY  - 2014
AB  - In recent decades, human-Rangifer (reindeer and caribou) interactions have increasingly been studied from a scientific perspective. Many of the studies have examined Norwegian wild reindeer or caribou in North America. It is often questioned whether results from these studies can be applied to reindeer in managed herds, as these animals have been exposed to domestication and are also more used to humans. In order to examine the domesticated reindeer's reactions to various disturbance sources, we reviewed 18 studies of the effects of human activity and infrastructure on 12 populations of domesti- cated reindeer and compared these to studies on wild reindeer and caribou; based on this, we discuss the effects of domestication and tameness on reindeer responses to anthropogenic disturbance. We also consider the relevance of spatial and temporal scales and data collection methods when evaluating the results of these studies. The reviewed studies showed that domesticated reindeer exhibit avoid- ance behaviours up to 12 km away from infrastructure and sites of human activity and that the area they avoid may shift between seasons and years. Despite a long domesti- cation process, reindeer within Sami reindeer-herding systems exhibit similar patterns of large-scale avoidance of anthropogenic disturbance as wild Rangifer, although the strength of their response may sometimes differ. This is not surprising since current Sami reindeer husbandry repre- sents an extensive form of pastoralism, and the reindeer are not particularly tame. To obtain a true picture of how reindeer use their ranges, it is of fundamental importance to study the response pattern at a spatial and temporal scale that is relevant to the reindeer, whether domesticated or wild.

TI  - A systematic comparison of first-time and repeat visitors via a two-phase online survey
PY  - 2008
AB  - Abstract Tourism researchers report differences between first-time and repeat visitors in terms of their demographics, tripographics, destination perception, perceived value, and travel motivations. The majority of previous studies focus on comparing only one or a couple of these dimensions, with fragmented and sometimes conflicting findings. Consequently, the existing literature presents a rather mixed picture of the similarity and differences between the two groups. This article offers a systematic comparison of first-time and repeat visitors via demographic and tripographic characteristics, travel planning behavior, pre- and post-trip congruency in travel activity preferences, and post-trip evaluation. The findings indicate that first-timers’ behaviors are more tourism/travel oriented, while repeaters’ behaviors demonstrate a recreation/activity orientation. First-timers are more active travel planners, while repeaters indicate more positive post-trip evaluations. Plus, on-site experiences influence the two groups’ activity preferences.

TI  - Grain size along two gravel-bed rivers: statistical variation, spatial pattern and sedimentary links
PY  - 1998
AB  - A new set of field data facilitates a detailed analysis of variations in bed material grain size within two confluent gravel-bed rivers in northeastern British Columbia, Canada. A preliminary assessment of grain-size variability establishes a basis for examination of the spatial pattern of grain-size change. Standard ANOVA techniques are inappropriate because individual samples have unequal variances and are not normally distributed. Alternative tests for homoscedasticity and comparison of means are therefore utilized. Within-site, between-sample variability is not significant. The grain-size distributions that were obtained at individual sites are therefore representative of the depositional environments that were sampled. In both rivers mean grain size does vary significantly between sites and there is therefore a basis for examining the data for spatial patterns such as downstream fining. Textural variations along the two rivers studied here are complex and show negligible overall fining (in over 100 km). This is the consequence of a large number of tributary inputs and non-alluvial sediment sources which are the legacy of Late Pleistocene glaciation. The identification of lateral sources like these is fundamental for understanding textural changes within rivers. The sedimentary link (a channel reach between significant lateral sediment inputs) provides a means of isolating fluvial maturation processes (abrasion and sorting) from contingent lateral inputs. Strong fining trends are apparent in most links and classification of grain-size measurements according to their location within particular links greatly improves the statistical explanation of textural variation. Identification of sedimentary links provides a means of applying models of fluvial fining processes, so isolation of link networks will aid the development of basin-scale models of textural variation. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Cambium dynamics of Pinus sylvestris and Betula spp. in the northern boreal forest in Finland
PY  - 2004
AB  - Wood formation dynamics of pine and birch along a south-north transect in Finnish Lapland were determined by the pinning technique. For all trees at all sites a more or less sigmoid shape of the wood formation intensity is characteristic with a slow beginning, a faster growth in the middle and a decreasing activity towards the end of the vegetation period. Wood formation of pine started at sites 1–3 (southern sites) in the second week of June and at sites 4 and 5 (northern sites) only in the last week of June, whereas wood formation ended within the first half of August. Wood formation of birch started in the second half of June and ended around the beginning of August. First cells were laid down by pine and birch when the temperature sum had reached the level of 85 to 90 degree days and 110 to 120 degree days, respectively. The intensity of wood formation in pine was highest in July, in birch within two weeks in the middle of July. Wood formation in pine lasted for about seven weeks at the southernmost and about six weeks at the northernmost site. In birch, the duration of wood formation was about five weeks at the southernmost site and around three weeks at the other sites.

TI  - Major decline in fires in coniferous forests - Reconstructing the phenomenon and seeking for the cause
PY  - 2011
AB  - Steep decline in forest fires about a century ago occurred in coniferous forests over large areas in North America and Fennoscandia. This poorly understood phenomenon has been explained by different factors in different regions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity of the four most commonly suggested causes of the decrease in forest fires: fire fighting, over-grazing, climate change and human influence. I compiled the available dendrochronological data and estimated the annually burned proportions of Pinus-dominated forests in four subcontinental regions during the past 500 years. These data were compared to the development of fire suppression, grazing pressure, climate and human livelihoods. The annually burned proportions declined over 90% in all studied regions. In three out of the four regions fires decreased decades before fire suppression began. Available drought data are annually well correlated with fires but could not explain the decrease of the level in annually burned areas. A rapid increase in the number of livestock occurred at the same time with the decrease in fires in the Western US but not in Fennoscandia. Hence, fire suppression in Central Fennoscandia and over-grazing in the Western US may have locally contributed to the reduction of burned areas. More general explanation is offered by human influence hypothesis: the majority of the past forest fires were probably caused by humans and the decrease in the annually burned areas was because of a decrease in human caused fires. This is in accordance with the old written records and forest fire statistics. The decrease in annually burned areas, both in Fennoscandia and the United States coincides with an economic and cultural transition from traditional livelihoods that are associated with high fire use to modern agriculture and forestry.

TI  - Accurately Identifying and Comparing Sustainable Tourists, Nature-Based Tourists, and Ecotourists on the Basis of Their Environmental Concerns
PY  - 2010
AB  - The current study, using a confirmatory factor analysis, developed a multi-item scale consisting of 3 dimensions that exhibited necessary reliability and validity. Based on this Nature-Based, Eco- and Sustainable Tourists (NES)-scale, and by utilizing a cluster analysis, the study identifies 4 distinct segments among a sample of the Norwegian population: nature-based tourists, ecotourists, sustainable tourists, and mass tourists. The analysis shows that while the ecotourists make up the largest segment, the mass tourists represent the smallest segment. Using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the resulting 4 segments are later compared on the basis of their environmental concerns. The findings suggest that the ecotourists are the most environmentally concerned whereas the mass tourists are the least environmentally concerned. Finally, based upon the overall findings of the study, a new inductive model is developed. This model highlights the interaction between different types of alternative tourists and mass t...

TI  - Paying for Tolerance: Rural Citizens' Attitudes toward Wolf Depredation and Compensation
PY  - 2003
AB  - As wolf ( Canis lupus) populations recover in Wisconsin (U.S.A.), their depredations on livestock, pets, and hunting dogs have increased. We used a mail-back survey to assess the tolerance of 535 rural cit- izens of wolves and their preferences regarding the management of "problem" wolves. Specifically, we tested whether people who had lost domestic animals to wolves or other predators were less tolerant of wolves than neighboring residents who had not and whether compensation payments improved tolerance of wolves. We assessed tolerance via proxy measures related to an individual's preferred wolf population size for Wisconsin and the likelihood she or he would shoot a wolf. We also measured individuals' approval of lethal control and other wolf-management tactics under five conflict scenarios. Multivariate analysis revealed that the strongest predictor of tolerance was social group. Bear ( Ursus americanus) hunters were concerned about losing valu- able hounds to wolves and were more likely to approve of lethal control and reducing the wolf population than were livestock producers, who were more concerned than general residents. To a lesser degree, education level, experience of loss, and gender were also significant. Livestock producers and bear hunters who had been compensated for their losses to wolves were not more tolerant than their counterparts who alleged a loss but received no compensation. Yet all respondents approved of compensation payments as a management strategy. Our results indicate that deep-rooted social identity and occupation are more powerful predictors of tolerance of wolves than individual encounters with these large carnivores.

TI  - Effects of Roads on Animal Abundance: an Empirical Review and Synthesis
PY  - 2009
AB  - The authors attempted a complete review of the empirical literature on effects of roads and traffic on animal abundance and distribution. They found 79 studies, with results for 131 species and 30 species groups. Overall, the number of documented negative effects of roads on animal abundance outnumbered the number of positive effects by a factor of 5; 114 responses were negative, 22 were positive, and 56 showed no effect. Amphibians and reptiles tended to show negative effects. Birds showed mainly negative or no effects, with a few positive effects for some small birds and for vultures. Small mammals generally showed either positive effects or no effect, mid-sized mammals showed either negative effects or no effect, and large mammals showed predominantly negative effects. The authors synthesized this information, along with information on species attributes, to develop a set of predictions of the conditions that lead to negative or positive effects or no effect of roads on animal abundance. Four species types are predicted to respond negatively to roads: (i) species that are attracted to roads and are unable to avoid individual cars; (ii) species with large movement ranges, low reproductive rates, and low natural densities; and (iii and iv) small animals whose populations are not limited by road-affected predators and either (a) avoid habitat near roads due to traffic disturbance or (b) show no avoidance of roads or traffic disturbance and are unable to avoid oncoming cars. Two species types are predicted to respond positively to roads: (i) species that are attracted to roads for an important resource (e.g., food) and are able to avoid oncoming cars, and (ii) species that do not avoid traffic disturbance but do avoid roads, and whose main predators show negative population-level responses to roads. Other conditions lead to weak or non-existent effects of roads and traffic on animal abundance. The authors identify areas where further research is needed, but they also argue that the evidence for population-level effects of roads and traffic is already strong enough to merit routine consideration of mitigation of these effects in all road construction and maintenance projects.

TI  - The Influence of Island and Mainland Lakeshore Landscapes on Boreal Forest Fire Regimes
PY  - 1991
AB  - In order to characterize the fire regime of the southern boreal forest and to understand the way in which landscape and fire regime interact, a detailed study of fire history was undertaken in two adjacent contrasting landscapes in northwestern Quebec. The fire history for the islands of Lake Duparquet was reconstructed and compared to that of the surrounding lakeshore. Fire occurrence was determined by archival search and by collection of information from fire scars. Dendroecological techniques were used to deter- mine years of stand initiation on the lakeshore and for a subsample of the islands. Stand initiation data were used to estimate fire frequency, fire cycle, and fire intensity (lethal and non-lethal fires). Tree composition and surficial deposits were sampled in order to assess the possible effect of topography and forest cover on fire frequency. Dated fire scars (n = 273) revealed 82 fire years, with the earliest dated to 1593. Islands experienced more fire years (56) than the lakeshore (37), and fire years were uncorrelated. Most (72%) of the lakeshore stands were initiated by a few large fires (eight), whereas the fire size on islands was variable, ranging from < 10% to 100% of the total surface of the island. Despite these differences in fire regime, fire occurrence and fire frequency decreased concurrently on the islands and the lakeshore starting ; 120 yr ago. The lakeshore fire cycle was 63 yr before 1870 and 99 yr since 1870, whereas the fire cycle on the islands was slightly longer (74 yr and 112 yr) during the same intervals. The long-term decrease in fire frequency of both the lakeshore and the islands was possibly driven by climatic change. Fire frequency was generally similar for all surficial deposits and fuel types on the lakeshore, whereas fires were more abundant in pine woodland growing on bedrock on the islands. Lakeshore fires were generally of lethal intensity, whereas both a long cycle of lethal fires and a shorter cycle of non-lethal fires were observed on 50% of the islands. The morphology and location of islands with both types of fires suggest that a higher frequency of lightning strikes resulted in a regime characterized by more frequent fires and fires of variable intensity. The specific fire regime observed in the island landscape may be the cause of the abundance of pines, whose presence may contribute, in turn, to the continuation of this regime of less intense and more frequent fires. We suggest that fire regime in the boreal forest is controlled by long-term climate change at the regional scale, and by a strong interaction with landscape at the local scale, both components having a great impact on the distribution and the dynamics of boreal vege- tation.

TI  - Relative Sensitivities of Mammalian Carnivores to Habitat Fragmentation
PY  - 2002
AB  - I examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on the distribution and abundance of mamma- lian carnivores in coastal southern California and tested the prediction that responses to fragmentation var- ied with the body size of carnivore species. I conducted track surveys for nine native and two exotic carnivore species in 29 urban habitat fragments and 10 control sites. Fragment area and isolation were the two stron- gest landscape descriptors of predator distribution and abundance. Six species were sensitive to fragmenta- tion, generally disappearing as habitat patches became smaller and more isolated; three species were en- hanced by fragmentation, with increased abundance in highly fragmented sites; and two species were tolerant of fragmentation, with little to no effect of landscape variables on their distribution and abundance. Within urban habitat fragments, the carnivore visitation rate increased at sites with more exotic cover and closer to the urban edge, a pattern driven largely by the increased abundance of fragmentation-enhanced carnivores at edge sites. Finally, body size, in conjunction with other ecological characteristics, partially ac- counted for the heterogeneity in responses to fragmentation among carnivore species. These differential sensi- tivities are useful criteria for choosing appropriate focal species for ecological research and conservation planning, a choice that depends on the scale of fragmentation in a region and the commensurate responses of carnivore populations at that scale.

TI  - Reconstructing Nature: Alienation, Emancipation and the Division of Labour
PY  - 1996
AB  - One of the main features of the contemporary environmental crisis is that no one has a clear idea of what is going on. The author uses an extension of Marx's theory of alienation to explain why people find it so difficult to relate their different knowledges of the natural and social world. He argues that nevertheless it is possible to relate these to the abstractions of ecological discourse. Emancipation can come only through embracing science and rationality rather than rejecting them and, in the process, humanity as well as the non-human world will benefit.

TI  - Pay-offs and penalties of competing migratory schedules
PY  - 2003
AB  - We relate variation in the timing of arrival by migrating birds breeding at northerly latitudes to individual differences in the prior accumulation of energy stores. Balancing starvation risks early in the season against the almost universal declining trend in reproductive prospects with advancing date is seen as an individual decision with fitness consequences. We review three studies implicating events at the staging sites or in winter in setting the individual migratory schedule. Climate change influences the timetable of a pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) population breeding in The Netherlands and wintering in West Africa, followed since 1960. Mean air temperature in the period mid April-mid May (arrival and laying) increased and laying date advanced by 10 days. Still, in recent years most birds did not lay early enough to maximise fitness (determined by recruitment and parental survival) whereas many parents achieved this goal in 1980-1985. As the flycatchers have not started to arrive earlier, some ecological constraint further upstream is postulated (possibly the hurdle of the crossing of Sahara and Mediterranean). The ability to follow individual migrants provides a second avenue to assess the fitness implications of migratory schedules. Thus, brightly coloured male bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica) captured in the Dutch Wadden Sea (the intermediate staging site linking a West African wintering area with breeding sites in arctic Russia) and traced with miniature radio-transmitters did not depart early. The 'best' males (with bright breeding plumage) were picked up by the listening stations in Sweden 650 km further along the migratory route ten days later than the paler individuals. If early arrival confers the competitive advantage of prior occupancy but increases mortality, the 'best' males may be able to afford arriving later and thus avoid some of the survival costs. Return rate of the 'bright' males to the staging site in later seasons was indeed higher than for the 'pale', early males. Intensive observation of pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) fitted with coded neck-collars substantiate the tight relationship between energy stores (fat) accumulated up to final departure from the final staging site (Vesteralen, N. Norway) en route to the nesting grounds (Spitsbergen) and subsequent success. The breeding outcome of individual parents (accompanied by juveniles or not) could be related to observations of body condition before departure (visual 'abdominal profile index'). Recently, perceived conflicts with agriculture have resulted in widespread harassment by humans. The geese have: drastically shortened their stay on the Vesteralen, fail to achieve the body condition usual a decade ago and reproductive output has fallen. Although the geese are currently pioneering new staging sites, an adequate alternative has not materialised, underlining the critical role of the final take-off site.

TI  - Allocation of water consumption in multipurpose reservoirs
PY  - 2016
AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources represented a benchmark in the assessment of water consumption from electricity production. The numbers for hydropower ranged from very low to much larger than the other renewable technologies, partly explained by methodological problems. One of the methodological shortcomings identified was the lack of guidance on how to allocate the water consumption rates in multipurpose reservoirs. This paper is, according to the authors’ knowledge, the first attempt to evaluate, test and propose a methodology for the allocation of water consumption from such reservoirs. We tested four different allocation methods in four different cases, all serving three to five functions, including drinking water supply, irrigation, flood control, industrial water, ecological flow and power generation. Based on our case studies we consider volume allocation to be the most robust approach for allocating water consumption between functions in multipurpose reservoirs. The spatial boundaries of the analysis should follow the boundaries of the hydraulic system. We recommend that data should preferably be gathered from one source for all functions, to ensure a consistent calculation approach. We believe the findings are relevant for similar allocation problems, such as allocation of energy investments and green-house gas emissions from multipurpose reservoirs.

TI  - FISHES AS INTEGRATORS OF BENTHIC AND PELAGIC FOOD WEBS IN LAKES
PY  - 2002
AB  - Studies of lake ecosystems generally focus on pelagic food chains and processes. Recently, there has been an emerging recognition of the importance of benthic production and processes to whole-lake ecosystems. To examine the extent to which zoobenthos contribute to higher trophic level production in lakes, we synthesized diet data from 470 fish populations (15 species) and stable isotope data from 90 fish populations (11 species), all of which are common inhabitants of north-temperate lakes. Across all species considered, zoobenthos averaged 50% of total prey consumption. Indirect consumption of zoobenthos (i.e., feeding on zoobenthos-supported fishes) contributed another 15%, for a total of 65% reliance on benthic secondary production. Stable isotopes provided estimates of mean zoobenthivory ranging from 43% to 59%. For most fish species, consumption of zoobenthos was highly variable among populations. The overwhelming concern of ecologists with pelagic food chains and processes contrasts sharply with our finding that benthic secondary production plays a central role in supporting higher trophic level production. This extensive zoobenthivory can subsidize fish populations, leading to apparent competition and otherwise altering trophic dynamics and ecosystem processes in the pelagic zone. We argue for a more integrated view of lake ecosystems that recognizes the duality of benthic and pelagic production pathways. Food web models that explicitly consider energy flow from pelagic and benthic sources will provide a more realistic energy flow template for understanding the regulation of lake ecosystem functioning.

TI  - Historical Range of Variability: A Useful Tool for Evaluating Ecosystem Change
PY  - 1994
AB  - The concept of historical range of variability in ecosystem structure or process is valuable in understanding and illustrating the dynamic nature of ecosystems; the processes that sustain and change ecosystems, especially disturbances; the current state of the system in relationship to the past; and the possible ranges of conditions that are feasible to maintain. Because ecosystems are structured hierarchically, historical range of variability must be characterized at multiple spatial scales and relevant time scales. Historical range of variability is a useful reference for determining a range of desired future conditions, and for establishing the limits of acceptable change for ecosystem components and processes.

TI  - The global abundance and size distribution of lakes, ponds, and impoundments
PY  - 2006
AB  - One of the major impediments to the integration of lentic ecosystems into global environmental analyses has been fragmentary data on the extent and size distribution of lakes, ponds, and impoundments. We use new data sources, enhanced spatial resolution, and new analytical approaches to provide new estimates of the global abundance of surface-water bodies. A global model based on the Pareto distribution shows that the global extent of natural lakes is twice as large as previously known (304 million lakes; 4.2 million km2 in area) and is dominated in area by millions of water bodies smaller than 1 km2. Similar analyses of impoundments based on inventories of large, engineered dams show that impounded waters cover approximately 0.26 million km 2 . However, construction of low-tech farm impoundments is estimated to be between 0.1% and 6% of farm area worldwide, dependent upon precipitation, and represents .77,000 km 2 globally, at present. Overall, about 4.6 million km2 of the earth’s continental ‘‘land’’ surface (.3%) is covered by water. These analyses underscore the importance of explicitly considering lakes, ponds, and impoundments, especially small ones, in global analyses of rates and processes.

TI  - Temperature and precipitation scenarios for Norway: comparison of results from dynamical and empirical downscaling
PY  - 2003
AB  - A scenario from the coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model ECHAM4/OPYC3 was downscaled by empirical and dynamical methods to show projected changes in temperature (T) and precipitation (R) in Norway under global warming. In the empirical models, large-scale T was applied as a predictor for T. For R, both T and sea-level pressure (SLP) were applied as predictors during most of the year, while only SLP was applied during summer. The dynamical model, HIRHAM, is a regional climate model based upon HIRLAM, but with physical parametrisations from ECHAM4/ OPYC3. Both approaches project from 1980-1999 to 2030-2049 an increase in annual mean temper- atures of between 1 and 2.5°C in various parts of the country. The projected warming is at a minimum along the southern coast, while greater warming is projected inland and in the north. Though the dif- ferences between the approaches are not statistically significant, empirical downscaling systemati- cally leads to a larger projected increase in annual mean temperature than dynamical downscaling does. The difference is at a maximum during winter and/or spring at localities exposed to tempera- ture inversions. Empirical downscaling projects larger winter warming in inland valleys than at more freely exposed localities, and thus implies a reduced intensity or frequency of winter inversions. It is argued that less favourable conditions for ground inversions are consistent with the future projection of increased winter wind speeds and reduced snow-cover. For precipitation, both downscaling approaches project a statistically significant increase in the west during autumn, and in the south during winter. The only significant difference between the results is that dynamical downscaling pro- jects increased summer precipitation in the southwest, while the empirically downscaled scenario shows no significant change. For summer precipitation the present empirical models do not include any predictor carrying the 'climate change signal', and thus the results from the dynamical down- scaling are probably more realistic concerning summer precipitation.

TI  - Influence of tourism and traffic on the Eurasian lynx hunting activity and daily movements
PY  - 2012
AB  - Influence of tourism and traffic on the Eurasian lynx hunting activity and daily movements.— Human presence influences survival of large carnivores in several ways and even outdoor activities can be a source of disturbance. As ungulate prey provide the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) with food for several nights and the pattern of lynx activity is mainly shaped by searching for and consuming large prey, the need to move decreases strongly while the prey is eaten. However, during the day, human activity may drive lynx to move to safe shelters and habitat features such as dense vegetation may increase tolerance. In the Bohemian Forest (Czech Republic), we found 116 prey killed by five GPS–collared lynxes. We tested whether the kill sites were located farther from roads or tourist trails than a set of randomly generated locations and whether presence of roads or tourist trails and habitat structure influenced the distance 'kill site to daytime resting sites'. At night, with low human activity, lynxes did not avoid roads and even selected the surroundings of tourist trails. The distance 'kill site to daytime resting sites' correlated negatively with presence of habitat concealment and distance to tourist trails, suggesting that outdoor activities may have to be considered in lynx management plans.

TI  - Habitat variables associated with wolf (Canis lupus) distribution and abundance in northern Poland
PY  - 2004
AB  - Based on data collected during the National Wolf Census in 2000 ‐ 01, we analysed the main habitat factors influencing the distribution and abundance of the wolf, Canis lupus , in northern Poland. The study region forms the western border of the continuous Eastern European range of wolves, although attempts at westward dispersal have been observed. Using Geographic Information System techniques, we measured nine habitat variables and three parameters related to wolf occurrence in 134 circular sample plots (radius 7 km, area 154 km 2 each). We compared 72 plots where wolves were recorded and 62 plots with no signs of wolf presence. Wolf plots were characterized by significantly higher forest cover, less fragmentation of forests, lower density of villages, towns, motorways, and railways than wolf-free plots. We found a positive correlation between the sum of wolf observations in plots and forest cover. The number of domestic animals killed by wolves was higher in areas with higher indices of wolf abundance and lower forest area. In multiple regression analysis, four independent variables explained 59% of the variation in wolf distribution and abundance in northern Poland: straight-line distance to continuous range of wolves in Eastern Europe; forest cover; forest fragmentation; and length of major motorways. We conclude that protection of wolves in Poland (since 1998) may not be an adequate conservation measure, especially because of the increasing density of highways and express motorways. Existing forest corridors should be protected and new ones should be restored to ensure long-term conservation of wolves and allow range expansion into Western Europe.

TI  - Regional variability in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) riverscapes: a simple landscape ecology model explaining the large variability in size of salmon runs across Gaspé watersheds, Canada
PY  - 2010
AB  - Kim M, Lapointe M. Regional variability in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) riverscapes: a simple landscape ecology model explaining the large variability in size of salmon runs across Gaspe watersheds, Canada. Ecology of Freshwater Fish 2011: 20: 144–156. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S Abstract – Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) rivers in the Gaspe Peninsula, Quebec, present a 20 to 1 variability in the average numbers of returning adult salmon per km2 of watershed area (the ‘specific run size’). These variations are very poorly explained by interbasin differences in total stream length (R2 = 0.033, P = 0.533) or in estimates of total area of salmon habitat that fail to take into account complementarity and interconnections across life stage habitats (R2 = 0.065, P = 0.448). The relative spatial distribution of three complementary habitat types (adult holding pools, spawning beds, parr habitats) is hypothesised to be an important factor controlling the production of salmon at any given watershed area or given total stream length, and by extension the numbers of adults returning each year to spawn. We developed a simple riverine landscape ecology (or riverscape) model that uses easily accessible topographic map sources to identify optimally productive river segments. These segments were identified based on large-scale river and valley features and the associated spatial organisation of complementary salmon habitats. We tested the ability of this model to predict salmon run sizes for 14 watersheds in the Gaspe Peninsula. The aggregate length of optimally productive segments, as defined in our model, is a strong predictor of the average size of the annual salmon runs for these watersheds (R2 = 0.913, P < 0.0005). Furthermore, specific salmon run sizes were accurately predicted (R2 = 0.771, P < 0.0005) after removal of the obvious scale effects of watershed size.

TI  - The spatio-temporal distribution of wild and domestic ungulates modulates lynx kill rates in a multi-use landscape
PY  - 2013
AB  - Depredation on livestock and competition with hunters for game species are prominent among the conflicts that the return of large carnivores generates in multi-use landscapes. The relative magnitude of the conflict strongly depends on what prey selection patterns predators will adopt once established in a new area. We explored prey selection and kill rates from 24 Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx in Southern Norway, between 2006 and 2011, using Global Positioning System collars. We recorded 603 lynx predation events on a wide range of prey species, ranging from passerines to large ungulates. During summer, domestic sheep were the most frequent prey, representing 64% of the ungulates killed, for an average kill rate of 8.2/100 days, whereas roe deer Capreolus capreolus were killed in about 33% of cases (kill rate = 4.2/100 days). In winter, when sheep were unavailable, roe deer were the most frequent prey, accounting for about 73% of the kills, for an average kill rate of 9.4/100 days, whereas red deer were found at 17% of the kill sites, corresponding to a kill rate of 2.2/100 days. Lynx-killed prey provided an average of 400 kg of meat per 100 days, irrespective of prey density. In both seasons, the proportion of each species killed by lynx was determined by the combined effect of all prey densities, so that the density of wild ungulates had the potential to affect the rate of depredation on sheep, to the same extent as the abundance of sheep could influence the kill rate on wild ungulates. Our results underline the complexity of carnivore–ungulate trophic interactions in multi-use landscapes where livestock and wildlife co-occur, and suggest that changes in densities of prey, predators or both may produce undesired outcomes, if such complexity is not taken into account during the decision-making process for management and conservation.

TI  - Effects of life history variation on size and growth in stream‐dwelling Atlantic salmon
PY  - 2003
AB  - A large size variation amongst life histories for stream-dwelling Atlantic salmon Salmo salar was found and the relative effect of life histories on size varied over time. As early as December (age 0+ years), fish that later smolted at age 2+years were significantly larger than fish that did not smolt at age 2+ years. In contrast, there were no mass differences at age 0- years between fish that would mature or not at age 1+ years (October). The mass differences between smolts and non-smolts persisted until smolting, and differences between mature and immature fish first appeared in May (age 1 + years). Following September (age 1 + years), there was also a significant interaction between smolting and maturity. Previously mature and immature age 2+ year smolts were not significantly different in size, but immature age 2+ year non-smolts were much lighter than mature age 2+ year non-smolts. Based on mass differences, the apparent 'decision' to smolt occurred c. 5 months before (winter. age 0+ years) the decision to mature ( late spring, age 1 + years). In addition to strong seasonal growth variation, sizes of freshwater Atlantic salmon were largely structured by the complex interaction between smolt-age and maturity.

TI  - Creating new foraging opportunities for dark-bellied brent Branta bernicla and barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in spring insights from a large-scale experiment
PY  - 2003
AB  - The implementation of a new non-disturbance policy on Schiermonnikoog (Dutch Wadden Sea islands) provided an experiment to test ideas concerning the switch between habitats by spring-staging Dark-bellied Brent Geese Branta bernicla and Barnacle Geese B. leucopsis. In the experimental years (2000 and 2001) the farmers desisted from all scaring activities in the enclosed pasture area (290 ha) with grasslands intensively managed for dairy farms. The adjoining salt marsh (1635 ha) already was afforded complete protection, and traditionally provided the main goose feeding area in spring. A traditional habitat switch to the marsh coincides with the spring increase of forage production in the marsh habitat, suggesting that forage availability on the marsh is limiting in early spring. Compared to three control years (1997, 98 and 99 with scaring in the pastures) both species of geese extended their usage of the agricultural habitat in the two non-scaring years, where they remained until migratory departure (Apr for the Barnacle Geese, late May for the Dark-bellied Brent). Numbers of geese on the salt marsh did not change, hence non-disturbance triggered an increase of capacity for spring feeding geese at this staging site. The change was most dramatic for the Dark-bellied Brent Goose with a doubling of numbers on the island in the years without scaring, and identification of ringed individuals showed that the birds recruiting to this new spring tradition had in previous seasons utilised other sites in the Dutch Wadden Sea.

TI  - Spring staging in the Svalbard-breeding Pink-footed Goose Anser brachyrhynchus population: site-use changes caused by declining agricultural management?
PY  - 2010
AB  - This study used remote sensing data to assess changes in the extent of different habitats at spring staging sites for Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus in northern Norway over the years 1975–2005. Shifts in goose distribution were analysed in relation to the habitat changes. Abandonment of livestock grazing and mowing of pastures, which has led to re-growth of rough pasture and scrub, is considered to be a major reason for changes in Pink-footed Goose distribution along the flyway in recent decades. The study demonstrates that migrating geese may respond to habitat change by switching to sites where intensive agricultural management has been maintained.

TI  - Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L. and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.): a review of aspects of their life histories
PY  - 2003
AB  - Abstract – Among the species in the family Salmonidae, those represented by the genera Salmo, Salvelinus, and Oncorhynchus (subfamily Salmoninae) are the most studied. Here, various aspects of phenotypic and life-history variation of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., brown trout Salmo trutta L., and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) are reviewed. While many strategies and tactics are commonly used by these species, there are also differences in their ecology and population dynamics that result in a variety of interesting and diverse topics that are challenging for future research. Atlantic salmon display considerable phenotypic plasticity and variability in life-history characters ranging from fully freshwater resident forms, where females can mature at approximately 10 cm in length, to anadromous populations characterised by 3–5 sea-winter (5SW) salmon. Even within simple 1SW populations, 20 or more spawning life-history types can be identified. Juveniles in freshwater can use both fluvial and lacustrine habitats for rearing, and while most smolts migrate to sea during the spring, fall migrations occur in some populations. At sea, some salmon undertake extensive oceanic migrations while other populations stay within the geographical confines of areas such as the Baltic Sea. At the other extreme are those that reside in estuaries and return to freshwater to spawn after spending only a few months at sea. The review of information on the diversity of life-history forms is related to conservation aspects associated with Atlantic salmon populations and current trends in abundance and survival. Brown trout is indigenous to Europe, North Africa and western Asia, but was introduced into at least 24 countries outside Europe and now has a world-wide distribution. It exploits both fresh and salt waters for feeding and spawning (brackish), and populations are often partially migratory. One part of the population leaves and feeds elsewhere, while another part stays as residents. In large, complex systems, the species is polymorphic with different size morphs in the various parts of the habitat. Brown trout feed close to the surface and near shore, but large individuals may move far offshore. The species exhibits ontogenetic niche shifts partly related to size and partly to developmental rate. They switch when the amount of surplus energy available for growth becomes small with fast growers being younger and smaller fish than slow growers. Brown trout is an opportunistic carnivore, but individuals specialise at least temporarily on particular food items; insect larvae are important for the young in streams, while littoral epibenthos in lakes and fish are most important for large trout. The sexes differ in resource use and size. Females are more inclined than males to become migratory and feed in pelagic waters. Males exploit running water, near-shore and surface waters more than females. Therefore, females feed more on zooplankton and exhibit a more uniform phenotype than males. The Arctic charr is the northernmost freshwater fish on earth, with a circumpolar distribution in the Holarctic that matches the last glaciation. Recent mtDNA studies indicate that there are five phylogeographic lineages (Atlantic, Arctic, Bering, Siberian and Acadian) that may be of Pleistocene origin. Phenotypic expression and ecology are more variable in charr than in most fish. Weights at maturation range from 3 g to 12 kg. Population differences in morphology and coloration are large and can have some genetic basis. Charr live in streams, at sea and in all habitats of oligotrophic lakes, including very deep areas. Ontogenetic habitat shifts between lacustrine habitats are common. The charr feed on all major prey types of streams, lakes and near-shore marine habitats, but has high niche flexibility in competition. Cannibalism is expressed in several cases, and can be important for developing and maintaining bimodal size distributions. Anadromy is found in the northern part of its range and involves about 40, but sometimes more days in the sea. All charr overwinter in freshwater. Partial migration is common, but the degree of anadromy varies greatly among populations. The food at sea includes zooplankton and pelagic fish, but also epibenthos. Polymorphism and sympatric morphs are much studied. As a prominent fish of glaciated lakes, charr is an important species for studying ecological speciation by the combination of field studies and experiments, particularly in the fields of morphometric heterochrony and comparative behaviour.

TI  - Landscape context affects the success of habitat restoration: large‐scale colonization patterns of saproxylic and fire‐associated species in boreal forests
PY  - 2011
AB  - Aim Restoration of habitats may be used as a conservation tool when ecosystems have lost their natural structure, dynamics or functioning over large areas. Controlled and planned use of fire could be an effective way to restore habitats of many threatened species in boreal forests where fire suppression has been effective. We asked whether the large-scale landscape context affects the occurrence of rare and threatened species in forest habitats that have been burned to restore their fire-related structures. Location Boreal forests in southern Finland. Methods We designed a large-scale field experiment that included nine Pinus sylvestris forests (5–10 ha each) in southern Finland. Sites were located in two regions: (1) in eastern region with shorter management history and (2) in western region where intensive forestry has continued longer. We evaluated whether restoration of dead/burned wood is beneficial for rare and conservation-dependent species and measured the recovery of pyrophilous and red-listed insects (beetles and flatbugs) in burned forests, using standardized sampling effort. Altogether, 956 individuals of 29 red-listed and pyrophilous species were sampled. Results Rare species colonized areas quickly, but there was a clear difference in species richness between the regions. The eastern forests harboured higher species richness after restoration. In these sites, the average species richness was 13.7 species per site, whereas in western forests it was 5.0 species per site. Similar pattern was also observed in subgroups: the corresponding numbers for pyrophilous species were 9.7 vs. 3.8, for red-listed 8.7 vs. 2.3 and for red-listed pyrophiles 4.7 vs. 1.2. Main conclusions Introducing fire back to boreal forests can aid in the recovery of rare species, but the landscape context considerably affects the success of restoring species. If restored habitats are located in landscapes that have lost their natural properties long ago, the success of restoration seems to be more challenging than in landscapes where habitats have been modified more recently.

TI  - Forest fires in the Muddus National Park (northern Sweden) during the past 600 years
PY  - 1984
AB  - The occurrence of forest fires in the Muddus National Park (area, 50 000 ha), just north of the Arctic Circle in northern Sweden, was investigated on 75 separate sample plots. Between 1413 and the present, evidence of 47 fire years was obtained by dating the fire scars on living Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris), the oldest of which had germinated in 1274. The fire traces found on the sample plots were fire scars on living or dead trees or charcoal fragments in the humus layer. Plots lacking all traces of former forest fires were mainly those situated on sites surrounded by extensive mires. Forest fires were shown to have occurred in the five different types of forest investigated. The commonest frequencies of fires in the pine forests occurred with the interval 81–90 years, while the mean frequency was 110 years. The mean interval of time elapsed since the last forest fire occurred in the pine forests was 144 years. Some of the major fire years in the Muddus area coincide with forest fires in other parts of...

TI  - Invasion of Norway spruce diversifies the fire regime in boreal European forests.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Summary 1. Global wildfire activity and biomass burning have varied substantially during the Holocene in both time and space. At the regional to continental scale, macroclimate is considered to be the predominant control regulating wildfire activity. By contrast, the role of forest tree composition is often considered as a subsidiary factor in studies addressing temporal variation in regional wildfire activity. 2. Here, we assemble a spatially comprehensive data set of 75 macroscopic charcoal records that reflect local burning and forest landscapes that are spread over a substantial part of the European boreal forest, spanning both oceanic and continental climates. 3. We show that the late-Holocene invasion of Norway spruce Picea abies ,an ew forest dominant in northern Europe, significantly reduced wildfire activity, thus altering forest disturbance dynamics at a subcontinental scale. 4. Synthesis. Our findings show that a biotic change in the local forest ecosystem altered the fire regime largely independent of regional climate change, illustrating that forest composition is an important parameter that must be considered when modelling future fire risk and carbon dynamics in boreal forests.

TI  - The response of Anatidae to changes in agricultural practice : Long-term shifts in the carrying capacity of wintering waterfowl
PY  - 1996
AB  - Les oiseaux d'eau herbivores ont grandement profite des changements intervenus dans les pratiques agricoles. L'intensification de l'agriculture a conduit a une amelioration des aires d'alimentation hivernales. Dans les Pays-Bas, cette amelioration s'est traduite par une augmentation des effectifs de Il especes d'Anatidae herbivores sur les 17 presentes. Les effets se sont d'abord manifeste chez les especes de grande taille (annees 1950-1960), alors que les especes plus petites et plus selectives, n'ont reagi que dans un passe recent (1970-1980). L'amelioration notamment de la qualite des herbages (proteine brute, meilleure digestibilite, saison plus longue) a conduit a une augmentation des capacites d'accueil au profit des especes selectives qui se nourrissent specialement d'herbes gramineennes. Pour certaines especes (canard siffleur, Anas penelope), cette reaction se traduit par une distribution differente le long des voies migratoires, pour d'autres (oie cendre, Anser anser) par l'augmentation globale des populations. Nous discutons de la possibilite d'un renversement des tendances dans un futur proche suite a la diminution de l'emploi des engrais azotes, de l'abandon des herbages au profit de la culture du mais a ensilage et suite a la diminution du nombre des tetes de betail pâturant encore sur des herbages naturels. Ceci peut concerner notamment les especes de taille plus petite comme le canard siffleur et la bernache cravant, Branta bernicla, mais peut toucher egalement les especes de grande taille. Tout depend de l'importance du declin de la qualite de la nourriture. Comme, actuellement, les densites de ces especes sont tres fortes, il se peut qu'elles se distribuent d'elles-memes sur d'autres aires et cherchent a exploiter localement d'autres ressources trophiques de qualite comme les cereales d'hiver. Ainsi, les pres qui restent et qui sont intensivement exploites, de meme que les cultures de cereales d'hiver, attireront de plus en plus d'oiseaux d'eau, ce qui pourra generer des problemes de degâts aux cultures.

TI  - Age and growth patterns of old Norway spruce trees in Trillemarka forest, Norway
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Old trees represent key features of old-growth forests and are important elements for maintaining biodiversity. Due to extensive human exploitation of Fennoscandian boreal forests during several centuries, old Norway spruce trees have become exceedingly rare. We analysed 91 spruce trees in Trillemarka Nature Reserve, southern Norway, to investigate (1) the maximum age of living trees, (2) growth rates of different-age trees and (3) growth trends in very old trees. Increment cores were taken from trees in selected old-growth stands located at 700–850 m a.s.l. Twelve spruce trees had an estimated total age of >400 years, the oldest one being 529 years and presumably the oldest known still living Norway spruce in northern Europe. A negative relationship between growth rate (basal area increment) and total age was observed, being most distinct for growth rates at 126–275 years and less marked for early stage growth (26–75 years). Thus, high age apparently was related more to low growth rates at adult...

TI  - Wildfires in boreal ecoregions: Evaluating the power law assumption and intra‐annual and interannual variations
PY  - 2014
AB  - Wildfires are a major driver of ecosystem development and contributor to carbon emissions in boreal forests. We analyzed the contribution of fires of different fire size classes to the total burned area and suggest a novel fire characteristic, the characteristic fire size, i.e., the fire size class with the highest contribution to the burned area, its relation to bioclimatic conditions, and intra-annual and interannual variation. We used the Canadian National Fire Database (using data from 1960 to 2010) and a novel satellite-based burned area data set (2001 to 2011). We found that the fire size distribution is best explained by a normal distribution in log space in contrast to the power law-based linear fire area relationship which has prevailed in the literature so far. We attribute the difference to previous studies in the scale invariance mainly to the large extent of the investigated ecoregion as well as to unequal binning or limiting the range at which the relationship is analyzed; in this way we also question the generality of the scale invariance for ecoregions even outside the boreal domain. The characteristic fire sizes and the burned area show a weak correlation, indicating different mechanisms behind each feature. Fire sizes are found to depend markedly on the ecoregion and have increased over the last five decades for Canada in total, being most pronounced in the early season. In the late season fire size and area decreased, indicating an earlier start of the fire season.

TI  - Climate and wildfires in the North American boreal forest
PY  - 2007
AB  - <jats:p>The area burned in the North American boreal forest is controlled by the frequency of mid-tropospheric blocking highs that cause rapid fuel drying. Climate controls the area burned through changing the dynamics of large-scale teleconnection patterns (Pacific Decadal Oscillation/El Niño Southern Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation, PDO/ENSO and AO) that control the frequency of blocking highs over the continent at different time scales. Changes in these teleconnections may be caused by the current global warming. Thus, an increase in temperature alone need not be associated with an increase in area burned in the North American boreal forest. Since the end of the Little Ice Age, the climate has been unusually moist and variable: large fire years have occurred in unusual years, fire frequency has decreased and fire–climate relationships have occurred at interannual to decadal time scales. Prolonged and severe droughts were common in the past and were partly associated with changes in the PDO/ENSO system. Under these conditions, large fire years become common, fire frequency increases and fire–climate relationships occur at decadal to centennial time scales. A suggested return to the drier climate regimes of the past would imply major changes in the temporal dynamics of fire–climate relationships and in area burned, a reduction in the mean age of the forest, and changes in species composition of the North American boreal forest.</jats:p>

TI  - Future wildfire in circumboreal forests in relation to global warming
PY  - 1998
AB  - Despite increasing temperatures since the end of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1850), wildfire frequency has decreased as shown in many field studies from North America and Europe. We believe that global warming since 1850 may have trig- gered decreases in fire frequency in some regions and future warming may even lead to further decreases in fire frequency. Simulations of present and future fire regimes, using daily outputs from the General Circulation Model (GCM), were in good agreement with recent trends observed in fire history studies. Daily data, rather than monthly data, were used be- cause the weather and, consequently, fire behavior can change dramatically over time periods much shorter than a month. The simulation and fire history results suggest that the impact of global warming on northern forests through forest fires may not be disastrous and that, contrary to the expectation of an overall increase in forest fires, there may be large regions of the Northern Hemisphere with a reduced fire frequency.

TI  - Fossil fuels, employment, and support for climate policies
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract We know that the costs of implementing various climate change mitigation policies are not uniformly distributed across individuals in society, but we do not know to what extent this unequal cost distribution influences public support for these various policies. This study shows that cost distribution is an important explanation for variations in public support for various climate policies. Using individual-level data on industry of employment and support for a range of climate policies, we find that those employed in the fossil fuel industry are less likely to support climate policies that are particularly costly to their industry, but are as likely as everybody else to support policies with lower costs to the industry. This finding challenges the traditional bifurcation between climate change "skeptics" and "acceptors." Furthermore, we find that opposition to renewable energy by large fossil fuel producers and consumers, identified in the political economy literature, is not uniformly found among these companies’ employees. The most important implication of this study for policy makers is that support for climate policies is sensitive to the compensation of exposed groups and stimulation of alternative avenues for employment.

TI  - Reconciling global-model estimates and country reporting of anthropogenic forest CO2 sinks
PY  - 2018
AB  - Achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement requires forest-based mitigation. Collective progress towards this goal will be assessed by the Paris Agreement’s Global stocktake. At present, there is a discrepancy of about 4 GtCO2 yr−1 in global anthropogenic net land-use emissions between global models (reflected in IPCC assessment reports) and aggregated national GHG inventories (under the UNFCCC). We show that a substantial part of this discrepancy (about 3.2 GtCO2 yr−1) can be explained by conceptual differences in anthropogenic forest sink estimation, related to the representation of environmental change impacts and the areas considered as managed. For a more credible tracking of collective progress under the Global stocktake, these conceptual differences between models and inventories need to be reconciled. We implement a new method of disaggregation of global land model results that allows greater comparability with GHG inventories. This provides a deeper understanding of model–inventory differences, allowing more transparent analysis of forest-based mitigation and facilitating a more accurate Global stocktake. The model–inventory discrepancy in net land-use carbon emissions mainly results from conceptual differences in estimating anthropogenic forest sinks. A revised disaggregation of global land model results allows greater comparability with inventories.

TI  - Conflicted transitions: Exploring the actors, tactics, and outcomes of social opposition against energy infrastructure
PY  - 2022
AB  - Given the growing frequency, severity, and salience of social mobilization and community action on energy and climate issues, in this study we systematically explore the configurations of types of infrastructure, actors, tactics, and outcomes of recent opposition to energy transitions across seven carbon-intensive regions in Asia, Europe, and North America. Based on both a literature review and an original dataset of 130 case studies spanning the past decade, we track opposition to a wide range of energy infrastructure in these regions, including low-carbon options such as renewable energy and nuclear power; provide network analyses of the actors and coalitions involved in such events; and develop a typology and frequency analysis of tactics (such as litigation or protest), and outcomes (such as remuneration, policy change, concessions, or labor protections). We show that the politics of energy transitions in carbon-intensive regions varies significantly from country to country and across types of energy, and we discuss how the configurations of infrastructure, actors, tactics, and outcomes can be explained by differences in national institutions and their responses to global or supranational pressures. By bringing both a sociotechnical and comparative perspective to the global analysis of social movements and energy transitions, we suggest how goals of energy transition are refracted through national and subnational institutions and through local mobilizations both in support of and opposed to those transitions.

TI  - Relative Effect of Food Supplementation and Natural Resources on Female Red Deer Distribution in a Mediterranean Ecosystem
PY  - 2010
AB  - Supplementary feeding is a widespread game management practice in several red deer (Cervus elaphus) populations, with important potential consequences on the biology of this species. In Mediterranean ecosystems food supplementation occurs in the rutting period, when it may change mating system characteristics. We studied the role of food supplementation relative to natural resources in the spatial distribution, aggregation, and mean harem size of females in Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) during the rut. We studied 30 red deer populations of southwestern Spain, 63% of which experienced supplementary feeding. Using multivariate spatial analyses we found that food supplementation affected distribution of females in 95% of the populations in which it occurred. Green meadows present during the mating season acted as an important natural resource influencing female distribution. Additionally, the level of female aggregation and mean harem size were significantly higher in those populations in which food supplementation determined female distribution than in populations in which female distribution did not depend on supplementary feeding. Because female aggregation and mean harem size are key elements in sexual selection, supplementary feeding may constitute an important anthropogenic element with potential evolutionary implications for populations of Iberian red deer.

TI  - Ecosystem Services Provided by Birds
PY  - 2008
AB  - Ecosystem services are natural processes that benefit humans. Birds contribute the four types of services recognized by the UN Millennium Ecosystem Assessment-provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. In this review, we concentrate primarily on supporting services, and to a lesser extent, provisioning and regulating services. As members of ecosystems, birds play many roles, including as predators, pollinators, scavengers, seed dispersers, seed predators, and ecosystem engineers. These ecosystem services fall into two subcategories: those that arise via behavior (like consumption of agricultural pests) and those that arise via bird products (like nests and guano). Characteristics of most birds make them quite special from the perspective of ecosystem services. Because most birds fly, they can respond to irruptive or pulsed resources in ways generally not possible for other vertebrates. Migratory species link ecosystem processes and fluxes that are separated by great distances and times. Although the economic value to humans contributed by most, if not all, of the supporting services has yet to be quantified, we believe they are important to humans. Our goals for this review are 1) to lay the groundwork on these services to facilitate future efforts to estimate their economic value, 2) to highlight gaps in our knowledge, and 3) to point to future directions for additional research.

TI  - Modeling Soil Carbon Dynamics in Northern Forests: Effects of Spatial and Temporal Aggregation of Climatic Input Data
PY  - 2016
AB  - Boreal forests contain 30% of the global forest carbon with the majority residing in soils. While challenging to quantify, soil carbon changes comprise a significant, and potentially increasing, part of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Thus, their estimation is important when designing forest-based climate change mitigation strategies and soil carbon change estimates are required for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Organic matter decomposition varies with climate in complex nonlinear ways, rendering data aggregation nontrivial. Here, we explored the effects of temporal and spatial aggregation of climatic and litter input data on regional estimates of soil organic carbon stocks and changes for upland forests. We used the soil carbon and decomposition model Yasso07 with input from the Norwegian National Forest Inventory (11275 plots, 1960–2012). Estimates were produced at three spatial and three temporal scales. Results showed that a national level average soil carbon stock estimate varied by 10% depending on the applied spatial and temporal scale of aggregation. Higher stocks were found when applying plot-level input compared to country-level input and when long-term climate was used as compared to annual or 5-year mean values. A national level estimate for soil carbon change was similar across spatial scales, but was considerably (60–70%) lower when applying annual or 5-year mean climate compared to long-term mean climate reflecting the recent climatic changes in Norway. This was particularly evident for the forest-dominated districts in the southeastern and central parts of Norway and in the far north. We concluded that the sensitivity of model estimates to spatial aggregation will depend on the region of interest. Further, that using long-term climate averages during periods with strong climatic trends results in large differences in soil carbon estimates. The largest differences in this study were observed in central and northern regions with strongly increasing temperatures.

TI  - Temporal scales, trade-offs, and functional responses in red deer habitat selection
PY  - 2009
AB  - Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e.g., food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis. This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when availability was low and decreased with increasing availability. Moreover, we show for the first time that in the real world with forest habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to biodiversity from grazing.

TI  - Bark-stripping on Norway spruce by red deer in Sweden: level of damage and relation to tree characteristics
PY  - 2013
AB  - Abstract Red deer are increasing and spreading in Scandinavia. The species is capable of causing severe damage to Norway spruce through bark-stripping. We studied occurrence of bark-stripping on 18,000 trees in six study areas within two different regions in Sweden. The susceptibility for damage was related to morphological characters of the trees (bark thickness, branchiness, stem diameter) and whether the trees had old damage or not. In southernmost Sweden, 83, 89 and 92% of the stems were damaged in the three study areas, whereas 2, 8 and 46% was damaged in the three study areas in the region further north. Gnawing was the most common type of damage. Peeling was rare in the northern region but more frequent in the southern region. Bark-stripped trees had on average fewer branches, thinner bark and smaller diameter compared to undamaged trees. Furthermore, the risk of fresh damage was higher for already damaged trees in the northern region whereas the opposite pattern was evident in the southern region....

TI  - Has Danish agriculture maintained farmland bird populations
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1 Rapid agricultural change in western Europe has occurred in the last three decades, at cost to farmland biodiversity, particularly birds. This study reviewed agricultural change in Denmark from 1983 to 2001, to compare patterns of intensification and farmland bird abundance with the UK. 2 Changes in 26 agricultural variables summarized using principal components analysis (PCA) showed consistent changes throughout the period that were similar to the UK. Pig and sheep production, and the extent of winter cereals, rape and fodder maize, all increased. The area used to grow fodder beet and spring barley, the applications of agrochemicals and the numbers of cattle reared all declined. The greatest change in land area in Denmark was the switch from spring- to autumn-sown cereals in the 1980s, almost a decade later than in the UK. 3 PCA described changes in annual indices of bird abundance based on Danish point count surveys from 1983 to 2001, which were most marked during 1983–90, after which ordination values varied little despite continued agricultural change. Of 27 bird species associated with farmland habitat in Denmark, five declined, 10 showed stable trends and 12 increased, compared with 15, eight and four, respectively, among the same species in the UK. 4 Agricultural yields have been sustained or enhanced during the survey period, while most farmland bird species declining in the UK have remained stable or increased in Denmark. Of the five declining Danish species, only lapwing Vanellus vanellus and yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella are associated with predominantly farmland habitat. The timing of the declines suggests that the switch to autumn sowing in Denmark has had little effect on any species. 5 In contrast to the UK, pesticide and inorganic fertilizer use has declined and organic farming has expanded in Denmark since 1983, coinciding with the period of stability/increase in farmland bird abundance. It is not possible to establish any causality from this analysis. 6 The ability of species showing marked declines in Europe to maintain their number and distribution in the Danish landscape in the face of agricultural intensification gives some optimism for safeguarding farmland birds and biodiversity in the future. However, we need to understand the reasons behind contrasting population trends in Denmark and the UK. 7 Synthesis and applications. Marked differences between national patterns of agriculture and the contrasting nature of historical intensification offer the opportunity to contrast the effects of major changes in land-use practice on European farmland biodiversity. Appropriate comparative and individual studies of the effects of changes in specific agricultural management at greater spatial (i.e. supranational) scales are necessary in order to underpin the successful development of future European agricultural policies that will sustain and enhance agricultural yields whilst maintaining farmland biodiversity.

TI  - Knowledge-based management of protected areas and hydropower: the case of Norway
PY  - 2019
AB  - How has ecological knowledge been applied in Norwegian management of hydropower and protected areas? By recognizing a diversity of environmental ‘knowledges’ and science as potentially subordinated to political and economic interests, we explain the link between ecological knowledge and management by the state and scale of knowledge, political conflict and international commitments. The analysis is guided by case-study methodology. We find that ecological knowledge has had weak impact in the management reform of protected areas and been reduced as a decision-making premise in hydropower management. Differing combinations of case-specific factors have produced these outcomes. In the case of protected areas, ecological knowledge was suppressed mainly by opposing economic interests. The hydropower case showed how competing environmental knowledge and international commitments related to renewable energy and climate change overshadowed nature management concerns. These observations highlight the importance of differentiating between types of environmental knowledge and between knowledge and interests in the study of nature management.

TI  - Traditional land use of the boreal forest landscape: Examples from Lierne, Nord-Trøndelag, Norway
PY  - 2013
AB  - Nature conservation in Norway is based on the idea that wilderness and forest nature reserves should be left to develop naturally. Several studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally, outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing, grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the ‘man-influenced’ landscape in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However, these nature reserves are parts of a...

TI  - Connectivity and management enables fast recovery of plant diversity in new linear grassland elements
PY  - 2015
AB  - Questions How does small linear grassland elements (paddy levees and road verges) contribute to plant diversity patterns in sites with modern or traditional management? Which factors determine small-scale plant species richness of small linear grassland elements in a Japanese agricultural landscape? Location Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Methods Aerial photos from 1963, 1985, 1995 and 2008 were used to investigate landscape changes and to measure landscape structures within a typical agricultural landscape (~25 km2). Plant diversity was investigated in ten paddy levees and ten road verges in each of four traditional (barely any land cover alterations after 1963) and five modern (almost completely changed after 1985) sites. α-diversity (mean number of species per plot) and γ-diversity (total number of species) for all species, specialist and invasive species, respectively, were analysed in relation to site history types and landscape structures. Plot species richness was analysed in relation to site history type, patch age and width, proximity to forest and litter removal. Results In total, 204 plant species were found, 55 species unique to traditional sites and 13 unique to modern sites. α- and γ-diversity of paddy levees and road verges was significantly higher in traditional sites. Number of specialist species on paddy levees and number of invasive species in road verges was also higher in traditional sites. Age was the strongest predictor of plot species richness on levees; older levees supported higher species richness than younger ones. Litter removal was the strongest predictor (positive effect) of plot species richness in road verges. Conclusions These results suggest that the colonization credit of new levees in modern sites is decreasing quite rapidly as species quickly establish, approaching almost the same richness values as in traditional sites. However, long continuity of traditional management is still one of the most important contributors to plant diversity and crucial for many species. But small grassland elements can still be of great significance for preserving and enhancing plant diversity in otherwise depleted landscapes, as long as they are managed and connected throughout the landscape.

TI  - Hunting for fear: innovating management of human–wildlife conflicts
PY  - 2013
AB  - Summary 1. There is a growing theoretical basis for the role of predation risk as a driver of trophic interactions, conceptualized as the ‘ecology of fear’. However, current ungulate management ignores the role of nonlethal risk effects of predation. 2. We introduce the concept of ‘hunting for fear’ as an extension of the more classical ‘hunting to kill’ that is typically used in large herbivore management. Hunting for fear aims to induce a behavioural response in ungulates, for example, as a way of diverting them from areas where their impact is undesired. 3. Synthesis and applications. Hunting for fear asks for novel, potentially controversial, ways of hunting to induce strong enough risk effects, including more hunting on foot and with dogs, extended hunting seasons (ideally year-round) and increased hunting of calves. Hunting for fear may offer novel opportunities to help manage the growing human–wildlife conflicts that we experience globally.

TI  - Cascading Effects of Bird Functional Extinction Reduce Pollination and Plant Density
PY  - 2011
AB  - Reductions in bird numbers could hamper ecosystem services such as pollination, but experimental proof is lacking. We show that functional extinction of bird pollinators has reduced pollination, seed production, and plant density in the shrub Rhabdothamnus solandri (Gesneriaceae) on the North Island ("mainland") of New Zealand but not on three nearby island bird sanctuaries where birds remain abundant. Pollen limitation of fruit set is strong [pollen limitation index (PLI) = 0.69] and significant on the mainland but small (PLI = 0.15) and nonsignificant on islands. Seed production per flower on the mainland is reduced 84%. Mainland sites have similar adult densities, but 55% fewer juvenile plants per adult, than island sites. Seed addition experiments near adult R. solandri plants on the mainland found strong seed limitation 5 years after sowing for R. solandri but not for two other co-occurring woody species. This demonstrates a terrestrial trophic cascade.

TI  - Landscape perspectives on agricultural intensification and biodiversity – ecosystem service management
PY  - 2005
AB  - Understanding the negative and positive effects of agricultural land use for the conservation of biodiversity, and its relation to ecosystem services, needs a landscape perspective. Agriculture can contribute to the conservation of high-diversity systems, which may provide important ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control via complementarity and sampling effects. Land-use management is often focused on few species and local processes, but in dynamic, agricultural landscapes, only a diversity of insurance species may guarantee resilience (the capacity to reorganize after disturbance). Interacting species experience their surrounding landscape at different spatial scales, which influences trophic interactions. Structurally complex landscapes enhance local diversity in agroecosystems, which may compensate for local high-intensity management. Organisms with high-dispersal abilities appear to drive these biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services, because of their recolonization ability and larger resources experienced. Agri-environment schemes (incentives for farmers to benefit the environment) need to broaden their perspective and to take the different responses to schemes in simple (high impact) and complex (low impact) agricultural landscapes into account. In simple landscapes, local allocation of habitat is more important than in complex landscapes, which are in total at risk. However, little knowledge of the relative importance of local and landscape management for biodiversity and its relation to ecosystem services make reliable recommendations difficult.

TI  - A Review of Damage by Mammals in North Temperate Forests: 1. Deer
PY  - 1992
AB  - SUMMARY The causes of browsing, bark stripping, and fraying damage by deer are examined by reviewing the available literature. Trees species differ in vulnerability and each form of damage occurs within certain age and size classes. Stem morphology has an important influence on bark stripping; lower branches and bark thickening tend to deter stripping in any one species. Site related factors such as hiding cover, snow and soil fertility also influence damage. The data relating deer population density to damage are imprecise and there is a need for improved density estimation methods to demonstrate the benefit of culling in different habitats. Vegetation affects both habitat and diet selection in deer, and can create both positive and negative relationships with damage. Computer models are proposed as an aid to damage prediction and forest protection decision making.

TI  - Responses of grassland species richness to local and landscape factors depend on spatial scale and habitat specialization
PY  - 2011
AB  - Questions: To what extent is species richness in semi-natural grasslands related to local environmental factors and (present/past) surrounding landscape structure? Do responses of species richness depend on degree of habitat specialization (specialists vs generalists) and/or scale of the study? Location: Oland, Sweden. Methods: Richness of herbaceous vascular plants (subdivided into richness of grassland specialists and generalists) was recorded within 50 9 50 cm plots and 0.1–4.8 ha grassland polygons. Generalized linearmodels and hierarchical partitioning were used to identify local factors (habitat area and heterogeneity, grazing intensity, habitat continuity) and landscape factors (proportion of surrounding grassland in 2004, 1938 and 1800, and landscape diversity in 2004)associated with the richness estimates. Results: At the polygon scale, both specialist and generalist richness was positively associated with local habitat area and heterogeneity and, independently of area and heterogeneity, with grazing intensity, habitat continuity and amount of surrounding grassland in 1800. At the plot scale, specialist species richness was positively associated with habitat heterogeneity, amount of surrounding grassland in 2004 and landscape diversity. Plot-scale generalist richness was negatively associated with surrounding grassland in 1938 and positively associated with local grazing intensity. Conclusions: Because both habitat specialization and study scale influence conclusions about relationships between species richness and local and landscape factors, the study highlights the need to consider species diversity at multiple spatial scales when making decisions about grassland management. Large-scale(polygon) species richness is influenced by immigration processes, with both specialists and generalists accumulating in old grasslands over centuries of grazing management. Habitat heterogeneity increased specialist species richness at both scales, suggesting that management policies should favour maintenance of a heterogeneous mosaic of open areas, trees and shrubs in temperate grazed grasslands. Although grassland specialists are sensitive to grassland isolation, in extensively managed landscapes with high landscape diversity input of grassland species from the landscape matrix may buffer negative effects of habitat fragmentation on grassland communities.

TI  - The relationship between multi‐scale habitat heterogeneity and farmland bird abundance
PY  - 2011
AB  - It has recently been proposed that losses in farmland habitat heterogeneity may have been a primary driver of the profound declines exhibited by many farmland bird species in recent decades. However, it has yet to be demonstrated which facets of heterogeneity and what spatial scales are most important for birds. Here we analyse the relationship between abundance and features of landscape heterogeneity at three spatial scales (1, 9 and 25 km2) for 32 bird species commonly associated with farmland. Heterogeneity was quantified using three contrasting indices reflecting 1) the spatial mixing of land uses, 2) variation in field sizes and 3) the density of field boundaries. The spatial mixing of land-uses explained, on average, the most variation in, and was most likely to be positively associated with, abundance at all spatial scales. The majority of species (66–75%, depending on the spatial scale) were more common in heterogeneous landscapes overall; however, migrants, those under a high level of conservation concern and farmland specialist species tended to be less abundant in more heterogeneous landscapes at all scales. Ground-nesting species were also more likely to be found in more homogeneous habitats than non-ground-nesters, but only at the finest spatial scale. Relationships between abundance and heterogeneity were generally consistent across spatial scales; however, species of high conservation concern had more variable associations compared with other species. These results highlight a potential role for farmland habitat heterogeneity in determining the abundance of many farmland species but suggest that population responses to an increase in heterogeneity would not be unanimously positive and would probably have negative impacts on some species, notably those that are already threatened.

TI  - Established sectors expediting clean technology industries? The Norwegian oil and gas sector's influence on offshore wind power
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract The development and deployment of clean technologies must be accelerated to avoid a more than 2-degree warmer world. Redeployment of the vast resources concentrated in established sectors is one possible way to advance cleantech industries. However, prior research on sustainability transitions tends to emphasize competition and conflict between established sectors and cleantech industries. There is thus a need for exploring in more depth how established sectors may positively contribute to cleantech industries. Based on the notion of structural overlaps, we propose an extended version of the technological innovation systems framework to study how established sectors influence cleantech industries, and present new conceptual definitions and indicators. We apply the framework to a case study of the relationship between the oil and gas sector and the offshore wind power industry in Norway. Our empirical results show that the oil and gas sector has several positive influences on offshore wind power enabled by technological overlaps and diversifying firms. However, misaligned informal institutions weaken such influences, manifested as e.g. conflicting priorities and wavering commitment of diversified oil and gas firms to the new industry. We conclude by discussing the usefulness of the proposed framework and the relevance of our findings for policy and further research.

TI  - A century of National Forest Inventory in Norway - informing past, present, and future decisions.
PY  - 2020
AB  - In the early twentieth century, forestry was one of the most important sectors in Norway and an agitated discussion about the perceived decline of forest resources due to over-exploitation was ongoing. To base the discussion on facts, the young state of Norway established Landsskogtakseringen – the world’s first National Forest Inventory (NFI). Field work started in 1919 and was carried out by county. Trees were recorded on 10 m wide strips with 1–5 km interspaces. Site quality and land cover categories were recorded along each strip. Results for the first county were published in 1920, and by 1930 most forests below the coniferous tree line were inventoried. The 2nd to 5th inventories followed in the years 1937–1986. As of 1954, temporary sample plot clusters on a 3 km × 3 km grid were used as sampling units. The current NFI grid was implemented in the 6th NFI from 1986 to 1993, when permanent plots on a 3 km × 3 km grid were established below the coniferous tree line. As of the 7th inventory in 1994, the NFI is continuous, and 1/5 of the plots are measured annually. All trees with a diameter ≥ 5 cm are recorded on circular, 250 m2 plots. The NFI grid was expanded in 2005 to cover alpine regions with 3 km × 9 km and 9 km × 9 km grids. In 2012, the NFI grid within forest reserves was doubled along the cardinal directions. Clustered temporary plots are used periodically to facilitate county-level estimates. As of today, more than 120 variables are recorded in the NFI including bilberry cover, drainage status, deadwood, and forest health. Land-use changes are monitored and trees outside forests are recorded. Considerable research efforts towards the integration of remote sensing technologies enable the publication of the Norwegian Forest Resource Map since 2015, which is also used for small area estimation at the municipality level. On the analysis side, capacity and software for long term growth and yield prognosis are being developed. Furthermore, we foresee the inclusion of further variables for monitoring ecosystem services, and an increasing demand for mapped information. The relatively simple NFI design has proven to be a robust choice for satisfying steadily increasing information needs and concurrently providing consistent time series.

TI  - Behavioural Responses of GPS-Collared Female Red Deer Cervus elaphus to Driven Hunts
PY  - 2009
AB  - Precise knowledge of how game species react to different hunting practices is a prerequisite for sound management of intensively hunted populations. We compared behavioural and spatial behaviour of five GPS-collared female red deer Cervus elaphus in Denmark before, during and after exposure to 21 driven hunts (2–5 times each). In 53% of all hunts, deer left their normal home ranges within 24 hours, moving on average 4 km and remaining away for an average of six days. Compared to pre-hunt values, deer moved longer distances per unit time on the day of the hunt and during the following two nights. Diurnal activity (based on motion sensors) did not increase significantly on the hunting day, but was lower than normal the day after the hunt. Nocturnal activity was equal before and after hunts. Deer spent 96% of their time in (safer) forest habitats by day and 43% by night before and after hunts. No induced responses were conditional on distance to the hunters (0–1.5 km), hunt duration (1.3–6.4 hours) or the ti...

TI  - Avoidance of conflicts and trade‐offs: A challenge for the policy integration of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
PY  - 2019
AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda compels nations to face challenges, especially interministerial conflicts, in policy integration. This article seeks to understand whether and how conflict avoidance may hamper the implementation of the SDG agenda. Building on 56 interviews with policymakers and bureaucrats in Finland, Germany, and the Czech Republic, we explore how avoidance behaviours preclude the conflicts that are necessary for achieving integration. The findings suggest that avoided conflicts tend to be long‐standing issues related to environmental protection. We identify four factors that contribute to conflict avoidance: The issues for deliberation are too political, the actors know too little or too much about the issues, the deliberation is too abstract, and the bar for consensus is too high. These factors filter out many impactful conflicts for deliberation, which partly explains why integration regimes have not produced transformational changes.

TI  - Macroeconomic impact of stranded fossil fuel assets
PY  - 2018
AB  - Several major economies rely heavily on fossil fuel production and exports, yet current low-carbon technology diffusion, energy efficiency and climate policy may be substantially reducing global demand for fossil fuels1–4. This trend is inconsistent with observed investment in new fossil fuel ventures1,2, which could become stranded as a result. Here, we use an integrated global economy–environment simulation model to study the macroeconomic impact of stranded fossil fuel assets (SFFA). Our analysis suggests that part of the SFFA would occur as a result of an already ongoing technological trajectory, irrespective of whether or not new climate policies are adopted; the loss would be amplified if new climate policies to reach the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement are adopted and/or if low-cost producers (some OPEC countries) maintain their level of production (‘sell out’) despite declining demand; the magnitude of the loss from SFFA may amount to a discounted global wealth loss of US$1–4 trillion; and there are clear distributional impacts, with winners (for example, net importers such as China or the EU) and losers (for example, Russia, the United States or Canada, which could see their fossil fuel industries nearly shut down), although the two effects would largely offset each other at the level of aggregate global GDP.

TI  - Habitat connectivity and matrix restoration: the wider implications of agri-environment schemes
PY  - 2006
AB  - Summary 1 The spread and intensification of agriculture are recognized as two of the most important global threats to wildlife. There are clear links between agricultural change and declines in biodiversity across a wide range of agricultural systems, and convincing evidence that reversing these changes leads to a recovery in wildlife populations. 2 Nearly 4 billion euros are now paid annually through agri-environment schemes (AES) to farmers in Europe and North America to make environmental improvements to their land. Where appropriately designed and targeted, these schemes have proved successful in reversing declines in farmland wildlife populations. 3 We argue that insights gained from island biogeography and metapopulation theory, and from theoretical and empirical assessments of landscape connectivity suggest that AES may carry substantial wider benefits, which so far have not been considered in the design and deployment of such schemes. ‘Softening’ agricultural land could offset some of the negative impacts on biodiversity of the loss and fragmentation of non-agricultural habitats; could allow species to adapt to climate change; could slow the spread of alien and invasive species; and could contribute positively to the coherence of key biodiversity and protected area networks. Indeed, AES might represent the only viable way to counter these threats. 4 We outline a number of ways in which these wider benefits could be taken account of in the design of AES and suggest a number of characteristics of the species most likely to benefit from them. 5 Synthesis and applications. Agri-environment schemes might bring significant environmental benefits to habitats other than farmland by restoring the agricultural matrix that separates them. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that matrix restoration improves a number of ecosystem functions. Where they are available, AES might therefore represent a viable mechanism for addressing a range of pandemic environmental problems such as global climate change. Little consideration has so far been given to these wider conservation applications in the design, deployment and monitoring of AES.

TI  - Historical Cadastral Maps as a Tool for Valuation of Today’s Landscape Elements
PY  - 2003
AB  - Physical and biological traces of human activity in the landscape such as various stone structures, buildings, irrigation channels, semi-natural vegetation types and land use patterns can give us information about the past and particular historical periods. However, it can often be difficult to fix the exact age of such traces, and to evaluate their continuity, because fragments dating from different parts of a long history may be recovered alongside each other in today’s landscape. Historical cadastral maps may be very useful tool for evaluating such landscape elements. They can be used to distinguish between older and younger man made structures, and may thus tell us, which structures survived land consolidation, which structures were built later on, and which have been lost. Knowledge of the types and locations of previously existing structures may also help us to understand other traces in today’s landscape. An understanding of the history of the landscape gives us information on areas with a long continuity of land use and management. Historical materials and historical maps have therefore been used in a number of ecological and geographical studies (Foster 1992; Kienast 1993; Skanes 1996; Ihse & Blom 2000; Cousins 2001). In Sweden, Riddersporre (1995) described the old agricultural landscape from before the 17th century and Borgegard (1994) demonstrated how historical maps could be used in the reconstruction of an old agricultural landscape.

TI  - Heterogeneity as a measure of spatial pattern for monitoring agricultural landscapes
PY  - 2001
AB  - The Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes is a sample-based programme that aims to document the current state and patterns of change in the agricultural landscape for the entire country. For this broad geographical coverage an indicator approach is the most cost-effective methodology. Landscape metrics are used as indicators in the monitoring programme based on the assumed importance of landscape composition and spatial pattern for a number of countryside interests. However, although indicators have been used successfully over a long period of time in various disciplines, their use in landscape monitoring is relatively new and there is little empirical data with which to assess their validity. This paper provides information on the performance of landscape diversity and landscape heterogeneity indices as estimated by specific biodiversity measures. Preliminary results show increasing numbers of breeding bird species and numbers of vascular plant species with increasing landscape diver...

TI  - Effects of the proportion and spatial arrangement of un‐cropped land on breeding bird abundance in arable rotations
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary 1. The response of bird abundance to the proportional availability of un-cropped land (i.e. land that could be cultivated, such as fallows, grass–flower or wild bird areas) is under-studied but of considerable significance for managing declining populations on farmland in western Europe. 2. In this study, bird abundance was examined at a scale consistent with many national monitoring schemes. Birds were counted on 28 farm sites of c. 100 ha, representing cereal-based and organic rotations. Sites were surveyed in summer, from 2007 to 2010, to assess the effect of the percentage cover and spatial arrangement of un-cropped land on bird abundance, with data analysed at the whole-farm (not patch) scale. 3. Un-cropped land area had significant effects on the abundance of key species (those with a high dependency on farmland) when controlling for effects of semi-natural habitats and management. On farms with 10% area of un-cropped land. 4. Positive, significant effects of the percentage area of un-cropped land were detected for lapwing, skylark, linnet and yellowhammer and for all highly farmland-dependent species combined. The relationship between un-cropped land and bird abundance was stronger on conventional compared with organic farms, suggesting a greater importance of un-cropped land on conventional farms. 5. Un-cropped land patch arrangement was significant for skylark and linnet abundance but generally weak amongst species compared with the availability of un-cropped land. Skylarks were positively associated with a larger relative edge effect amongst patches, whereas linnets were more associated with larger blocks of contiguous habitat. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study provides important evidence for a proportionate effect of habitat provision on farmland bird abundance. The relative area of un-cropped land had the strongest effect on bird abundance. Sites with <3% (and, to a lesser extent, <5%) un-cropped land were highly under-populated. A two-fold increase in the area of un-cropped land was associated with an average 16–53% increase in the relative abundance of key species, which has implications for the contribution of un-cropped areas towards population stabilization amongst farmland birds in Europe.

TI  - Natural forest regrowth as a proxy variable for agricultural land abandonment in the Swiss mountains: a spatial statistical model based on geophysical and socio-economic variables
PY  - 2007
AB  - In many European mountain regions, natural forest regrowth on abandoned agricultural land and the related consequences for the environment are issues of increasing concern. We developed a spatial statistical model based on multiple geophysical and socio-economic variables to investigate the pattern of natural forest regrowth in the Swiss mountain area between the 1980s and 1990s. Results show that forest regrowth occurred primarily in areas with low temperature sum, intermediate steepness and soil stoniness as well as close to forest edges and relatively close to roads. Model results suggest that regions with weak labor markets are favored in terms of land abandonment and forest regrowth. We could not find an effect of population change on land abandonment and forest regrowth. Therefore, we conclude that decision makers should consider non-linearities in the pattern of forest regrowth and the fact that labor markets have an effect on land abandonment and forest regrowth when designing measures to prevent agricultural land abandonment and natural forest regrowth in the Swiss mountains.

TI  - Arctic petroleum’s community impacts: Local perceptions from Hammerfest, Norway
PY  - 2016
AB  - This article examines perceptions of petroleum developments in the Norwegian Arctic town of Hammerfest, especially in the context of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Based on eighteen semi-structured interviews conducted in Hammerfest, the perceived effects of petroleum developments are identified and discussed. Local support for petroleum activity is high, particularly given the upsurge in job opportunities and economic ripple effects, both of which are considered essential to the community's survival. Environmental concerns and opposition to oil and gas are largely ascribed to external forces and do not feature as much in the locals’ perceptions. While CSR is not part of the interviewees' vocabulary, the local population has clear expectations and views about petroleum companies' responsibilities to their community. In order to grasp the full picture of the Arctic petroleum debate, it is important to acknowledge that expectations, desires, and reality on the ground will sometimes diverge strongly from non-local considerations.

TI  - Multiple habitat associations: the role of offsite habitat in determining onsite avian density and species richness
PY  - 2012
AB  - Many animal populations continue to decline despite occurring in protected areas or on sympathetically managed sites. Frequently, this is because a specific habitat patch may not fulfil all the niche requirements of a threatened species. For instance, species often move between, and make use of, multiple habitat types for breeding, roosting and feeding within the same landscape. These cross-habitat interactions present a challenge for conservation. Here we quantify how the habitat associations of individual species and assemblages occurring within two distinct but adjacent habitat types (moorland and farmland) determine a suite of density and richness indicators, using the bird community of the English uplands as a case study. There was a clear association between onsite avian density and richness and offsite habitat structure (e.g. vegetation height, percent cover of dominant plant species, land management practices). Although such effects are not universal across all species and assemblages, where present (for five farmland and three moorland indicators) the increase in explanatory power offered by including offsite habitat structure can be large. By constructing scenarios of possible changes to management practice on both moorland and farmland, we demonstrate a real conservation benefit can be obtained by altering management in offsite habitats. For example, reducing burning intensity on moorland can result in a five-fold increase in snipe Gallinago gallinago density on farmland, without an alteration in farmland habitat. For one species (Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata), we demonstrate the frequency with which birds move between and utilise farmland and moorland during the breeding season, and therefore the importance of both habitat types to maintaining population densities. The multiple habitat dependency phenomenon quantified here is common and not restricted to birds. The successful conservation of many threatened species will thus depend on coordinated cross-habitat management.

TI  - Effects of habitat cover, landscape structure and spatial variables on the abundance of birds in an agricultural–forest mosaic
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1 Numerical studies of the relationship between birds and their habitat are important because they provide understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on avian diversity. However, collinearity between explanatory variables and spatial autocorrelation can hamper the detection of key environmental factors underlying bird–environment relationships identified by traditional regression approaches. This study utilized two alternative statistical methods to address these difficulties in biodiversity modelling. 2 We examined bird abundance patterns, spatial structure and relationship to environmental factors in an agricultural–forest mosaic landscape in Finland. We used data from 105 grid squares each 25 ha in size. Using variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning methods, we determined the independent and joint effects of habitat cover, landscape structure and spatial variables on the total number of bird pairs and that of agricultural bird pairs. 3 The explanatory variables highlighted as important predictors of bird patterns by the two methods generally coincided well. The total number of bird pairs was negatively related to agricultural land, and positively to cover of forests and landscape heterogeneity. However, a clear majority of the explained variation in bird patterns was related to the joint effect of predictors, and the independent contributions of predictors were small. The univariate importance of landscape heterogeneity decreased greatly if the habitat cover variables were considered simultaneously. 4 Most of the explained variation in the number of agricultural bird pairs was related to the joint effects of the explanatory variables. In addition, the independent effect of habitat cover variables was considerable and agricultural birds showed a positive relationship with semi-natural grasslands. 5 Synthesis and applications. Variation partitioning and hierarchical partitioning approaches provide deeper insights into bird–environment relationships than traditional regression methods. This is particularly so when they are employed in a complementary manner. Our results indicate that a major part of the spatial structure in bird patterns in agricultural–forest mosaics can be caused by the clumping of habitats either preferred or avoided by birds. Moreover, at a scale of 25 ha, the abundance of bird pairs is not necessarily related to landscape heterogeneity as such, but depends more on the distribution of the most important habitats for birds.

TI  - Loss of plant species richness and habitat connectivity in grasslands associated with agricultural change in Finland.
PY  - 2003
AB  - The drastic loss of seminatural grasslands and the decrease in species diversity in Europe during the 20th century are closely linked to social-economic factors. Development in agricultural production drives land-use changes, and thus controls the capacity of landscapes to maintain biodiversity. In this study, we link agricultural production changes to landscape fragmentation and species diversity. Our results show that the termination of grazing on seminatural grassland caused significant changes in landscape structure and a decline in the number of vascular plant species. The decline of grazed grasslands has been driven mainly by farm-level economic efficiency and profitability interests, which have been connected with agricultural policy measures. Since 1995, when Finland joined the European Union, the area of grazed patches in our study area has again increased as a result of a support scheme for the management of seminatural grasslands.

TI  - The reconstruction of past patterns of tilled fields from historical cadastral maps using GIS
PY  - 2007
AB  - Abstract Information derived from a historical infield cadastral map dated 1874 and its written protocol was combined with data on four landscape characteristics (distance to the hamlet, 1 slope, folded aspect and quaternary geology) in a GIS-based 3D model in an attempt to develop a methodology for reconstructing earlier tilled field patterns. The study area was the farm of Grinde in Western Norway. The areas that the farmers themselves considered to be best for growing crops in 1874 sloped gently, faced south-west, were close to the hamlet and were on glacio-fluvial deposits or a thick layer of moraine. More than 80% of the fields expected to be the oldest appeared to be correctly identified. This pilot study shows that it is possible to identify the probable location of the oldest tilled fields both on maps and in the terrain, using land consolidation documents or other data on crop sowing and yields from historical sources even where no land consolidation documents are available. The method may be hel...

TI  - The political economy of the ‘just transition’
PY  - 2013
AB  - This paper explores the political economy of the ‘just transition’ to a low carbon economy. The idea of a ‘just transition’ increasingly features in policy and political discourse and appeals to the need to ensure that efforts to steer society towards a lower carbon future are underpinned by attention to issues of equity and justice: to those currently without access to reliable energy supplies and living in energy poverty and to those whose livelihoods are affected by and dependent on a fossil fuel economy. To complicate things further this transition has to be made compatible with the pursuit of ‘climate justice’ to current and future generations exposed to the social and ecological disruptions produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Here we seek to identify and analyse the immensely difficult political trade-offs that will characterise collective attempts to enact and realise a just transition. We explore procedural and distributional aspects of energy politics and practice in particular as they relate to the just transition: energy access for those who do not have it; justice for those who work within and are affected by the fossil fuel economy; and attempts to manage the potential contradictions that might flow from pursuing energy and climate justice simultaneously.

PY  - 2011
AB  - Across Europe, ungulate numbers have greatly increased over the past decades, leading to increasing concerns about the ecological and economical impacts and pleas for stronger population control. However, focussing on population control only ignores other underlying factors which may enhance the wildlife–forestry conflict. I reviewed factors which shape herbivore top-down effects in natural temperate forest systems aiming at understanding how these interactions are altered in managed forests. Carnivores are important in modifying ungulate–plant interactions. They can directly influence the numbers of ungulates, but this effect is dependent on productivity and predicted to be smallest in highly productive temperate forest. Indirectly, they modify herbivore top-down effects by creating a landscape of fear. Despite the abundance of knowledge from American systems, there is a lack of knowledge on how this process might work in European systems. Next to carnivores, abiotic conditions interact with herbivory by influencing forage quality and availability. Forest gaps lead to concentration of ungulates and their effects, due to increased forage supply. Abiotic conditions also influence the response of plants following herbivory, which can be tolerated by showing increased regrowth or resistance due to chemical or physical defence. In typical managed forest systems, carnivores and abiotic conditions which shape ungulate top-down effects in natural forests are altered or absent. Human hunting might replace the direct effects of carnivores, but does not replace their indirect effects. Forestry practices also have modified herbivore–plant interactions in several ways, creating a forest with lower ungulate carrying capacity and higher sensitivity for ungulate browsing. These changes logically increase the strength of herbivore top-down effects in managed forests and increase the wildlife–forestry conflict. To reduce this conflict, aiming only at reducing wildlife numbers is predicted to have little effects when they do not coincide with habitat ameliorations. Forestry practices may therefore greatly enhance the conflict that exists between wildlife and forestry but can also be an important tool to reduce this conflict by adapting management practices that allow more natural functioning of forests systems.

TI  - Global carbon budget 2013
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates, consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel combustion and cement production (EFF) are based on energy statistics, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated for the first time in this budget with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models forced by observed climate, CO2 and land cover change (some including nitrogen–carbon interactions). All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (2003–2012), EFF was 8.6 ± 0.4 GtC yr−1, ELUC 0.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, GATM 4.3 ± 0.1 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN 2.5 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and SLAND 2.8 ± 0.8 GtC yr−1. For year 2012 alone, EFF grew to 9.7 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, 2.2% above 2011, reflecting a continued growing trend in these emissions, GATM was 5.1 ± 0.2 GtC yr−1, SOCEAN was 2.9 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1, and assuming an ELUC of 1.0 ± 0.5 GtC yr−1 (based on the 2001–2010 average), SLAND was 2.7 ± 0.9 GtC yr−1. GATM was high in 2012 compared to the 2003–2012 average, almost entirely reflecting the high EFF. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 392.52 ± 0.10 ppm averaged over 2012. We estimate that EFF will increase by 2.1% (1.1–3.1%) to 9.9 ± 0.5 GtC in 2013, 61% above emissions in 1990, based on projections of world gross domestic product and recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy. With this projection, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach about 535 ± 55 GtC for 1870–2013, about 70% from EFF (390 ± 20 GtC) and 30% from ELUC (145 ± 50 GtC). This paper also documents any changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget from previous budgets (Le Quere et al., 2013). All observations presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center ( doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP_2013_V2.3 ).

TI  - Deep transitions: Emergence, acceleration, stabilization and directionality
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Industrial society has not only led to high levels of wealth and welfare in the Western world, but also to increasing global ecological degradation and social inequality. The socio-technical systems that underlay contemporary societies have substantially contributed to these outcomes. This paper proposes that these socio-technical systems are an expression of a limited number of meta-rules that, for the past 250 years, have driven innovation and hence system evolution in a particular direction, thereby constituting the First Deep Transition. Meeting the cumulative social and ecological consequences of the overall direction of the First Deep Transition would require a radical change, not only in socio-technical systems but also in the meta-rules driving their evolution – the Second Deep Transition. This paper develops a new theoretical framework that aims to explain the emergence, acceleration, stabilization and directionality of Deep Transitions. It does so through the synthesis of two literatures that have attempted to explain large-scale and long-term socio-technical change: the Multi-level Perspective (MLP) on socio-technical transitions, and Techno-economic Paradigm (TEP) framework.

TI  - Riparian vegetation has disproportionate benefits for landscape-scale conservation of woodland birds in highly modified environments
PY  - 2014
AB  - Summary Identifying landscape patterns that allow native fauna to coexist with human land use is a global challenge. Riparian vegetation often persists in anthropogenic environments as strips of natural or semi-natural vegetation that provide habitat for many terrestrial species. Its relative contribution to landscape-scale conservation is likely to change as environments become increasingly modified. We used a ‘whole of landscape’ approach to test the hypothesis that riparian vegetation offers disproportionate benefits, relative to non-riparian vegetation, for the conservation of woodland birds in highly modified agricultural landscapes. We selected 24 landscapes, each 100 km2, along a gradient of landscape change represented by decreasing cover of native vegetation (from 60% to <2%), in an agricultural region in SE Australia. Bird species were systematically surveyed at three riparian and seven non-riparian sites in wooded vegetation in each landscape. Riparian sites supported a greater richness of woodland-dependent species, a group of conservation concern, than did non-riparian sites. The composition of assemblages also differed between site types. At the landscape scale, the pooled richness of bird assemblages at riparian and non-riparian sites, respectively, decreased with overall loss of tree cover despite constant sampling effort. Within landscapes, the β-diversity of woodland species among non-riparian sites increased (composition became less similar) as landscape tree cover declined. In contrast, riparian assemblages were relatively stable with no change in β-diversity. Importantly, as landscape tree cover declined, the proportion of woodland species uniquely present at riparian sites increased and made a greater contribution to overall landscape diversity. Synthesis and applications. Landscape-scale richness of woodland species declines as landscape tree cover is lost. In highly depleted landscapes, riparian vegetation retains a relatively rich, stable assemblage compared with that in heterogeneous remnants of non-riparian vegetation and consequently contributes disproportionately to landscape-scale diversity. These observations, together with the diverse benefits of riparian vegetation for aquatic ecosystems, mean that protection and restoration of riparian vegetation is a high priority in anthropogenic environments. Importantly, such actions are directly amenable to individual land managers, and the benefits will accumulate to enhance the persistence and conservation of species at landscape and regional scales.

TI  - The importance of arable habitat for farmland birds in grassland landscapes
PY  - 2001
AB  - Summary 1 Over the last 25 years, populations of seed-eating birds have declined severely over most of western Europe. Local extinctions have occurred in grassland-dominated areas in western Britain, which may be influenced by loss in habitat diversity and a decline in the amount of arable cultivation. 2 We used the large-scale British Breeding Bird Survey of 1998 to investigate the importance of arable habitat within grassland landscapes for 11 common seed-eating birds and four similar sized insectivores. Generalized linear models were used to model the number of birds recorded in agricultural habitat within survey squares as a function of the amount of arable habitat present. 3 Numbers of grey partridge Perdix perdix, skylark Alauda arvensis, tree sparrow Passer montanus, corn Miliaria calandra and reed buntings Emberiza schoeniclus, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and whitethroat Sylvia communis increased with the amount of arable habitat present in a survey square; the numbers of house sparrow Passer domesticus, four finch species, dunnock Prunella modularis, robin Erithacus rubecula and blackcap Sylvia atricapilla did not. 4 The positive association between numbers of some species and arable habitat within 1-km squares was strongest where arable habitat was rare in the surrounding area, and weakest or even reversed when arable habitat was common. These results demonstrate the scale-dependence of bird–habitat associations in agricultural landscapes, only demonstrable where data are available at fine grain over large geographical areas. 5 These results support the hypothesis that range contractions (i.e. local extinctions) of some granivorous species have occurred because of contraction in arable cultivation. The loss of arable habitat where it is scarce may be causing declines in some areas, even though intensification of arable management is thought to be the main cause of declines elsewhere. Agri-environment schemes may need to vary between regions, for example to encourage arable cultivation in pastoral areas.

TI  - The Use of Push-Pull Strategies in Integrated Pest Management
PY  - 2007
AB  - Push-pull strategies involve the behavioral manipulation of insect pests and their natural enemies via the integration of stimuli that act to make the protected resource unattractive or unsuitable to the pests (push) while luring them toward an attractive source (pull) from where the pests are subsequently removed. The push and pull components are generally nontoxic. Therefore, the strategies are usually integrated with methods for population reduction, preferably biological control. Push-pull strategies maximize efficacy of behavior-manipulating stimuli through the additive and synergistic effects of integrating their use. By orchestrating a predictable distribution of pests, efficiency of population-reducing components can also be increased. The strategy is a useful tool for integrated pest management programs reducing pesticide input. We describe the principles of the strategy, list the potential components, and present case studies reviewing work on the development and use of push-pull strategies in each of the major areas of pest control.

TI  - Imagining energy futures: Sociotechnical imaginaries of the future Smart Grid in Norway
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract A future “Smart Grid” is increasingly being embraced in energy policies as a promising energy scenario for the future, with the introduction of “smart” electricity meters being seen as the first step. In Norway, this process is happening without much public debate. Discussions of complexity and uncertainty related to the future Smart Grid are mainly taking place within a network of actors with recognized expertise. Based on empirical data from interviews and documentary analysis, this paper describes sociotechnical energy imaginaries of a future Smart Grid in a Norwegian context from within this network of experts, which is conceptualized as a techno-epistemic network. The future imaginaries of smart meters and a future Smart Grid are mainly technological and economical, and they are partly permeated by national imaginations. They connect the past and the future by providing solutions for current challenges in the energy supply system, which reflect current institutional and technological structures. The imaginaries also include constructions of the public, or “consumers”, which has implications for the communication to the public. The paper suggests that increased openness and the inclusion of multiple perspectives and ways of knowing, inspired by post-normal science, could facilitate more careful consideration of potential social implications.

TI  - Herbivore avoidance by association: vole and hare utilization of woody plants
PY  - 1993
AB  - The probability that an individual plant will be attacked by a herbivore depends not only on the characteristics of the individual plant, but also on the quality and abundance of its neighbours. However, plants have been reported to receive protection from herbivory both when associated with plants of higher and lower palatability (the attractant-decoy and repellent-plant hypotheses, respectively), and there are no mechanistic explanation for these different outcomes of plant spatial association. We used patch-use theory (marginal-value theorem) to predict under which circumstances we should expect plants to gain protection from herbivory due to association with other plants

TI  - Contrasting patterns of change in the distribution and abundance of farmland birds in relation to farming system in lowland Britain
PY  - 2001
AB  - Patterns of change in distribution (presence/ absence) and abundance since the late 1960s were examined in 20 species of farmland bird in southern Britain in predominantly arable (eastern), predominantly mixed (central) and predominantly grassland (western) regions. Comparisons were made between changes in distribution and in abundance to determine whether these measures show similar relationships to environmental change. Local extinctions of selected species and reductions in species richness were significantly greater in the predominantly grassland region. Decreases in abundance were greatest in seven species in the predominantly arable region, two in the mixed region and nine in the grassland region. Changes in distribution and abundance showed consistent patterns in three species, turtle dove Streptopelia turtur L., yellow wagtail Motacilla flava L. and reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus L. In another four species, grey partridge Perdix perdix L., lapwing Vanellus vanellus L., tree sparrow Passer montanus L. and corn bunting Miliaria calandra L., decreases in abundance were greatest in the arable region, yet declines in distribution were lowest. For other individual species, changes in distribution were too small to draw any conclusions in relation to farm type. We suggest that modern grassland systems are suboptimal habitats compared to arable or mixed agricultural land for many farmland species that occur at relatively low density in the more western, grass-dominated region. Declines in abundance are therefore more likely to lead to local extinction in these areas than in eastern areas where abundance is higher. However, the role of changes in grassland management on bird populations requires further research. It is suggested that conclusions drawn from changes in distribution alone, in the absence of supporting data on changes in abundance, may be misleading where the aim is to assess how large-scale spatial dynamics of populations relate to environmental change.

TI  - Windmill Noise Annoyance, Visual Aesthetics, and Attitudes towards Renewable Energy Sources
PY  - 2016
AB  - A small focused socio-acoustic after-study of annoyance from a windmill park was undertaken after local health officials demanded a health impact study to look into neighborhood complaints. The windmill park consists of 31 turbines and is located in the South of Norway where it affects 179 dwellings. Simple exposure-effect relationships indicate stronger reactions to windmills and wind turbine noise than shown internationally, with the caveat that the sample size is small (n = 90) and responses are colored by the existing local conflict. Pulsating swishing sounds and turbine engine hum are the main causes of noise annoyance. About 60 per cent of those who participated in the survey were of the opinion that windmills degrade the landscape aesthetically, and were far from convinced that land-based windmills are desirable as a renewable energy source (hydropower is an important alternative source of renewables in Norway). Attitudes play an important role in addition to visual aesthetics in determining the acceptance of windmills and the resulting noise annoyance. To compare results from different wind turbine noise studies it seems necessary to assess the impact of important modifying factors.

TI  - The green flings: Norwegian oil and gas industry’s engagement in offshore wind power
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Reorientation of fossil fuel industries towards renewable energy, and the role of changes in organizational environment underlying such processes, have not featured strongly in the study of sustainable energy transitions. We contribute to this important policy issue with a case study of the Norwegian oil and gas industry and its engagement in offshore wind power. We study how the engagement has changed during the period 2007–2016, and whether these changes correspond with developments in the industry’s task and institutional environments. Our study reveals that despite relatively stable institutional environment and continuous growth in offshore wind market over the last decade, the oil and gas industry’s engagement has fluctuated over time. These fluctuations – green flings – took place during two market downturns in the oil and gas market, while during an oil and gas boom the industry reoriented back to this core market. Our results draw attention to the potential importance of market changes for reorientation of fossil fuel industries towards renewable energy. We conclude by discussing the implications of our study for policies seeking to support sustainable energy transitions.

TI  - Systematic Assessment of Maps as Source Information in Landscape-change Research
PY  - 2002
AB  - A methodology is proposed for systematic map assessment to contribute to landscape-change research. Two major topic areas are dealt with, namely: content, quality and usefulness of landscape information on different maps; and methods used in the spatial conversion of maps into digital systems (e.g. geographical information systems). The major focus is on information about physical landscape characteristics (e.g. land cover) and land uses. The approach was tested using a sequence of nine large- and medium-scale basic maps of the island of Ruissalo in SW Finland from between 1690 and 1998. Fundamental differences were found in the thematic consistency of landscape information, mainly related to the scale, purpose and generalization of landscape information on different maps. Spatial matching was tested for a set of three old maps using four image rectification functions. The results showed that spatial matching of old maps is difficult, and success in rectification is influenced by many factors. Evaluation ...

TI  - National identities, international roles, and the legitimation of climate leadership: Germany and Norway compared
PY  - 2015
AB  - The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) confers an obligation on developed states to lead in mitigation. This obligation challenges traditional conceptions of the modern state by calling forth a more outward looking state that is able to serve both the national and international communities in the service of global climate protection. Yet, the more skeptical theories of the ecological state suggest that climate leaders will only emerge if they can connect their climate strategy to the traditional state imperatives of economic growth or national security. How the governments of Germany and Norway, both relative climate leaders with ongoing fossil-fuel dependencies, have legitimated their climate policies and diplomacy is examined through a comparative discourse analysis. While both governments rely heavily on discourses of Green growth, they also construct national identities and international role conceptions that serve purposes beyond themselves.

TI  - Policyscape—A Spatially Explicit Evaluation of Voluntary Conservation in a Policy Mix for Biodiversity Conservation in Norway
PY  - 2013
AB  - We use spatially explicit indicators for biodiversity conservation status and opportunity costs of conservation to evaluate the role of voluntary forest conservation in a mix of policy instruments distributed across a landscape. We define a spatially explicit evaluation of a policy mix as a “policyscape analysis.” A policyscape analysis includes a comparison of (1) actual spatial overlap of instruments, (2) “functional overlap” of instruments in a cost-effectiveness space, and (3) complementary spatial targeting of instruments as computed by reserve site selection models. To illustrate, we evaluate the actual spatial coverage in cost-effectiveness space of Norway's public protected areas and private voluntary forest conservation. We use proxies for conservation value and opportunity cost—a national Nature Index for forests and forest productivity classes. We conclude by discussing the empirical challenges of our “policyscape analysis.” These have bearing on future “return-on-investment” analysis and reser...

TI  - Habitat associations and breeding success of yellowhammers on lowland farmland.
PY  - 2000
AB  - 1. Yellowhammers began to decline on British lowland farmland in the late 1980s and losses are presently 10% per year. This study examined variation in the habitat selection and breeding success of yellowhammers, allowing an evaluation of whether Britain's yellowhammer decline might have been caused by recent changes in agriculture. 2. Yellowhammer territories were associated with hedgerows, vegetated ditches and wide uncultivated grassy margins around fields. Pasture and silage leys were avoided. Nests were built among herbaceous vegetation in ditches or in the shrubby vegetation of hedgerows. 3. Breeding started slightly earlier on organic farms than on intensively managed farms, but no measure of breeding success differed between farm types. Predation was the cause of most (64%) nest failures. A maximum of three breeding attempts (two successful) was observed per pair, with a mean clutch size of 3·3, a Mayfield nest success rate of 0·46, and 2·6 nestlings fledged per successful brood. These data, together with published estimates of adult yellowhammer survival and of post-fledging survival among other passerines, suggest that breeding productivity is too low to maintain a stable population. 4. The removal of hedgerows or abandonment of hedge management, filling or clearing of ditches, intensification of grassland management and cropping or grazing right up to the field edge, are all likely to have adversely affected yellowhammers on lowland farmland in southern England. Policy reforms that redirect subsidy support to environmentally beneficial management of field margin habitats and retention of winter-feeding sites such as stubbles should assist in restoring populations of breeding yellowhammers on lowland farmland. 5. Our data expand further the array of farmland bird species for which interactions between agricultural change and population change are increasingly understood.

TI  - Sense And Sustainability: The Paradoxes That Sustain
PY  - 2013
AB  - The Royal Society report updates the anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems services and our inability to rise to this challenge. Sustainable development is argued to be a linguistic device that has been instrumental in deflecting us from addressing the paradox at the heart of the oxymoron. The relationships between the social, environmental, and economic are explored together with the utility of the I = PAT equation, with reference to the Hardin Taboo, Jevons's, and Easterlin's paradoxes. A more prominent role for phronesis in the management of human affairs and the adoption of ethics as the language for dealing with such issues are advocated.

TI  - Habitats for birds in Europe : A conservation strategy for the wider environment
PY  - 1997
AB  - The greatest threats to Europe's birds and biodiversity come from loss and degradation of habitat. This book brings together more than 190 bird and habitat conservation experts from all over Europe, to examine the threats to Europe's eight major habitat types, and propose policies and actions to protect and restore them. Although the emphasis is on birds, particularly the 40 percent of European species with an unfavourable conservation status, many recommendations would help conserve all elements of biodiversity in the wider European environment.

TI  - Common European birds are declining rapidly while less abundant species' numbers are rising
PY  - 2014
AB  - Biodiversity is undergoing unprecedented global decline. Efforts to slow this rate have focused foremost on rarer species, which are at most risk of extinction. Less interest has been paid to more common species, despite their greater importance in terms of ecosystem function and service provision. How rates of decline are partitioned between common and less abundant species remains unclear. Using a 30-year data set of 144 bird species, we examined Europe-wide trends in avian abundance and biomass. Overall, avian abundance and biomass are both declining with most of this decline being attributed to more common species, while less abundant species showed an overall increase in both abundance and biomass. If overall avian declines are mainly due to reductions in a small number of common species, conservation efforts targeted at rarer species must be better matched with efforts to increase overall bird numbers, if ecological impacts of birds are to be maintained.

TI  - 7 The Development of the Norwegian Petroleum Innovation System: A Historical Overview
PY  - 2009
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title> <jats:p>This chapter addresses the development of the Norwegian Petroleum Innovation System. While the initial phase of the petroleum development of Norway in the 1960s was characterized by an absorptive capacity of receiving new technology, the building of Norwegian competence in the 1970s and 1980s was, in certain respects, directly shaped by public policy so that participatation could occur. With the Condeep design it became possible to speak of an independent Norwegian petroleum industry. In the R&amp;D system of Norway, petroleum education and research were introduced at several levels. Due to new cost-efficient technologies introduced in the 1990s, we may say that the adjustment was concluded by the beginning of 21st century. The Norwegian oil and gas actors perceived themselves ready to participate fully in the international system of energy producers.</jats:p>

TI  - Agricultural intensification and the collapse of Europe's farmland bird populations
PY  - 2001
AB  - The populations of farmland birds in Europe declined markedly during the last quarter of the 20th century, representing a severe threat to biodiversity. Here, we assess whether declines in the populations and ranges of farmland birds across Europe reflect differences in agricultural intensity, which arise largely through differences in political history. Population and range changes were modelled in terms of a number of indices of agricultural intensity. Population declines and range contractions were significantly greater in countries with more intensive agriculture, and significantly higher in the European Union (EU) than in former communist countries. Cereal yield alone explained over 30% of the variation in population trends. The results suggest that recent trends in agriculture have had deleterious and measurable effects on bird populations on a continental scale. We predict that the introduction of EU agricultural policies into former communist countries hoping to accede to the EU in the near future will result in significant declines in the important bird populations there.

PY  - 1998
AB  - This paper critically reviews the concept of sustainability, especially as it has come to be applied outside of environmental goals. It suggests “sustainability” should not be considered as a goal for a housing or urban programme – many bad programmes are sustainable – but as a constraint whose absence may limit the usefulness of a good programme. It also discusses how the promotion of “sustainability” may simply encourage the sustaining of the unjust status quo and how the attempt to suggest that everyone has common interests in “sustainable urban development” masks very real conflicts of interest.

TI  - Global priority areas for ecosystem restoration
PY  - 2020
AB  - Extensive ecosystem restoration is increasingly seen as being central to conserving biodiversity and stabilizing the climate of the Earth. Although ambitious national and global targets have been set, global priority areas that account for spatial variation in benefits and costs have yet to be identified. Here we develop and apply a multicriteria optimization approach that identifies priority areas for restoration across all terrestrial biomes, and estimates their benefits and costs. We find that restoring 15% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning. Our results confirm the vast potential contributions of restoration to addressing global challenges, while underscoring the necessity of pursuing these goals synergistically.

TI  - The value of interdisciplinary research to advance paradox in organization theory
PY  - 2021
AB  - Over the past decades, scholars advanced foundational insights about paradox in organization theory. In this double volume, we seek to expand upon these insights through interdisciplinary theorizing. We do so for two reasons. First, we think that now is a moment to build on those foundations toward richer, more complex insights by learning from disciplines outside of organization theory. Second, as our world increasingly faces grand challenges, scholars turn to paradox theory. Yet as the challenges become more complex, authors turn to other disciplines to ensure the requisite complexity of our own theories. To advance these goals, we invited scholars with knowledge in paradox theory to explore how these ideas could be expanded by outside disciplines. This provides a both/and opportunity for paradox theory: both learning from outside disciplines beyond existing boundaries and enriching our insights in organization scholarship. The result is an impressive collection of papers about paradox theory that draws from four outside realms – the realm of belief, the realm of physical systems, the realm of social structures, and the realm of expression. In this introduction, we expand on why paradox theory is ripe for interdisciplinary theorizing, explore the benefits of doing so, and introduce the papers in this double volume.

TI  - Effects of the feeding of wild Yeso sika deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis) on the prevention of damage due to bark stripping and the use of feeding sites.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Feeding sites for wild Yeso sika deer around Lake Akan, Japan, were established. Effects on the number of deer using the feeding sites, the prevention of bark stripping damage, the amount of feeding, and eating time in a 5-year period (1999-2003) were evaluated. The number of deer using feeding sites increased with years during the feeding period. The damaged tree ratio after the initiation of feeding markedly decreased compared with 16.5% before the initiation of feeding. After the start of feeding, there were no trees with damage the entire circumference. According to tree species, the number of damaged trees of Ulmus laciniata Mayr as a percentage of all investigated trees was high (5.2%). The total amount of beet pulp feeding increased with the feeding year, showing 4.5-fold increase. At feeding sites in deer culling, eating behavior was observed during the night. The preventive effects on bark stripping damage continued during the 5-year feeding period. However, with the course of feeding years, the number of deer using feeding sites and the level of feeding increased.

TI  - The Vicissitudes of Energy and Climate Policy in Stockholm: Politics, Materiality and Transition
PY  - 2013
AB  - Through analysis of the orientations, conflicts and challenges of recent energy–climate policy in Stockholm, this paper interrogates how energy and climate become (translated as) a set of issues which come to matter in the local urban arena for different social and political interests. Drawing in particular on recent theoretical work on urban materiality, it is argued that ongoing, ‘everyday’ local struggles over the processes and practices of transformation of the urban fabric constitute repoliticised settings through and in which the orientations of urban energy transition are materially understood, experienced and performed in diverging ways. In ‘mapping’ the undulating politics of energy–climate matters, the paper outlines an alternative way of following and/or measuring energy and carbon flows through the urban environment.

TI  - Responses of red deer (Cervus elaphus) to regular disturbance by hill walkers
PY  - 2011
AB  - Disturbance to wildlife from human recreational activities is increasing as remote areas become accessible to greater numbers of people. We used Global Positioning System tracking collars to monitor the movements of red deer (Cervus elaphus) stags (n = 8) in a herd whose feeding grounds lie close to a popular walking track in the Highlands of Scotland. The track is used by around 20,000 walkers per year and is busiest in summer and at weekends. In a 2-year study, the locations of collared deer were recorded at 2-h intervals on typically busy days (Sundays: mean number of walkers = 204) and quiet days (Wednesdays: mean number of walkers = 49) during May and June. The deer were consistently further from the track on Sundays than Wednesdays (371 vs 286 m) and moved greater distances between fixes (365 vs 308 m). The amount of time spent (percentage of total fixes) in the small area of grassland closest to the track was lower on Sundays than Wednesdays (6% vs 13%). Although 97% of walkers use the track during the day (between 0800 and 2000 h), there was no evidence of compensatory use of grassland at night, when the deer moved to higher ground dominated by heather moorland. The results demonstrate that animals which appear to be habituated to regular disturbance within their home territory may nevertheless alter their behaviour and potentially diet composition, as a result of that disturbance.

TI  - GIS analysis of change in an agricultural landscape in Central Finland
PY  - 1996
AB  - <jats:p>Changes in landscape over a period of 50 years were analysed in a rural area of 324 ha in Central Finland. The data were digitized from aerial photographs of the National Land Survey taken in 1944, 1959, 1979 and 1991, and analysed with the IDRISI™ geographic information system (GIS). The average proportion of land in agricultural use in the sample area was 17.4%. The arable area declined from the maximum of 62.3 ha (1959) to 47.6 ha. The total length of linear landscape elements, predominantly ditch bank habitats, halved, from 876 m/ha of field (1944) to 449 m/ha by the end of the period. The average rate of loss of field boundary habitat was 9.1 m/ha/ year. At the same time, the Shannon-Weaver index of diversity of agricultural landscape elements dropped from 0.37 to 0.24. The number of field parcels declined by 29%, and the mean parcel size increased by 45%, from 1.2 ha to 1.7 ha. The index value of the fractal dimension measuring the complexity of parcel shapes also fell, from 1.88 (1959) to 1.86 (1991). The change in spatial structure reflects the intensification of farming in Finland. Biodiversity at ecosystem level has clearly declined. However, the implications for the agroecosystem and its sustainability are still unknown.</jats:p>

TI  - Monitoring Norwegian farmland loss through periodically updated land cover map data
PY  - 2013
AB  - Land use changes resulting in the loss of farmland have been the focus of growing public concern and have led to the development of preservation policies worldwide. There is a need to develop adequate tools to monitor such changes in order to inform and improve farmland management policies. The present study investigates to what extent the periodic updating of Norwegian land cover data (as part of AR5, the Norwegian land capability classification system and dataset) can satisfy the need to monitor farmland decrease. GIS analysis was performed for two municipalities. Changes during a c.10-year period were analysed and uncertainties in the results explored. The analysis reveals that farmland loss due to reversible processes is far more important than loss through irreversible processes such as development. Uncertainty related to the identified changes is found to be small enough to leave no doubt about the prevailing change processes in the study area, yet could be of great importance for the most minor cha...

TI  - Influence of slope and aspect on long‐term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands
PY  - 2006
AB  - 1 The species composition of fragmented semi-natural grasslands may change over time due to stochastic local extinction and colonization events, successional change and/or as a response to changing management or abiotic conditions. The resistance of vegetation to change may be mediated through the effects of topography (slope and aspect) on soils and microclimate. 2 To assess long-term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands, 92 plots first surveyed by F. H. Perring in 1952–53, and distributed across four climatic regions, were re-surveyed during 2001–03. Changes in vegetation since the original survey were assessed by comparing local colonization and extinction rates at the plot scale, and changes in species frequency at the subplot scale. Vegetation change was quantified using indirect ordination (Detrended Correspondence Analysis; DCA) and Ellenberg indicator values. 3 Across all four regions, there was a significant decrease in species number and a marked decline in stress-tolerant species typical of species-rich calcareous grasslands, both in terms of decreased plot occupancy and decreased frequency within occupied plots. More competitive species typical of mesotrophic grasslands had colonized plots they had not previously occupied, but had not increased significantly in frequency within occupied plots. 4 A significant increase in Ellenberg fertility values, which was highly correlated with the first DCA axis, was found across all regions. The magnitude of change of fertility and moisture values was found to decrease with angle of slope and with a topographic solar radiation index derived from slope and aspect. 5 The observed shift from calcareous grassland towards more mesotrophic grassland communities is consistent with the predicted effects of both habitat fragmentation and nutrient enrichment. It is hypothesized that chalk grassland swards on steeply sloping ground are more resistant to invasion by competitive grass species than those on flatter sites due to phosphorus limitation in shallow minerogenic rendzina soils, and that those with a southerly aspect are more resistant due to increased magnitude and frequency of drought events.

TI  - Identifying threshold densities for wild deer in the UK above which negative impacts may occur
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1 At high densities, deer populations may have adverse effects upon and within their environment. In this review we explore published and unpublished information to derive density thresholds for deer species in relation to impacts upon agriculture, forestry, conservation habitats, road traffic, and human and livestock health in the UK. Impact levels are affected by many factors other than absolute density. We therefore seek to establish the range of densities within which negative impacts might start to occur and which should trigger objective monitoring of actual impacts. 2 In commercial forestry, a threshold of 4 deer per 100ha has been suggested. Unfenced native woodlands seem to regenerate naturally if there are fewer than 4-5 large deer or fewer than 25 roe deer Capreolus capreolus per 100ha; open habitats may suffer only light or moderate impacts from red deer Cervus elaphus at landscape densities of 7-8 per 100ha. 3 Woodland bird species may have declined where deer densities are high but absolute thresholds seem impossible to establish. One study suggests maximum diversity at about 8 white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus per 100ha. 4 Deer-vehicle collisions are affected by various factors in addition to deer density, but British and American studies suggest that accident frequencies decline at densities below 7-8 per 100ha. 5 Fallow deer Dama dama populations may maintain bovine TB (bTB) infection at much lower densities (25/100ha) than red or roe deer (91/100ha and 200/100ha, respectively) assuming 100% prevalence. Even at 30% prevalence a density of 75 fallow deer per 100ha could maintain bTB within the population. 6 We conclude that deer density alone is unlikely to be a good predictor of impact, and suggest that long-term management should be based on assessment both of actual impacts and apparent density of deer.

TI  - Low‐intensity agriculture increases farmland bird abundances in France
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Farmland biodiversity continues to decline mainly because of agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Agri-environment schemes can be designed to halt this loss by favouring extensification of agricultural practices and through sympathetic management of field boundaries and fallow land. In Europe, High Nature Value (HNV) farmland is defined as low-intensity farmland supporting or associated with a high rate of biodiversity, in terms of species richness or habitat diversity and therefore plays a crucial role in the maintenance of European biodiversity. However, no large-scale analysis has explored the role of these areas in achieving conservation goals. 2. We analysed information from widely used indicators in order to describe the impact of low-intensity agriculture on farmland biodiversity in France. We used the HNV farmland indicator, based on agricultural statistics such as the Farm Structure Survey and the grassland survey, and common bird indicators, i.e. the Farmland Bird Indicator (FBI), the Community Specialization Index (CSI) and species richness indexes, based on the French Breeding Bird Survey. 3. Temporal trends in the farmland bird indicator showed that populations of farmland birds were more likely to increase inside HNV areas compared to non-HNV areas. Although species richness is not higher within HNV farmland, bird communities are composed by more specialist species than in non-HNV areas. In addition, these specialist bird species are significantly more abundant in HNV areas. 4. Synthesis and applications. Further farmland biodiversity decline is potentially reversible through an appropriate management of HNV areas. Existing and future agri-environment schemes should focus on preserving and extending HNV farmland, by favouring the maintenance of low-intensity agriculture and landscape complexity. Priority should be given to preserving diversity at the community level, with the help of adequate indicators, such as the ones presented here. The role of HNV farmland or similar concepts in combining agriculture and biodiversity goals should be further analysed and further used as large-scale conservation tools.

TI  - Spatial synchrony of local populations has increased in association with the recent Northern Hemisphere climate trend
PY  - 2004
AB  - According to ecological theory, populations whose dynamics are entrained by environmental correlation face increased extinction risk as environmental conditions become more synchronized spatially. This prediction is highly relevant to the study of ecological consequences of climate change. Recent empirical studies have indicated, for example, that large-scale climate synchronizes trophic interactions and population dynamics over broad spatial scales in freshwater and terrestrial systems. Here, we present an analysis of century-scale, spatially replicated data on local weather and the population dynamics of caribou in Greenland. Our results indicate that spatial autocorrelation in local weather has increased with large-scale climatic warming. This increase in spatial synchrony of environmental conditions has been matched, in turn, by an increase in the spatial synchrony of local caribou populations toward the end of the 20th century. Our results indicate that spatial synchrony in environmental conditions and the populations influenced by them are highly variable through time and can increase with climatic warming. We suggest that if future warming can increase population synchrony, it may also increase extinction risk.

TI  - Smart energy prosumers in Norway: Critical reflections on implications for participation and everyday life
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract As evidenced by the EU’s 2016 political ambition to empower energy consumers by allowing them to become prosumers, smart energy technologies are expected to contribute to energy savings as well as healthier and more comfortable lives. Norway is a vanguard country in implementing smart energy technologies, and a growing literature of social science and humanities research has investigated how such technology impacts everyday life. Taking stock with this literature and comparing two Norwegian high-tech demonstration cases, where local production and smarter consumption is enabled through novel technologies, the research objective of this paper was to analyse the ways in which smart energy technologies affect users, and the extent to which users can influence the role of smart energy technological arrangements in their everyday lives. Results indicated that there is a divergence between the intentions and the effects of the introduced technologies. For instance, smart technologies and prosuming affected the way people organised their everyday lives by demanding more work of participants. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners relating to consumer participation and energy prosuming, advising a focus on broader implications in addition to smart technological fixes.

TI  - Probability of recent bark stripping damage by red deer (Cervus elaphus) on Norway spruce (Picea abies) in a low mountain range in Germany – a preliminary analysis
PY  - 2008
AB  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) can cause considerable damage to forest stands by bark stripping. Here, we examined the probability of bark stripping of susceptible Norway spruce (Picea abies) during winter in relation to local environmental characteristics in the western Harz Mountains, Lower Saxony, Germany. We present the results of a multiple logistic regression model for recent bark stripping damage by red deer which we developed from two systematic cluster sampling inventories after two winter periods along with associated meteorological data and records of bagged deer. Our model suggests that the risk of bark stripping increased significantly (P < 0.05) with rising slope angle, cumulating snow depth and increasing index values of red deer population density. Spruces growing in closed forest stands were debarked at a higher probability than spruces located close to forest edges. Further on, spruce stands on eastern slopes had a lower probability of bark damage than spruce stands on northern slopes. Other tested variables (altitude, length of daily solar irradiation, duration of snow cover, age of spruce stand within the age range of 16–50 years) had no significant effect on the probability of new bark stripping. We conclude that red deer in the western Harz Mountains seem to use bark as food resource at preferred locations and in times of low food availability. To improve fit and predictive power of bark stripping models we recommend including stand characteristics. We propose to reduce the population size of red deer in order to diminish bark stripping damages to an economically acceptable level.

TI  - Ecosystem Services and Opportunity Costs Shift Spatial Priorities for Conserving Forest Biodiversity
PY  - 2014
AB  - Inclusion of spatially explicit information on ecosystem services in conservation planning is a fairly new practice. This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2%) and the non-use zone (+3.2%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79%.

TI  - A conceptual framework for understanding the social acceptance of energy infrastructure: Insights from energy storage
PY  - 2017
AB  - Although social acceptance research has blossomed over the last decade, interdisciplinary studies combining market, socio-political and community aspects are scarce. We propose a novel integration of social science theory in which the belief systems or social representations held by key actors play a crucial role in fostering acceptance of novel technologies, and where a polycentric perspective places particular emphasis on ways that middle actors mediate processes of change between scales. We advance a methodological approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods and exemplify the framework by focusing on acceptance of renewable energy storage solutions to accommodate high levels of renewable energy deployment. A research agenda for the social acceptance of energy storage is proposed that sets out key research questions relating international, national and local levels. The outcome of such studies would not only lead to enhanced understanding of processes of social acceptance, but deliver important insights for policy and practice.

TI  - Extinction thresholds and disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in fragmented plant populations
PY  - 2002
AB  - In order to estimate how much population extinction risk may be affected by local fragmentation, population viability analyses were performed in six populations of the endangered grassland herb Gentianella campestris in Sweden. The populations had been experimentally reintroduced to grasslands that were locally fragmented by juniper shrubs. The sites represented three sizes of grassland and two levels of grassland abundance in the landscape. Five years' demographic data were evaluated in a stochastic matrix population model, and studies of seed set, pollinator abundance, and inbreeding depression were performed in order to examine possible links between population viability and pollination. In all six sites, plants with reduced capacity of self-pollination (due to herkogamy) showed strongly reduced population viability in locally fragmented grassland habit, with pronounced extinction thresholds at certain levels of local fragmentation. Population viability was reduced because of inbreeding depression and reduced seed production in combination, both caused by pollinator deficit in locally fragmented grasslands. Plants with high selfing capacity had low population viability over the entire local fragmentation gradients. Selfing yielded high seed set in the absence of pollinators and was advantageous in fragmented parts of the grasslands. However, selfing had negative effects in nonfragmented parts of the grasslands, because it decreased the chances of cross-pollination and because selfed progeny had reduced fitness compared to outcrossed offspring. A comparison among the six sites indicated that the negative effects of local fragmentation were amplified by reduced size of the grassland sites and by reduced abundance of grassland habitat in the landscape. To my knowledge, this is the first quantitative estimate of increased extinction risk in fragmented plant populations.

TI  - The relevance of non-farmland habitats, uncropped areas and habitat diversity to the conservation of farmland birds
PY  - 2004
AB  - Use of non-farmland habitats by species generally perceived as ‘farmland birds’ is common, yet these habitats are not always considered in conservation strategies aimed at population recovery. At the national scale, many farmland species occur in landscapes not dominated by farmland. An analysis of distribution atlas data coupled with remotely sensed habitat data showed that for 16 out of 28 farmland species, less than half of the breeding range was associated with high cover of lowland farmland. However, with a few exceptions, populations breeding in non-farmland habitats are likely to depend on farmland at some time in the year. Within farmland landscapes, uncropped areas and patches of non-farmland habitat can provide nesting, foraging or roosting resources. Habitats that are scarce on farmland and that provide potential supplementary or complementary resources to those available within the productive areas of farmland include ruderal vegetation, rough grassland and scrub. Enhancing habitat diversity through provision of modest quantities of these habitats will benefit farmland birds. Complete knowledge of year-round habitat requirements and patterns of resource use at all scales is needed if robust national conservation plans are to be developed for farmland species. Similarly, interactions between the farmland and non-farmland sections of populations need to be determined.

TI  - Drivers of change in Norwegian agricultural land control and the emergence of rental farming
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract Norway represents one of the last countries in Europe where the structural development of agriculture is strongly state regulated through legislation and economic instruments. The result is an agriculture dominated by very small farms while, in most of the rest of Europe, farming has been rationalised into much larger units – thus improving the structural efficiency of agriculture. This study looks at how and why the pattern of farmland control (ownership and renting) in Norway has changed over the last fifty years. Using a study of agricultural policy documents, an investigation of statistics on farmland control changes, and a qualitative survey, we explore the considerable growth in the number of partly rented farms over this period. We suggest that change is attributable to three key factors: techno-economic development leading to a growing need for economies of scale, social norms curbing the transfer of farm properties outside of the family, and policy and legal instruments reducing the extent of property transfer. In addition, the weakening of compensation to smaller farmers since the 1990s has encouraged many to leave agriculture and made more rental land available – ultimately leading to a rapid shift from traditional owner occupation to a predominantly rented land system.

TI  - Soil multifunctionality is affected by the soil environment and by microbial community composition and diversity.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Microorganisms are critical in mediating carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes in soils. Yet, it has long been debated whether the processes underlying biogeochemical cycles are affected by the composition and diversity of the soil microbial community or not. The composition and diversity of soil microbial communities can be influenced by various environmental factors, which in turn are known to impact biogeochemical processes. The objectives of this study were to test effects of multiple edaphic drivers individually and represented as the multivariate soil environment interacting with microbial community composition and diversity, and concomitantly on multiple soil functions (i.e. soil enzyme activities, soil C and N processes). We employed high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) to analyze bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition by targeting the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS1 region of soils collected from three land uses (cropland, grassland and forest) deriving from two bedrock forms (silicate and limestone). Based on this data set we explored single and combined effects of edaphic variables on soil microbial community structure and diversity, as well as on soil enzyme activities and several soil C and N processes. We found that both bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities were shaped by the same edaphic factors, with most single edaphic variables and the combined soil environment representation exerting stronger effects on bacterial/archaeal communities than on fungal communities, as demonstrated by (partial) Mantel tests. We also found similar edaphic controls on the bacterial/archaeal/fungal richness and diversity. Soil C processes were only directly affected by the soil environment but not affected by microbial community composition. In contrast, soil N processes were significantly related to bacterial/archaeal community composition and bacterial/archaeal/fungal richness/diversity but not directly affected by the soil environment. This indicates direct control of the soil environment on soil C processes and indirect control of the soil environment on soil N processes by structuring the microbial communities. The study further highlights the importance of edaphic drivers and microbial communities (i.e. composition and diversity) on important soil C and N processes.

TI  - Management strategy evaluation: a powerful tool for conservation?
PY  - 2011
AB  - The poor management of natural resources has led in many cases to the decline and extirpation of populations. Recent advances in fisheries science could revolutionize management of harvested stocks by evaluating management scenarios in a virtual world by including stakeholders and by assessing its robustness to uncertainty. These advances have been synthesized into a framework, management strategy evaluation (MSE), which has hitherto not been used in terrestrial conservation. We review the potential of MSE to transform terrestrial conservation, emphasizing that the behavior of individual harvesters must be included because harvester compliance with management rules has been a major challenge in conservation. Incorporating resource user decision-making required to make MSEs relevant to terrestrial conservation will also advance fisheries science.

TI  - Who influences windpower licensing decisions in Norway? Formal requirements and informal practices
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Licensing processes for renewable electricity plants have been surprisingly little studied. Yet, how public and private stakeholders influence the process, formally and informally, is crucial to the outcome of the licensing decision. This article analyses how the organisation of the Norwegian windpower licensing process affects actor influence, and the consequences for licensing outcomes as well as the transparency and predictability of the process. Drawing on licence application and decision documents, official regulations, policy documents and reports, as well as research papers, media articles and 19 interviews, we map and discuss formal rules and informal practices. Changes in regulations and organisation of the licensing process, along with locating the licensing body within a sector authority instead of generalised planning, have given the licensing body considerable room for decisional discretion. This gives rise to the issue of transparency, where the grounds for the licensing outcome and the weighting of various factors are unclear, and also makes it difficult to predict the results for similar projects. We argue that the superficial impression of a centrally driven and controlled process should be modified somewhat, as some local stakeholders have more influence on the licensing outcome than is immediately apparent.

TI  - Population trends of farmland birds in Sweden and England: similar trends but different patterns of agricultural intensification
PY  - 2006
AB  - Studies, mainly from the UK, show that many farmland birds have declined as a result of recent agricultural intensification. We tested this idea by analysing farmland bird population trends in Sweden, a country displaying less dramatic agricultural changes and less intensive agriculture. Specifically we investigated whether (i) farmland specialists have declined more than generalists, (ii) population declines in Sweden are less marked than in England and (iii) Swedish population trends are associated with changes in the amount of autumn-sown crops, and inputs of pesticides and fertilizers. Data on population trends for 21 farmland bird species collected from the Swedish Breeding Bird Survey 1976-2001 were analysed in relation to agricultural changes in Sweden. Fifteen (71%) farmland bird species declined significantly in number (P < 0.05) over the 26 years. Farmland specialists displayed a significantly stronger average decline (55%) as a group than farmland generalists (7%). For seven species the declines were significantly steeper between 1976 and 1988 than between 1988 and 2001. Farmland bird populations have declined at least as much in Sweden as in England. Several specialist species displayed similar temporal patterns in population change in both countries. The area of autumn-sown crops has remained stable in Sweden, whereas use of pesticides and fertilizers has declined. There are no clear associations between these factors and observed farmland bird population declines. The similarities in bird population trends in Sweden and England, despite large differences in patterns of agricultural change in Sweden and England, may be explained by: (i) common wintering grounds, (ii) similar negative effects of agricultural intensification (England) and intensification/abandonment (Sweden) and (iii) a simultaneous loss of landscape heterogeneity. Synthesis and applications. Farmland birds in Sweden have declined by at least as much as in England, despite clear differences between the two countries in the degree of agricultural intensification over the last 30 years. We suggest that the marked declines in Swedish populations are caused by (i) the dual negative effects of intensification and abandonment of farmland at breeding grounds, and (ii) Swedish populations partly sharing wintering grounds with English populations. We conclude that agri-environmental schemes need to be flexible enough to address the negative effects both of intensification and the abandonment of farming. In addition, our results emphasize that farmland bird conservation is an issue without country borders. (Less)

TI  - Variations in bark‐stripping by red deer Cervus elaphus across Europe
PY  - 2006
AB  - 1 The literature on bark-stripping by red deer Cervus elaphus in Europe is reviewed to reveal quantitative variation in this behaviour and relate it to deer density and local characteristics such as dominant tree species, occurrence of artificial feeding, altitude, region and size of the study site. We also review the importance of bark in red deer diets over the seasons and discuss the causes of bark-stripping, focusing on the significance of bark as food. 2 Over the 36 sites examined, the rate of bark-stripping was highly variable (from 0 to 84% of susceptible trees debarked), with less damage in Scotland than in other European sites for which bark-stripping rates were higher at high red deer density. Altitude, the size of the study site, the number of dominant tree species and the occurrence of artificial feeding do not significantly relate to the rate of bark-stripping. 3 Bark sometimes made up a large proportion of red deer diet (> 10%), especially in areas with severe winters (high levels of snow), whereas in study sites with mild winters, bark was practically not eaten at all. 4 These results suggest that severe bark-stripping could be related to a reduction in food resource availability. This food availability hypothesis needs to be better documented, dealing particularly with the possible interaction between food availability and red deer density.

TI  - Bottom-up versus top-down control of tree regeneration in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland
PY  - 2010
AB  - We tested the interactions between biotic and abiotic factors in structuring temperate forest communities by comparing tree recruitment after 7 years inside 30 pairs of exclosure (excluding ungulates: red deer, roe deer, bison, moose, wild boar) and control plots (7 × 7 m each) in one of the most natural forest systems in Europe, the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (eastern Poland). The strictly protected part of that forest hosts the complete native variety in trees, ungulates and their carnivores and excludes human intervention.2. We analysed whether the exclosure effect interacted with abiotic factors, relevant for tree recruitment (canopy cover, ground vegetation cover, soil fertility and soil wetness) at different stages of tree regeneration (seedlings, saplings = 50 and > 50 cm).3. Contrary to our expectations, a single factor dominated at each stage of tree regeneration. Herbaceous vegetation cover was the main factor determining the number of seedlings with an optimum at 38% of cover. Soil fertility determined the density of saplings = 50 cm, with on average three times higher density on eutrophic than on oligotrophic soils. Herbivory was the main factor determining recruitment rate of trees into > 50 cm size classes only.4. The density of saplings that grew into the > 50 cm size class was more than three times higher in the exclosures than in the control plots during 7 years. In the absence of ungulates, on average 3.1 species recruited into the > 50 cm size class compared to 1.7 in control plots. Tree species occurred in more equal proportions inside exclosures, whereas species composition was pushed towards strong dominance of a preferred forage species, Carpinus betulus, in the presence of ungulates. This suggests that preference of species by ungulates can coincide with tolerance to browsing.5. Synthesis. The study showed that abiotic conditions dominated the early stages and ungulate impact the later stages of tree regeneration, indicating the context-dependence of herbivore top-down effects. Heterogeneity in abiotic and biotic conditions may, therefore, have an important influence on the strength of top-down effects and the role that herbivores play in natural ecosystems.

TI  - Effects of abandonment on plant diversity in semi‐natural grasslands along soil and climate gradients
PY  - 2017
AB  - Questions: What are the effects of abandonment on plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands? Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and soil? Location: West and mid-Norway. Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m2 in 14 sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seed mass (SM) and number of seeds per plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database. Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random effect. Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H, LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower. Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species. Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience. (Resume d'auteur)

TI  - Ecosystem consequences of bird declines
PY  - 2004
AB  - We present a general framework for characterizing the ecological and societal consequences of biodiversity loss and applying it to the global avifauna. To investigate the potential ecological consequences of avian declines, we developed comprehensive databases of the status and functional roles of birds and a stochastic model for forecasting change. Overall, 21% of bird species are currently extinction-prone and 6.5% are functionally extinct, contributing negligibly to ecosystem processes. We show that a quarter or more of frugivorous and omnivorous species and one-third or more of herbivorous, piscivorous, and scavenger species are extinction-prone. Furthermore, our projections indicate that by 2100, 6–14% of all bird species will be extinct, and 7–25% (28–56% on oceanic islands) will be functionally extinct. Important ecosystem processes, particularly decomposition, pollination, and seed dispersal, will likely decline as a result.

TI  - Adaptive biodiversity management of semi-natural hay meadows: The case of West-Norway
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract Worldwide semi-natural habitats of high biological value are in decline. Consequently, numerous Agri-Environment Schemes (AESs) intended to halt biodiversity loss within these habitats have been implemented. One approach has been the application of “adaptive management”, where scientific knowledge is applied alongside the traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of stakeholders in order to establish an integrated approach that is adjusted as outcomes are assessed. In this paper we examine the effectiveness of the adaptive management approach of Norway’s Action Plan for Hay Meadows (APHM). Twenty-nine hay meadows from fourteen farms in the county of More og Romsdal were ecologically surveyed over a 2 year period. Interviews were also conducted with owners and land managers to explore TEK and management issues. The interdisciplinary study found that the disembedding of hay meadow management from its initial commercial purpose (in particular the loss of much of the livestock from the region) has contributed to a significant loss of TEK – which is now largely limited to knowledge of how the fields were managed recently. While, the APHM is limiting biodiversity decline by promoting traditional practices there were indications that the standardisation of management actions might negatively affect species composition in the long term. More critically, continued farm abandonment within the region means that without alternatives to management by farmers many of these meadows are likely to disappear in the next couple of decades. We conclude that adaptive management provides an effective short-term means of preserving hay meadows, but long term conservation will require a means of addressing the continued decline of local farming communities.

TI  - Rethinking NIMBYism: The role of place attachment and place identity in explaining place‐protective action
PY  - 2009
AB  - The ‘NIMBY’ (Not In My Back Yard) concept is commonly used to explain public opposition to new developments near homes and communities, particularly arising from energy technologies such as wind farms or electricity pylons. Despite its common use, the concept has been extensively critiqued by social scientists as a useful concept for research and practice. Given European policy goals to increase sustainable energy supply by 2020, deepening understanding of local opposition is of both conceptual and practical importance. This paper reviews NIMBY literature and proposes an alternative framework to explain local opposition, drawing upon social and environmental psychological theory on place. Local opposition is conceived as a form of place-protective action, which arises when new developments disrupt pre-existing emotional attachments and threaten place-related identity processes. Adopting a social constructivist perspective and drawing on social representation theory, a framework of place change is proposed encompassing stages of becoming aware, interpreting, evaluating, coping and acting, with each stage conceived at multiple levels of analysis, from intrapersonal to socio-cultural. Directions for future research and potential implications of the place-based approach for public engagement by energy policy-makers and practitioners are discussed.

TI  - Energy justice : a conceptual review
PY  - 2016
AB  - Energy justice has emerged as a new crosscutting social science research agenda which seeks to apply justice principles to energy policy, energy production and systems, energy consumption, energy activism, energy security and climate change. A conceptual review is now required for the consolidation and logical extension of this field. Within this exploration, we give an account of its core tenets: distributional, recognition and procedural. Later we promote the application of this three-pronged approach across the energy system, within the global context of energy production and consumption. Thus, we offer both a conceptual review and a research agenda. Throughout, we explore the key dimensions of this new agenda – its evaluative and normative reach – demonstrating that energy justice offers, firstly, an opportunity to explore where injustices occur, developing new processes of avoidance and remediation and recognizing new sections of society. Secondly, we illustrate that energy justice provides a new stimulating framework for bridging existing and future research on energy production and consumption when whole energy systems approaches are integrated into research designs. In conclusion, we suggest three areas for future research: investigating the non-activist origins of energy justice, engaging with economics, and uniting systems of production and consumption.

TI  - Rewilding Abandoned Landscapes in Europe
PY  - 2012
AB  - For millennia, mankind has shaped landscapes, particularly through agriculture. In Europe, the age-old interaction between humans and ecosystems strongly influenced the cultural heritage. Yet European farmland is now being abandoned, especially in remote areas. The loss of the traditional agricultural landscapes and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services is generating concerns in both the scientific community and the public. Here we ask to what extent farmland abandonment can be considered as an opportunity for rewilding ecosystems. We analyze the perceptions of traditional agriculture in Europe and their influence in land management policies. We argue that, contrary to the common perception, traditional agriculture practices were not environmentally friendly and that the standards of living of rural populations were low. We suggest that current policies to maintain extensive farming landscapes underestimate the human labor needed to sustain these landscapes and the recent and future dynamics of the socio-economic drivers behind abandonment. We examine the potential benefits for ecosystems and people from rewilding. We identify species that could benefit from land abandonment and forest regeneration and the ecosystem services that could be provided such as carbon sequestration and recreation. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with rewilding, including the need to maintain open areas, the fire risks, and the conflicts between people and wildlife. Despite these challenges, we argue that rewilding should be recognized by policy-makers as one of the possible land management options in Europe, particularly on marginal areas.

TI  - Planetary boundaries: Exploring the safe operating space for humanity
PY  - 2009
AB  - Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere <350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite ≥ 80% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone (<5% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use (<4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change (<15% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of <10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social-ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of "planetary boundaries" lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the "planetary playing field" for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.

TI  - Assessing deer densities and impacts at the appropriate level for management: a review of methodologies for use beyond the site scale
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1 Population density alone is unlikely to be a good predictor of the impacts of deer on their environment. The assessment of management requirements should therefore be based on assessment of deer impacts, alongside estimates of density. 2 Both density and impacts need to be monitored at a landscape scale, and there is a need to develop appropriate methodologies that allow managers to consider the current and likely future impact of deer. 3 The relevant scale for assessment (and management) varies both with deer species and context of impact, but should always encompass at least the estimated biological range of the population of deer present in an area. Some impacts (e.g. deer–vehicle collisions, and risks of disease transmission) may need to be assessed at a wider regional level. 4 In this review we consider various approaches available for assessing: absolute or relative animal abundance; impacts of ungulates on agriculture, forestry, amenity woodlands and other conservation sites; impacts on public safety (e.g. through road traffic accidents) and on humans or livestock through potential spread of disease. 5 In each case the advantages and disadvantages of a variety of methods are considered, before recommendations are made for methodologies which are sufficiently accurate, sufficiently robust and sufficiently practical to be favoured in a management context. 6 To address impacts at the landscape scale requires management policies that integrate information on both positive and negative impacts of deer in order to ensure appropriate and holistic management. We present a decision-support framework suitable for use within the UK, using inputs from a variety of possible impact types to assist managers and forewarn of situations where current management may need to be modified.

TI  - Landscape of fear in Europe: wolves affect spatial patterns of ungulate browsing in Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Large carnivores can either directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, in contrast to North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bialowieza National Park, Poland. Browsing intensity of tree saplings (height class <150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50.5%) where predator presence is highest, than in the remainder of the wolf pack’s home range (58.3%). Additionally, browsing intensity was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a ?ungulate escape impediment', increased (within 5-m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns of birch regrowth in a Western Norwegian treeline ecotone
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractThe study investigates spatio-temporal patterns of birch regrowth in a mountain valley in which intensive livestock grazing was formerly practised. Vegetation changes were identified through analysis of three sets of aerial photographs. The results of GIS analyses, one-way ANOVA and PCA showed that regrowth patterns are complex. In the early phase of succession, grazing history has a strong impact on where new forest establishes, both at a distance from the seasonal farmsteads where grazing intensity prior to abandonment was highest, and close to previously existing forest. Sprouting is most likely to be the dominating regeneration strategy in this early phase. In a later phase of succession, the impact of grazing history on forest distribution patterns decreases, as exemplified by the increasing distance from existing forest. The largest amounts of birch forest then establish in warm locations with moderate moisture. Protection against wind appears to be important for birch establishment.

TI  - The concept of overgrazing and its role in management of large herbivores
PY  - 2006
AB  - Abstract Increasing populations of cervids in Europe and North America have made the issue of overgrazing relevant outside areas with domestic or semi-domestic herbivores. Over grazing is defined depending on management objectives. I focus on challenges related to implementing a ‘range ecologist’ baseline, defining overgrazing as situations when ‘forage species are not able to maintain themselves over time due to an excess of herbivory or related processes’. Herbivores may be naturally regulated at ecological carrying capacity (K) with no overgrazing, but overgrazing may occur below K. Rare, preferred plant species can decline in density due to a ‘herbivore pit’ created by generalist herbivores, without having much effect on K. The concept of overgrazing is almost meaningless unless the issue of spatial scale is considered, and the extent to which preferred plant species decline in coverage. Herbivore population instability increases with increased population growth rate, but overgrazing depends also on t...

TI  - Probability of Bark Stripping Damage by Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) in Austria
PY  - 2006
AB  - Bark stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) causes considerable damage to Austrian forests, however, the incidence of bark stripping was never examined from large scale survey data. In this manuscript we present a logistic regression model for bark stripping damage (static model) and a model for recent (5-year period) bark stripping damage to previously undamaged trees (dynamic model) developed from Austrian National Forest Inventory data. Both models showed bark stripping damage to be most frequent in core red deer habitat areas and less frequent in less suitable habitat. Damage was concentrated at elevations of 400–1200 m and in alluvial forests (only static model). Norway spruce (Picea abies), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) and Sorbus spp. had 11–12 times more injuries than all the other species. Red deer preferred the smallest trees with a breast height diameter of 5 cm for bark stripping and damage probability decreased rapidly for trees with a breast height diameter greater than 25 cm. Our static model showed a maximum of bark stripping damage in stands with a mean height of 20 m. In the dynamic model the probability for bark stripping damage decreased with decreasing mean height. Also, in the static model the probability for bark stripping damage increased with increasing spruce proportion and with increasing stand density whereas in the dynamic model the proportion of previous bark stripping damage was a good predictor. Goodness of fit and discrimination of both models were good. In combination with forest growth models, the bark stripping models can be used to predict the risk of damage associated with different forest and habitat management options.

TI  - Green colonialism in the Nordic context: Exploring Southern Saami representations of wind energy development.
PY  - 2020
AB  - This paper explores social representations of wind energy development within reindeer herding lands among the Indigenous Southern Saami living within Norwegian borders. For this matter, the paper combines Social Representations Theory (SRT) with the analytical framework of "circuits of dispossession and privilege" and decolonial approaches within community psychology. Data consisted of seven individual semi-structured open-ended interviews, three collective interviews, and observation in three lawsuits, public meetings, protest actions, and reindeer herding activities. The findings suggest that for the subjects in this study, the onset of wind power represents the renewal of historical processes of dispossession through accumulation and colonialism, enabled by harmful knowledge gaps in Norwegian society and institutions, contrasting Southern Saami's values of responsibility and ecological practices. The implication of these findings suggests an urgent need of rethinking renewable energy and including indigenous knowledge in climate change agendas.

TI  - Revitalizing varieties of capitalism for sustainability transitions research: Review, critique and way forward
PY  - 2022
AB  - Despite recent calls for more critical views of capitalism in sustainability transitions research, a starting point for transitions researchers is lacking. Recognizing the potential of the varieties of capitalism (VoC) approach to bring capitalism deeper into transitions research, this paper constitutes a review of VoC in the sustainability transitions literature, returning to its theoretical foundations in coordination and strategic interactions and their relations to innovation and socio-technical system transformation. The review finds the most common application of VoC to be in the energy dimension of transition, nevertheless revealing a shallow engagement with the approach that reinforces the need for conceptual development for sustainability transitions purposes. Potential areas for development relate to the enrichment of core VoC concepts – coordination, strategic interaction and comparative institutional advantage – and to competing growth and sustainability objectives of existing (and beyond) capitalist systems. There is a further need to expand the scope of VoC application beyond ideal-form national archetypes to infiltrate across scales and levels, as well as to go beyond the traditional range of sectors to shed light on understudied actors, roles and power relations for transitions. Despite typical delegation to political economy, VoC is highly interdisciplinary, applicable to common frameworks used in transition studies and amenable to social scientists interested in power and agency in transitions. As a strategy for moving VoC forward in transitions research, it is recommended to place it at the core of studies taking institutions, stakeholder interactions and sector coordination in their contextual situations seriously.

TI  - Implementing a just renewable energy transition: Policy advice for transposing the new European rules for renewable energy communities
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The recast of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) provides an enabling framework for “Renewable Energy Communities” (RECs) that is being transposed into law by the 27 European Union Member States by June 2021. RECs are majority owned by local members or shareholders who are authorized to share energy within the community, offering the potential to unlock private investment and financing for renewable energy sources and provide social benefits. However, successful implementation and a just energy transition requires the coupling of technological solutions with more open decision making, based on sound analysis, knowledge of engineering, spatial planning, and social science. We argue that financing and ownership models that address renewable energy complementarity, spatial organization of resource potential, demographics, pushback from incumbents, and inclusion of traditionally marginalized groups, are common issues across all Member States that are crucial for the transposition of RED II and a just energy transition. This paper highlights the benefits and challenges of widespread development of RECs, and using examples from the pending transposition process provides policy advice for effective implementation of the RED II with respect to RECs.

TI  - Humanizing sociotechnical transitions through energy justice: an ethical framework for global transformative change
PY  - 2018
AB  - Poverty, climate change and energy security demand awareness about the interlinkages between energy systems and social justice. Amidst these challenges, energy justice has emerged to conceptualize a world where all individuals, across all areas, have safe, affordable and sustainable energy that is, essentially, socially just. Simultaneously, new social and technological solutions to energy problems continually evolve, and interest in the concept of sociotechnical transitions has grown. However, an element often missing from such transitions frameworks is explicit engagement with energy justice frameworks. Despite the development of an embryonic set of literature around these themes, an obvious research gap has emerged: can energy justice and transitions frameworks be combined? This paper argues that they can. It does so through an exploration of the multi-level perspective on sociotechnical systems and an integration of energy justice at the model’s niche, regime and landscape level. It presents the argument that it is within the overarching process of sociotechnical change that issues of energy justice emerge. Here, inattention to social justice issues can cause injustices, whereas attention to them can provide a means to examine and potential resolve them.

TI  - Wind power—An assault on local landscapes or an opportunity for modernization?
PY  - 2012
AB  - Abstract Wind power development has produced controversies in many places. Some people see wind power as a sustainable source of energy, others see it as destroying nature and landscapes. The opposition to wind power is often asserted to be from local forces and NIMBYism, and support to be based on the national and global benefits of increased supply of renewable energy. In this paper, I challenge this view by analyzing how local communities with established or planned wind power parks went through the process of developing wind power, what arguments they used and how they think about the wind power technology and its expected local effects. I found that most of the arguments in favor of wind power development addressed local concerns regarding the economy, modernization, and employment opportunities and not a need for sustainable energy. The opposition to wind power development was not based on NIMBYism. Rather, many different arguments were used, and the features of the controversies were distinct to each community.

TI  - Temporal and spatial development of red deer harvesting in Europe: biological and cultural factors
PY  - 2006
AB  - Summary 1. Deer numbers have increased dramatically throughout Europe and North America over the last century, but empirical analyses of variation in harvesting and the influence of biological and cultural factors are lacking. 2. We examined trends in size and composition of red deer Cervus elaphus harvests over the last three to four decades in 11 European countries with contrasting deer productivity, management strategies and hunting traditions. 3. The harvest increased exponentially in all countries except Austria and Germany, where it was stable, and Poland, where it has declined in recent years. Harvest growth rates ranged from 0·009 in Austria to 0·075 in Sweden and depended on the management system and harvest composition, being negatively related to the proportion of females in the adult harvest. 4. Within four focal countries (France, Hungary, Norway and Scotland), there was considerable spatial variation in harvest growth rates. These tended to be higher in recently colonized areas than in traditional hunting areas and were often higher than the maximum possible population growth rate. Range expansion was an important component of the increase in total harvest in France and Scotland, but not in Hungary or Norway. 5. Harvest composition was available for seven countries, all of which showed a strong increase in the proportion of calves in the harvest. The sex ratio of the adult harvest was relatively stable, being strongly male-biased in Norway and marginally femalebiased elsewhere. The proportion of males in the harvest was unrelated to trophy hunting objectives. 6. Synthesis and applications . Our study emphasizes that cultural aspects of management need to be accounted for, as well as biological factors, when interpreting the patterns of harvest growth and composition across Europe. Widespread sustained harvest growth has occurred, suggesting continued growth of deer populations with consequent social and economic impacts. Population control is therefore a major challenge for the future, currently hampered by inadequate population data and a decreasing number of hunters in some countries. Increasing the motivation of hunters to harvest female deer is one possible solution, although this may conflict with hunting traditions and economic considerations in some areas.

TI  - Colour infrared aerial photography as a tool for vegetation mapping and change detection in environmental studies of Nordic ecosystems: A review
PY  - 2007
AB  - The aim of the paper is to sum up knowledge of colour infrared (CIR) aerial photography as a tool for vegetation data for mapping and monitoring in environmental and biodiversity surveys and change detection surveillance. It compiles thirty years of research of the main ecosystems in Swedish vegetation, where the overall goal was to develop methods for mapping and monitoring vegetation by use of CIR aerial photographs, assess the accuracy compared to field-based mapping and to implement them as a tool in nature conservation and environmental planning. The methods include development of a classification system, identification and analysis of indicators, development of interpretation techniques, and evaluation compared to the data collected in the field. The CIR observable criteria are colour, texture, pattern, size, form, and density, based on spectral reflectance, physiognomy, life forms, ecological conditions, moisture and nutrition, vegetation period and phenology, topography, site conditions, and management methods. The methods have been used to produce vegetation maps of mountains, boreal forests, and mires in northern and central Sweden, in national inventories of wetlands, ancient meadows and pastures, key biotopes in forests and for monitoring agricultural landscapes.

TI  - The role of politics in sustainable transitions: The rise and decline of offshore wind in Norway
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract This paper studies how political conditions and external events influenced the rise and fall of offshore wind on the political agenda in Norway between 2005 and 2012. In this sense, the paper contributes to recent debates about the role of politics in sustainable transitions. Key findings are that changes in government posts combined with a need for the offshore petroleum industry to diversify created favourable conditions for offshore wind. However, offshore wind as a solution to articulated problems was insufficiently developed when the window of opportunity opened up. The analysis then shows how a recovery in the offshore petroleum industry and new changes inside government closed the window of opportunity. The paper concludes that we should attend more to the interests of government actors, and conflicts inside government, in the analysis of energy transitions.

TI  - Assessing the implications of the loss of set-aside for farmland birds.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Between 1988 and 2007, set-aside, a European Commission production control measure, took an average of 10% of arable farmland in the EU out of production each year. In 2007, the set-aside rate was set to 0% and the scheme was later abandoned altogether. By assessing associations of farmland birds with set-aside and quantifying the extent of set-aside loss, this study aims to assess the implications of set-aside loss for farmland bird conservation. During the lifespan of set-aside, a large number of studies assessed the biodiversity value of set-aside and other agricultural crops and habitats. Where possible we considered measurable benefits of set-aside. However, some studies did not specify the type of set-aside and in some cases set-aside fields were grouped with cereal stubble fields. In these cases, we took the pragmatic approach of assessing the value of generic stubble fields as a conservative minimum estimate of the value of set-aside fields. A re-analysis of data from 30 intensive studies demonstrates that farmland bird densities tended to be higher on set-aside than on either cereal or oilseed rape crops. Without mitigation, these are the two crops likely to replace most set-aside fields. We estimate that 26–52% of the farmland populations of key granivorous passerines were present on stubble fields, giving an indication of the proportion of birds likely to be present on set-aside fields within this broader category. An extensive survey of lowland farmland during winters 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2002/2003, repeated in February 2008, showed a doubling of the number of 1-km squares with no stubble and a halving of the number of squares with more than 10 ha of stubble. After set-aside abandonment, 72% of squares had no stubble in the important late winter period, confirming that many of the former stubble fields were retained as set-aside. A simple correlative model suggests that this could cause a small increase in the rate of decline of Skylark Alauda arvensis and Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella populations, assuming causal links between stubble area and demography. However, even if this assumption cannot be supported, these results clearly indicate that a significant proportion of some farmland bird populations will need to find alternative breeding and foraging habitats.

TI  - Performance of hunting statistics as spatiotemporal density indices of moose (Alces alces) in Norway
PY  - 2014
AB  - Wildlife managers are often asking for reliable information of population density across larger spatial scales. In this study, we examined the spatiotemporal relationships between moose density as estimated by cohort analysis and the density indices (1) harvest density (HD; hunter kills per km2), (2) moose seen per unit effort (SPUE), seen moose density (SMD; seen moose per km2), and density of moose-vehicle accidents (MVA density; e.g., traffic kills per km2) in 16 areas in Norway with 13–42 years of data. HD showed a close positive relationship with moose density both within and between regions. However, the temporal variation in HD was best explained as a delayed reflection of moose density and tended to overestimate its growth and decline. Conversely, SMD and SPUE were unable to predict the spatial variation in moose density with high precision, though both indices were relatively precise temporal reflectors of moose density. However, the SPUE tended to underestimate population growth, probably because of a decrease in searching efficiency with increasing moose density. Compared to the other indices, MVA density performed poor as an index of moose density within regions, and not at all among regions, but may, because of its independent source of data, be used to cross-check population trends suggested by other indices. Our study shows that the temporal trends in moose density can be surveyed over large areas by the use of cheap indices based on data collected by hunters and local managers, and supports the general assumption that the number of moose killed per km2 provides a precise and isometric index of the variation in moose density at the spatial scale of our study.

TI  - Natural climate solutions
PY  - 2017
AB  - Better stewardship of land is needed to achieve the Paris Climate Agreement goal of holding warming to below 2 °C; however, confusion persists about the specific set of land stewardship options available and their mitigation potential. To address this, we identify and quantify "natural climate solutions" (NCS): 20 conservation, restoration, and improved land management actions that increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas emissions across global forests, wetlands, grasslands, and agricultural lands. We find that the maximum potential of NCS-when constrained by food security, fiber security, and biodiversity conservation-is 23.8 petagrams of CO2 equivalent (PgCO2e) y-1 (95% CI 20.3-37.4). This is ≥30% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y-1) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is ≥100 USD MgCO2e-1 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a >66% chance of holding warming to below 2 °C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2-1 Most NCS actions-if effectively implemented-also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates. Nevertheless, existing knowledge reported here provides a robust basis for immediate global action to improve ecosystem stewardship as a major solution to climate change.

TI  - Back to the Future: The Potential of Intergenerational Justice for the Achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals
PY  - 2018
AB  - The establishment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) bolstered momentum to achieve a sustainable future. Undeniably, the welfare of future generations is a fundamental value of sustainable development since the publication of the Brundtland report. Nevertheless, SDGs and their targets are meagre on intergenerational justice concerns. The 15-year target horizon of the SDGs might be beneficial for implementation reasons. However, such a short-term perspective is far from innocuous in justice terms. It jeopardises the establishment of long-term goals, which protect both present and future people. This article advocates for clearer stances on intergenerational justice. What type of distributive principles could and should dictate the present socio-economic development? Looking at intragenerational justice principles contained in SDGs does not provide a full answer since they express conflicting visions of what constitutes a fair development. Furthermore, a fair distribution of the development benefits and burdens among present and near future people does not necessarily guarantee the wellbeing of more distant generations. I propose an intergenerational sufficientarian perspective as a way of extending the beneficial impacts of SDGs to both close and distant future generations. Hopefully, it facilitates the translation of the SDGs into policies that promote fairer implementation strategies.

TI  - The impacts of landscape structure on the winter movements and habitat selection of female red deer
PY  - 2014
AB  - An area of research that has recently gained more attention is to understand how species respond to environmental change such as the landscape structure and fragmentation. Movement is crucial to select habitats but the landscape structure influences the movement patterns of animals. Characterising the movement characteristics, utilisation distribution (UD) and habitat selection of a single species in different landscapes can provide important insights into species response to changes in the landscape. We investigate these three fields in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in southern Sweden, in order to understand how landscape structure influences their movement and feeding patterns. Movements are compared between two regions, one dominated by a fragmented agriculture–forest mosaic and the other by managed homogenous forest. Red deer in the agriculture-dominated landscape had larger UDs compared to those in the forest-dominated area, moved larger distances between feeding and resting and left cover later in the day but used a similar duration for their movements, suggesting faster travelling speeds between resting and feeding locations. The habitat selection patterns of red deer indicate a trade-off between forage and cover, selecting for habitats that provide shelter during the day and forage by night. However, the level of trade-off, mediated through movement and space use patterns, is influenced by the landscape structure. Our approach provides further understanding of the link between individual animal space use and changing landscapes and can be applied to many species able to carry tracking devices.

TI  - Barriers to path creation: the case of offshore wind power in Norway
PY  - 2018
AB  - abstractAlthough economic geography has made considerable progress in explaining the emergence of new industrial development paths, a number of issues have yet to be sufficiently explored. The purpose of this article is to contribute to economic geography research on path creation by developing a conceptual framework that specifies key conditions and reinforcing mechanisms for path creation, on the one hand, and barriers to the materialization of such conditions and mechanisms, on the other hand. As such, the framework moves beyond firm-centric perspectives and argues that path creation needs to be understood as a collective endeavor incorporating both firm and nonfirm actors. By implication, this necessitates an understanding of the broader contexts that shape path creation processes, including how the dynamics of an emerging path are affected by the dynamics of established paths. The authors employ this framework to analyze Norway’s offshore wind power (OWP) industry. Their analysis reveals that an init...

TI  - Temporal echoes and cross-geography policy effects: Multiple levels of transition governance and the electric vehicle breakthrough
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract This article analyses the Norwegian electric vehicle transition from a socio-technical perspective, shedding light on the emergence of one of the most important EV markets globally. The Norwegian strategy to promote this transition is often understood as a set of targeted policies to create EV demand. Here, we illustrate how visions and incentives for a Norwegian EV transition have emerged over a period of 40 years, highlighting how many of the incentives were actually introduced as mechanisms to stimulate the creation of a Norwegian EV industry niche. Conceptually, we contribute to understandings of the complex geographies of niche creation through discussions of how local policies can have trans-local and global effects. Further, we identify dynamics we describe as temporal echoes, which illustrate how visions, strategies or policies introduced at a specific point in time to serve a particular purpose might unexpectedly re-appear later, transformed, to serve different purposes.

TI  - Transformative governance of biodiversity: insights for sustainable development
PY  - 2021
AB  - While there is much debate on transformative change among academics and policymakers, the discussion on how to govern such change is still in its infancy. This article argues that transformative governance is needed to enable the transformative change necessary for achieving global sustainability goals. Based on a literature review, the article unpacks this concept of transformative governance. It is: integrative, to ensure local solutions also have sustainable impacts elsewhere (across scales, places, issues and sectors); inclusive, to empower those whose interests are currently not being met and represent values embodying transformative change for sustainability; adaptive, enabling learning, experimentation, and reflexivity, to cope with the complexity of transformative change; and pluralist, recognizing different knowledge systems. We argue that only when these four governance approaches are: implemented in conjunction; operationalized in a specific manner; and focused on addressing the indirect drivers underlying sustainability issues, governance becomes transformative.

TI  - A Paradox Perspective on Corporate Sustainability: Descriptive, Instrumental, and Normative Aspects
PY  - 2017
AB  - The last decade has witnessed the emergence of a paradox perspective on corporate sustainability. By explicitly acknowledging tensions between different desirable, yet interdependent and conflicting sustainability objectives, a paradox perspective enables decision makers to achieve competing sustainability objectives simultaneously and creates leeway for superior business contributions to sustainable development. In stark contrast to the business case logic, a paradox perspective does not establish emphasize business considerations over concerns for environmental protection and social well-being at the societal level. In order to contribute to the consolidation of this emergent field of research, we offer a definition of the paradox perspective on corporate sustainability and a framework to delineate its descriptive, instrumental, and normative aspects. This framework clarifies the paradox perspective’s contents and its implications for research and practice. We use the framework to map the contributions to this thematic symposium on paradoxes in sustainability and to propose questions for future research.

TI  - Habitat-specific bird trends and their effect on the Farmland Bird Index
PY  - 2013
AB  - Farmland birds in Europe have declined in numbers from the last decades, as reflected in the Farmland Bird Index (FBI), a multi-species indicator of population trends adopted by the European Union. Some of these farmland bird species breed to a varying degree also in non-farmland habitats: however, the indicator is calculated using trends estimated from all birds counted of each species, irrespective of habitat. Consequently, when interpreting indicators of farmland birds, it is important to know the influence of including the trends of the populations in non-farmland habitats. We estimated national and regional bird-habitat relationships and population trends of 14 of the species included in the Swedish version of FBI. Bird data came from the Swedish Bird Survey (1996-2008) including 716 separate routes, and detailed habitat data came from the Swedish Board of Agriculture (1999-2008). The proportion of individuals that occurred in non-farmland habitats ranged from 2% to 96%. Local densities were generally highest in farmland habitats, but because only 7-8% of the surface of Sweden is farmland, even low local densities in non-farmland sum up to high national totals. With few exceptions, the temporal trends of species were independent of the amount of farmland on routes, suggesting similar trends within and outside farmland. Accordingly, incorporating data on farmland birds from non-farmland habitats had only a limited effect on the FBI. But given that habitat-specific trends may well occur, it is important that multi-species indices are checked for potential habitat-specific differences among the included species.

TI  - The concept of energy justice across the disciplines
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract Over the last decade, ‘Energy Justice’ is a concept that has emerged in research across many disciplines. This research explores the role and value of the energy justice concept across the disciplines. It provides the first critical account of the emergence of the energy justice concept in both research and practice. A diagrammatical image for examining the energy justice concepts is presented and this is a tool for interdisciplinary engagement with the concept. In this context, restorative justice is introduced and how it results in energy justice applying in practice is detailed. Energy research scholarship at universities is assessed and it is clear that through universities there is a platform for energy justice scholarship to build on the interdisciplinary energy scholarship at universities. Further, the role of education is vital to policy-making, and the understanding and development of the energy justice concept. Finally, in analysing how the energy justice concept can impact on policy-making, there is a critical examination of the energy justice and its relationship with economics, and how it can transfer directly into practice by assisting in balancing the competing aims of the energy trilemma.

TI  - Impacts of land use on the vegetation in three rural landscapes of Norway
PY  - 2012
AB  - Long-term and varied land use has had a major influence on the vegetation in rural Norway, and the traditional open landscapes are now being replaced by forests. In the present investigation, we assess and quantify structural vegetation changes caused by changes in land use and climate. Up-to-date actual vegetation maps from three rural study areas were compared with interpreted historical vegetation maps and potential natural vegetation (PNV) models. Our findings indicate that the present vegetation structure is strongly influenced by land use. In the studied sites, 56–66% of the areas presently have another vegetation type than expected from a natural state (PNV). The mean turnover of vegetation types in the study areas during the past 35–40 years was 25%. Our study highlights that the influence of land-use needs to be accounted for when considering the effects of climate change.

TI  - CONFRONTING MULTICOLLINEARITY IN ECOLOGICAL MULTIPLE REGRESSION
PY  - 2003
AB  - The natural complexity of ecological communities regularly lures ecologists to collect elaborate data sets in which confounding factors are often present. Although multiple regression is commonly used in such cases to test the individual effects of many explanatory variables on a continuous response, the inherent collinearity (multicollinearity) of confounded explanatory variables encumbers analyses and threatens their statistical and inferential interpretation. Using numerical simulations, I quantified the impact of multicollinearity on ecological multiple regression and found that even low levels of collinearity bias analyses (r ≥ 0.28 or r2 ≥ 0.08), causing (1) inaccurate model parameterization, (2) decreased statistical power, and (3) exclusion of significant predictor variables during model creation. Then, using real ecological data, I demonstrated the utility of various statistical techniques for enhancing the reliability and interpretation of ecological multiple regression in the presence of multic...

TI  - A general and simple method for obtaining R2 from generalized linear mixed-effects models
PY  - 2012
AB  - Summary The use of both linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution. Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for mixed-effects models. The presentation of ‘variance explained’ (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore, most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models) and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g. implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects models. We then recommend a general and simple method for calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be widely employed by researchers in any fields of research, regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the presentation of R2 for a wide range of circumstances.

TI  - Forest regrowth and cultural heritage sites in Norway and along the Norwegian St Olav pilgrim routes.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Pilgrims travel along the main reopened St Olav pilgrim routes in Norway and visit a variety of cultural heritage types. These routes are part of a value creation programme, in which the management authorities try to increase the numbers of pilgrims. At the same time, forest regrowth is reported to reduce the landscape experience of pilgrims and to biophysically change the cultural heritage sites. However, no studies have been reported on the spatial encroachments of forests along the pilgrim routes. The purpose of this study is to analyse where forest regrowth along the main reopened pilgrim routes in Norway will appear, given the present climatic conditions, and to assess the spatial overlap of future forest regrowth with cultural heritage sites. A potential forest model and a cultural heritage sites database were combined with several baseline geographical data layers and spatially joined in geographical information systems. The results show that most of the future forest regrowth will appear in mounta...

TI  - Challenges in delivering climate change policy through land use targets for afforestation and peatland restoration
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract Climate change policy for the land sector is challenged by complex biophysical and socioeconomic contexts. A target approach utilising land-use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress, based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions. This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration, both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits, with uptake typically supported by grant incentives. A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments (net-zero emissions by 2045). Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration, referenced against biophysical data, showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture, usually on wetter uncultivated semi-natural land, often on organic soils. This acts to constrain net carbon gains. Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations, regardless of biophysical opportunities, highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors. Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups. Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes, especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land, which will constrain long-term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly. Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets (e.g. trees planted) as headline progress indicators can be misleading, potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets. A more spatially targeted approach is required to maximise GHG reductions relative to local contexts. Recommendations are made for improved measures that recognise spatial and temporal variability, as exemplified by certification schemes.

TI  - Structural analyses of features in cultural landscapes based on historical cadastral maps and GIS
PY  - 2005
AB  - A landscape may appear to be ancient and to contain old man-made structures even if this is not the whole truth. Structures are moved, removed, replaced and added over the years. New users introduce new land use and management regimes. In Norway, information from land consolidation processes is crucially important in gaining a better understanding of the history, dynamics and development of farms, identifying older traces of human activity and selecting important areas for protection and management. When cadastral maps are transformed, common points are needed during the transformation process and for testing the accuracy of the final transformation. It is often difficult to find enough common points to satisfy statistical requirements. Paper I presents a simple method using buffers based on linear features to evaluate whether or not the accuracy of the transformation results is better than the known accuracy of the source. Papers II, III and IV show how digitised and geographically referenced historical cadastral maps can be used to reconstruct the situation at various dates back to the 19th century, and for some information back to the 16th century. The digitised cadastral map provides a snapshot of the situation at the time of the land consolidation process, and the information is considered to be very exact. Paper IV also demonstrates how a DEM (digital elevation model) can add significantly to an understanding of the information contained in the land consolidation material. The use of digitised cadastral maps reveals that many man-made structures generally perceived as old, because they are constructed using traditional techniques, in fact date from after the land consolidation process. One aim of the new European Landscape Convention is to promote landscape protection, management and planning. It therefore requires identification of landscapes and analysis of their characteristics and the forces and pressures transforming them. Using land consolidation material in a GIS makes it possible to document changes in a landscape and improve understanding of the pressures behind these changes.

TI  - Red deer (Cervus elaphus) bark stripping on spruce with regard to spatial distribution of supplemental feeding places
PY  - 2008
AB  - Forest damages caused by red deer and some other large herbivore species occasionally feeding on tree bark, are a grave ecological and economic problem in many parts of the world. Winter supplemental feeding is commonly used to mitigate the problem, but its effects are poorly known. this study, carried out at Pohorje (Slovenia) and including over 2,300 trees, used binary logistic regression to analyse the effects of supplemental feeding and many other factors on the probability of bark stripping on spruce. the probability of bark stripping depends on distance from the forest edge, density, age and tree species diversity of stands, slope and aspect of terrain, and red deer density; contrary to expectations, it is not related to distance from feeding places. as much as 35% of spruce trees were damaged. the damage was the highest in younger, denser pure spruce stands, whose favourable protective and microclimatic conditions (thinner snow cover, higher effective temperatures) make them a preferred winter habitat for red deer. they contain, however, little other food but bark. to prevent / diminish bark stripping we propose a stronger thinning of such stands. Supplemental feeding may reduce damage only in exceptional cases, when animals are lured and concentrated in less sensitive areas, but in general we advise against the use of this measure due to its other negative effects.

TI  - Out of Sight, out of Mind? Controversy over Offshore Wind Energy in Norway's News Media
PY  - 2016
AB  - AbstractNews media are important reference points for public sense-making of emerging technology. In Norway, offshore wind can be considered an emerging technology. Siting renewable energy technology offshore is commonly regarded as a solution to onshore implementation problems, as development happens ‘out of sight, out of mind’ of the public. However, does moving renewable energy technology offshore really prevent controversy? How is emerging offshore wind technology made comprehensible in Norwegian news media? The dominance of supporting actors and arguments in the Norwegian news media discourse on offshore wind energy technology and the high prevalence of the argument that offshore wind should be non-controversial due to its placement ‘out of sight’ suggest that the expectation that such technology will prevent controversy has been partly met. Still, the emerging technology has been accompanied by an evolving controversy, though with a different extent and focus than the controversy over onshore wind. ...

TI  - The impacts of agricultural change (1963–2003) on the grassland flora of Central England: processes and prospects
PY  - 2005
AB  - Summary The goal of UK agricultural policy between the late 1940s and the 1980s has been increased agricultural production. Since the build-up of huge agricultural surpluses in the mid-1980s, there has been a shift towards more environmentally sensitive policies. Here we have studied the impact of these policies on the grassland flora of Central England. We present evidence that an agricultural assessment of the ‘potential quality of land for agriculture’ defines the basic properties of the ecological landscape. In the agriculturally favoured lowlands nearly all of the grassland, both improved and semi-natural, has been replaced by arable fields. Little semi-natural grassland remains and is generally abandoned. Nationally important conservation sites for grassland are few and in poor condition. Rates of extinction of locally rare grassland species are high. Within the uplands, which are less suitable for productive agriculture, grasslands predominate and, even though half of the species-rich meadows disappeared between 1980 and 1995, the area has much greater conservation interest. The conservation problems facing grasslands within our study area (small, typically abandoned remnants of semi-natural grassland in agriculturally productive landscapes, larger grazed sites in regions of lower agricultural productivity) appear similar to those elsewhere in UK and in other CLIMB sites. This suggests that common European solutions for the conservation of grasslands can and should be sought. In particular, since conservation appears more effective in areas of lower agricultural productivity, we should pay more attention to relationships between fertility and economic yield. We should consider whether some current agri-environment schemes, particularly national ones involving flat-rate payments, are appropriate tools for the conservation of a country's natural grassland heritage.

TI  - Hotspots of land use change in Europe
PY  - 2016
AB  - Assessing changes in the extent and management intensity of land use is crucial to understanding land-system dynamics and their environmental and social outcomes. Yet, changes in the spatial patterns of land management intensity, and thus how they might relate to changes in the extent of land uses, remains unclear for many world regions. We compiled and analyzed high-resolution, spatially-explicit land-use change indicators capturing changes in both the extent and management intensity of cropland, grazing land, forests, and urban areas for all of Europe for the period 1990-2006. Based on these indicators, we identified hotspots of change and explored the spatial concordance of area versus intensity changes. We found a clear East-West divide with regard to agriculture, with stronger cropland declines and lower management intensity in the East compared to the West. Yet, these patterns were not uniform and diverging patterns of intensification in areas highly suitable for farming, and disintensification and cropland contraction in more marginal areas emerged. Despite the moderate overall rates of change, many regions in Europe fell into at least one land-use change hotspot during 1990-2006, often related to a spatial reorganization of land use (i.e., co-occurring area decline and intensification or co-occurring area increase and disintensification). Our analyses highlighted the diverse spatial patterns and heterogeneity of land-use changes in Europe, and the importance of jointly considering changes in the extent and management intensity of land use, as well as feedbacks among land-use sectors. Given this spatial differentiation of land-use change, and thus its environmental impacts, spatially-explicit assessments of land-use dynamics are important for context-specific, regionalized land-use policy making.

TI  - Human activities and biodiversity opportunities in pre‐industrial cultural landscapes: relevance to conservation
PY  - 2016
AB  - 1. Conservation practices in Europe frequently attempt to perpetuate or mimic the ‘traditional’ forms of management of semi-natural habitats, but with a limited understanding of what these entailed. 2. We review the emerging understanding of ecological processes, structures and management interventions that enhance biodiversity (wildlife) at diverse scales. These are then examined in the context of pre-industrial (c. 1200-1750) land management systems in lowland England, in order to identify historic practices which are likely to have provided important wildlife resources, but which are relatively neglected in current conservation management. 3. Principles enhancing alpha and beta diversity and the conservation status of threatened species, include: structural complexity and heterogeneity at nested spatial scales; physical disturbance and exposure of mineral substrate; nutrient removal; lengthened successional rotations; and spatial variation in grazing regimes. 4. The available evidence suggests that pre-industrial management was generally characterised by: intense resource exploitation and significant levels of biomass harvest; complex nested structural heterogeneity both between and within landscape elements; overlaying of multiple land-uses; and spatial and temporal variability in management, rendering the concept of long-lived ‘traditional’ practice problematic. Grazing patterns are poorly understood but intensive grazing was probably the norm in most contexts, potentially resulting in simplified sward structures and suppressed ecotonal vegetation. 5. In much of the pre-industrial period, early-successional and disturbed microhabitats were widespread but ungrazed or lightly grazed herb-rich vegetation may have been limited, the converse of current conservation management. The key change since then has been homogenisation at multiple scales, coupled with reduction of specific niches and conditions. 6. Synthesis and applications: In adopting perceived ‘traditional’ management practices, modern conservation rarely achieves the range and complexity of conditions that were present in the past. A better understanding of past practices allows more favourable management of those surviving semi-natural habitats where historic assemblages persist – with greater emphasis on physical disturbance and variability in prescriptions both temporally and spatially. When creating or restoring habitats, after interruption of management sufficiently long for dependent assemblages to be lost, better appreciation of historic management encourages novel forms of intervention to enhance biodiversity, with emphasis on complex structural and spatial heterogeneity at nested scales, biomass removal and nutrient reduction. These two distinct but overlapping approaches are complementary to the use of large herbivores to create and maintain dynamic ecotonal mosaics in the manner advocated by some proponents of ‘rewilding’.

TI  - Climate and land-use change as driving forces in lowland semi-natural vegetation dynamics
PY  - 2011
AB  - In many parts of Europe, extensive changes in vegetation have taken place during recent decades. In Norway, forest expansion is a major trend, with an increase in volume of 20.3% during the period 1994-2008. The annual increase has more than doubled since 1967. This study was carried out to gain more insight into the complexity of vegetation dynamics and alterations in a lowland area on the coast of W Norway, and to identify the driving forces behind these changes. Field surveys were carried out with aerial photo interpretation and vegetation mapping. Spatial analysis was carried out using GIS. Historical sources were identified, interpreted, and used to generate information on land-use during recent centuries. Supplementary methods consisted of soil profile analysis and dendrochronology. Climate data were used to analyse climatic trends in the past 90 years since 1923. Forest expansion was a major trend during 1956-1994. In 1956, 49.5% of the area was covered by forest, and by 1994 the coverage had increased with 53.4%. Forestation continued during 1994-2003 and 2003-2007, but at rates far lower than in the previous period (4.0 and 3.8% increases, compared to 53.4%). Forest expansion was most extensive during 1956-1994, a period with no clear trend in mean July temperatures. A distinct increase in mean July temperatures occurred during the period 1994-2003 and again in 2003-2007, when the rate of forestation was far lower than in previous decades. This is an indication that a factor other than climate change is the most important driving force for vegetation change, forest expansion in particular. Forestation did not start simultaneously throughout all parts of the study area, but at different times on different landholdings. Forestation initially started on plots where livestock grazing first came to an end (in the 1930s), and lastly on plots where grazing came to an end three decades later, in the 1960s. The different starting times of forestation is reflected in the present age structure of the forest stands on the eight landholdings studied. The conclusion is drawn that changes in land-use are the major driving force behind the distinct process of forestation that occurred during the 20th century.

TI  - Is political steering gone with the wind? Administrative power and wind energy licensing practices in Norway
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract The conflicts and potential trade-offs between renewable energy development and nature protection are evident in policies aimed at promoting windpower, particularly in nature areas under high pressure from human activities. However, surprisingly little is known about the influence of political steering on windpower licensing practices. This article examines how political steering has affected the weight accorded to environmental considerations in the licensing practices of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). We find that the NVE enjoys significant discretion in interpreting and implementing political decisions, and that the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (OED) has not provided clear steering signals regarding nature protection. Political pressures for expanded renewable energy production are reflected in the significant attention paid to economic and technical considerations in the licensing process. We conclude that ministerial steering signals and the NVE’s technocratic culture have pushed in the same direction: greater development of windpower, at the expense of transparent and predictable consideration for nature concerns.

TI  - Global soil carbon: understanding and managing the largest terrestrial carbon pool
PY  - 2014
AB  - Carbon stored in soils worldwide exceeds the amount of carbon stored in phytomass and the atmosphere. Despite the large quantity of carbon stored as soil organic carbon (SOC), consensus is lacking on the size of global SOC stocks, their spatial distribution, and the carbon emissions from soils due to changes in land use and land cover. This article summarizes published estimates of global SOC stocks through time and provides an overview of the likely impacts of management options on SOC stocks. We then discuss the implications of existing knowledge of SOC stocks, their geographical distribution and the emissions due to management regimes on policy decisions, and the need for better soil carbon science to mitigate losses and enhance soil carbon stocks.

TI  - Elite energy transitions: Leaders and experts promoting renewable energy futures in Norway
PY  - 2022
AB  - This article shows how energy transitions are advanced by energy elites – the leaders and experts of energy companies. While the dominant literature suggests that elites resist societal changes, this research highlights that energy elites are instrumental in the promotion of energy transitions. The findings in this article are based on 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork in energy companies based in Oslo, Norway, and analysed using anthropological perspectives. The research has found that energy elites, faced with climate change concerns, re-imagined energy futures and accordingly reoriented their careers. Out of a total of 109 energy elites interviewed, 30% decided to leave the hydrocarbon sector in pursuit of careers in renewables. As energy elites left their occupations in oil and gas, they inspired others – including elites and non-elites – to follow suit. This suggests that elites are not only crucial to the pursuit of energy transitions but can also be key pillars of promoting societal changes. What is more, the research demonstrates that elites do not operate in isolation. Factors like social networks, politico-economic contexts, and changes in investor climates all contribute to the promotion of low-carbon energy futures. This article provides a deeper understanding of the multifaceted drivers of energy transitions – in Norway and beyond.

TI  - The renewable energy policy Paradox
PY  - 2018
AB  - Abstract One major avenue for policymakers to meet climate targets is by decarbonizing the power sector, one component of which is raising the share of renewable energy sources (renewables) in electricity generation. However, promoting renewables --in liberalized power markets-- creates a paradox in that successful penetration of renewables could fall victim to its own success. With the current market architecture, future deployment of renewable energy will necessarily be more costly and less scalable. Moreover, transition towards a full 100% renewable electricity sector is unattainable. Paradoxically, in order for renewable technologies to continue growing their market share, they need to co-exist with fossil fuel technologies. Ignoring these findings can slow adoption and increase the costs of deploying new renewable technologies. This paper spots the incompatibility between electricity liberalization and renewable policy, regardless of the country, location or renewable technologies. The Paradox holds as long as market clear prices with short term marginal costs, and renewable technology's marginal cost is close to zero and not dispatchable.

TI  - Diversity of butterflies in the agricultural landscape: the role of farming system and landscape heterogeneity.
PY  - 2000
AB  - To examine the importance of management practices and landscape structure on diversity of butterflies 16 farms with organic or conventional management were censused during 1997 and 1998. On each farm a transect route was walked during July and the beginning of August, six times in 1997 and five times in 1998. The farms were located in the central part of Sweden in two adjacent regions with the same pool of species. The organic and conventional farms were paired with help of the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index according to land use to control for landscape structure on the farm level. On each farm calculations were made of large- and small-scale landscape heterogeneity with the help of GIS. A grid with a mesh size of 400 m was placed over each farm and the small-scale heterogeneity was calculated as the mean habitat diversity of four squares. The large-scale landscape heterogeneity described the landscape in which the farms were imbedded, and covered an area of 5x5 km. No differences in butterfly diversity, number of species or number of observations were noted between organic and conventional farms. Butterfly diversity was positively correlated with small-scale landscape heterogeneity while butterfly abundance was positively correlated with large-scale heterogeneity. Both large-scale and small-scale heterogeneity were important for the composition of species. The landscape structure seemed to be more important for butterfly diversity and species composition than the farming system in itself.

TI  - Trade unions’ interpretation of a just transition in a fossil fuel economy
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract Trade unions have received little attention in sustainability transitions research, despite their capacity to influence policy decisions. This article presents a study of how key unions in Norway a country with a large petroleum sector as well as high union level density – have moved their preferences on transition issues in the period 2007–2019. With a document-based process analysis of trade unions’ changing policy preferences and interpretations of a just transition, a concept that aims to bridge the apparent gap between destruction and creation policies, we show how trade unions have used this concept to reconcile different positions among unions. While unions from petroleumrelated sectors are more opposed to phase-out policies compared to non-petroleum unions, the solidarity principle among unions has caused some movement towards a joint support of a just transition. Yet, different unions promote different ideas of what a just transition means depending on their sector affiliation.

TI  - “Sustainability” in higher education: From doublethink and newspeak to critical thinking and meaningful learning
PY  - 2002
AB  - It is higher education’s responsibility to continuously challenge and critique value and knowledge claims that have prescriptive tendencies. Part of this responsibility lies in engaging students in socio‐scientific disputes. The ill‐defined nature of sustainability manifests itself in such disputes when conflicting values, norms, interests, and reality constructions meet. This makes sustainability – its need for contextualization and the debate surrounding it – pivotal for higher education. It offers an opportunity for reflection on the mission of our universities and colleges, but also a chance to enhance the quality of the learning process. This paper explores both the overarching goals and process of higher education from an emancipatory view and with regard to sustainability.

TI  - Mixed effects of organic farming and landscape complexity on farmland biodiversity and biological control potential across Europe
PY  - 2011
AB  - 1. Organic farming in Europe has been shown to enhance biodiversity locally, but potential interactions with the surrounding landscape and the potential effects on ecosystem services are less well known. 2. In cereal fields on 153 farms in five European regions, we examined how the species richness and abundance of wild plants, ground beetles and breeding birds, and the biological control potential of the area, were affected by organic and conventional farming, and how these effects were modified by landscape complexity (percentage of arable crops within 1000 m of the study plots). Information on biodiversity was gathered from vegetation plots, pitfall traps and by bird territory mapping. The biological control potential was measured as the percentage of glued, live aphids removed from plastic labels exposed in cereal fields for 24 h. 3. Predation on aphids was highest in organic fields in complex landscapes, and declined with increasing landscape homogeneity. The biological control potential in conventional fields was not affected by landscape complexity, and in homogenous landscapes it was higher in conventional fields than in organic fields, as indicated by an interaction between farming practice and landscape complexity. 4. A simplification of the landscape, from 20% to 100% arable land, reduced plant species richness by about 16% and cover by 14% in organic fields, and 33% and 5·5% in conventional fields. For birds, landscape simplification reduced species richness and abundance by 34% and 32% in organic fields and by 45·5% and 39% in conventional fields. Ground beetles were more abundant in simple landscapes, but were unaffected by farming practice. 5. Synthesis and applications. This Europe-wide study shows that organic farming enhanced the biodiversity of plants and birds in all landscapes, but only improved the potential for biological control in heterogeneous landscapes. These mixed results stress the importance of taking both local management and regional landscape complexity into consideration when developing future agri-environment schemes, and suggest that local-regional interactions may affect other ecosystem services and functions. This study also shows that it is not enough to design and monitor agri-environment schemes on the basis of biodiversity, but that ecosystem services should be considered too.

TI  - Supplemental feeding of migratory moose Alces alces: forest damage at two spatial scales
PY  - 2004
AB  - Landowners in southeast Norway have supplied moose Alces alces with ensilaged bales of hay for up to eight winters. The incentive has been to limit migratory movements into heavily trafficated winter areas and away from young forest plantations. In this article, we report on landscape characteristics that increase the use of feeding stations, and on how browsing activity on Scots pine Pinus sylvestris twigs as well as leader stems of both pine and Norway spruce Picea abies was associated with distance to feeding stations at two different spatial scales: 1) at a local scale we sampled data from 50 m2 observational plots up to 200 m from the feeding stations, and 2) at a regional scale we sampled data at all available young forest plantations up to 7 km from a feeding station. The probability that a feeding station was used increased towards the bottom of side valleys. The frequency of use of feeding stations increased annually, with increasing distance to other feeding stations, and with increasing distance to the more populated main valley. Moose-induced browse damage was extensive at proximate distances (< 200 m) to feeding stations, decreased to a minimum at 1–2 km, and increased slightly again at 3–7 km distance from less intensely used feeding stations. Indices of moose activity distribution (i.e. piles of faecal pellets) resembled browsing activity.

TI  - What shapes Norwegian wind power policy? Analysing the constructing forces of policymaking and emerging questions of energy justice
PY  - 2021
AB  - Abstract This paper employs an assemblage theoretical approach to analyse how Norwegian land-based wind power policies are constructed over time and what forces dominate and resist wind power policy development. The entanglement of policies, technology deployment and (lack of) social acceptance emphasizes the need to critically question what and who influence the construction of energy transition policies and how and what concerns are left out, especially in relation to the tenets of energy justice. We find that wind power policies are primarily influenced by energy authorities, developers and interest organizations, furthering arguments of climate concerns, energy security and economic opportunity. The emerging voices of local governments, environmental organizations and concerned citizens claim new political engagement related to valuations of (local) environmental, distributional and procedural justice and the recognition of alternative future energy imaginaries. The increase in conflicts and public debates has challenged national politicians to play a more active role in wind power policy making, which entails the reconsideration of wind power as an energy policy and critically judging what, for whom and how wind power should contribute to local, national and global energy transitions.

TI  - What role for CCS in delivering just transitions?: An evaluation in the North Sea region
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract This paper assesses the role of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in addressing challenges in the energy transition in regions reliant on carbon-intensive industries for employment and as an economic base. The assessment is based on semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders and experts in the Aberdeen area in Scotland, the Rotterdam harbour (or Rijnmond) area in the Netherlands, and in Norway. The interviews explored challenges around the role of CCS in regional ‘just transitions’, or how to make the transformation of regions relying on carbon-intensive industries to a low-carbon society fair. While significant differences in responses between the Aberdeen area, the Rijnmond area and Norway were found, a common understanding showed that for CCS to contribute to a just transition it has to (a) make a contribution to climate change imperatives; (b) help to mitigate the economic and employment effects arising from declining or maturing industries; and (c) be undertaken in a manner that helps to redress (or at least does not increase) uneven vulnerabilities and inequalities in society. Five key themes that characterise the opportunities and challenges for CCS from a just transition perspective were drawn from the interviews: Skills for a just transition, transition as an opportunity, responsibility, scale of action and viability. We recommend that these are added to earlier work on barriers and enablers of CCS in areas relying on fossil industry.

TI  - Home Ranges of Red Deer in a European Old-growth Forest
PY  - 2008
AB  - ABSTRACT We monitored four male and seven female red deer (Cervus elaphus) from Mar. 2001 to Mar. 2003 in Bialowieza National Park (BNP), Poland, to determine their home ranges in one of the best preserved old-growth forests in lowland Europe, and with large (>15 kg) carnivores present. Mean home-range size of adult males (36.0 km2) was significantly larger than adult females (8.4 km2). Seasonal home-range sizes differed significantly among seasons for both males and females, with the largest home ranges being in autumn for males (23.0 km2), and winter for females (7.1 km2). Inter-sexual differences in home ranges appeared to be influenced by differences in reproductive strategies and physiological needs. Both sexes exhibited strong range fidelity, although home ranges in different years overlapped more for individual males (93–100%) than females (71–90%). Home ranges of red deer in BNP were substantially larger than that reported in previous studies throughout Europe, suggesting that in old-growth forest...

TI  - Enabling transformative economic change in the post‐2020 biodiversity agenda
PY  - 2021
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on the global economy, and current delays in the negotiation of the post-2020 global biodiversity agenda of the Convention on Biological Diversity heighten the urgency to build back better for biodiversity, sustainability, and well-being. In 2019 the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) concluded that addressing biodiversity loss requires a transformative change of the global economic system. Drawing on the IPBES findings, this policy perspective discusses actions in four priority areas to inform the post-2020 agenda: (1) Increasing funding for conservation; (2) redirecting incentives for sustainability; (3) creating an enabling regulatory environment; and (4) reforming metrics to assess biodiversity impacts and progress toward sustainable and just goals. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made clear, and the negotiations for the post-2020 agenda have emphasized, governments are indispensable in guiding economic systems and must take an active role in transformations, along with businesses and civil society. These key actors must work together to implement actions that combine short-term impacts with structural change to shift economic systems away from a fixation with growth toward human and ecological well-being. The four priority areas discussed here provide opportunities for the post-2020 agenda to do so.

TI  - Solidarity tested: The case of the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO-Norway) and its contradictory climate change policies
PY  - 2020
AB  - <jats:p>The paper examines how organised labour as an important strategic actor in the political economy engages with climate change mitigation policies. By using The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO‐Norway) as a case study, we investigate how sectoral unions view the national confederation as a contested space of engagement in which they promote their positions on petroleum extraction and environmental conservation around the Lofoten archipelago. Affiliate unions of LO‐Norway legitimise their policy positions through claims of sectoral and regional representation. The analysis traces the confrontation of these policy positions as inter‐union solidarity was put to the test in the build‐up to the 2017 LO‐Norway congress. While an emerging climate agenda seemingly opened a discursive window for a policy shift within LO‐Norway at the 2017 congress, we show how institutional norms harnessed claims of sectoral and regional dependence and maintained unity within the national confederation.</jats:p>

TI  - A protocol for data exploration to avoid common statistical problems
PY  - 2009
AB  - Summary 1. While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.

TI  - Environmental variation and moose Alces alces density as determinants of spatio-temporal heterogeneity in browsing
PY  - 2009
AB  - Understanding temporal variation in habitat selection and browsing intensity by large herbivores is fundamental because of their large impact on the ecosystems. I studied the annual variation in winter browsing pressure on young trees and habitat selection by moose Alces alces over a ten year period. Specifically, the relationships between browsing pressure on Scots pine Pinus sylvestris and two birch species (Betula ssp.) and three explanatory variables – 1) availability of forage, 2) moose density (estimated by pellet group counts) and 3) snow cover was studied. At a larger spatial scale (forest stand level) the relationship between moose habitat selection between three different habitat types (forest 30 yr and mire) and two explanatory variables, 1) snow condition and 2) moose density, were studied. Browsing pressure on Scots pine, the dominating food plant, was related to forage availability, moose density and snow condition. No significant relationships between any of the three explanatory variables and browsing pressure on the two birch species were found. Moose selection for certain habitats varied between years and was affected by number of days with >0.10 m of snow. Habitat selection was not significantly related to moose density and the relationship between overall moose density and habitat specific moose densities was proportional within the studied density range. These findings have implications for understanding varying browsing patterns – and will affect both the ability to predict herbivores’ effect on the forest ecosystem. A snow dependent browsing pattern also indicates that one can expect a long term decrease in browsing pressure on the tree and shrub layer as a consequence of the ongoing large-scale climate change.

TI  - Diversifying diversity: Inclusive engagement, intersectionality, and gender identity in a European Social Sciences and Humanities Energy research project
PY  - 2020
AB  - Abstract This paper argues for inclusive engagement within Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) interdisciplinary research, particularly, energy and climate research, by reflecting on the attempts to implement an inclusive engagement approach in SHAPE ENERGY, a Horizon 2020 project aimed at creating a European energy-SSH platform where a broad range of viewpoints from researchers, businesses, policymakers, NGOs, and citizens could be brought to bear on energy policy discussions. The European Horizon 2020 funding program has sought to explicitly integrate gender considerations into their funded projects, including SHAPE ENERGY. Our study shows that, in spite of such ambitions, there was huge variety with regard to how gender was understood as well as how notions of gender were engaged with during the project. Dealing with gender was often reduced to counting men and women, while wider concerns, such as representations of age, geography, field of expertise, etc., were comparatively neglected. In this paper, we argue that gender equality strategies should embrace these wider perspectives to sufficiently address how various forms of intersectionality may inform and strengthen inclusive engagement.

TI  - Comparing land use impacts using ecosystem quality, biogenic carbon emissions, and restoration costs in a case study of hydropower plants in Norway
PY  - 2017
AB  - Habitat destruction is today the most severe threat to global biodiversity. Despite decades of efforts, there is still no proper methodology on how to assess all aspects of impacts on biodiversity from land use and land use changes (LULUC) in life cycle analysis (LCA). A majority of LCA studies on land extensive activities still do not include LULUC. In this study, we test different approaches for assessing the impact of land use and land use change related to hydropower for use in LCA and introduce restoration cost as a new approach. We assessed four hydropower plant projects in planning phase (two upgrading plants with reservoir and two new run-of-river plants) in Southern Norway with comparable geography, biodiversity, and annual energy production capacity. LULUC was calculated for each habitat type, based on mapping of present and future land use, and was further allocated to energy production for each power plant. Three different approaches to assess land use impact were included: ecosystem scarcity/vulnerability, biogenic greenhouse gas (bGHG) emissions, and the cost of restoring affected habitats. Restoration cost represents a novel approach to LCA for measuring impact of LULUC. Overall, the three approaches give similar rankings of impacts: larger impact for small and new power plants and less for larger and expanding existing plants. Reservoirs caused a larger total area affected. Permanent infrastructure has a more similar absolute impact for run-of-river and reservoir-based hydropower, and consequently give relatively larger impact for smaller run-of-river hydropower. All approaches reveal impacts on wetland ecosystems as most important relative to other ecosystems. The methods used for all three approaches would benefit from higher resolution data on land use, habitats, and soil types. Total restoration cost is not accurate, due to uncertainty of offset ratios, but relative restoration costs may still be used to rank restoration alternatives and compare them to the costs of biodiversity offsets. The different approaches assess different aspects of land use impacts, but they all show large variation of impact between the studied hydropower plants, which shows the importance of including LULUC in LCA for hydropower projects. Improved data of total restoration cost (and cost accounting) are needed to implement this approach in future LCA.

TI  - The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State: A History of Property Mapping
PY  - 1993
AB  - Throughout history the control of land has been the basis of power. Cadastral maps, records of property ownership, played an important role in the rise of modern Europe as tools for the consolidation and extension of land-based national power. The Cadastral Map in the Service of the State, illustrated with 126 maps, traces the development and application of rural property mapping in Europe from the Renaissance through the nineteenth century. Beginning with a review of the roots of cadastral mapping in the Roman Empire, the authors concentrate on the use of cadastral maps in the Netherlands, France, England, the Nordic countries, the German lands, the territories of the Austrian Habsburgs, and the European colonies. During the sixteenth century government institutions began to use maps to secure economic and political bases; by the nineteenth century these maps had become tools for aggressive governmental control of land as tax bases, natural resources, and national territories. This work demonstrates how the seemingly neutral science of cartography became a political instrument for national interests. The manuscript of Cadastral Maps in the Service of the State was awarded the Kenneth Nebenzahl Prize in 1991.

TI  - The effect of land type diversity and spatial heterogeneity on farmland birds in Norway
PY  - 2017
AB  - Abstract The decline in farmland birds observed throughout Europe during recent decades has attracted much attention. Agricultural intensification or land abandonment are commonly forwarded as key drivers. Several countries have established agri-environmental schemes (AES) to counter these negative trends among farmland birds. This paper reports a study of the relationship between land use and bird species in the agricultural landscape of Norway. The main objective was to investigate the effect of spatial heterogeneity and diversity of land use on total richness and abundance of farmland birds at a national level. Monitoring the distribution and abundance of birds is part of the Norwegian monitoring programme for agricultural landscapes. The monitoring programme is based on mapping of 1 × 1 km squares distributed across the entire agricultural landscape. Within these squares permanent observation points are established for bird monitoring. Detailed interpretation of aerial photographs provides the land classification. We tested the relationship between landscape metrics at different levels of land type detail and species richness and abundance of farmland and non-farmland birds. There was a positive relationship between species richness and abundance of farmland birds and agricultural area. For non-farmland birds the relationship was negative. Spatial heterogeneity of land use was a significant positive factor for both farmland and non-farmland species. High land type diversity was positive for farmland bird richness, but negative for abundance. Non-farmland bird richness was not affected by land type diversity, but abundance had a negative response. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of a spatial heterogeneous landscape. However, we also found that land type diversity could negatively affect the abundance of both farmland and non-farmland birds. Our findings suggest a need for different management approaches depending on whether the aim is increased species richness or abundance. Achieving both aims with the same means might be difficult. We thus suggest a need for land use analyses before proper management strategies can be implemented.

TI  - Coal, green growth and crises: Exploring three European Union policy responses to regional energy transitions
PY  - 2022
AB  - Despite increasing interest in energy transitions in the European Union, little attention has been paid conceptually to regional energy transitions in terms of development nor to the potential regional impacts of cumulative policies. A contextual understanding of regional energy transitions in Europe is therefore lacking. To address this gap, this paper considers regional energy transitions from a political economy perspective, using an institutional lens and critical varieties of capitalism approach to examine European Union policy responses within the scope of innovation driven and growth based regional development. Policy responses for regional energy transitions are first structured using crises as turning points and then explored in three themes: an energy transition with roots in coal regions; an energy transition that harnesses the green growth agenda; and an energy transition intensified by multiple crises. Going beyond the traditional economic aspects of regional policy and acknowledging the contradictions of green growth, critical reflection on these themes calls into question the extent of policy responses to address the potentially diverse regional futures enabled through the energy transition. Considering the aim of territorial cohesion, renewable energy resources and green innovation capacities can be seen as either sources of prosperity or aggravators of existing inequalities. Further attention is therefore needed toward current understandings of regional development in light of policy objectives and the sustainability ambitions of regional transitions. While limiting this analysis to the green growth logic, the arguments acknowledge critical perspectives that can potentially be brought into European policy perspectives for sustainable regional development.

TI  - Natural forage composition decreases deer browsing on Picea abies around supplemental feeding sites
PY  - 2014
AB  - In southern Sweden, maintaining high cervid densities through supplemental feeding has become a common management practice. We aim at investigating deer browsing pressure on young Norway spruce in relation to distance from supplemental feeding sites. Because available forage is considered important in understanding browsing patterns, we modeled several factors affecting food availability, and their interaction effect with distance. We confirmed earlier studies about a locally high browsing pressure on natural vegetation adjacent to supplemental feeding sites where browsing pressure declined with distance and alternative forage abundance. Novel is that browsing on spruce occurred in 27.6% of the investigated plots. The browsing pressure of those plots averaged 9%. Distance was the most important factor in relation to browsing. The interactive effect of occurring field layer (FL), and deciduous trees was also highlighted as these significantly affected the relationship between browsing pressure on spruce an...

TI  - Supplemental feeding of migratory moose <i>Alces alces</i>: forest damage at two spatial scales
PY  - 2004
AB  - <jats:p>Landowners in southeast Norway have supplied moose <jats:italic>Alces alces</jats:italic> with ensilaged bales of hay for up to eight winters. The incentive has been to limit migratory movements into heavily trafficated winter areas and away from young forest plantations. In this article, we report on landscape characteristics that increase the use of feeding stations, and on how browsing activity on Scots pine <jats:italic>Pinus sylvestris</jats:italic> twigs as well as leader stems of both pine and Norway spruce <jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic> was associated with distance to feeding stations at two different spatial scales: 1) at a local scale we sampled data from 50 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> observational plots up to 200 m from the feeding stations, and 2) at a regional scale we sampled data at all available young forest plantations up to 7 km from a feeding station. The probability that a feeding station was used increased towards the bottom of side valleys. The frequency of use of feeding stations increased annually, with increasing distance to other feeding stations, and with increasing distance to the more populated main valley. Moose‐induced browse damage was extensive at proximate distances (&lt; 200 m) to feeding stations, decreased to a minimum at 1–2 km, and increased slightly again at 3–7 km distance from less intensely used feeding stations. Indices of moose activity distribution (i.e. piles of faecal pellets) resembled browsing activity.</jats:p>

TI  - Ecological Impacts of Deer Overabundance
PY  - 2004
AB  - ▪ Abstract Deer have expanded their range and increased dramatically in abundance worldwide in recent decades. They inflict major economic losses in forestry, agriculture, and transportation and contribute to the transmission of several animal and human diseases. Their impact on natural ecosystems is also dramatic but less quantified. By foraging selectively, deer affect the growth and survival of many herb, shrub, and tree species, modifying patterns of relative abundance and vegetation dynamics. Cascading effects on other species extend to insects, birds, and other mammals. In forests, sustained overbrowsing reduces plant cover and diversity, alters nutrient and carbon cycling, and redirects succession to shift future overstory composition. Many of these simplified alternative states appear to be stable and difficult to reverse. Given the influence of deer on other organisms and natural processes, ecologists should actively participate in efforts to understand, monitor, and reduce the impact of deer on ...

TI  - Analysis of historic landscape patterns with a Geographical Information System — a methodological outline
PY  - 1993
AB  - Various methods for storing, retrieving, and analyzing historic land use records by means of electronic data processing are evaluated. The procedures are illustrated with data from a pilot study on the Swiss Plateau which is part of a broader landscape historical monitoring program at the Swiss Federal Institute of Forest, Snow and Landscape Research. The land use matrix was derived from topographic maps, aerial photographs and other land use records and spans approximately 100 yrs with an updating cycle of 7 to 20 yrs. A special technique was developed to generate series of digital maps and to superimpose the data layers of various time steps. Each landscape element is described with time-stamped attributes to ensure access to the entire “life history” from any point in space or time. The proposed data model proved to be a powerful tool for routine updating of digital maps. It can be used by practitioners as well as scientists working with Geographical Information Systems (ARC/INFO or similar package). With this procedure, disturbance maps over any number of available updates can be quickly generated, allowing the user to identify zones of similar degrading or upgrading tendency. The procedures for analyzing changing landscape structures include calculation of information theoretic indices (diversity, dominance), calculation of fractals, edge analysis, as well as landscape assessment along random traverses. The latter proved to be especially powerful, where barrier/habitat frequencies were evaluated. On the basis of all parameters calculated, landscape structures on the study plot seem to be ecologically most favorable in the 1930's followed by a strong degradation in the World War II - and the post-World War II period. In contrast to many hypotheses, the landscape structures in the second half of the 19th century were structurally less favorable than between 1900 and 1930.

TI  - ESTABLISHING NATIVE FORBS TO REDUCE BLACK-TAILED DEER BROWSING DAMAGE TO DOUGLAS-FIR
PY  - 1978
AB  - Author(s): Campbell, Dan L.; Evans, James | Abstract: Principal methods being used to alleviate browsing damage to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings by black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) in the Pacific Northwest are animal repellents applied to foliage and plastic mesh cylinders around individual seedlings. As an alternate method, we demonstrated that prompt establishment of highly palatable native forbs reduced summer browsing on planted seedlings to the point that black-tailed deer were no longer a factor limiting Douglas-fir regeneration. We believe that establishing native forbs is a sound ecological approach to deer-reforestation problems; furthermore, it should have wide utility because it integrates forest- and wildlife-management objectives by promoting prompt regeneration of conifers and enhancing wildlife habitat.

TI  - Still walking on the wild side? Management actions as steps towards 'semi-domestication' of hunted ungulates
PY  - 2010
AB  - Summary 1. Domestication is a process involving adaptations to man and the man-made environment. Semidomestic animals are those for which humans have only partial control over breeding, mortality, space use and food supply, and that have not been greatly modified by artificial selection. They therefore appear more similar to their wild counterparts. 2. The degree of domestication depends on the level of (i) human control over breeding, mortality, food supply, space use and thereby selection pressures; (ii) how much these differ from original states; and (iii) how strongly the phenotypic traits have been affected. 3. Synthesis and applications. Both natural and sexual selection in man-made environments may differ, and some management actions move traits of hunted ungulates closer to those associated with a semi-domestic stage; depending on the harvest pressure and selectivity, fencing, artificial feeding and predator control. There is a trade-off between high productivity of hunted ungulate populations and retaining wild traits.

TI  - Back to the futures: Retrospecting the prospects of smart grid technology
PY  - 2014
AB  - Abstract This paper analyzes a ten-year long technology debate, which dealt with the so-called advanced electricity meters in Norway (1998–2008). The debate circled around one central question: should the implementation of this technology be forced through with regulations or should the market decide on pace and character of implementation? In 2008 it was decided that it was best to regulate the implementation. Throughout these 10 years, the debate largely concerned how the future would look with or without regulation. This paper is inspired by “the sociology of expectation”, which assumes that futures are performative. This means that when the future is evoked or imagined, it influences present action and navigation. With this in mind, the paper analyzes future visions and expectations as they were formulated in the technology debate, and traces the role of these futures in the policy debate and for the policy outcome. The paper identifies two modes of future performativity: translative and transformative futures. Translative futures are often mobilized as spokespersons for desired technology or policy trajectories. Here, they work as (a) stagestting devices: sparking debate, enrolling new actors in the debate and generating interest. Further, they work as (b) regulative tools: establishing the need for political decisions, either to realize the content of future visions, or to avoid the contents of alternative futures. Transformative futures do more subtle and gradual work, shifting the practical, symbolic and cognitive meaning of “what” the technology in question might become in the future. As an example, the significance of the advanced electricity meters discussed in this paper changed from being a device filling the knowledge gaps of electricity consumers, to being a central hub in households delivering a range of potential services and being available for a number of different users. In this paper, I describe the gradual shift in understanding of what advanced electricity meters could be as a virtual domestication trajectory.

TI  - An agenda for sustainability transitions research: State of the art and future directions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Research on sustainability transitions has expanded rapidly in the last ten years, diversified in terms of topics and geographical applications, and deepened with respect to theories and methods. This article provides an extensive review and an updated research agenda for the field, classified into nine main themes: understanding transitions; power, agency and politics; governing transitions; civil society, culture and social movements; businesses and industries; transitions in practice and everyday life; geography of transitions; ethical aspects; and methodologies. The review shows that the scope of sustainability transitions research has broadened and connections to established disciplines have grown stronger. At the same time, we see that the grand challenges related to sustainability remain unsolved, calling for continued efforts and an acceleration of ongoing transitions. Transition studies can play a key role in this regard by creating new perspectives, approaches and understanding and helping to move society in the direction of sustainability.

TI  - Methodology to estimate loss of semi-natural grasslands due to shrub encroachment in Denmark from 1965 to 2010–a sample-based study using dot grids on aerial photographs
PY  - 2013
AB  - Due to abandonment of agricultural management, shrub encroachment is thought to be a major threat to semi-natural grasslands in Denmark. However, no long-term, retrospective studies have been conducted to clarify the actual extent of this problem. To estimate the loss of semi-natural grassland caused by shrub encroachment, we analysed a sample of 1383 hectares of semi-natural grassland within a 5000 km2 study area located in Denmark. Applying a dot-grid-based interpretation of aerial photographs together with selected thematic data, we estimated change from semi-natural grassland to shrub for the periods 1965–1987 and 1987–2010. Our results show that 9.4% of the semi-natural grassland from 1965 had changed into shrub by 2010. The speed of loss was constant with 5% in each of the periods 1965–1987 and 1987–2010. We conclude that shrub encroachment is a major threat to the remaining semi-natural grasslands. Furthermore, we recommend our sample- and dot-grid method as a quick and robust approach for assessin...

TI  - Land‐use history and fragmentation of traditionally managed grasslands in Scandinavia
PY  - 2002
AB  - <jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract. </jats:bold> Plants associated with traditional agricultural landscapes in northern Europe and Scandinavia are subjected to drastic habitat fragmentation. In this paper we discuss species response to fragmentation, against a background of vegetation and land‐use history. Recent evidence suggests that grassland‐forest mosaics have been prevalent long before the onset of human agriculture. We suggest that the creation of infield meadows and outland grazing (during the Iron Age) increased the amount and spatial predictability of grasslands, resulting in plant communities with exceptionally high species densities. Thus, distribution of plant species in the present‐day landscape reflects historical land‐use. This holds also when traditional management has ceased, due to a slow response by many species to abandonment and fragmentation. The distribution patterns are thus not in equilibrium with the present habitat distribution. Fragmentation influences remaining semi‐natural grasslands such that species density is likely to decline as a result of local extinctions and invasion by habitat generalists. However, species that for a long time have been subjected to changing mosaic landscapes may be more resistant to fragmentation than is usually believed. Conservation should focus not only on ‘hot‐spots’ with high species richness, but also consider species dynamics in a landscape context.</jats:p>

TI  - Energy comes home
PY  - 2007
AB  - The growth in private energy consumption is an increasing problem in western countries. From an environmental point of view, this consumption has to be reduced. On the basis of two Norwegian case studies, this article discusses private energy consumption and possibilities for reduction, with a special focus on the home. It argues against a rational economic view of the consumer and emphasizes the significance of a more subtle understanding of private energy use. The article approaches the challenges of reducing private energy consumption by analysing the domestication of the home and discusses everyday life activities as well as the phenomenon of rebuilding and redecorating. By using the concept of domestication, the article challenges the linear understanding of technological as well as behavioural change. Private energy consumption is part of a complex network and it is necessary to understand this network in order to achieve a more permanent reduction.

TI  - Long-term fertilization of a boreal Norway spruce forest increases the temperature sensitivity of soil organic carbon mineralization.
PY  - 2013
AB  - Boreal ecosystems store one-third of global soil organic carbon (SOC) and are particularly sensitive to climate warming and higher nutrient inputs. Thus, a better description of how forest managements such as nutrient fertilization impact soil carbon (C) and its temperature sensitivity is needed to better predict feedbacks between C cycling and climate. The temperature sensitivity of in situ soil C respiration was investigated in a boreal forest, which has received long-term nutrient fertilization (22 years), and compared with the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization measured in the laboratory. We found that the fertilization treatment increased both the response of soil in situ CO2 effluxes to a warming treatment and the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization measured in the laboratory (Q10). These results suggested that soil C may be more sensitive to an increase in temperature in long-term fertilized in comparison with nutrient poor boreal ecosystems. Furthermore, the fertilization treatment modified the SOC content and the microbial community composition, but we found no direct relationship between either SOC or microbial changes and the temperature sensitivity of C mineralization. However, the relation between the soil C:N ratio and the fungal/bacterial ratio was changed in the combined warmed and fertilized treatment compared with the other treatments, which suggest that strong interaction mechanisms may occur between nutrient input and warming in boreal soils. Further research is needed to unravel into more details in how far soil organic matter and microbial community composition changes are responsible for the change in the temperature sensitivity of soil C under increasing mineral N inputs. Such research would help to take into account the effect of fertilization managements on soil C storage in C cycling numerical models.

TI  - Soil networks become more connected and take up more carbon as nature restoration progresses
PY  - 2017
AB  - Soil organisms have an important role in aboveground community dynamics and ecosystem functioning in terrestrial ecosystems. However, most studies have considered soil biota as a black box or focussed on specific groups, whereas little is known about entire soil networks. Here we show that during the course of nature restoration on abandoned arable land a compositional shift in soil biota, preceded by tightening of the belowground networks, corresponds with enhanced efficiency of carbon uptake. In mid- and long-term abandoned field soil, carbon uptake by fungi increases without an increase in fungal biomass or shift in bacterial-to-fungal ratio. The implication of our findings is that during nature restoration the efficiency of nutrient cycling and carbon uptake can increase by a shift in fungal composition and/or fungal activity. Therefore, we propose that relationships between soil food web structure and carbon cycling in soils need to be reconsidered.

TI  - Ensuring a Post-COVID Economic Agenda Tackles Global Biodiversity Loss
PY  - 2020
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic and unprecedented impacts on both global health and economies. Many governments are now proposing recovery packages to get back to normal, but the 2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Global Assessment indicated that business as usual has created widespread ecosystem degradation. Therefore, a post-COVID world needs to tackle the economic drivers that create ecological disruptions. In this perspective, we discuss a number of tools across a range of actors for both short-term stimulus measures and longer-term revamping of global, national, and local economies that take biodiversity into account. These include measures to shift away from activities that damage biodiversity and toward those supporting ecosystem resilience, including through incentives, regulations, fiscal policy, and employment programs. By treating the crisis as an opportunity to reset the global economy, we have a chance to reverse decades of biodiversity and ecosystem losses.

TI  - Community acceptability and the energy transition: a citizens’ perspective
PY  - 2019
AB  - Every energy transition has had its winners and its losers, both economically and in terms of social justice and community cohesion. The current transition is no different given the complex, intersecting matrices of power and experience that influence the key stakeholders and actors involved. Local oppositions to the deployment of renewable energy technologies have been significantly higher than expected. In numerous instances, these oppositions have been in reaction to the disempowerment of local rights and entitlements associated with specific developments. Consequently, there is a clear need for governance structures and organisational formats that are participatory, inclusive and mindful of the lived experiences of local people. Despite the knowledge gaps and financial constraints that continue to persist, how can local communities become empowered to drive project development and meaningfully engage in the low-carbon energy transition? This paper presents a methodology for investigating citizen perceptions of the energy transition and the kinds of roles they see themselves having in its implementation. Working with six communities across five European countries (France, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK), we conducted a series of iterative cross-sectional community engagements using a mixed methods approach. In addition, a number of innovative participatory action research tools were incorporated to engage citizens in co-designing their own energy transition pathways. Participants expressed having restricted agency as citizens participating in the energy system. They also felt locked in to a limiting set of false choices as ‘energy consumers’ that do not translate into real or meaningful power, despite popular narratives to the contrary. The research also resulted in a co-designed characterisation tool to help local communities assess the energy democracy and citizen participation potential of a number of participatory business models. Citizens remain locked out of the decision-making processes of the energy transition. We outline a more integrated approach, using co-design and participatory action research, to incorporate citizen perspectives into the planning and implementation of more appropriate business configurations. This paper presents demonstrable examples of how extended stakeholder perspectives can improve procedural justice outcomes and ensure the rollout of more equitable energy configurations into the future.

TI  - Indicators for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes: a pan‐European study
PY  - 2007
AB  - Summary 1. In many European agricultural landscapes, species richness is declining considerably. Studies performed at a very large spatial scale are helpful in understanding the reasons for this decline and as a basis for guiding policy. In a unique, large-scale study of 25 agricultural landscapes in seven European countries, we investigated relationships between species richness in several taxa, and the links between biodiversity and landscape structure and management. 2. We estimated the total species richness of vascular plants, birds and five arthropod groups in each 16-km 2 landscape, and recorded various measures of both landscape structure and intensity of agricultural land use. We studied correlations between taxonomic groups and the effects of landscape and land-use parameters on the number of species in different taxonomic groups. Our statistical approach also accounted for regional variation in species richness unrelated to landscape or land-use factors. 3. The results reveal strong geographical trends in species richness in all taxonomic groups. No single species group emerged as a good predictor of all other species groups. Species richness of all groups increased with the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Species richness of birds and vascular plants was negatively associated with fertilizer use. 4. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that indicator taxa are unlikely to provide an effective means of predicting biodiversity at a large spatial scale, especially where there is large biogeographical variation in species richness. However, a small list of landscape and land-use parameters can be used in agricultural landscapes to infer large-scale patterns of species richness. Our results suggest that to halt the loss of biodiversity in these landscapes, it is important to preserve and, if possible, increase the area of semi-natural habitat.

TI  - Linking agricultural policies to population trends of Swedish farmland birds in different agricultural regions
PY  - 2007
AB  - 1. The widespread declines of farmland birds have generally been linked to agricultural intensification. We tested the hypotheses that (i) changes in agricultural policy, through its effects on agricultural intensification and (ii) regional differences in agricultural intensification affect temporal and spatial population trends of farmland birds in Sweden. 2. We analysed regional bird population trends (1976–2003) for seven common farmland bird species: the migratory lapwing Vanellus vanellus, skylark Alauda arvensis, starling Sturnus vulgaris and linnet Carduelis cannabina and the resident tree sparrow Passer montanus, house sparrow P. domesticus and yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella. We identified three periods of agricultural policy in Sweden between 1976 and 2003: the intensification period (i.e. 1976–87; promoting increased production), the set-aside period (1987–95; promoting extensification of farming) and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) period (1995–2003; promoting increased production). Population trends were compared between three types of Swedish farmlands: open plains (intensive farming with a marked intensification), mosaic farmlands (i.e. farmland-dominated forest mosaics, less intensive farming, but show moderate intensification) and forest regions (i.e. forest-dominated farmlands with low intensity farming and extensification/abandonment). 3. The four migrants displayed clear significant trend switches between the policy periods, with declines in the ‘intensification period’ and the ‘CAP period’ and less negative or even positive population trends in the ‘set-aside period’. The population trends of the three resident species showed no clear pattern in relation to agricultural policy periods. 4. All species except tree sparrow displayed significantly different population trends between farmland regions. Four species (lapwing, skylark, linnet and house sparrow) declined most in the open plains and the forest regions, whereas two species (starling and yellowhammer) declined most in the mosaic farmlands. 5. Synthesis and applications. Large-scale changes in agriculture policy have a strong potential to change the present poor state of farmland biodiversity as shown by the generally positive population trends in the ‘set-aside period’. It also suggests extensification to be beneficial to farmland birds. However, in regions of low profitability and an already ongoing extensification, a further extensification will lead to loss of both farmland habitat and bird diversity. In such regions mixed farming needs to be retained and hence should be supported.

TI  - Modeling recent bark stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in South Belgium coniferous stands
PY  - 2012
AB  - • Context Over the past few decades, the impact of large herbivorous ungulates on forest vegetation has been clearly highlighted. Among those impacts, bark stripping of coniferous trees is one of the most damaging. Bark stripping leads to rot development, inducing serious loss of timber value.

TI  - Grid map analysis and its application for detecting vegetation changes in Japan
PY  - 1998
AB  - . Grid maps are used as a basic vegetation data base in Japan; they are simplified from vector-based vegetation maps. We estimated the frequency error or lack of information corresponding to reduced resolution and examined the reliable limits of this data base. We produced 10 grid maps on five different scales from 50 m to 1000 m using two different methods using both the whole cell (W-method) and only the central circle (C-method) from a vegetation map at scale 1: 25 000. We found that patches larger than the area of a cell on a vector-based map could be kept almost certainly on any map, but many patches of less than the cell size were lost. The number of missing patches with the C-method is fewer at every scale than those with the W-method. Though the value of Morisita's Cλ (p) index showed that the similarity with the original map was high - from the 50-m to the 200-m resolution - it was increasingly lower on the 400-m and 1000-m grid maps. The values of the Shannon index on the original map, 50-m and 100-m grid maps were not different, but they decreased from the 200-m to 1000-m grid maps. Because the vegetation data base of the Japanese Environment Agency used a 1000-m C-method grid map, we found that much information on patches less than 100 ha had disappeared. Information about dominant vegetation or large patches is almost accurate in this data base.

TI  - REVIEW: The management of wild large herbivores to meet economic, conservation and environmental objectives
PY  - 2004
AB  - Summary 1. Wild large herbivores provide goods and income to rural communities, have major impacts on land use and habitats of conservation importance and, in some cases, face local or global extinction. As a result, substantial effort is applied to their management across the globe. To be effective, however, management has to be science-based. We reviewed recent fundamental and applied studies of large herbivores with particular emphasis on the relationship between the spatial and temporal scales of ecosystem response, management decision and implementation. 2. Long-term population dynamics research has revealed fundamental differences in how sex/age classes are affected by changes in density and weather. Consequently, management must be tailored to the age and sex structure of the population, rather than to simple population counts. 3. Herbivory by large ungulates shapes the structure, diversity and functioning of most terrestrial ecosystems. Recent research has shown that fundamental herbivore/vegetation interactions driving landscape change are localized, often at scales of a few metres. For example, sheep and deer will selectively browse heather Calluna vulgaris at the edge of preferred grass patches in heather moorland. As heather is vulnerable to heavy defoliation, in the long term this can lead to loss of heather cover despite the average utilization rate of heather in a management area being low. Therefore, while herbivore population management requires a large-scale approach, management of herbivore impacts on vegetation may require a much more flexible and site-specific approach. 4. Localized impacts on vegetation have cascading effects on biodiversity, because changes in vegetation structure and composition, induced by large herbivores affect habitat suitability for many other species. As such, grazing should be considered as a tool for broader biodiversity management requiring a more sophisticated approach than just, for example, eliminating grazing from conservation areas through the use of exclosures. 5. Synthesis and applications . The management of wild large herbivores must consider different spatial scales, from small patches of vegetation to boundaries of an animal population. It also requires long-term planning based on a deep understanding of how population processes, such a birth rate, death rate and age structure, are affected by changes in land use and climate and how these affect localized herbivore impacts. Because wild herbivores do not observe administrative or political boundaries, adjusting their management to socio-political realities can present a challenge. Many developing countries have established co-operative management groups that allow all interested parties to be involved in the development of management plans; developed countries have a lot to learn from the developing world’s example.

TI  - Effects of reforestation and intensified land use on vascular plant species richness in traditionally managed hay meadows
PY  - 2003
AB  - In this study of 130 sites with different management we investigated whether vascular plant species richness is signifi cantly reduced when traditionally managed hay meadows are abandoned and reforested. We also compared the effects of reforestation with those of intensifi ed land-use to see which have the largest effects on species richness. Finally, we investigated the relative importance of relevant ecological factors for species richness. While the use of artifi cial fertilizers in traditionally managed hay meadows has resulted in signifi cantly lower species richness, and intensive cultivation in even lower species richness, abandonment with reforestation has not decreased the species richness signifi cantly. Productivity and habitat diversity have determined the species richness of meadows on the scale (0.03–5.1 ha) of this study. Low productivity is a prerequisite for high species richness in meadows. Maximum species richness was observed in unproductive, old, traditionally managed hay meadows with a high soil pH and high habitat diversity. The high species richness of these meadows suggests that they are in urgent need of conservation.
