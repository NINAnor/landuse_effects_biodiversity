AB  - Mammalian fossils and subfossil stray finds are extremely scarce in Finland, the latter consisting mainly of marine mammals. Animal bones from cultural sites, the so-called refuse fauna, are far more abundant, offering more precise information especially of the faunal history of terrestrial mammals. The Holocene subfossil fauna is rather monotonous and no distinct faunal periods can be detected. The earliest postglacial finds are from. the Boreal chronozone and contain species connected with young forest habitats. Mammal remains from the Atlantic chronozone are more complex, including species associated with both coniferous and mixed oak forests. Reindeer remains from Atlantic dwelling sites in southeast Finland indicate an early invasion of the wild forest reindeer (Rangifer tarandus fennicus Lonnberg) in the area. Seal remains are found not only in coastal areas but also at dwelling sites located on the shores of inland lakes. Their proportion increases in the Late Atlantic refuse fauna, but the cause of this phenomenon is not yet fully understood.

AB  - Standing deadwood is an important structural component of forest ecosystems. Its occurrence and dynamics influence both carbon fluxes and the availability of habitats for many species. However, deadwood is greatly reduced in managed, and even in many currently unmanaged temperate forests in Europe. To date, few studies have examined how environmental factors, forest management and changing climate affect the availability of standing deadwood and its dynamics. Data from five periods of the Austrian National Forest Inventory (1981-2009) were used to (I) analyse standing deadwood volume in relation to living volume stock, elevation, eco-region, forest type, ownership and management intensity, (II) investigate the influence of forest ownership and management intensity on snag persistence and (III) define drivers of standing deadwood volume loss for seven tree genera (Abies, Alnus, Fagus, Larix, Picea, Pinus and Quercus) using tree-related, site-related and climate-related variables, and predict volume loss under two climate change scenarios. Standing deadwood volume was mainly determined by living volume stock and elevation, resulting in different distributions between eco-regions. While forest type and management intensity influenced standing deadwood volume only slightly, the latter exhibited a significant effect on persistence. Snag persistence was shorter in intensively managed forests than in extensively managed forests and shorter in private than in public forests. Standing deadwood volume loss was driven by a combination of diameter at breast height, elevation, as well as temperature, precipitation and relative humidity. Volume loss under climate change predictions revealed constant rates for moderate climate change (RCP2.6) by the end of the 21st century. Under severe climate change conditions (RCP8.5), volume loss increased for most tree genera, with Quercus, Alnus and Picea showing different predictions depending on the model used as the baseline scenario. We observed trends towards faster volume loss at higher temperatures and lower elevations and slower volume loss at high precipitation levels. The tree genera most susceptible to climate change were Pinus and Fagus, while Abies was least susceptible. Synthesis and applications. We recommend to protect standing dead trees from regular harvesting to ensure the full decomposition process. The consequences for decomposition-dependent species must be taken into account to evaluate the influences of management and climate change on standing deadwood dynamics.

AB  - In order to estimate how much population extinction risk may be affected by local fragmentation, population viability analyses were performed in six populations of the endangered grassland herb Gentianella campestris in Sweden. The populations had been experimentally reintroduced to grasslands that were locally fragmented by-juniper shrubs. The sites represented three sizes of grassland and two levels of grassland abundance in the landscape. Five years' demographic data were evaluated in a stochastic matrix population model, and studies of seed set, pollinator abundance, and inbreeding depression were performed in order to examine possible links between population viability and pollination. In all six sites, plants with reduced capacity of self-pollination (due to herkogamy) showed strongly reduced population viability in locally fragmented grassland habit, with pronounced extinction thresholds at certain levels of local fragmentation. Population viability was reduced because of inbreeding depression and reduced seed production in combination, both caused by pollinator deficit in locally fragmented grasslands. Plants with high selfing capacity had low population viability over the entire local fragmentation gradierits. Selling yielded high seed set in the absence of pollinators and was advantageous in fragmented parts of the grasslands. However, selling had negative effects in nonfragmented parts of the grasslands, because it decreased the chances of cross-pollination and because selfed progeny had reduced fitness compared to outcrossed offspring. A comparison among the six sites indicated that the negative effects of local fragmentation were amplified by reduced size of the grassland sites and by reduced. abundance of grassland habitat in the landscape. To my knowledge, this is the first quantitative estimate of increased extinction risk in fragmented plant populations.

AB  - Policy integration required for delivering multi-functional blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is difficult to achieve, because environmental policymaking is characterised by sectoral responsibilities and institutional structures that hinder collaboration. Both theory and practice consider urban living labs (ULLs) as promising vehicles for policy integration, as ULLs can overcome institutional structures. This article presents a framework that assesses how the urban living lab can contribute to policy integration in BGI projects and applies this to three case studies in Antwerp (Belgium), Dordrecht (the Netherlands), and Gothenburg (Sweden). Our findings demonstrate that ULLs can enhance policy integration through defining integrative aims, creating shared accountability structures, and assigning a clear problem owner with authority. ULLs can equally hinder policy integration because their dependence on sectoral funding results in narrowed-down goals. Moreover, their experimental, non-committal position gives them limited power to pull down institutional structures. Thus, ULLs do not automatically enhance policy integration in BGI projects.

AB  - Nature-based tourism has been widely addressed, yet research on nature-based science tourism, founded on science, scientific knowledge, and/or engagement in scientific research, is still scarce. Drawing on tourist motivation, nature-based tourism, special interest tourism, and science tourism, a novel theoretical conceptualization of nature-based science tourism was developed. The framework identified three categories of science tourism with intensifying levels of tourists' interest in scientific knowledge and tourist engagement: tourism based on scientific knowledge, tourism with scientific adventure or volunteering, and scientific research tourism. In the empirical part, the framework was applied to Seili Island, Finland, and tourist motivation to nature-based science tourism was examined through a survey (n = 518). According to the results, tourists were interested in science and nature-based science tourism products, especially guided tours involving scientific interpretation, but also in intensive scientific excursions. Learning was a dominant motivation, but enjoying nature and escape and relaxation were also significant. When moving from guided tours to more intensive scientific excursions, motivations diversified; besides learning, other tourist motivations also need to be addressed in developing nature-based science tourism experiences. The study contributes to nature-based tourism and underresearched science tourism literature and provides practical implications for developing nature-based tourism.

AB  - The need for cities worldwide to embrace sustainable transportation alternatives has given rise to innovative planning and design practices such as the use of Complete Streets. This research article presents an approach that utilizes interim design strategies to investigate users' perceptions of Complete Streets modifications and their impact on travel behavior. The study focused on a major street in Trondheim, Norway, where various low-cost interim street changes were implemented to enhance conditions for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit users. These changes involved measures such as a ban on through-driving, a road diet (lane reduction initiative), bicycle lanes with armadillo separators, the deactivation of traffic lights, and parklet installation. Multiuser perceptions of the modifications were explored with the help of 832 online ex-post survey responses from city center residents and street users. Additionally, manual before-and-after counts of cyclists were conducted on the target street and three parallel streets. The findings revealed that employing interim design strategies enables transport planners to gain practical insights into the effectiveness of different Complete Streets measures. This, in turn, facilitates the optimization of roads for diverse travel modes and user needs.

AB  - Pollen analysis was carried our on peat profiles from small forest hollows at four sires in southern Sweden in order to investigate the establishment of Fagus sylvatica at the stand-scale. Viewed on a continental scale the migration pattern of Fagus can be correlated with climatic change, but at finer scales such a correlation is weaker. Ar the stand-scale there are factors other than climate that are crucial for the establishment of Fagus (e.g., disturbance, seed dispersal, human activities). The establishment of Fagus does not show any regional coherence in southern Sweden, and this may imply that climate was not the limiting factor for its establishment. Fagus seeds are highly dependent on ground disturbance for successful establishment. A semi-open cultural landscape may be optimal for Fagus establishment, as cultural activities may create conditions particularly suitable for its regeneration. At two of the studied sites cultural activities probably created conditions that favoured the establishment of Fagus at 400 and 900 BP respectively. At the other sires the local forest stands were relatively unaffected by cultural activities prior to the establishment of Fagus at 950 BP and 1450 BP respectively, where, fires (natural?) or slight human influence were effective. The present-day distribution of Fagus in southern Sweden suggests migration with a discontinuous front and outlying populations, and this model probably applies to its past distribution. This type of migration means that the landscape becomes filled in by dispersal from outlying stands. The timing of stand-scale establishment is then largely influenced by site-specific factors and chance. Fagus may still be migrating northwards in Sweden. It grows well in its outlying area, and it seems that present-day land use, not climate, is the limiting factor for the local expansion of Fagus. The northern distribution limits of Fagus probably still represent an active front, and outlying stands act as 'infection centres'.

AB  - The Laurentian Great Lakes and the Swedish Great Lakes both have a long history of being invaded by non-native species, although the total number reported in the former system far exceeds that in the latter. Until about the 1980s, non-native species that had the greatest ecosystem and/or socioeconomic impacts in both systems were controlled, or their negative impacts ameliorated by management actions; most prominent of these species were the Sea Lamprey and Alewife in the Laurentian Great Lakes, and Crayfish plague in the Swedish Great Lakes. In the 1980s, a number of species native to the Ponto-Caspian region were introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes via the ballast water of transoceanic ships, and these species had significant ecosystem impacts, could not be controlled by management actions, and changed the way these lake resources were managed. Similar introductions have not occurred in the Swedish Great Lakes, but many of the same species that have impacted the Laurentian Great Lakes are spreading in European systems and in the Baltic Sea, and thus could pose an invasion risk to lakes in Sweden. Based on experiences in the Laurentian Great Lakes, it seems prudent to conduct a thorough assessment of these invaders relative to potential vectors of introduction for the Swedish Great Lakes. Also, an assessment of long-term monitoring programs is in order. Long-term data provides baseline information of the ecosystem and tracks ecosystem responses if indeed an invader becomes established.

AB  - The expansion of organic agricultural production methods has been tendered as a critical factor in the development of a sustainable global food system. The European Union has led efforts to expand organic farming, with a current target share of 25% organic farmland area by 2030 through the Farm-to-Fork strategy. Many member states have set organic area targets through the initiation of organic action plans, but systematic, quantitative, empirical research into the effectiveness of such organic policies is lacking. This study analyses the effect of four different national organic action plans - the 1st French Organic Action Plan (2008 to 2012), the 2nd Swedish Organic Action Plan (2006 to 2010), the 2nd Czech Organic Action Plan (2011 to 2015) and the 5th Austria Organic Action Plan (2011 to 2013) - on organic farmland area extent. This was achieved using a balanced country-level panel dataset consisting of 26 OECD states between 2001 and 2019 (N = 494). The synthetic control method was applied systematically to predict the counterfactual organic area growth paths, enabling the quantification of the treatment effects for the selected action plans. The model specifications were vigorously tested with leave-out-one robustness tests and in-space placebo tests. The results indicated robust, large, positive and significant effects for the French and Swedish organic action plans on organic farmland area. However, the Czech and Austrian plans were found to be ineffectual. Whilst organic action plans appear useful agenda-setting tools, caution is advised in relying on them to produce consistent results, particularly if numerous plans have been previously implemented and the organic area share is already high. This finding is also likely indicative of decreasing marginal returns to action plans. A deeper understanding of the effectiveness of previously implemented plans is critical for the optimisation of future interventions.

T2  - AMBIO

AB  - Estuaries and coastal streams are important reproduction areas for freshwater fish in the Baltic. In Finland, fish stocks spawning in the River Kyronjoki have been monitored since the 1970s, and the development of the commercial catch in this area has been monitored since the 1960s. A substantial part of the river catchment area consists of sulfur-rich soils. Over the years, intensive land use, together with water engineering work, has led to episodical acidification of both the river and its estuary. This has caused the loss of fish reproduction areas which, in turn, has changed the local fish stocks and the coastal fishery. As the local spring spawning fish stocks diminished, fishing focused on passing migratory whitefish, whose reproduction and in some cases growth areas are elsewhere. The fishery for human consumption, which earlier harvested several species in the vicinity of the home harbor throughout the season, became dependent on one species only. The change in the fish community has affected the entire structure of the local fishery, which is reflected in market statistics and catch estimates.

AB  - Cumulative impact assessment (CIA) is a promising approach to guide marine spatial planning (MSP) and management. One limitation of CIA is the neglect of seascape connectivity, which may spread the impact of localized pressures to ambient areas, e.g. through lost dispersal and recruitment of organisms.
   We here, for the first time, incorporate seascape connectivity into a traditional CIA model using a connectivity matrix, exemplified by dispersal of propagules estimated through biophysical modelling. Two connectivity impacts are identified: the source impact represents downstream areas losing recruits because of reduced larval dispersal from sites affected by the pressure, and the sink impact represents loss of recruits originating from upstream areas prevented from settlement in the site affected by the local pressure.
   By including seascape connectivity in the Swedish MSP-guiding CIA tool Symphony we demonstrate how to practically account for remote effects of local environmental impact. Our example on blue mussel shows how reducing mussel fitness in a given area may have impacts on mussels far from the acting pressures. Overall, results indicate that connectivity impact for blue mussels plays a minor role in most areas, <10% of the ordinary cumulative impact. However, in some smaller areas, e.g. on offshore banks and the Danish Straits, seascape connectivity may increase ordinary cumulative impact with 20%-30%. In an example of scenario-based CIA analyses of MSP projections, we demonstrate how impacts of particular management actions, e.g. shipping rerouting and wind power developments, can be tracked far from the original area of influence.
   Depending on the dispersal ability of ecosystem components, a local pressure may impact a considerable area through seascape connectivity, transgressing management units and national borders. Although the mean connectivity impact may be modest for a single ecosystem component, the consideration of seascape connectivity across multiple ecosystem components may significantly alter the mapping of cumulative impact and the assessment of different MSP scenarios.
   Synthesis and applications. Our extension of Cumulative Impact Assessment offers a new method for mapping and practically integrating seascape connectivity with ecosystem-based MSP and other spatial instruments for policy making, such as marine protected areas.

AB  - United Paper Mills Ltd (UPM) runs one of its largest paper production units, a 670.000 ADt/a mill producing SC and LWC grades, at Rauma on the west coast of Finland. In May 1994, UPM acquired a new partner to develop the large industrial site and manufacturing facilities at Rauma. The newly established company Metsa-Rauma, which is partly owned by UPM, started to build a completely new 600.000 ADt/a kraft pulp mill at the site. Start-up is scheduled for spring 1996.
   The huge single-line pulp mill will employ the latest advances in kraft pulping technology to produce full-brightness TCF pulp. The pulp mill will specialize in the production of high-quality softwood reinforcement pulp. Part oi the pulp production and the entire energy system will be integrated with the existing paper mill on the site. The two mills will complement each other in many respects, starting from greater coordination of forestry operations and wood transportation. They will also share the same raw water supply and new chemical raw water purification and desalination plants. The biological waste water treatment plant, which is based on the activated sludge process, has already been expanded to cater for the new pulp mill.

AB  - This study investigated the elemental composition of PM10 collected in a polar environment (Ny-Alesund, Norwegian Arctic), to identify its sources and to understand the effects of short- and long-range transport processes. Natural (crustal and marine) and anthropogenic Arctic PM sources were identified, and specific emission sources were recognised by means of Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis: airborne pollution deriving from ship fuels, local vehicle (non-exhaust) and continental emissions (e.g. incinerators or industries) were the main sources of anthropogenic elements. The results obtained so far from samples collected during four successive spring-summer sampling campaigns (2010-2013) show a remarkable seasonal trend for most of the investigated elements. For both geogenic and anthropogenic elements, concentrations are generally higher in March and April, when the ground is almost entirely covered by snow and ice, suggesting that long-range transport processes might be taking place. On the other hand, the concentrations of anthropogenic metals related to ship emissions (i.e. Co, Ni and V) peak in late spring and summer, when the marine traffic in the fjord is generally higher. For most of the analytes, the four campaigns were not significantly different; therefore, in the studied period, the composition of PM10 in Ny-Alesund did not vary remarkably. Finally, the behaviour of Rare Earth Elements was discussed in terms of parent material mineralogy.

AB  - High activity of seismic surveying in Norwegian waters has caused concerns about the impact the acoustic noise from the seismic airguns may have on marine life. There is evidence that this noise can cause reactions on the behavior of the fish resulting in reduced catches. To mitigate the problem and the conflict of interest between the fishing industry and the seismic exploration interest, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) commissioned SINTEF Information and Communication Technology (ICT, Trondheim, Norway) and the Department of Biology, University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway) to develop an acoustic-biological model to predict the impact of seismic noise on the fish population. The ultimate goal is to develop an acoustic-biological model to use in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing interest is minimized. This acoustic module of the model is based on ray theory and can deal with range-dependent bathymetry and depth-dependent sound-speed profiles. The bottom is modeled as a sedimentary fluid layer over a solid elastic rock and the model requires the thickness and seismoacoustic properties of the sediments layer and the rock with compressional speed, shear speed, and absorption. The model simulates the total sound field, both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, out to very large distances. Calculated sound exposure levels are compared with startle response levels for cod. Preliminary conclusions indicate a required distance in the range of 5-10 km, but dependent on the depth and the season. In additions, under certain conditions, there will appear regions with hot spots where the sound level is significantly higher due to caustics and focusing of sound. Modeled results are compared with results obtained from a joint seismoacoustic survey conducted in summer 2009 at Vesteralen-Lofoten area (Nordland VII). In this experiment, signals were recorded at fixed hydrophone positions as the seismic vessel approached from a maximum distance of 30 km toward the receiving positions. The same situation was modeled using available geological and oceanographic information as input to the acoustic model. The agreement between the real and recorded signals and the model results is good. This indicates that in the future acoustic-biological models may be used in the design and planning of seismic surveys such that the disturbance to fishing is minimized.

AB  - Dam removal to restore ecologically impaired rivers is becoming increasingly common. Although the target often is to facilitate fish migration, dam removal has also been assumed to benefit other types of organisms. Because few studies thus far deal with effects of dam removal on stream macroinvertebrates and because results have been equivocal, we investigated both short- and longer-term dam-removal effects on downstream macroinvertebrate communities. We did this in a before-and-after study of the removal of a dam located in a south Swedish stream. We sampled the benthic fauna 6months before dam removal and both 6months and 3.5years after the dam was removed. We compared species composition, taxonomic richness, total densities and densities of macroinvertebrate groups before and after dam removal and between downstream and reference sites. We found that dam removal reduced some macroinvertebrate taxa at the downstream site, but we found no effect on community composition. Although this corroborates results from previous short-term studies, we also found a reduction of taxonomic richness and that some dam-removal effects persisted or even increased over time. The most likely explanation for the suppression of benthic macroinvertebrate richness following dam removal is a significantly increased sediment transport from the former reservoir and a subsequent loss of preferred substrates. Our results indicate that adverse dam-removal effects may be long lasting but taxon specific. We therefore call for longer-term studies on a variety of organisms to better understand how dam removal may influence downstream macroinvertebrate communities.

AB  - The effect of gender and school type on Swedish speaking Finnish students' information gathering for the future and self-evaluation was investigated in a study, in which 15-year-old comprehensive school students and 18-year-old upper secondary school and vocational school students (N=460) served as samples. It was observed that girls generally reported more information gathering than boys did, about three content areas, mostly concerning future education and occupation, and less concerning family life. Girls also reported more information gathering in all contexts except formal education, than boys. Home was reported as the most used source of knowledge, next came peers and school friends; mass media and formal education were the least used source. Formal education was emphasised by comprehensive school students, and mass media by upper secondary school students. Generalisation of more reported information gathering across contexts was more typical of girls, while generalisation of less information gathering was more typical of boys. Limited relationships between self-evaluation, measured as self-esteem, certainty of goal realisation and school achievement, and information gathering were found. It is suggested that informal learning of cultural knowledge is a more powerful mediator of future preparation than formal education.

AB  - Uses of game resources are under constant debate. One such debate focuses on hunting tourism and its contributions to rural economics. To prioritize future investment and inform policy decisions, it is necessary to identify the full economic consequences of the operation of hunting tourism companies in rural areas. However, the true economic significance of these typically small-scale companies is not apparent when examined on an industrial scale. These companies may nevertheless serve as a sustainable solution to local-scale rural challenges. In this article, the regional economic significance of hunting tourism is estimated for the East Lapland sub-region of northern Finland through the use of Computable General Equilibrium simulation models. Although these models are known to effectively evaluate short-and long-term regional economic effects of industries such as tourism, they have not previously been applied to evaluate hunting tourism.

AB  - Biodiversity, cultural heritage, and scenery are major public goods produced in the agricultural landscape. Theoretically, Indicator-based Agri-Environmental Payments have the properties of providing socially efficient production. A system of seven composite state indicators, expressing the public goods of the respective fields or field elements, was developed and tested to assess if the model worked in practical policy implementation. The evaluation indicated a more efficient resource allocation, better dynamic incentives and lower transaction costs, compared to the current Swedish payment programs. A disadvantage is that such value-differentiated payments do not comply with tailoring and with present WTO-or CAP-regulations of cost-based payments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Policy measures are needed to reduce the risks associated with pesticides' application in agriculture, resulting in more sustainable agricultural systems. Pesticide taxes can be an important tool in the toolkit of policy-makers and are of increasing importance in European agriculture. However, little is known about the effects of such tax solutions and their impacts on the environment, farmers, and human health. We aim to fill this gap and synthesize experiences made in the European countries that have introduced pesticide taxes, i.e., France, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The major findings of our analysis are: (1) overall, the effectiveness of pesticide taxes is limited, but if a tax on a specific pesticide is high enough, the application and the associated risks will be reduced significantly; (2) in all countries, hoarding activities have been observed before a tax introduction or increase. Therefore, short-term effects of taxes are substantially smaller than long-term effects; (3) differentiated taxes are superior to undifferentiated taxes because fewer accompanying measures are required to reach policy goals; (4) tax scheme designs are not always in line with the National Action Plan targets. Low tax levels do not necessarily lead to a reduction of pesticide input and differentiated taxes do not necessarily lead to fewer violations of water residue limits.

AB  - Purpose - The Samis are the indigenous population of Northern Scandinavia. When the oppressive policy against the Sami population in Norway was lightened during the 1960s, many Sami communities established language and cultural centers for documentation and development of their language and cultural heritage as the oral tradition lost its ground in the modernization process. This paper aims to discuss how Sami cultural centers use documentation both as a way of remembering the past and as a political strategy in order to produce evidence for land and water claims.
   Design/methodology/approach - The Sami centers are many-faceted institutions and document theory is suggested as a theoretical perspective in order to analyze why these institutions were established and how they are functioning today.
   Findings - Two cases are presented. The first shows how the centers use documentation as a technique for restoring the past. The second is a ruling in the Norwegian High Court that shows a new turn in what can be accepted as documents proving indigenous land and water claims.
   Originality/value - This article is an attempt to introduce document theory as an analytical tool for analyzing the documentation processes in indigenous cultural centers.

AB  - Forest edges may affect the organisms in a forest fragment by changing biotic and abiotic conditions, and they have important effects on biodiversity. This characteristic of forest landscape is usually assessed using remotely sensed data. When doing so, forest edge length is estimated using either polygon delineation (manually or automatically) or sampling methods. This study attempts to estimate the total forest edge length (at regional level) using three estimation techniques: mapped plot, line intersects sampling, and buffer zone. Another aim is to compare the precision of the results using these techniques with field data from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). The Swedish NFI data allows reasonable precision (less than 10% SE) estimating total forest edge length. In most cases, line intersects sampling and mapped plot (at the subplot level) produce more precise estimates than buffer zone (at cluster level). All three techniques can be applied in monitoring programs aimed at measuring important biodiversity metrics from forest landscape patterns. It was also found that edge density was highest in the south of Sweden. Another future application worth investigating is the ability to determine how forest edge length metrics change over time.

AB  - Trust in animal farming is a complex phenomenon and it is expressed in heterogeneous ways in different cultural contexts. Nordic countries are typically known as high-trust societies in terms of food issues. Based on group interviews among Finnish consumers, this paper explores how citizenconsumers express trust and distrust regarding animal farming practices and whether it is possible to identify different forms of trust among different consumer groups. The foundations of emotional trust in animal farming have been weakening due to urbanization and the structural change in agriculture. Ordinary shoppers responded to this situation by transferring responsibility for farm animal welfare to public authorities, relying on habitual policy-generated trust in animal farming. In contrast, gastronomes and organic consumers actively cultivated their emotional trust in livestock production by creating new kinds of contacts to farming. Gastronomes, organic consumers and vegetarians especially acknowledged the complexity of the claims made in farm animal welfare politics. As trust in food has arguably become a subject of active negotiation in Finland, the foundations for the habit-based policy-generated trust may be partly weakening, creating more space for the politicizing of food issues and the developing of alternative sources for regaining trust in food production.

AB  - This study focuses on the population changes in the countryside and in urban centres within the municipalities of Sweden outside the metropolitan areas, between 1990 and 1997. Overall, the countryside showed a higher population increase than the municipality centres. Smaller population centres suffered a population decline. The increase in population in the countryside was strongest in areas surrounding the metropolises and around regional centres. Statistical analysis showed that population change outside population centres mainly varies with the average income, labour-market access, and taxation values or housing costs in the municipalities. This process of change has run directly counter to the policy that was formulated for small municipalities from the end of the 1960s onwards. The growth in rural population was spontaneous for the most part, and more or less in conflict with the plans of the municipalities.

AB  - Extensive monitoring data on waste generation is increasingly collected in order to implement cost-efficient and sustainable waste management operations. In addition, geospatial data from different registries of the society are opening for free usage. Novel data analytics approaches can be built on the top of the data to produce more detailed, and in-time waste generation information for the basis of waste management and collection. In this paper, a data-based approach based on the self-organizing map (SOM) and the k-means algorithm is developed for creating a set of waste generation type profiles. The approach is demonstrated using the extensive container-level waste weighting data collected in the metropolitan area of Helsinki, Finland. The results obtained highlight the potential of advanced data analytic approaches in producing more detailed waste generation information e.g. for the basis of tailored feedback services for waste producers and the planning and optimization of waste collection and recycling.

AB  - Previous research has proposed that everyday favorite places can be used as restorative niches to support emotional self-regulation and enhance subjective well-being. The study aimed to investigate how perceived physical characteristics of favorite places and emotional experiences in the place form meaningful configurations. Appraisals of favorite place attributes and place-related emotional experiences of Finnish and Hungarian participants (N = 259 and 290, respectively) were collected via online assessment. Joint factor analysis of the favorite place appraisals provided two factors of physical attributes (natural and urban characteristics) and two factors of emotional experiences (self-recovery and distress). Content analytically detected types of favorite places differed meaningfully across the four factors and between the two nationalities. Latent profile analyses of the factors in the two samples yielded four types of person-environment fit in the favorite place in the Finnish and five in the Hungarian sample. Beyond subgroups with restorative place experiences ("self-restoration in nature"), some subgroups showed ambivalent place characteristics. These included "places of distress" and "environments for distress and recovery" at home and in nature. Results indicate a novel phenomenon called "distress-related" or "ambivalent place preference." These results highlight the complexity of environmental self-regulation strategies relating to favorite places and the need for cross-cultural studies and dynamic, process-oriented research approaches.

AB  - Ecologically based architecture aims to maintain a long-term harmony between the built environment and nature. It assumes that there is a close, interlocked connection between natural conditions and cultural expressions, a unitary and holistic comprehension of time and space, and a belief in one's ability to influence the long-term effects of technological development in an ecologically beneficial way. In this paper these hypotheses will be viewed in light of some basic principles on which the structures of traditional building forms have been based. Special emphasis will be put on the relationship that has long existed between the built environment and the landscape. This approach will be illustrated by the presentation of a traditional regional type of dwelling still found in active use in some mountain areas in Norway and by the ways farmers adapt to the demands set by modem farming directives. The paper is linked to an ongoing interdisciplinary research project: "Redefining Rural Resources - Local capacity-building in sustainable management of cultural historic environments of mountain summer fanning".

AB  - The combination of magnetic, geochemical, and microstructural methods was used to characterize road dust properties in roadside soils of two sites in southern Finland: a highway (Tuusula no. 45, high traffic volume) and a local road (Mikkeli no. 13, low traffic volume). Significant differences in horizontal (kappa) and vertical (chi) distribution of magnetic susceptibility were observed in the investigated roadside soils. These variations were concluded to be mostly associated to traffic volume, which is considered to be a major factor that determines the degree of particle emissions derived from vehicle traffic. Magnetic parameters of hysteresis, isothermal remanence magnetization (IRM) acquisition curves, and thermomagnetic data indicated coarse-grained (pseudo-single-domain/multi-domain) magnetite as the primary magnetic carrier. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analyses identified two groups of magnetic materials: angular/aggregate particles (diameter similar to 2-100 mu m) derived from circulation of motor vehicles (e.g., vehicle exhaust emission, cycling of dust in suspension due to vehicular movement, dispersion of road construction materials, and abrasion of tires, brake linings, and road surface), and magnetic spherules (d similar to 3-15 mu m) possibly originating from industrial and domestic heating systems. Concentrations of selected trace elements Cu, Zn, and Pb in highway roadside soils were significantly higher than those in local roadside soils.

AB  - Two most critical factors to address in environmental system analysis of future milk production are 1) the link between milk and beef production, and 2) the competition for land, possibly leading to land use change (LUC) with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and loss of biodiversity as important implications. Different methodological approaches concerning these factors, in studies on environmental impacts of dairy production, sometimes lead to contradictory results.
   Increasing milk yield per cow is often one of the solutions discussed in order to reduce GHG emissions from milk production. However, when also accounting for other systems affected (e.g. beef production) it is not certain that an increase in milk yield per cow leads to a reduction in total GHG emissions per kg milk. In the present study the correlation between carbon footprint (CF) of milk and the amount of milk delivered per cow is investigated for 23 dairy farms (both organic and conventional) in Sweden. Use of a fixed allocation factor of 90% (based on economic value) indicates a reduction in CF with increased milk yield, while no correlation can be noted when system expansion is applied. The average CF for two groups of farms, organic and high yielding conventional, is also calculated. When conducting system expansion the CF is somewhat lower for the organic farms (which have a lower milk yield per cow, but more meat per kg milk), but when a 90% allocation factor is used, the CF is somewhat higher for the organic farms compared to the high yielding conventional farms. In analysis of future strategies for milk production, it is suggested that system expansion should be applied, in order to also account for environmental impacts from affected systems. Thus, scenarios for milk and meat production should be analysed in an integrated approach in order to reduce total emissions from the livestock sector.
   How to account for emissions from LUC is highly debated and there is no current shared consensus. Different LUC methods result in significantly different results. In this study, four different LUC methods are applied, using data for organic milk production and high yielding conventional milk production systems in Sweden. Depending on which LUC method was applied, the organic system showed about 50% higher or 40% lower CF compared to the conventional high yielding system. Thus, when reporting CF numbers, it is important to report LUC-factors separately and clearly explain the underlying assumptions, since the method of accounting for LUC can drastically change the results.

AB  - The forest sector is important for the German Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg (BW) and the Vasterbotten (VB) County in Sweden. Their forestry wood chains (FWCs) are of similar magnitude and supply forest industries. This study provides a regional comparison of the performance of FWCs from roundwood harvesting, including hauling, to mill gate concerning the factors that impact sustainability and assess different sustainability indicators for alternative supply chains, in particular fully mechanized chains in comparison to motor-manual operations. The harvest volumes are similar but operational conditions differ. Analysis of sustainability indicators demonstrated that the total costs for roundwood to industry are similar. Higher harvesting costs in BW are compensated for by lower transport costs to the mills. Employment per unit is higher in BW because of the high share of labour in felling. Due to smaller machinery and shorter transport distances in BW, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions per unit are lower than in VB. Areas for improvement are the technologies for logging in BW and the logistics of timber transport in VB.

TI  - Nordic geoscience and the 3rd international geological congress: Introduction
T2  - EPISODES
LA  - English
AB  - Geology has been of profound importance for the Nordic countries since the Middle Ages. Strong economies were built on an understanding of the occurrence in bedrock of minerals containing metals, e.g., silver, copper, zinc and iron, and eventually led to the establishment of the first Geological Surveys in Norway and Sweden in the middle of the nineteenth century. The geology of Norden ranges from the oldest to youngest rocks on the planet. Based on the papers in this special issue, this introduction provides a brief summary of the geological evolution of Norden, from the Archean of Greenland and northern Fennoscandia to the on-going volcanicity in Iceland on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It also refers to aspects of Geoscience that are particularly important for society in Norden, including geo-resources (petroleum, geothermal energy, nuclear energy, metals, industrial minerals and ground-water) and environmental geology (including natural and anthropogenic processes, medical geology, geo-hazards and climate). Information on the early history of geology in Norden and the geological surveys is also included and, finally, an outline of the 33rd International Geological Congress with its main theme "Earth System Science: Foundation for Sustainable Development".

AB  - Although leaf-litter breakdown rates have been suggested as a complementary bioassessment tool to measure stream functional integrity, surprisingly few studies have assessed how seasonal variability in decomposition might affect detection of impact. In this study, leaf-litter breakdown (Alnus glutinosa (L) Gaertner) was assessed during two seasons (spring and autumn) and over three years to determine the efficacy of this method for detecting human-induced change. The leaf-litter breakdown studies, performed in nine boreal streams in south-central Sweden along a gradient of nutrient enrichment, gave little support to the conjecture that rates of decomposition were related to nutrient enrichment. Only fine mesh bags in one season (autumn-winter 2005) showed a significant effect of impact. Seasonal differences in leaf mass loss in coarse mesh bags after 34 and 55 days of incubation and in fine mesh bags after 34 days were attributed to changes in temperature. In addition, other factors such as high water levels resulted in the loss of many litter bags confounding data interpretation.

AB  - The ISO 50001 energy management system (EnMS) standard was published in June 2011 and has been widely adopted by organizations from around the world, including Thailand. From 2014-2017, there was a continuous increase in the number of ISO 50001-certified companies in the East Asia and Pacific regions and, more broadly, the world, although this is not consistent with the number of companies that emerged during this period in Thailand. This information shows that the implementation of energy management in some companies may not be sustainable. This research offers a novel method for assessing the quality of energy management in the form of an energy management system sustainability index (EnMS SI) framework, presenting the economic, organizational, energy performance, and environmental aspects of sustainable energy management. Data collection, from a literature review of related research and the EnMS good practices, was implemented in order to select sustainability indicators and further develop a sustainability index for energy management. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted arithmetic mean (WAM) were used to establish an EnMS SI. The study results were then assessed and validated using 31 ISO 50001-certified companies in Thailand. Direct interviews and questionnaires were used to obtain responses from energy management representatives. The studied data indicated that an EnMS SI framework can be used in qualitative analyses to effectively determine the sustainability of an EnMS. Significant sustainability indicators, consisting of continuous benefits, top management commitment, and long-term strategic planning, were found. The results also revealed that the EnMS in Thailand has been significantly economically weak. The EnMS SI framework is a tool for assessing energy management sustainability, which allows for the determination of an organization's actual strengths and weaknesses. The benefits of this framework include the possibility of determining guidelines for correcting and improving the EnMS to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Fisheries catches worldwide have shown no increase over the last two decades, while aquaculture has been booming. To cover the demand for fish in the growing human population, continued high growth rates in aquaculture are needed. A potential constraint to such growth is infectious diseases, as disease transmission rates are expected to increase with increasing densities of farmed fish. Using an extensive dataset from all farms growing salmonids along the Norwegian coast, we document that densities of farmed salmonids surrounding individual farms have a strong effect on farm levels of parasitic sea lice and efforts to control sea lice infections. Furthermore, increased intervention efforts have been unsuccessful in controlling elevated infection levels in high salmonid density areas in 2009-2010. Our results emphasize host density effects of farmed salmonids on the population dynamics of sea lice and suggest that parasitic sea lice represent a potent negative feedback mechanism that may limit sustainable spatial densities of farmed salmonids.

AB  - Global climate change also influences the forest damaging agents occurrence and thus a forest health. Forest trees that are damaged by agents are in managed forests processed by salvage felling. The amount of an annual salvage felling represents the occurrence of a damaging agents occurrence in a certain year. In 2015, the area of forests in Slovakia reached 2.014 mil. ha. Within the 20 years (from 1998 to 2017), the total felling reached 162.52 mil. m(3), out of this 47.99 % were ascribed to a salvage felling. Abiotic agents were the most damaging agents (42.28 mil. m(3) of damaged wood), out of it a wind was the most important one. Biotic damaging agents were the second important group (32.165 mil. m(3)), whereas bark beetles on spruce were the most important. The third group and the less damaging one was anthropogenic agents group (3.555 mil. m(3)) with an air pollution as the most important damaging agent. There was no statistically significant difference in the volume of processed trees within salvage felling caused by abiotic and biotic damaging agents. However, these two groups caused significantly higher damages than the third group of anthropogenic damaging agents. There were two major wind damages, Alzbeta in 2004 and Zofia in 2014 with damaged wood 5.3 mil. m(3) and 5.2 mil. m(3), respectively. They occurred in southern, central and northern part of Slovakia. As damaged wood was not processed from strict nature conservation areas, the secondary damaging agents, mostly Ips typographus on Norway spruce reproduced as much that after some years it cumulatively reached or even exceeded damages from those two major windthrows episodes.

AB  - Although the volume of dead wood is commonly acknowledged as an indicator of biodiversity in sustainable forest management schemes, only few data are available for plantation forests. To evaluate the volume and qualify the diversity of woody debris along a chronosequence of maritime pine plantations, we sampled downed woody debris, snags and stumps in 143 stands of different ages. To test the hypothesis that the pattern of dead wood accumulation mainly results from silvicultural operations, we developed a predictive model. It combined an empirical growth model evaluating the amount of dead wood produced by successive thinnings with a decay function that estimated the loss of dead wood with time.
   The volume of dead wood averaged 15 m(3)/ha. Downed woody debris, stumps and snags represented 81%, 11% and 8% of this volume, respectively. Pieces of downed woody debris were equally distributed between fine and coarse woody debris however large pieces (diameter >= 20 cm) were scarce. The dead wood was mainly from anthropogenic origin (77%) and its volume significantly increased with stand productivity. The pattern of dead wood accumulation along the forestry cycle showed a convex shape with a peak in stands of ca. 30-year-old, after the third thinning. The dynamics was successfully predicted for downed woody debris (r = 0.47, P < 0.001) and for stumps (r = 0.45, P < 0.001) by the model combining inputs from thinnings and loss with time. This model may help to predict the effect of alternative forestry practices on dead wood accumulation by forest managers or nature conservationists in similar pine forest plantations.

AB  - Soil is one of the most important and most complex natural resources, but current developments (urbanisation, erosion and climate change) increasingly threaten this valuable resource in Europe and worldwide. The main objective of this paper is to introduce how changes in soil quality were modelled in the SENSOR project through two indicators: soil carbon content and soil water erosion. Indicators were calculated using state variables and model variables that were mainly derived from the CLUE model which predicts land use change in response to policy scenarios.
   In the case of erosion, accuracy of the calculations was evaluated by comparing GIS data with the results of the PESERA project. The PESERA and SENSOR models predicted comparable soil loss for the first year in the NUTS-X regions of Europe that were analysed. The higher resolution national soil-loss prediction USLE map largely overestimated the amount of soil loss compared to the PESERA and the SENSOR models in the NUTS-X regions of Hungary. This discrepancy may result from technical or methodological differences such as the spatial reference framework (NUTS-X regions), spatial resolution or levels of data aggregation.
   The soil organic carbon loss predictions for the NUTS-X regions of Europe are displayed on maps and background data are given in tables. The greatest decreases in soil carbon content may be expected in some regions of Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, south-eastern UK and eastern Germany. The greatest increases in soil carbon content may be expected in central and eastern parts of the UK, in Ireland, in northern and central Sweden and Estonia, in Greece, in central and southern Italy, in the island of Sardinia and in some regions of Spain.
   As erosion strongly reduces soil productivity these predictions have not only environmental but also socio-economic implications. The results presented in this paper could be used at EU level to locate regions where negative changes in soil quality can be expected. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Efforts to understand anthropogenic stress in marine environments have introduced methods of cumulative human pressure modeling in the broad-scale mapping of large sea areas. This paper examines the usability of such modeling in the shallow seafloor and complex shoreline conditions of the Archipelago Sea in the northern Baltic Sea. We employed public spatial data sources to describe the spatial patterns of 24 different human pressures with their normalized values in a 20 m x 20 m pixel size. Public data were also used to classify the seafloor into six different environmental types. The model output was assessed against environmental data from regular seafloor monitoring. Visual examination shows general agreement between the cumulative human pressure model and the health of the benthic fauna, seabed oxygen and, to a degree, also the tributyltin. However, although none of these field parameters show high statistical correlation with the cumulative pressure status, multiple parameters assessed simultaneously could provide a sufficient reference. Local-scale disagreements between the cumulative model and the field parameters particularly occur near the largest harbor in the region where regular dredging is practiced. Model sensitivity to different input variables was further tested by comparing 36 dissimilar variants. The comparisons reveal a general stability across the inclusion, exclusion, or modification of such spatially restricted human pressure data, which only induced local-scale details. High instabilities occurred when the tested input data had a large spatial coverage. As the cumulative human impact model reduces several human pressures into one index, it should be considered as a broad scale descriptor of the likely overall health status of the sea. When implemented with accurate local-scale data it can help coastal and marine spatial planning but it should not be considered as a predictive depiction of any particular environmental characteristic. The cumulative pressure map is particularly powerful in providing unforeseen insights into the distributions of overall anthropogenic influences within the study region, and through these it can also contribute to environmental policies.

CP  - 8th International Symposium on the Geochemistry of the Earths Surface (GES-8)
AB  - Lake sediments were studied from four lakes in environmentally different areas in northern Finland. Lakes Pyykosjarvi and Kuivasjarvi are situated near roads with heavy traffic and the city of Oulu. Lakes Martinlampi and Umpilampi are small lakes in a forest area with no immediate human impact nearby. The concentration of Pb increases in the upper parts of the sedimentary columns of Lake Kuivasjarvi and Lake Pyykosjarvi. This is interpreted as being all anthropogenic effect related to heavy traffic in the area and use of Lake Pyykosjarvi as all airport during World War II. High Ni and Zn concentrations in the Lake Umpilampi sediments are caused by weathered black schists. Sediments in Lake Martinlampi show high Pb and Zn contents with increasing Pb concentrations up through the sedimentary column. The sources of these elements are probably Pb-Zn mineralization in the bedrock, Pb-Zn-rich boulders and anomalous Pb and Zn contents in till in the catchment area of the lake.

AB  - CONTEXT: Sustainable intensification (SI) is needed to cope with the challenges agriculture faces with respect to climate change and increasing food demand. Northern cropping systems may benefit from longer and warmer growing seasons, but the sustainability of production will be challenged due to increased production risks. Concentrated efforts are needed to find ways to adapt cropping to changing conditions and sustainably intensify production.
   OBJECTIVE: This study combined stakeholder knowledge and simulation modelling to find means for the sustainable intensification of cereal production in the North Savo region in Finland.
   METHODS: Stakeholders identified promising intensification measures in two workshops. Alternative options for sustainable intensification and climate adaptations and their combinations were assessed using the APSIM cropping system model. The model was used to assess cereal yields, the grain nitrogen (N) content, nitrate leaching and water productivity for a historical baseline (1981?2010) and mid-century conditions (2041?2070) projected by five general circulation models for different emission scenarios. Simulated management options included improved cultivars with later maturing characteristics, improved heat/drought resistance and nitrogenuse efficiency, increased N fertilisation levels, improved crop rotations together with improved soil, as well as supplementary and full irrigation.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results indicated that although a warming climate in conjunction with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations generally increase yield levels, N uptake and water productivity, risks associated with higher N leaching due to increased precipitation are a challenge for the sustainability of crop production. Overall, different SI options affected the sustainability indicators studied more than future projected climate, strongly suggesting that there is a large potential for sustainably intensifying crop production in northern conditions, particularly when applying more than one intensification measure at a time. Among a wide set of SI options tested for their sustainability impacts, improved crop cultivars showed the firmest positive impacts. This was supported by the views of agricultural stakeholders in the region.
   SIGNIFICANCE: While the agricultural stakeholder?s suggestions for alternative SI options challenged the simulation approach to some extent, the simulations provided robust information for comparing the sustainability impacts of alternative measures.

AB  - This study analyses how women professionals make sense of change with regard to gender (in)equality in the Swedish forestry sector. While most participants described an increased focus on gender equality in the sector, perceptions of change varied. Descriptions emphasising progress observe change in the sense that an increased focus on gender equality has meant that explicit sexism is no longer tolerated. Descriptions emphasising stability, however, consider that this focus has not allowed for a transformation of the sectors embedded in masculine structures and cultures. The study thus points to a discrepancy between what organisations 'do' and what they 'say they do', which sheds light on the various forms of power, conflict and resistance involved in the constitutions of gender equality. To truly promote gender equality in the Swedish forestry sector, researchers and policy-makers must continue to make visible, address and challenge the complex practices and processes involved in organisational transformation.

AB  - Increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), often labelled "browning", is a current trend in northern, particularly boreal, freshwaters. The browning has been attributed to the recent reduction in sulphate (S) deposition during the last 2 to 3 decades. Over the last century, climate and land use change have also caused an increasing trend in vegetation cover ("greening"), and this terrestrially fixed carbon represents another potential source for export of organic carbon to lakes and rivers. The impact of this greening on the observed browning of lakes and rivers on decadal time scales remains poorly investigated, however. Here, we explore time-series both on water chemistry and catchment vegetation cover (using NDVI as proxy) from 70 Norwegian lakes and catchments over a 30-year period. We show that the increase in terrestrial vegetation as well as temperature and runoff significantly adds to the reduced SO4-deposition as a driver of freshwater DOC concentration. Over extended periods (centuries), climate mediated changes in vegetation cover may cause major browning of northern surface waters, with severe impact on ecosystem productivity and functioning.

AB  - The quantification of point and non-point losses of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) to surface waters is currently a major issue for the implementation of Environmental Directives, such as the Water Framework Directive in Europe. However, the drivers behind nutrient pollution are location specific and are affected by regional hydroclimatic and geomorphological characteristics. In this study the river basin model SWAT was used in order to improve the process-based understanding of mechanisms behind nutrient transport from land to water recipients in two European catchments with significantly different meteorological conditions: the Greek catchment of Ali Efenti, representative of the Mediterranean climate, and the Norwegian catchment of Vansjo-Hobolv, representative of the cold climate typical in Scandinavia. The models were firstly calibrated according to measured river flows and nutrient loads, and then four Best Management Practices (BMPs), related to nutrient application and soil management were applied in order to examine their effectiveness under the different geoclimatic conditions of the two catchments. The results of the baseline indicated that diffuse agricultural sources were the largest contributor of N losses in both catchments and of P losses in the Greek catchment, while point sources were significant contributors to P levels in Norwegian rivers. Nutrient losses to surface waters in Ali Efenti exhibited high seasonal variation, attributed to the extremeness of precipitation events that is typical in the Mediterranean, as well as to the temporal distribution of sediment losses to waters. On the other hand, in Scandinavia, the losses of N and P occurred with less deviation throughout the year and independently of the freezing of soils. The values of the calibrated parameters that mainly governed the hydrological and erosion processes in the catchments demonstrated the natural driving forces of nutrient losses to waters and their temporal distribution indicating that these forces are also crucial in determining the appropriate implementation of agricultural management practices in various geoclimatic regions.

AB  - Freight transport has a minor role in transport planning procedures in most cities, although freight transport operations represent a substantial proportion of emissions. The focus in this research is the local authority perspective of sustainable urban freight transport and the aim is to contribute to the understanding of how freight transport affects the urban environment and how awareness and knowledge within the local authority effects the urban freight transport situation. The analysis is based on four studies: a literature study, a review of transport in three cities via in-depth interviews, a review of freight in four cities via in-depth interviews and finally a review of freight in all Swedish cities via a questionnaire survey. Three aspects are considered throughout the research: the sustainability concept, knowledge and awareness as well as barriers and drivers. The results confirm that knowledge and awareness in the area of urban freight transport is low, which generates a low level of interest in the subject and makes it hard to predict outcomes of certain actions. The implication for local authorities is that the issue of urban freight transport should gain a higher priority on the agenda. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Rivers draining into (Lake) Inarijarvi, northern Finland, sustain a number of lake-run brown trout, Salmo trutta, populations but, as with most lake-run S. trutta systems, the level of population genetic structuring among populations is unknown. To address this and to assist fish stock management in the region, the population genetic structure of S. trutta collected from 28 sampling sites in rivers flowing into Inarijarvi was studied using 13 microsatellite loci. Populations were clustered into three separate groups, largely corresponding to geographic regions, with between-region F-ST values ranging from 0 center dot 11 to 0 center dot 16. The significant differentiation observed between most populations within each region also implies that individual populations should be recognized as separate management units and actions to improve, and subsequently maintain, conditions for natural spawning should be prioritized. The results of this study further indicate that the trout from each of these regions may have different biological characteristics, such as local-lake feeding behaviour among the western populations and strong isolation among the northern stocks. As a consequence, further research is warranted to better understand the level of ecological uniqueness of lake-run S. trutta populations.

AB  - High in the mountains between Norway and Sweden, archaeological survey has brought to light a trail marked by standing stones at regular intervals and tall enough to show above the winter snows. In the absence of any cultural material, the erection of the stones was dated by the diameter of the lichen spreads upon them, and corroborated by a study of the documents and radiocarbon dates. The authors argue that this was not an indigenous trail but one constructed by a Norse chieftain probably around the ninth century AD to gain safe access to the fur-trading Sami.

AB  - Roads dominate our daily surroundings and are essential conditions of the access to the visual landscape. This paper focuses on the dual landscape role of secondary and tertiary roads in a semi-rural setting, to be understood as the access to scenery and as their direct influence to the landscape characteristics. A combination of techniques was used including a radiocentric morphological landscape analysis, a perception study on landscape photographs and a cumulative logit model to assess the factors of landscape appreciation in this kind of environment. The results show that roads do not entirely open up the information content of the visual landscape. Furthermore, roads and built fabric seem to have a negative impact on landscape appreciation. This result does not rely on the structures themselves, but on the artificial materials they are constructed of. The methodology applied proves to be useful and is probably applicable in other geographical contexts. It can be a supporting tool to plan and manage road networks for improvement of landscape quality, especially in parts of the countryside strongly affected by urban sprawl. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chronically high infestation of salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) questions the sustainability of the Norwegian Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture industry. The confinement of millions of hosts, within hundreds of farms with overlapping larval dispersal kernels create the structure for extremely persistent parasite meta-populations. However, the processes regulating the temporal variation in cross-contamination of pelagic salmon louse stages among farms (i.e. connectivity), a vital process driving louse population dynamics, are not well described. Here, we employ a data driven biophysical dispersal model that reproduces three-and-a-half years of production histories of 132 salmon farms in western Norway and quantifies the connectivity of infective pelagic lice stages among the farms with the ocean currents. We show that although the complex geography of western Norwegian fjords governs the long-term topology of the connectivity network, there was a strong seasonal component to network fragmentation. The main de-structuring agent was the delayed infectivity of the pelagic lice stages at cooler temperatures increasing dispersal distances, enhanced by occasional large scale wind forcing events. Coordinated fallowing strategies and de-lousing treatments only played a marginal role in network fragmentation, suggesting that novel lice restraining strategies that consider the environmentally sensitive transport distances must be developed to successfully break up the connectivity network.

AB  - Inbreeding is common in nature, and many laboratory studies have documented that inbreeding depression can reduce the fitness of individuals. Demonstrating the consequences of inbreeding depression on the growth and persistence of populations is more challenging because populations are often regulated by density- or frequency-dependent selection and influenced by demographic and environmental stochasticity. A few empirical studies have shown that inbreeding depression can increase extinction risk of local populations. The importance of inbreeding depression at the metapopulation level has been conjectured based on population-level studies but has not been evaluated. We quantified the impact of inbreeding depression affecting the fitness of individuals on metapopulation persistence in heterogeneous habitat networks of different sizes and habitat configuration in a context of natural butterfly metapopulations. We developed a spatial individual-based simulation model of metapopulations with explicit genetics. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit the model to extensive demographic, genetic and life-history data available for the well-studied Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulations in the angstrom land islands in SW Finland. We compared 18 semi-independent habitat networks differing in size and fragmentation. The results show that inbreeding is more frequent in small habitat networks, and consequently, inbreeding depression elevates extinction risks in small metapopulations. Metapopulation persistence and neutral genetic diversity maintained in the metapopulations increase with the total habitat amount in and mean patch size of habitat networks. Dispersal and mating behaviour interact with landscape structure to determine how likely it is to encounter kin while looking for mates. Inbreeding depression can decrease the viability of small metapopulations even when they are strongly influenced by stochastic extinction-colonization dynamics and density-dependent selection. The findings from this study support that genetic factors, in addition to demographic factors, can contribute to extinctions of small local populations and also of metapopulations.

AB  - The excessive energy consumption, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction problems have gradually become huge obstacles for the development of societal-economic-natural complex ecosystems. Regarding the national ecological-economic system, how to make explicit the resource accounting, diagnose the resource conversion, and measure the disturbance of environmental emissions to the systems are the fundamental basis of sustainable development and coordinated management. This paper presents an extended exergy (EE) accounting including the material exergy and exergy equivalent of externalities consideration in a systematic process from production to consumption, and China in 2010 is chosen as a case study to foster an in-depth understanding of the conflict between high-speed development and the available resources. The whole society is decomposed into seven sectors (i.e., Agriculture, Extraction, Conversion, Industry, Transportation, Tertiary, and Domestic sectors) according to their distinct characteristics. An adaptive EE accounting database, which incorporates traditional energy, renewable energy, mineral element, and other natural resources as well as resource-based secondary products, is constructed on the basis of the internal flows in the system. In addition, the environmental emission accounting has been adjusted to calculate the externalities-equivalent exergy. The results show that the EE value for the year 2010 in China was 1.80 X 10(14) MJ, which is greatly increased. Furthermore, an EE-based sustainability indices system has been established to provide an epitomized exploration for evaluating the performance of flows and storages with the system from a sustainability perspective. The value of the EE-based sustainability indicator was calculated to be 0.23, much lower than the critical value of 1, implying that China is still developing in the stages of high energy consumption and a low sustainability level.

AB  - Within the European Union, promotion of policy coherence' is intended to improve co-ordination across sectors and groups of professionals, who make competing claims for agricultural development in low-income countries. This article examines the prospects for stakeholders in Sweden to implement such a policy, drawing on experiences from the launch of a national multi-stakeholder platform with the participation of 99 organisations. Its findings demonstrate institutional fragmentation and struggles for legitimacy, with the internationally heralded Swedish Policy for Global Development operated largely as a tokenistic instrument, legitimised by the pretence of stakeholder engagement. It argues for improved institutional support to facilitate cross-sectoral dialogues to deconstruct social boundaries which are no longer relevant.

AB  - Major revisions of the Finnish Forest Act were carried out in 1994-1996 and 2010-2013. The need for revision emerged from societal changes and changes in the forest sector's operational environment that related to the globalisation of markets and influences of international policies. This study analysed the influences of global and European Union forest and environmental policies on the revision of the Forest Act by combining advocacy coalition framework with the four pathways of influence framework introduced by Bernstein and Cashore. The results show that the three identified advocacy coalitions, namely Forestry administration, Private forestry and Environmental coalition remained rather stable over the two revision processes from 1990s to 2010s. The importance of the different pathways of international influence differed between the coalitions. Private forestry and Forestry administration coalitions, which represented forestry paradigm, stressed market-related arguments, whereas Environmental coalition representing environmental paradigm mainly referred to international legally binding rules and non-legally binding initiatives. The argumentation of the actors indicated that international rules and international norms and discourse were regarded to be as equally important.

AB  - Within the BiodiverCity project in Malmo (Sweden), green structure elements were implemented aiming to support biodiversity and enhancing amenity in denser parts of the city. In this study, bumblebee and butterfly abundances and species richness were studied in 20 green structure elements in three areas in Malmo. The investigated green structure elements consisted of objects established within the BiodiverCity project and other green structure elements in their surroundings (e.g. road verges, lawns and flowerbeds). Observed bumblebee and butterfly abundances and species richness was generally low. In total, 528 bumblebees of eight species were recorded, with 97% of all bumblebees belonging to two species, Bombus lapidarius and B. terrestris/lucorum. A total of 154 butterflies from 10 species were detected, most commonly Pieris species. There were no significant differences in mean individual or species numbers (bumblebees and butterflies) between green structure elements designed to support biodiversity and conventional ones. Bumblebee species richness and abundance were positively correlated with mean cover of flowering vegetation and mean number of flowering plant species. Butterfly species richness and abundance were positively correlated with mean number of flowering plant species and size of the green structure. Observations of flower visits showed that the two groups of insects had different preferences. The results of this study show that enhancing bumblebee and butterfly diversity and abundances in densely built city areas can be challenging. To support bumblebees and butterflies more successfully, the habitat requirements of these insect groups need to be better considered from the beginning in the design of green structure elements.

AB  - Analysis of pollen and charcoal in peat cores together with age-structure data of a swamp-forest site in the western part of central Sweden show the regional vegetation succession and the disturbance patterns over the last 9000 years. Five major vegetation sequences are identified: 1) Betula-Pinus period (c. 7000 to c. 6000 cal. sc); 2) wetland development (c. 6000 cal. sc to c. cal. AD 300); 3) Picea swamp-forest establishment (c. cal. AD 300-1000); 4) human exploitation (c. cal. AD 1000-1900); and 5) cessation of human impact (c. cal. AD 1900- present). Between c. 7000 cal. sc and c. cal. AD 1000, 17 fires were recorded in the pear. During the last 900 years, the area has been under the influence of human impact, mainly by animal grazing and trampling, together with deliberate flooding. These activities have affected the structure and dynamic of the swamp-forest by suppressing the regeneration of Picea and thereby creating an open Picea stand. During the last hundred years, a gradual cessation of human activities has led to increased Picea establishment and a denser swamp-forest. Despite these prolonged anthropogenic disturbances, the swamp-forest has qualities that make it unique in the Swedish forest landscape: 1) it has been forested for about 1700 years, during the last c. 900 years of which tire has been of little or no importance; 2) there are no visual signs of logging; and 3) dynamic processes, with trees continuously establishing, ageing and reaching senescence, have produced a forest with a high abundance of dead wood The results show that the vegetation has been highly dynamic in response to both anthropogenic and 'natural' disturbance, and to the immigration of Picea. The present high biodiversity, and subsequent conservation interest does not result from long-term stability or absence of fire and other disturbance agencies. Conservation policies should therefore, in addition to species preservation, work to create a mosaic-like landscape where many different forest types are represented, containing structures, substrates and processes that are important for many different species. This provides the species the freedom of movement necessary for survival within the forest landscape in a longer perspective.

AB  - Two separate field experiments were performed in the U.S.A. and Norway with stocked Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In the Norwegian experiment, the offspring of early-spawning fish which had larger eggs and emerged a few days before offspring of later spawning fish had consistently higher survival rates. In the U.S.A. experiment, stream sections with higher proportions of favourable foraging locations during the critical period (the transition from dependence on maternally-derived yolk reserves to independent feeding) had lower loss rates of fish stocked as unfed fry. These results provide support for the critical period concept (CPC) in Atlantic salmon, underscores the utility of a manipulative approach to achieve further advances in knowledge of Atlantic salmon ecology and provide additional guidance to management and restoration. A mechanistic, conceptual model for density dependence is presented to identify important knowledge gaps that remain to further evaluate the importance of the CPC for Atlantic salmon population regulation.

AB  - Swedish municipalities are taking an active role in shaping and implementing sustainability-related policies in urban development by initiating and governing sustainability-profiled district developments on municipally owned land. To drive sustainable development and innovation in these districts and develop future policies, municipalities use land allocation agreements to set project-specific sustainability requirements on housing development projects that go beyond the current national building regulations. Developers play a key role in implementing these municipal sustainability requirements. The purpose of this paper is to explore housing developers' perceived barriers to implementing municipal sustainability requirements in their projects, which ultimately constrain possibilities for municipalities to drive sustainable development. Findings are based on case studies of two sustainability-profiled district developments in different Swedish municipalities. Main barriers perceived by the developers could be categorized into: (1) increased costs when adapting to unforeseen changes that constrain project budgets and (2) conflicting interests and objectives between interdependent actors. These barriers are contextualised within the relationship between the developers and municipalities. Contributions are made to literature on developers' roles and perspectives in sustainability-oriented urban development. We illustrate how conflicting short-term and long-term interests between developers and municipalities complicate and impede problem solving in housing development projects. This calls for more research on these actors' interests, and how they align and conflict in these types of projects. Findings also illustrate how developers resolve issues through interactions with municipalities, indicating collaborative problem solving processes to investigate further.

AB  - This article explores how sustainability is made present and visible in the life of residents in a new neighbourhood. Glass is enacted by design professionals and a Swedish municipality to create spaces for residents that fulfil sustainability objectives and put daily life on display. However, some practises developed by residents resist the intended uses of these spaces. Through a detailed case study of the proclaimed new role model neighbourhood of Vallastaden in Linkoping, Sweden, we critically investigate the ontological politics of the residents' everyday life, including their social life with neighbours, low-energy living, interactions with local small businesses, recycling habits and mobility habits. By attending to glass, we show how humans, non-humans, materials and technologies become part of everyday practises and help uncover the ontological politics of mundane life.

AB  - The glyphosate controversy before the renewal of the authorization of glyphosate in the European Union (EU) once again turned the spotlight on pesticide regulation in the EU. In the EU, pesticides are attracting more public attention than in other parts of the world, and many nongovernmental organizations specifically target pesticide regulation, trying to influence politicians and other decision makers. Following an overview of the EU pesticide legislation and the impact hitherto on EU agriculture, this paper outlines the glyphosate controversy and presents the outcome of desk studies conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Sweden on the potential effects of a glyphosate ban on agricultural productivity and farm income. All studies concluded that the loss of income depends very much on farm type and cropping practice, but they all reached the conclusion that particularly no-tillage farming/conservation agriculture will be facing severe problems without glyphosate to control weeds and terminate cover crops. No-tillage/conservation agriculture is viewed as an effective strategy to prevent soil erosion and loss of nutrients, which could become larger problems without glyphosate. Other issues highlighted in the studies were the impact on resistance management, as glyphosate is largely seen as a "herbicide-resistance breaker." Without glyphosate, fundamental changes in farming practices in the EU are required, and it is hard to imagine that they will come without a cost, at least in the short term.

The dendrometric variables of greatest importance (diameter at breast height, height, and crown diameter) were measured and the diameter distribution were determined and analyzed. The importance of tree species and their families was determined by an index of relative importance which was calculated using relative abundance and relative dominance. The results of this study show that the inversely proportional linear distribution of diameters is within acceptable parameters for historical parks, however there is an insufficient number of trees in the lowest and higher diameter classes. The most significant tree species having an index of relative importance greater than 10% were: sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), largeleaf linden (Tilia platyphyllos Scop.) and Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.). These results of this study have a practical application in planning short-term measures for maintenance and care, as well as for the development of long-term strategies in order to achieve sustainable biological stability and other functionalities of urban green surfaces (ecological, biological, aesthetic, social, etc.).

AB  - Large carnivore populations are recovering in many parts of the world and this generates conflicts with humans, notably in terms of livestock depredation. Governmental programs of mitigation measures and compensation for losses are often implemented to reduce conflicts, but the factors affecting losses are poorly understood. We used 11 years of data on domestic sheep (Ovis aries) claimed, and confirmed, to have been killed by predators in Norway to evaluate how predator density, flock management, and other environmental or habitat-related variables are related to losses. The percentage of animals claimed as lost that was found and confirmed to have been killed by large predators (i.e., the detection rate) was low, especially for sheep claimed as killed by Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), wolverine (Gulo gulo) and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). Still, we generally found that similar factors predicted the number of claims and number of carcasses found across predator species. Predator density was strongly associated with losses, especially for sheep claimed as killed by brown bears (Ursus arctos), lynx and wolverines. Percentage of forest in the pastures, average slaughter weight of the lambs (an indicator of the forage conditions during summer) and vegetation characteristics in the spring also predicted the number of sheep claimed and found killed by lynx, wolverines and eagles. Factors related to losses due to wolves (Canis lupus) were harder to ascertain, possibly because of the severity of mitigation measures (e.g., electric fences) taken to protect sheep in wolf territories, a factor we were not able to include in our large scale analyses. Patrolling of the grazing area and early gathering of sheep in the autumn were not associated with a substantial reduction in losses. However, our dataset was not well suited to evaluate the efficiency of those mitigation strategies. Our findings could help develop new mitigation strategies as alternatives to predator removal where large carnivore conservation is a concern.

AB  - The winter climate in northwestern Europe is commonly influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Its intensity, expressed as an index (NAO(i)), has been suggested for use in assessing nutrient leaching from arable land to water and the effects of mitigation measures. We found significant (p < 0.05) positive linear relationships between NAO(i) and an air freezing-thawing index in central and southern Sweden for 2004 to 2016. This period covered winters with both extreme low and high NAO(i.) There were significant negative linear relationships between NAO(i) and a snow depth index. Management and nutrient leaching were studied simultaneously in two agricultural catchments (20.7 ha, code 11M; 788 ha, code M36) in southwestern Sweden. Catchments 11M (silty-clay soil) and M36 (sandy hills with a central, heavy clay plain) are both artificially drained. Total N and total P leaching increased significantly with winter (November-April) NAO(i) in both catchments. In contrast, leaching of dissolved reactive P (DRP) was not related to NAO(i). The highest DRP concentrations were observed in connection with specific agricultural practices, whereas moderately elevated DRP concentrations were linked to snowmelt events. Concentrations of P in other forms (other P) were even more elevated (1.02 mg L-1) in 11M in winter 2014-2015, probably due to a large (32% of area) internal buffer (ley-fallow) in a central ravine being plowed down in autumn 2014. No general trend in P or N fertilization was found in catchment M36. Thus NAO(i) may be appropriate for use in trend analyses of nutrient load in the study region.

AB  - The increasing globalization of markets and the criticality of reaching the right lifestyle segments make the relationship between personal motives and cultural values an important area for academic research and managerial practice. The authors seek to provide an understanding of this relationship in a tourism context, specifically in terms of the links between travel motivations and a set of cultural values - materialism, uncertainty avoidance, horizontal and vertical individualism, and horizontal and vertical collectivism. The study examined whether the importance ratings of cultural values differ across segments of tourists grouped on the basis of their travel motives. An Internet survey was used and the sample included 1546 potential tourists visiting the nature-based destination Fjord Norway. Results showed that travel motives and cultural values can serve as discriminators between lifestyle segments. The three motive segments were the nature and novelty, the status, and the relaxation segment. The segments evaluate the destination differently and vary in behavioral intentions.

AB  - Cultural anthropologists and historians have successfully adopted a borderlands perspective to investigate interaction, power, and identity between emerging or expanding state societies. This article develops an archaeological approach to such interstitial landscapes. It conceptualizes borderlands as spaces where people engage the material world under very specific geopolitical circumstances and create very specific materialities and subjectivities in the process. Political, social, and ideological dynamics between state societies produce two kinds of cultural spaces: hybrid third spaces and fractured landscapes. Although seemingly contradictory, these often emerge side by side in the same physical space. We illustrate this process by exploring the expansion of the Catholic Church and the Swedish kingdom to the Northern Ostrobothnian coast in northern Finland during the Middle Ages (ca. 1300-1600). During this era, church buildings and cemeteries became sites where locals, ecclesial officials, and state agents negotiated their relations through complex material and spatial practices.

AB  - Headwater streams channelized for A ater transport of timber in Finland are being restored to their pre-channelization state. The primary motivation is the enhancement of sport fisheries. but restoration probably has profound impacts also on other stream organisms. We assessed hock such "single-goal" restorations affect benthic macroinvertebrate communities. We revisited the streams sampled by Laasonen et al. [Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems 8 (1998)] in the early 1990s when the streams had been recently restored. In 1997. the recovery period of these streams ranged from 4 to 8 years. Habitat structure among the stream types represented a distinct recovery gradient. with streams restored 1 month before sampling and natural streams being the endpoints of a gradient in moss cover (highest in natural. lowest in recently restored streams). Channelized streams supported a characteristic set of indicator species. whereas shifts in species composition between restored and natural streams were more gradual. Macroinvertebrate communities in unmodified streams changed little between the two surveys, whereas communities in restored streams had undergone considerable changes. In-stream restoration is an unpredictable disturbance, to which stream biota cannot have any evolved responses. Therefore. the relatively rapid recovery of habitat structure and macroinvertebrate communities in restored streams is encouraging. However, long-term monitoring of benthic communities in both restored and natural streams is needed to assess whether restoring rivers by these techniques will enhance the recovery of benthic biodiversity in boreal streams.

AB  - Lately there has been a shift in Sweden from grazing species-rich semi-natural grasslands towards grazing ex-arable fields in the modern agricultural landscape. Grazing ex-arable fields contain a fraction of the plant species richness confined to semi-natural grasslands. Still, they have been suggested as potential target sites for re-creation of semi-natural grasslands. We asked to what extent does fine-scale variation in soil conditions, management history and site location effect local plant diversity in grazed ex-arable fields. We examined local soil conditions such as texture, pH, organic carbon, nitrogen (N) and extractable phosphate (P) and effects on plant richness in ten pairs of grazed ex-fields and neighbouring semi-natural grasslands in different rural landscapes. Each grassland pair where in the same paddock. A multivariate test showed that site location and land use history explained more of differences in species richness than local soil property variables. Plant species richness was positively associated to grazed ex-fields with low pH, low N and P levels. Sites with high plant richness in semi-natural grasslands also had more species in the adjacent grazed ex-fields, compared to sites neighbouring less species-rich semi-natural grasslands. Although both soil properties and species richness were different in grazed ex-fields compared to semi-natural grassland, the site location within a landscape, and vicinity to species-rich grasslands, can override effects of soil properties. In conclusion, if properly located, ex-arable fields may be an important habitat to maintain plant diversity at larger spatio-temporal scales and should considered as potential sites for grassland restoration.

AB  - The biosphere faces an uncertain future! Embracing change, uncertainty and complexity calls for creative transformative pathways. Biosphere stewardship provides a novel multi actor approach towards sustainability. Despite the critical role of individual environmental stewards, biosphere stewardship emphasizes the importance of collective action, and therefore governance. Biosphere stewardship denotes novel governance configurations with the capacity to effectively approach to sustainability transformation. In this paper we seek to advance understanding of how biosphere stewardship actively shapes trajectories of change to foster social-ecological resilience and human wellbeing. Considering the crucial role of governance and more specifically its two pillars of collaboration and learning, we conduct our study of biosphere stewardship through the lens of adaptive co-management. We first set out a framework for diagnosing and analyzing the process of biosphere stewardship. Secondly, we provide evidenced-based insights from applying the framework in four UNESCO biosphere reserves situated in Canada and Sweden to shed light on how active collective shaping of biosphere stewardship occurs and what it produces. In view of the lack of framework for environmental stewardship, we suggest that the present study makes a considerable contribution by providing an appropriate holistic and systemic framework with operational measures. The study also highlights how the comprehensive and consensual understanding of stewardship is proving to be a means of catalyzing biosphere stewardship by enabling effective crafting of policy design and strategic interventions. Moreover, the application of the framework to four case studies reveals the importance of the governance process attributes (collaboration and learning) in mediating outcomes from biosphere stewardship. Finally, the framework provides the basis to address new stewardship enquiries, which require further research in this field.

AB  - We investigated how recent-generation (CMIP5) global climate model projections affect the volume growth, carbon stock, timber yield and its profitability in managed Scots pine, Norway spruce and Silver birch stands on medium fertile upland sites under southern and northern boreal conditions in Finland. Forest ecosystem model simulations were conducted for the current climate and changing climate, under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), using 10 individual global climate model (GCM) projections. In addition to the baseline thinning, we maintained either 20% higher or lower stocking in thinning over a 90-year period. In the south, the severe climate projections, such as HadGEM2-ES RCP8.5 and GFDL-CM3 RCP8.5, as opposed to MPI-ESM-MR RCP4.5, considerably decreased the volume growth, carbon stock and timber yield, as well as its profitability, in Norway spruce stands, but also partially in Scots pine stands, compared to the current climate. Silver birch gained the most from the climate change in the south and Scots pine in the north. The impacts of the thinning regime varied, depending on tree species, site and climate applied.

AB  - Production of wood ash has increased strongly in the last ten years due to the increasing popularity of renewable and CO2-neutral heat and energy production via wood burning. Wood ashes are rich in many essential plant nutrients. in addition they are alkaline. The idea of using the waste ash as fertiliser in forests is appealing. However, wood is also known for its ability to strongly enrich certain heavy metals from the underlying soils, e.g. Cd, without any anthropogenic input. Concentrations of 26 chemical elements (Ag, As, Au, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sr, Ti, and Zn) in 40 samples each of birch and spruce wood ashes collected along a 120 km long transect in southern Norway are reported. The observed maximum concentrations are 1.3 wt.% Pb, 4.4 wt.% Zn and 203 mg/kg Cd in birch wood ashes. Wood ashes can thus contain very high heavy metal concentrations. Spreading wood ashes in a forest is a major anthropogenic interference with the natural biogeochemical cycles. As with the use of sewage sludge in agriculture the use of wood ashes in forests clearly needs regulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cattle released for summer grazing in south-boreal forest are free to select among a broad range of habitats. The goal of this study was to identify the factors influencing the microhabitat selection of such free-ranging beef cattle, for grazing and resting. We equipped sixteen female adult cows with GPS collars and activity sensors in southeastern Norway during the summer grazing season in 2017. We identified grazing and resting positions based on positioning and activity data. At these positions, we recorded habitat variables following a matched case-control sampling design. We analysed the data using generalized linear mixed models. We found differences in the cattle's microhabitat selection for grazing and resting. Within a given habitat patch, cattle selected for the most grass-rich site for grazing, whereas they selected for the most grass-rich, the flattest and the most covered site for resting.
   These findings complement our knowledge on habitat selection of cattle and can be used to design cattle pastures according to the animals needs and to mitigate interest conflicts between livestock husbandry and forestry in communal forested lands in Norway.

AB  - The growing interest in pilgrimages has led to their being organised in Finland-a traditionally protestant country. They are certainly arranged with the best of intentions. Yet, the 'St Henrik's Road', which purports to follow a mediaeval pilgrim route between Turku and Kokemaki, leaves much to be desired. There is no evidence that such a route ever existed-the hypotheses about it have been accepted much too uncritically. The present propaganda for the pilgrimages along 'St Henrik's Road' lulls the general public into believing that the fragments of the mediaeval landscapes connected with the memories of Henrik, the national saint of Finland, are taken care of. The finances for the management of cultural landscapes are, however, scarce, and other sites more truly connected with the history of the saint, or of greater historical importance, are therefore in danger of being neglected.

KW  - Norway
AB  - One of the most poignant scenes in Ken Russell's 1968 film Delius: Song of Summer evocatively depicts the ailing composer being carried in a wicker chair to the summit of the mountain behind his Norwegian cabin. From here, Delius can gaze one final time across the broad Gudbrandsdal and watch the sun set behind the distant Norwegian fells. Contemplating the centrality of Norway in Delius's output, however, raises more pressing questions of musical meaning, representation, and our relationship with the natural environment. It also inspires a more complex awareness of landscape and our sense of place, both historical and imagined, as a mode of reception and an interpretative tool for approaching Delius's music.
   This essay focuses on one of Delius's richest but most critically neglected works, The Song of the High Hills for orchestra and wordless chorus, composed in 1911 but not premiered until 1920. Drawing on archival materials held at the British Library and the Grainger Museum, Melbourne, I examine the music's compositional genesis and critical reception. Conventionally heard (following Thomas Beecham and Eric Fenby) as an imaginary account of a walking tour in the Norwegian mountains, The Song of the High Hills in fact offers a multilayered response to ideas of landscape and nature. Moving beyond pictorial notions of landscape representation, I draw from recent critical literature in cultural geography to account for the music's sense of place. Hearing The Song of the High Hills from this perspective promotes a keener understanding of our phenomenological engagement with sound and the natural environment, and underscores the parallels between Delius's work and contemporary developments in continental philosophy, notably the writing of Henri Bergson.

AB  - Base course is an important structural layer of a road pavement which plays a vital role in transferring and distributing the traffic loadings to the subgrade. The base usually comprises unbound materials, which can be stabilized to enhance the mechanical properties when necessary. This study evaluates all the various types of stabilization products suitable for a coarse-graded base, which can be grouped as traditional solutions (cement and bitumen) and nontraditional solutions (brine salt, clay, organic non-petroleum, organic petroleum and synthetic polymer). The research presented here addresses four major objectives. First, the effect of the stabilizers is evaluated via cyclic triaxial tests both before and after the exposure of the samples to ten freeze-thaw cycles. Second, the potential to reduce the thickness of a base course is evaluated for each stabilizer according to the Norwegian pavement design code. Third, the study appraises the associated reductions in carbon dioxide emissions during the operations for road construction in Norway and, finally, the related economic costs are derived. The freeze-thaw actions exert almost no effect on the samples stabilized with cement, bitumen, organic petroleum and synthetic polymer. These stabilizers seem to display an aging effect, which is responsible for the improvement of the mechanical properties over time. The required thickness of a stabilized base layer is at least halved compared to a traditional unbound course and this remarkably lowers the carbon footprint of the con-struction operations. The application of most of the stabilizers is cost-effective, whereas their market price and the transport distance of aggregates are two crucial factors for the determination of their economic competitiveness.

AB  - This paper addresses the dynamics of real processes of inclusive environmental governance by looking at the decision-maker/expert/lay person interplay. Specifically, we present a comparative ethnographic study that leads to a critical examination of Marteen Hajer's concept of technological citizenship and its role in normative models of so-called inclusive environmental governance. First, we present the Bio-natur project of MST (Movimento Sem Terra/Landless People's Movement), the largest rural movement in Latin America. The project explicitly attempts to include lay/traditional knowledge into the processes of defining and protecting a regulatory space for "Creole seeds". Second, we describe the formally open and inclusive environmental management of polluted sediments during harbour dredging in Norway. In both cases the actors are confronted with difficult problems bound by contradictory constraints of the institutional and cultural contexts. In complex relationships, trust, dependency, responsibility and opposition, encompass the decision-maker/expert/lay interplay. Embedded in these contexts, it is not always clear that non-experts want full autonomy and responsibility. in complex relationships, trust, dependency, responsibility and opposition, encompass the decision-maker/expert/lay person interplay. The results suggest that ideals, if instantiated, are reshaped within concrete contexts of action. Participatory ideals such as "technological citizenship", inclusiveness, transparency and accountability need not be relativised, but they would better be expressed as regulative norms for practice rather than ideals from which an acontextual model or structure may be deduced.

AB  - While patterns of spore dispersal from single sources at short distances are fairly well known, information about spore rain' from numerous sources and at larger spatial scales is generally lacking. In this study, I sampled spore rain using a novel method consisting of 0.250.5 m2 cotton cloth traps at nine sites in the boreo-nemoral vegetation zone in eastern Sweden during two seasons, using Sphagnum spores as a model. Traps were located in various landscapes (mainland, islands). Additional trapping was done in an arctic area (Svalbard) without spore production. Spore densities were tested against distance from the nearest source and area of sources (open peatlands) within different radii around each site (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 km). The cloth method appeared reliable when accounting for precipitation losses, retaining approximately 2060% of the spores under the recorded amounts of precipitation. Estimated spore densities ranged from 6 million m2 and season within a large area source, via regional deposition of 50 000240 000 spores m2, down to 1000 m2 at Svalbard. Spore rain for all sites was strongly related to distance from the nearest source, but when excluding samples taken within a source peatland, the amount of sources within 200 km was most important. Spores were larger at isolated island sites, indicating that a higher proportion originated from distant, humid areas. Immense amounts of Sphagnum spores are dispersed across regional distances annually in boreal areas, explaining the success of the genus to colonise nutrient poor wetlands. The detectable deposition at Svalbard indicates that about 1% of the regional spore rain has a trans- or intercontinental origin. The regional spore rain, originating from numerous sources in the landscape, is probably valid for most organisms with small diaspores and provides a useful insight in ecology, habitat restoration and conservation planning.

AB  - A study of erosion and phosphorus problems was carried out in central Sweden in an area with very visible erosion and negative offsite effects on water quality. The Massingsboan catchment is dominated by agriculture and the recipient Lake Brunnsjon suffers from eutrophication. Local demonstration areas were established and local personal contacts to motivate action and local subsidies were financed for 2 years. Measures identified and/or implemented to reduce phosphorous load on the lake were grouped into: (1) improved soil fertility and minimising of soil erosion; (2) measures at or in the stream; (3) measures in the lake itself; (4) improvements of single household wastewater treatment systems. Soil management that improved aggregate stability was demonstrated to significantly reduce soil erosion and loss of particulate-bound phosphorus. In addition, high soil fertility was generally associated with good aggregate stability. Local experiments in the stream and in the lake were less successful and more research is needed. Maximum phosphorus concentration for water loading the lake without causing excessive eutrophication was calculated to be similar to the background phosphorus concentration from arable land (0.05 mg l(-1)).

AB  - Conservation of forest biodiversity has brought about an interest in evaluating the naturalness of forests, and to locate and protect semi-natural and old-growth forests in the Fennoscandian countries. However, it is not always clear how natural these forests really are, and how the past management history has affected their present structural composition. We studied the relationships between cut stumps from historical logging activity (50-100 years ago) and forest structural characteristics of today in a total of 385 0.25 ha plots in three boreal coniferous forests which are parts of National Nature Reserves in Norway. We also studied how forest productivity influenced these relationships. In plots with negligible logging impact we found the amount of living trees, dead wood, and size of the oldest trees mainly to increase with increasing productivity, whereas the age of the oldest trees decreased. The amount of deciduous trees was generally low irrespective of productivity. The intensity of logging did not consistently influence most of these forest structural variables, neither at low- nor at high-productive sites. The only consistent relationship in all study areas was a decreasing amount of dead wood with increasing logging intensity at high-productive sites. Also, the decay class distribution of dead wood was more right-skewed (indicating on-going accumulation of dead wood) the more logging had occurred at high-productive sites. Except from the effects on dead wood, previous logging does not show up as a major determinant of other stand structures of today.

AB  - This artistic research reflection explores Sweden's legally-mandated 'tourist-release' at the angstrom ngermanalven River's storied site of Namforsen. Against World Wars and calls for energy independence of the mid 1940s, the iconic angstrom ngermanalven River was industrialised from a free-flowing salmon river to eventually a series of 44 dams and hydropower plants. Later, a unique environmental court legal judgement resulted in 'tourist-water' at Namforsen that gives the illusion of a free-flowing river during summer months. Existing for solely aesthetic purposes, tourist-water is an unexplored example of the (in)visible powers perpetuating myths associated with hydropower and place in Sweden. Through text and images, this piece reflects on witnessing this tourist-water phenomena through place-based documentary arts practice. The fieldwork is part of a doctoral project in artistic practice focusing on how photography can mediate complex issues in places of environmental change through the case of Namforsen. Strategies such as framing, time-scaling and montage have emerged from this practice at the same time as ethical concerns related to representation are raised. This case is especially pertinent as hydropower in Sweden comes under increased scrutiny, simultaneously as it is marketed as a sustainable energy solution. The piece furthermore highlights the lasting implications of conservation efforts centred historically on aesthetic rather than ecologic values.

AB  - The energy market today is turbulent. Nations follow different energy trends and shape their policies towards Energy Transition and sustainable development. To avoid risks and pursue opportunities, oil and gas companies must adapt their long-term strategies to macro-trends and national regulations.
   The study's objective is to investigate how major oil and gas companies' development trends correlate with trends and strategies at the national level. The hypothesis is that oil and gas companies' operations and innovation portfolios are linked to national energy mixes and environmental regulations. To do this, the authors examined the energy markets of 54 countries with the focus on Brazil, Canada, China, EU, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UK, the USA, operational indicators, and innovation development trends of 18 major oil and gas companies. The production volumes have been translated into an ordinal scale and analyzed with the use of Spearman correlation. The study confirmed a weak correlation between oil and gas companies' operational indicators and national strategies. Companies operating in countries with strict environmental regulations, primarily in the European Economic Area, have been more likely to adapt their businesses to energy transition while building up oil and gas production; they also have had more diversified innovation portfolios. As more countries moved towards later generations of environmental regulations, the increase in renewable energy investments was found in more oil and gas majors.

AB  - In this article, I examine how the grand narratives of sustainability, development and mining impact local governance in a Swedish municipality. I do this by studying three mining projects under implementation and relate them to notions of development and sacrifice to lend insights into what the new trends of mining in Europe outlined above mean for the rural North. I regard sustainable development as a political concept ascribed to activities (such as political programmes or investments). Based on ethnographic fieldwork in the Storuman municipality, I show how politicians, political parties and government administrators position themselves in relation to the three mining projects. I provide a detailed account of perceptions, responses and practices in a local government that engage with three mining companies seeking to open mines within the municipal borders. I show how a tug of war between ideas of sustainable development or survival through sacrifice depoliticises and stabilises a dominant political line in favour of mining within local politics. While the respondents differed in what they thought that sacrifice might lead to, ranging from environmental disaster and social suffering to economic prosperity, I reveal a process wherein sustainable development becomes translated into 'that which must be sacrificed'.

AB  - This paper focuses on diffusion-oriented innovation intermediaries ("diffusion intermediaries"), i.e. actors that function as brokers between technology adopters and the providers of resources needed to implement a new technology that is available more or less "off-the-shelf". It investigates how such actors create value for adopters of new technologies as well as the trade-offs they face. An interview-based, qualitative survey of 14 Swedish consultants and project developers involved in solar PV and wind power reveals that diffusion intermediaries create value mainly through technology transfer and coordination of various actors throughout the planning and implementation of turnkey projects. There is evidence of trade-offs related to value capture as well as between different value dimensions (e.g. between quality control and legitimacy). These findings have important implications for the design of strategies and policies to leverage value creation and handle trade-offs to avoid negative effects on projects, companies, and the overall diffusion of cleaner technologies.

AB  - One important goal of the ongoing implementation of Integrated Operations (10) in the Norwegian petroleum industry is to empower the organizations to perform better, faster and safer decisions, which are strongly associated with both improved HSE and efficiency. A central agent for obtaining this is to bring complementary competencies closer together regardless of organizational borders and geographical distances.
   In one of the Norwegian oil companies, training in work processes is regarded as a measure in cultural and safety development. This paper presents data from some of these training sessions and discusses how training can be assured to have a positive and long lasting effect on HSE.

AB  - Active House is a concept developed by a large collaboration of actors from the automation and power industry and research institutes in Sweden. The frame is the Stockholm City's Royal Seaport city development area which focuses on sustainable development and extensive CO2 reductions. The residential building is called an "Active House" since it has active interaction between the electricity consumer and the utility. The active interaction aims at reducing utilization of electricity production with high CO2 emissions and includes customer-controlled post-shift and reduction of the consumer's electricity loads and local electricity production using Solar PV systems.
   This paper presents the Active House collaboration, the household incentives to participate and its energy management system used to shift and reduce electric loads, and also discusses the hourly CO2 emission model and some of its simulation results for the Swedish and the United Kingdom power system.

AB  - Forest disturbances are intensifying globally, yet regional drivers of these dynamics remain poorly understood. We investigated recent disturbance intensities in Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests in Slovakia (Central Europe) with different management objectives in 2000-2017 based on Landsat imagery. We focused on 122 strict reserves without any management, their actively managed surroundings (500 m and 2000 m buffers), and managed production forests beyond the buffer areas. We used generalized additive mixed models to test for differences in temporal trends of disturbance intensity among these management categories. We found that disturbance intensity was increasing in all management categories during the studied period. The increase was more pronounced in the managed forests (compound annual disturbance rate 1.76% year(-1)) and the 2000 m buffer (2.21% year(-1)) than in the strict reserves (0.58% year(-1)). The predicted cumulative disturbance during the 18-year period was 9.9% in the reserves and 30.5% in the 2000 m buffer. We found that forests in nature reserves can be more resistant to disturbances than forests managed for timber production, despite management efforts to control disturbances in managed forests. Our findings can help reconcile the different perceptions of natural disturbances and their management in Central Europe and support climate-adapted management strategies that consider natural disturbances as an indispensable component of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Disentangling the effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the environment is a major challenge in paleoenvironmental research. Here, we used fecal sterols and other biogeochemical compounds in lake sediments from northern Norway to identify both natural and anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the late Holocene. The area was first occupied by humans and their grazing animals at similar to 2,250 +/- 75 calendar years before 1950 AD (calendar years before present). The arrival of humans is indicated by an abrupt increase in coprostanol (and its epimer epicoprostanol) in the sediments and an associated increase in 5 beta-stigmastanol (and 5 beta-epistigmastanol), which resulted from human and animal feces washing into the lake. Human settlement was accompanied by an abrupt increase in landscape fires (indicated by the rise in pyrolytic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and a decline in woodland (registered by a change in n-alkane chain lengths from leaf waxes), accelerating a process that began earlier in the Holocene. Human activity and associated landscape changes in the region over the last two millennia were mainly driven by summer temperatures, as indicated by independent tree-ring reconstructions, although there were periods when socioeconomic factors played an equally important role. In this study, fecal sterols in lake sediments have been used to provide a record of human occupancy through time. This approach may be useful in many archeological studies, both to confirm the presence of humans and grazing animals, and to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural factors that have influenced the environment in the past.

AB  - Climate, farmers' actions and previous cultivation history influence regional crop yields and drive autonomous adaptation in time. Proceeding climate change will induce needs for various adaptation measures in the future, especially in the northern regions. We investigated how farms take advantage of novel opportunities in Finland as dictated by the biophysical environment, farmer experience and knowledge, and the dynamics of the socioeconomic environment. Using Finland as a case, we aimed to characterize the relation of regional climate and yield development of the four major cereal crops since 1965 and of spring rape since 1978. Yields in the northernmost regions were most responsive to growing season temperature sum and precipitation. However, yield levels in southern relative to northern and eastern areas have polarized through the period, which might be an indication of a socioeconomic rather than a climate-related response. As socioeconomic factors can be more deterministic for targeting autonomous adaptation on farms, regionally planned proactive adaptation strategies are needed to prepare for long-term changes such as the climate change.

AB  - Since the start in 2001, approximately 3,000 students have attended courses in Sustainable Smallscale Forestry at the Linnaeus University in Sweden. The majority of students are private forest owners. The courses in Sustainable Small-scale Forestry have been successful in recruiting and educating both men and women, unlike many other Swedish forestry educations. The number of students correspond to the relation between female (38 %) and male (62 %) forest owners. Sociocultural perspectives on learning promotes the importance of social contexts and the idea of sharing thoughts and experiences with other people in order to motivate and confirm knowledge. Therefore cooperation and student focused learning with peer reviews and reflection is often a given element when planning a course. But how do educators work with their own internal course development? What kind of reflection and peer review can be helpful in improving your own course? At the Linnaeus University, a systematic course reflection was introduced to the teachers in the Forestry Department in 2009. The purpose was to help the teaching staff perceive shortcomings and possibilities of amelioration, as well as to systemize and make improvement efforts to courses more efficient. The process was a spin-off from the participation in the National Strategy for Equality within the Forestry Sector that was initiated by the Swedish government in 2009. The Strategy focused on three actions, where Education was one of them. Linnaeus University played an active part in the progress to create and realize the National Strategy for Equality that was introduced in April 2010. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prospect of course reflection to improve university courses and to pay attention to a specific issue. The benefit of course reflection in the improvement work was assessed by having members of the teaching staff reflect over their own use of course reflection (meta-reflection). The study includes twelve persons from the teaching staff, two from each of seven different courses in Sustainable Small-scale Forestry. The education is internet-based distance courses with a blended learning approach. The teachers took notes during and after the course and put the thoughts down in a standardized form. In addition to the general course related issues, they were asked to focus on how equality (between women and men, ethnical background, age etc) has been promoted in the course. The evaluation of the study is in progress. Preliminary results will be presented in the summer of 2012.

AB  - Recent decades have seen a strong increase in bioenergy utilization in Sweden, from 52 TWh in 1983 to 128 TWh in 2013. Much of this increase has been achieved by replacing fossil fuels with different forms of bioenergy in district heating. Increased use of bioenergy is generally seen as key to reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy security.
   However, replacing fossil fuels with solid biomass fuels in stationary heat and power generation entails significantly more complicated fuel supply logistics, with geographically scattered material associated with storage difficulties and low energy density. Given these risks and challenges and the key role of biomass-based district heating in the Swedish energy system, disturbances in fuel supply to district heating could potentially be an energy security issue.
   Through literature studies and interviews with employees at 18 district heating plants, we mapped present and future risks and risk management strategies in district heating supply in the Malardalen region, south-east Sweden. We found that although small disturbances to fuel supply are not uncommon, the likelihood of heat supply failures due to fuel supply problems is low. Risk awareness is generally high among fuel supply managers, with widespread use of multilevel redundancies and diversification as key risk management strategies. However, fuel supply to plants is highly dependent on functioning truck transport and, consequently, availability of diesel fuel for trucks. Risk management can be strengthened further by implementation of forward-looking risk assessments that are less reliant on past experiences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Claims for indigenous rights to land and resources are influencing land use policies worldwide. The public's support for such land tenure arrangements has rarely been investigated. We present a unique case from the Norwegian Arctic, where land claims made by the indigenous Sami people have resulted in the transfer of land tenure and resource management from the government to the residents of Finnmark in 2005. Based on indigenous land claims, a management agency was established, the Finnmark Estate (FeFo), which on the operational level provides Sami and non-Sami users the same services. Public debates and conflicts among politicians and the public framed the political process leading up to this establishment. Based on a survey and interviews in Finnmark, we explored the public's support for the new land tenure arrangements. We use the term diffuse support to investigate whether residents conform to FeFo's basic ideas, values and principles, while specific support refers to the supportive attitudes for management actions carried out by the institution. We conclude that there is a general low diffuse support for FeFo among the residents in Finnmark, but a relatively high specific support for the policies and management actions implemented by the estate among those who have experiences with FeFo. We explain the gap between diffuse- and specific support by the historical, social and political processes which led up to the establishment of the land tenure arrangements.

AB  - This article puts forward a model of the role of phosphorus in crop production, soil phosphorus dynamics and phosphorus loading that integrates the salient economic and ecological features of phosphorus management, with grain production in southern Finland as an application. The model accounts for the links between phosphorus fertilization, crop yield, accumulation of soil phosphorus reserves, and phosphorus loading into waterways. It can be used to guide precision phosphorus management as a means to mitigate agricultural phosphorus loading. Erosion control is considered as an additional measure to reduce phosphorus loading through soil loss. A dynamic programming approach and numerical solution method are used to analyze the intertemporally optimal combination of fertilization and erosion control and the associated soil phosphorus development. The optimal fertilizer application rate changes markedly over time in response to changes in the soil phosphorus level. Erosion control was found to increase welfare only on land that is highly susceptible to erosion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article discusses the significance and trends of digitalisation in tourism. Phases of digital technologies development in tourism and factors influencing the uptake of digitalisation in tourism are presented. It was found that Europe is the world's leading tourism destination with 51 % of international tourists arrivals and 39 % of global international tourism receipts in 2019. However, the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism caused 69 % declines international tourist arrivals in Europe in 2020. This is due to the fact that since the beginning of the pandemic travel restrictions have been implemented and the external borders of the European Union have been closed. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was studied and it was found that the share of tourism contribution to GDP in European member decreased in 2020. Countries where tourism contributed the highest share to GDP in 2020 were Croatia (10,2 %), Greece (8,7 %) and Portugal (8,1%). It has been proven that digital technologies and data play important role in combating the pandemic Covid-19 and tourism recovery. Main tools of digitalisation in tourism that help to make travel safe and healthy are digital COVID certificate, mobile applications and web sites that propose information about epidemiological situation, restrictions and requirements for travellers. Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) of European Union countries are analysed. According to DESI the most advanced countries of European Union in 2018 were Denmark (70), Finland (68), Netherlands (68) and Sweden (65), while Croatia (35), Poland (36), Slovakia (39), Bulgaria (40) and Greece (40) have the lowest scores on the index. Recommendations for tourism recovery in post-COVID-19 are proposed. Main directions of tourism recovery should be: collaboration between destination management organisations and tourism enterprises, promotion of sustainable and inclusive tourism development, implementation of innovation and digital technologies in the process of tourism services consumption.

AB  - The forest limits of south-east Norway have expanded to higher altitudes. Two main processes are believed to cause these changes: regrowth after abandonment of human utilisation and recent climate changes. The article aims at separating the effects of these two processes on the upper forest limits and recent forest expansion. Four datasets representing 161.5 km2 have been used: climate data, downscaled climate change scenario data, forest height growth, and four vegetation maps. The maps represent the years 1959 and 2001, potential natural vegetation (PNV), and a climate change scenario (CCS). The recent upper potential climatic and edaphic forest limit (UPCEFL) was used to define the potential for forest regrowth after the abandonment of human utilisation. Forest height growth and climate data were then used to analyse any supplementary effect of recent climate change. The projected future forest limits were based on the IPCC IS92a scenario for 2020-2049. The results show that raised forest limits and forest range expansion often attributed to recent climate change is rather the product of regrowth, a process that was climatically retarded from 1959 to 1995. For the period 1995-2006, the data indicate a preliminary effect of climate change escalating the regrowth and probably pushing the future forest limits to higher altitudes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to review the available research information on the environmental risks and effects of metals leached from Finnish acid sulphate soils. The reason for carrying out this study was recent evidence demonstrating that much larger quantities of a number of metals are leached from these soils than from the entire Finnish industry taken together. Alarmingly few scientific studies on the actual biological impacts of acid sulphate soils have been published. However, they all indicate an extensive and serious effect on biota, including metal imbalance in crops and elevated concentrations of Al and Zn in the milk of cows. Acid sulphate soils have also significant, but spatially and temporally variable impacts on biodiversity and community structure of fish, benthic invertebrates and macrophytes, with numerous cases of mass fish kills along the Finnish coast. Furthermore, chronic exposure to high concentrations of metals may pose an actual threat on human health. The potential risks for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in acid sulphate soil landscapes are discussed.

AB  - The Positive Energy District (PED) concept is a localized city and district level response to the challenges of greenhouse gas emission reduction and energy transition. With the Strategic Energy Transition (SET) Plan aiming to establish 100 PEDs by 2025 in Europe, a number of PED projects are emerging in the EU member states. While the energy transition is mainly focusing on technical innovations, social innovation is crucial to guarantee the uptake and deployment of PEDs in the built environment. We set the spotlight on Norway, which, to date, has three PED projects encompassing 12 PED demo sites in planning and early implementation stages, from which we extract approaches for social innovations and discuss how these learnings can contribute to further PED planning and implementation. We describe the respective approaches and learnings for social innovation of the three PED projects, ZEN, +CityxChange and syn.ikia, in a multiple case study approach. Through the comparison of these projects, we start to identify social innovation approaches with different scopes regarding citizen involvement, stakeholder interaction and capacity building. These insights are also expected to contribute to further planning and design of PED projects within local and regional networks (PEDs in Nordic countries) and contribute to international PED concept development.

AB  - In Sweden, there is a longstanding conflict between the use of forests for timber production and game for hunting due to browsing damages on young forests. This study examines the assessments of two stakeholder groups regarding browsing damage by moose. The data originated from a mail survey that involved hunters and forest owners in Sweden. The samples were randomly selected from two national registers of hunters and forest owners, respectively. An ordered logit model was used to account for the assessments of severity of moose browsing damage. The results showed that on average, non-forest owning hunters rated the browsing damage on their main hunting ground lower than non-hunting forest owners rated the browsing damage on their forest estate. The respondents who both hunt and own forest had a rating that was intermediate between the former two groups. The ratings were mainly influenced by level of activity in improving game habitat, quantity of moose meat obtained, level of moose on forest estate and the importance of bagging game as well as forest estate size, hunting ground size, and the stakeholder group that the respondents belong. The findings can help in designing strategies for conflict resolution between forestry and hunting for moose.

AB  - Several studies have examined how local governments respond to the implications of shrinkage. This article add to this knowledge by focusing on local governmental communication in processes of demographic decline. Hypothetically, local governments can contribute to a greater understanding of the causes and consequences of demographic decline, to greater legitimacy for the political decisions made in response, and to a vivid discussion of what the future could look like in shrinking community. Our results, drawn from a study in Sweden and in Germany, however suggest that local governmental communication is an expertocratic practice used to avoid conflict about future developments.

AB  - European aspen is important in boreal forests because of its rich fauna and flora. In Finnish commercial forests, however, aspen stems-especially large ones-are rare. Alternatives to aspen in managed forests were studied with a decision-support system where biodiversity was assessed according to the number of beetle species. The results showed that large aspen stems maintain the richness of beetle species in a forest. Such stems appear in commercial forests if green-retention trees remain after regeneration cutting.

AB  - Barnacle Geese Branta leucopsis have bred in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland since 1995. The species starting to breed in this area later than in the western Baltic Sea and North Sea regions, which were first colonised in the 1970s and early 1980s respectively. Since then, the breeding distribution has continued to expand through Lake Ladoga to Lake Onega in northwest Russia, which currently forms the north-easternmost limit of the range for of this temperate-breeding population. Nowadays, Barnacle Geese in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland breed later than in other Baltic counties, including neighbouring Finland. The egg-laying period, which starts between 1 May-25 June and peaks during 11-25 May, is longer than for Barnacle Geese nesting in western parts of the temperate zone and also in comparison with those breeding in the Russian Arctic. The mean dutch size of 4.95 (s.e. +/- 0.07) eggs is however larger than in other parts of the Baltic and in Arctic areas. Nests were found only on islands occupied by Herring Gulls Larus argentatus, which is the most common predator of Barnacle Goose eggs in the region. The Herring Gulls' egg-laying period lasted from April to June; thus, incubation of Barnacle Goose eggs occurs during the gulls' nesting and brood rearing period. It is suggested that anthropogenic disturbance could adversely affect Barnacle Goose breeding success in the Russian part of the Gulf of Finland, through tourist activity displacing geese from their nests at a time when the gulls are also breeding nearby. Specific features of the environment (late spring, predation risk and tourist activity) and the characteristics of this particular goose population (recent colonisation of the area, small population size and late breeding period) should be taken into account in developing conservation management programmes for geese in the region.

AB  - The main objective of this research is to propose the best aggregate index of corporate social responsibility practice at the organisational level. To achieve this, we analyse the consistency of the different aggregated measures that researchers use in their analyses through a robust statistical technique, the CUR matrix, framed in the big data environment for selecting individuals. Accordingly, we use an international sample of 2,675 large listed companies. The results show that the CUR leverage identifies greater consistency of the different aggregate measures of CSR, confirming its coherence with a correlation analysis. In this sense, it is possible to affirm that the composite indexes used in academia do not introduce any bias into the analysis of CSR practices. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this technique to identify the most powerful companies, analysing their CSR commitment at the country and industry levels, namely, Norsk Hydro in the metal and mining industry in Norway, Stora Enso in forestry and paper in Finland, Akzo Nobel in chemical products in the Netherlands, BMW in automobiles and parts in Germany, Generali in finance in Italy, Novartis in pharmaceuticals in Switzerland, the BT Group in telecommunications in the United Kingdom and Inditex in textiles in Spain. Moreover, the results of the CUR study confirm that companies adapt to the demands or pressures from the stakeholders in different areas of interest, which are specific to each country and industry. The availability of these data allows the identification of the structural drivers of their growth and the establishment of priorities that allow the design of more effective sustainable development momentum policies.

AB  - Insofar as our cultural heritage (CH) has become not only an economic resource but a key element in defining our identity, its accurate and flexible documentation has emerged as an essential task. The generation of 3D information with physical and functional characteristics is now possible through the connection of survey data with Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM). However, few studies have focused on the semantic enrichment process of models based on point clouds, especially on the field of cultural heritage. These singularities make the conversion of point cloud to "as-built" HBIM an expensive process from the mathematical and computational viewpoint. At present, there is no software that guarantees automatic and efficient data conversion in architectural or urban contexts.
   The ongoing research "Documenting and Visualizing Industrial Heritage" is conducted by the School of Architecture, Tampere University of Technology, Finland based on an Open Notebook Reserarch Model. It is focused on advance the knowledge of digital operating environments for the representation and management of historical buildings and sites. On the one hand, the research is advancing in three-dimensional "as-built" modeling based on remote sensing data, while on the other hand is aiming to incorporate more qualitative information based on concepts of production and management in the Iifecycle of the built environment. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss the different approaches to date on the HBIM generation chain: from 3D point cloud data collection to semantically enriched parametric models.

AB  - Soil water and nutrient regimes of naturally established old-growth conifer stands and those of intensively managed Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] sites were assessed over a range of lithological provinces in Finnish Lapland. Soil dielectric permittivity (epsilon), as a measure of soil water content (theta(v)) and soil electrical conductivity (sigma(a)), as a measure of soil solute content, were species specific, such that high soil theta(v) > 0.27 cm(3) cm(-3) (epsilon > 15) constitutes an edaphic constraint for Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and low soil solute content (sigma(a) < 0.5 mS m(-1)) is constraining for Norway spruce. The spatial pattern of the soil theta(v) was temporally stabile, such that intraseasonal and interseasonal soil theta(v) was significantly higher in silty tills of spruce stands compared to sandy tills of pine stands. Scots pine was the only conifer on tills derived from felsic rocks of Hetta granite (HG) and Lapland granulite (LG). Norway spruce dominated on tills derived from the mafic rocks of Lapland greenstone belt (LGB), but tills of LG and HG constitute a dispersal barrier for spruce. Mechanical site preparation (MSP) with ploughing (Marttiini) was not able to amend soil theta(v) to meet site requirements of Scots pine at former spruce sites. MSP resulted in significant reduction in soil nutrient content such that untreated control sigma(a) > tilt/shoulder sigma(a) > trench sigma(a). The results imply that MSP treatments through which cross-contour tracks are created pose a risk to the sustainability of soil quality in Lapland.

AB  - Lycosid and linyphiid spiders were collected over a full cropping season around Uppsala, Sweden, in eight organic spring sown cereal fields in three different habitat types: field margin, field, and the edge between the two. The sites were located in landscapes with different proportions of non-crops, forest, perennial crops, annual crops, and number and sizes of arable fields. The field margin, compared with the field habitat, was found to be important for the activity density of lycosids, and for the species richness and composition of linyphiids. Landscape parameters were central for the activity density of linyphiids and for the species richness and composition of Lycosidae. A diverse landscape with easy access to perennial crops and forest in addition to field margins will augment both the number of species and individuals of the two spider families.

AB  - Purpose - This paper is a study of creating organization in the case of cultural projects; cultural entrepreneurship. This includes taking advantage of opportunities and using ones social capital through networks. It is a case study of Vandalorum which is an Swedish international art and design centre with a strong regional connection. They want to offer close collaborations between artists, designers and the creative industry. It is located in Varnamo in the south of Sweden and was inaugurated in April 2011 after an establishment process running over 15 years. Renzo Piano has created the architectural concept of Vandalorum, inspired by traditional Swedish materials and building techniques. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Through interviews with significant actors over many years and secondary analysis of data collected by others the authors describe and analyze the establishment process of Vandalorum Art and Design Centre.
   Findings - The case of Vandalorum shows that organizing a cultural project like Vandalorum is characterized by no well-defined starting and stopping point, but - quite typically for entrepreneurship as an organization-creation process - builds momentum and legitimacy narratively.
   Originality/value - The originality lies in answering the question that the authors chose to focus on, which is embedded in the opening story of Vandalorum: how can such a cultural project become legitimized in a place like that, outside and rather far from any large city? In a changed cultural landscape with reduced public contributions, the claim is that it is crucial to legitimize the idea and project in relation to the main/key stakeholders. Such legitimization is a key entrepreneurial achievement.

AB  - Over the last 40 years, many goose populations have recovered from historic lows and are now more numerous than ever. At the same time, geese have shifted from natural foraging habitats to securing most of their nutritional demands from agricultural fields, leading to crop damage and conflict with agriculture. We studied field use by Greylag Geese (Anser anser) in the agricultural landscape surrounding a main breeding and moulting lake in Sweden. From 2012 to 2016, weekly roadside surveys were conducted from May to July. Data were collected on goose numbers, crop type and sward height in agricultural fields. Using a compositional analysis, we demonstrate that Greylag Geese show a strong selection for ley and pasture fields compared to other crop types (rank order: ley/pasture > oat > barley > wheat > other crops). This selection was consistent across years and between pre- and post-moult. Aside from ley and pasture, no other crop types were selected for, as they were used less than expected given their availability. Irrespective of crop type, geese foraged predominantly on short (0-10 cm) swards. The strong selection for ley and pasture may have been driven by higher nutritional quality of short, managed grass swards relative to other available foods. This suggests that during the summer grass fields may be more vulnerable to damage compared to other crop types. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the ecology of Greylag Geese, which may be used to inform management strategies focused on mitigating crop damage and alleviating conflict.

AB  - In this study archaeology, history and palaeoecology (modern and fossil data sets of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs) were used to reconstruct small-scale pastoral activities in the Pyrenees Mountain during the last two millennia. Modern pollen assemblages from the major vegetation units (both natural and anthropogenic) are studied on one restricted watershed area. A correlative model (RDA) of 61 modern pollen spectra and 35 external variables distinguishes two groups of taxa, providing information on the nature and spatial extent of human impact on the landscape. The first pool indicates local pastoral activities, and the second one implies regional input from outside the studied watershed, and is not characteristic of a specific land use. These pools are described as 'Local Pastoral Pollen Indicators' (LPPI) for this particular mountain region on crystalline bedrock and 'Regional Human Activities Pollen Indicators' (RHAPI). The modern data set is used to aid interpretation of the local pollen sequence of Sourzay that covers the last 2000 calendar years BP, using RDA reconstructions, and best modern analogues as a means of comparing modern and fossil spectra. The study also demonstrates agreement between the independent interpretations of two fossil proxies, LPPI and corophilous fungi.

AB  - For four years (2014-17), a competence-building project (BioCarb+) on the biocarbon value chain for energy and metallurgical industries has been miming in Norway. Value chains, from the resource side to the end user side, have been studied, aiming at improvement along the value chains to increase their sustainability. The ultimate goal is to enable the use of Norwegian national forest resources for production of biocarbon of various qualities, for different end uses. The purpose of the work has been to investigate improvement potentials along the value chains, enabling production of biocarbon of various qualities from Norwegian national forest resources, for different end uses. Experimental and theoretical studies connected to forest operations, carbonization and end use have been carried out. The scientific innovation and relevance are improvements throughout the value chains, contributing to increased sustainability and pathways for increased use and sourcing of forest resources for production of biocarbon for energy purposes and as reductant in different metallurgical industries.

AB  - Acclimatory adjustments of foliar vascular architecture, photosynthetic capacity, and transpiration rate in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (Italian, Polish [Col-0], Swedish) were characterized in the context of habitat of origin. Temperatures of the habitat of origin decreased linearly with increasing habitat latitude, but habitat precipitation was greatest in Italy, lowest in Poland, and intermediate in Sweden. Plants of the three ecotypes raised under three different growth temperature regimes (low, moderate, and high) exhibited highest photosynthetic capacities, greatest leaf thickness, highest chlorophyll a/b ratio and levels of beta-carotene, and greatest levels of wall ingrowths in phloem transfer cells, and, in the Col -0 and Swedish ecotypes, of phloem per minor vein in plants grown at the low temperature. In contrast, vein density and minor vein tracheary to sieve element ratio increased with increasing growth temperature - most strongly in Col -0 and least strongly in the Italian ecotype - and transpirational water loss correlated with vein density and number of tracheary elements per minor vein. Plotting of these vascular features as functions of climatic conditions in the habitat of origin suggested that temperatures during the evolutionary history of the ecotypes determined acclimatory responses of the foliar phloem and photosynthesis to temperature in this winter annual that upregulates photosynthesis in response to lower temperature, whereas the precipitation experienced during the evolutionary history of the ecotypes determined adjustment of foliar vein density, xylem, and transpiration to temperature. In particular, whereas photosynthetic capacity, leaf thickness, and foliar minor vein phloem features increased linearly with increasing latitude and decreasing temperature of the habitats of origin in response to experimental growth at low temperature, transpiration rate, foliar vein density, and minor vein tracheary element numbers and cross-sectional areas increased linearly with decreasing precipitation level in the habitats of origin in response to experimental growth at high temperature. This represents a situation where temperature acclimation of the apparent capacity for water flux through the xylem and transpiration rate in a winter annual responded differently from that of photosynthetic capacity, in contrast to previous reports of strong relationships between hydraulic conductance and photosynthesis in other studies.

AB  - In this study, due to the high contribution of the transportation sector to generate CO2 emissions, an evaluation for the best scenario of the replacement of petroleum derived fuels by renewable and sustainable alternatives was assessed with a multi collative approach suggesting the second-generation bioethanol as the most promising one. In this context, this paper focused on the practices over the past 23 years in the following four countries; Turkey, China, Sweden, and Brazil, with a comparative regression analysis between the CO2 emissions generated from the consumptions of total energy and biofuels. Accordingly, a curve-fitting and an estimation on the formation of CO2 emissions with the incrementing blends of gasoline by 3 to 100% of bioethanol was forecasted for 2020 to 2030. The outcomes of the comprehensive research indicated the international and national benefits of biofuel use, thus, promoting the potential integration of bioethanol in the Turkish transportation sector.

AB  - Changing forest disturbance regimes pose a major challenge for current day forestry. Yet our understanding of the economic impacts of disturbances remains incomplete. Existing valuations of losses from natural disturbances commonly exclude extreme events and neglect impacts on standing timber. Here we develop a new methodology to assess the economic impact of natural disturbances addressing these limitations. We couple an empirical function of forest growth with survival modelling for the example of Norway spruce (Picea abies), using MonteCarlo simulations to quantify the economic losses from natural disturbances. We illustrate the effect of extreme disturbance events by analyzing the lowest (worst) 5% of simulated economic returns. Ranging between ? -2,611 and -34,416 per hectare, disturbance-induced economic losses varied greatly, depending on the valuation approach applied. Accounting for extreme events and disturbance impacts on standing timber resulted in 262?1218% higher losses compared to damages derived with common valuation approaches that neglect these aspects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that refraining from salvage logging after extreme disturbances does not necessarily result in major economic losses for forest owners, indicating a potential cost-effective avenue to improve forest biodiversity. Our approach presents an important step towards quantifying the economic impacts of changing forest disturbance regimes.

AB  - The study focuses on local people's expressions of attitudes and ideologies in the light of proposed Sami-Norwegian bilingual policies in their Northern Norwegian hometown. The local politicians' plan to introduce the bilingual regulations of an "administrative area for the Sami language" in the town of Tromso encountered conflicting language ideologies and attitudes among the local population and precipitated a vivid and sometimes rude debate about identities, ethnicity, and local belonging. Focusing on the mechanisms of social evaluation vis-a-vis the Sami and Norwegian languages, the analysis of attitudes and stance-taking in texts (e. g., letters to the editor) in local newspapers reveals how writers anchor their evaluations and personal stances to the relations between the self, the recipients, and shared, ideological systems of values. Ideologies about Sami and Norwegian are mainly brought up implicitly in these relations. A large number of evaluations are expressed as judgements of other people's behaviour, and language plays only a relatively marginal role as a target of most writers' evaluations. The paper concludes by discussing the ideological boundaries that writers construe simultaneously with their construction of interactional bonds, and the metalinguistic contextualization of the Sami language within these debates.

AB  - Policymakers worldwide are promoting the use of bio-based products as part of sustainable development. Nonetheless, there are concerns that the bio-based economy may undermine the sustainability of the transition, e.g., from the overexploitation of biomass resources and indirect impacts of land use. Adequate assessment methods with a broad systems perspective are thus required in order to ensure a transition to a sustainable, bio-based economy. We review the scientifically published life cycle studies of bio-based products in order to investigate the extent to which they include important sustainability indicators. To define which indicators are important, we refer to established frameworks for sustainability assessment, and include an Open Space workshop with academics and industrial experts. The results suggest that there is a discrepancy between the indicators that we found to be important, and the indicators that are frequently included in the studies. This indicates a need for the development and dissemination of improved methods in order to model several important environmental impacts, such as: water depletion, indirect land use change, and impacts on ecosystem quality and biological diversity. The small number of published social life cycle assessments (SLCAs) and life cycle sustainability assessments (LCSAs) indicate that these are still immature tools; as such, there is a need for improved methods and more case studies.

AB  - Regional pollen diagrams indicate that Fagus may have been present close to its northern distributional limits in southern Sweden for as long as 1000 years. Fagus has probably always been rare in this region, except for some small and scattered stands. Many of these outlying Fagus stands have been regarded as planted but no previous studies have investigated this in detail. At Mattarp, a small outpost Fagus stand in northern Smaland, the pollen record of the deposit of a small hollow indicates that Fagus became established c. 400 BP. The local establishment was associated with an earlier phase of woodland clearance and the former system of land-use. Local factors seem to have controlled the immigration and establishment at the stand-scale at this site. Regional climate had probably been favourable for Fagus for almost 2000 years and cannot be regarded as the direct cause for establishment at this site. The complex south Swedish cultural landscape may have favoured Fagus establishment in many areas, particularly when there has been a temporary reduction in human influence. Picea became regionally established around 800 BP, but a local expansion did not occur until c. 400 BP, coinciding with the establishment of Fagus. Picea expansion also seems to have been favoured by a moderate human influence at this site. Fagus pollen influx values have steadily increased since the time of establishment. It seems likely that the Fagus stand has continually increased in size, and probably would continue to do so if this were not prevented by human activities.

AB  - Finnish forest policy has turned into the paradigm of (participatory) multi-objective forestry during the last decades. In this paper, we identify different types of discoursal power in the Finnish print media and analyse how - and with what kind of consequences - these types of power are associated with the present paradigm. The data consist of randomly selected print media articles (n = 164) on forest issues from three case years (1977, 1997, 2017). The mixed method analysis combines qualitative content analysis with multivariate methods.
   Two types of hegemony and three types of subordination were identified in the analysis. Single-objective hegemony (1) manifested itself in a conflict free narration that operated within one's own single objective for forest use. In multi-objective hegemony (2), there were several objectives in a beautiful harmony. Deeply subordinate (3) narration emphasised fundamental conflicts between the objectives, whereas optimistic subordination (4) emphasised good co-operation as a solution for all problems. Mild subordination (5) was expressed when the objectives were mutually harmonious but there was a conflict between the means to achieve them. The paradigm of multi-objective forestry was essentially built on multi-objective hegemonic and mildly subordinate narrations.
   The types of discoursal power associated with the paradigm of multi-objective forestry appear problematic from the perspectives of sustainable development and democratic forest policy, as they effectively mask conflicts and divisions behind an ostensible consensus. The mass media actors should be more aware of these mechanisms of de-politicisation, even if we also found some marks of the return of the political in our analysis.

AB  - Modern hunting appears to be undergoing an identity crisis as a result of transitioning from labour to leisure. This transition is by no means linear or absolute. Today, hunting is framed both as a hobby for the leisure participant, and as a societal duty that delivers wildlife management, pest control for agriculture, sustainably sourced meat and euthanasia of injured wildlife. Hunting is hence doubly serious as 'serious leisure': it involves skill and perseverance, but it is also seen as serious in constituting societal labour. In this article, we employ netnographic research to examine how and in what contexts labour-leisure tensions are manifested among Swedish hunters. We observe hunters struggle with the balance between leisure and labour on four levels: (1) internally, when it comes to reconciling their personal motivations for hunting; (2) between hunters, resulting in the normative differentiation between 'urban leisure hunters' and everyday hunters in the countryside doing 'real' work; (3) between different hunting practices; and (4) between wanting to enjoy the freedom afforded by the leisure label, while also inviting formalisation of hunting's role as a public service, including compensation. Our findings show the contradiction between labour and leisure is also differently managed across these levels.

AB  - Recent years have seen a substantial growth in urban metabolism research, resulting from increasing scientific consensus that metabolic flow assessments can inform resource-efficient urban policy. However, only a few works report on retrospective evaluation of the relevance and impact of urban metabolism studies in urban planning. Practice-relevant urban metabolism research depends on the applicability of assessment methods as well as on the effectiveness of knowledge transfer between scientists and practitioners. This paper presents a retrospective evaluation of a collaborative urban metabolism project (EU-FP7 BRIDGE) conducted through empirical inquiry. The goal of the inquiry was to evaluate the applicability of the BRIDGE assessment method in urban planning and the effectiveness of the knowledge-transfer approach in one of the BRIDGE case-study cities (Helsinki, Finland) in a combined fashion. Through generalization of key findings on strengths and areas of improvement, a combined framework to evaluate both aspects in the design of urban metabolism projects is proposed. The framework aims at supporting scientists and practitioners in the development of collaborative research that can accommodate expectations as well as sustainability priorities and objectives of both parties.

AB  - Maritime traffic in the Gulf of Finland has grown remarkably during the 2000s. This increase has an impact on the environment and exposes it to risks. These problems should be controlled to guarantee sustainable development and the welfare of inhabitants in the area. A method for estimating the impact of ship-originated air emissions on the environment is to calculate their environmental externalities which are a part of the total marginal social costs of shipping. The internalization of externalities as a control method of transport would comply with the polluter pays principle and act as a fair traffic control method between transport modes. In this paper, we present the results of CO2, NOx, SOx and PM emissions originating from ships and their externalities in the Gulf of Finland up to 2015. The calculation algorithm developed for this study produces emission estimates per annum and converts them into externalities. We focus on passenger, tanker, general cargo, Ro-Ro, container and bulk vessel ship types representing almost 90% of the total NOx emissions of shipping in the area. Scenario modelling is a method for estimating the effects of forthcoming or planned regulations and helps with targeting emission abatement actions to maximize their profit. The results of the calculation algorithm show that externalities can be used as a consultative tool for transport-related decision-making. The costs are given at the price levels of the year 2000. The total external cost of ship-originated CO2, NOx, SOx and PM emissions in the Gulf of Finland was almost (sic)175 million in 2007. Due to increased traffic volumes, these costs will increase to nearly (sic)214 million in 2015. The majority of externalities are produced by CO2 emissions. If we deduct CO2 externalities from the results, we get total externalities of (sic)57 million in 2007. Following eight years (2015), externalities would be 28% or (sic)41 million lower. This would be as a result of regulation reducing the sulphur content of marine fuels. Regulating SOx and PM emissions will slow down the increasing trend of shipborne externalities in the Gulf of Finland; however, the externalities are still growing. In order to achieve a downward trend, the two major compounds resulting in externalities must be reduced, which requires strict actions to lower shipborne CO2 and NOx emissions.

CP  - 11th International Conference of the Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies
AB  - The public transport situation in Indonesia is currently facing severe challenges. Poor quality in services combined with an ever increasing need for sustainable transport solutions is challenging the current model for public transport planning and organization. Transport research provides valuable input for this development, although mainly with a focus on technology and traffic planning models. The human aspects of public transport services are more seldom considered. Therefore, in this paper we present an internationally valid yet locally relevant customer survey instrument capable of giving the customer a "voice" in the public transport development process. Building on experiences from Swedish and European public transportation research, an initial pilot study of customers' perception of service quality in public transportation in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, has been carried out.

AB  - Restoration by imitating natural disturbances is widely practised in boreal forests to increase the availability of habitats for specialized species. We studied the abundance and species richness of saproxylic beetles on different types of created dead wood during 2 years after restoration. The study was conducted on areas of a large-scale experiment in which Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests were restored by controlled burning and partial harvesting with down wood retention in southern Finland. More beetle species were attracted to spruces than to birches and more species were attracted to burnt trees than to unburnt trees killed by girdling. Birch-living species consistently benefited from fire, but on spruce, the abundance of cambium consumers and their associates was negatively affected by fire. Trees at harvested sites attracted more beetles in the first year, but the volume of down wood retention had only minor effects. Beetle assemblages were strongly altered by burning and harvesting. We conclude that burning and harvesting are efficient tools to promote species richness within a short time period, but there is a risk that the dead wood resource may be rapidly exhausted. Moreover, many saproxylic species of spruce forests may not be adapted to open habitats formed by stand-replacing disturbances.

AB  - The paper analyses the 'energy savings plan for existing buildings' (EBB) introduced in Sweden after the first oil crisis of 1973, and how effects of policies on the built heritage were perceived and communicated to a wider public. A conflict between conservation aims and energy efficiency was constructed for the first time in Sweden. The programme was a huge investment made by the government to reduce the import of oil. At first, little consideration was taken to the fact that heritage values might be at risk when giving property owners financial incentives to retrofit their houses. Soon increasing knowledge about the existing building stock showed that older houses were not necessarily energy inefficient. An information campaign launched by protagonists of building conservation encouraged property owners to direct measures to the interiors of buildings, thus saving the exterior character of not just single buildings but also complete neighbourhoods. Towards the end of EBB, the field of conservation had become a more articulated voice when it came to influencing measures aiming at increased energy efficiency. Finally, the paper discusses how values constituted in the 1970s affect policy and practice today.

AB  - Forest residue left after clear-cutting is increasingly being used as biofuel in Sweden. Deadwood is an important habitat for many species and a crucial resource for forest biodiversity. On eight clear-cuts in eastern central Sweden, the amount of Picea abies (L.) Karst. deadwood left on the ground was compared with the amount collected in piles for fuelwood extraction. It was found that 65% of the volume, 77% of the surface area and 84% of the pieces of slash were to be extracted. In another study on 23 clear-cuts in the same region, it was found that 36% of the logs left outside piles after clear-cutting were later removed. These studies indicate that a considerable amount of potential substrate is lost during slash extraction.

AB  - Prescribed burning, to prevent larger fires or to encourage ecological restoration, is a highly contested practice, raising both complex practical questions relating to safety and techniques, and deep philosophical questions about the relationship between people and nature. Previous research either analyses conflict in forest fire management, or argues for social learning but does not discuss how this might happen. We explore what community engagement in fire management might contribute, and how policy conditions enable or constrain deliberative practices in fire management in two very different countries, Sweden and Australia. In Sweden, burning is gradually emerging on foresters' and nature conservationists' agendas, whereas in Australia, prescribed burning has been practiced and debated on a relatively broad scale for some time. Both countries rely much on technical expertise, while merging this with local knowledge in transformative processes in which conflicts and difference have a place could enhance the quality of the debates.

AB  - Forest fuel harvesting increases the need to collect not just logging residues but also tree stumps from harvested stands. This biomass removal has raised concern over forest biodiversity. Here, the effects of stump harvesting on spiders, ants, harvestmen, ground beetles and epiedaphic springtails occupying boreal Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest floor were studied two and five years after harvesting by comparing pitfall trap samples from clear-cut sites with and without subsequent stump harvesting and from unharvested mature forests in central Finland. At harvested sites, traps were placed both on intact and exposed mineral soil surface. Open-habitat and generalist ground beetles benefitted from the stump harvesting, but generally the numbers of arthropods between stump harvesting treatments and different aged clear-cuts were rather similar. The intact forest floor hosted more ants, springtails and harvestmen than did the exposed mineral soil. Moreover, the community structure of spiders, ground beetles and spring tails was affected by stump harvesting, forest-floor quality (intact or exposed), and time elapsed since harvesting. Based on these results we recommend minimizing the exposure of mineral soil during management practices. However, more long-term studies are required to document the development of fauna in the harvested areas and the ecosystem-level impacts of utilization of forest biomass for energy.

AB  - The first lepidopteran genome (Bombyx mori) was published in 2004. Ten years later the genome of Melitaea cinxia came out as the third butterfly genome published, and the first eukaryotic genome sequenced in Finland. Owing to Ilkka Hanski, the M. cinxia system in the angstrom land Islands has become a famous model for metapopulation biology. More than 20 years of research on this system provides a strong ecological basis upon which a genetic framework could be built. Genetic knowledge is an essential addition for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics and the genetic basis of variability in life history traits. Here we review the process of the M. cinxia genome project, its implications for lepidopteran genome evolution, and describe how the genome has been used for gene expression studies to identify genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation. Finally, we introduce some future possibilities and challenges for genomic research in M. cinxia and other Lepidoptera.

KW  - Sacred, Religion and geography
AB  - A case study of sacred landscapes in the contemporary era, the article deals with a particular mountain and its rise to sacredness. Fuelled by plans of ski-slope development, the fate of Tromsdalstind caused a lively debate in local newspapers, as well as a report issued by the Sami Parliament. The report connected sacredness to Sami traditions in the past and to current laws on the protection of Sami cultural memories. This, then, was a case of sacredness constructed outside the context of organized religions and ongoing religious traditions, as well as a case of using secular laws as the primary basis for definitions of sacredness.
   Through this process, love for the mountain appears to have grown deeper and more religious, both for the Sami as well as for other northern Norwegians. Neither more nor less authentic than those of the past, these concepts of sacredness belong to the late modern world of law culture, nature romanticism, and to pan-indigenous spirituality as a "religion" in the making.

AB  - The boreal forests of Scandinavia offer a considerable resource base, and use of the resource for the production of less carbon-intensive alternative transport fuel is one strategy being considered in Norway. Here, we quantify the resource potential and investigate the environmental implications of wood-based transportation relative to a fossil reference system for a specific region in Norway. We apply a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment to evaluate four E85 production system designs based on two distinct wood-to-ethanol conversion technologies. We form best and worst case scenarios to assess the sensitivity of impact results through the adjustment of key parameters, such as biomass-to-ethanol conversion efficiency and upstream biomass transport distance. Depending on the system design, global warming emission reductions of 46% to 68% per-MJ-gasoline avoided can be realized in the region, along with reductions in most of the other environmental impact categories considered. We find that the region's surplus forest-bioenergy resources are vast; use for the production of bioethanol today would have resulted in the displacement of 55% to 68% of the region's gasoline-based global warming emission-or 6% to 8% of Norway's total global warming emissions associated with road transportation.

AB  - Hunters can affect the behavior of wildlife by inducing a landscape of fear, selecting individuals with specific traits, or altering resource availability across the landscape. Most research investigating the influence of hunting on wildlife resource selection has focused on target species and less attention has been devoted to nontarget species, such as scavengers that can be both attracted or repelled by hunting activities. We used resource selection functions to identify areas where hunters were most likely to kill moose (Alces alces) in south-central Sweden during the fall. Then, we used step-selection functions to determine whether female brown bears (Ursus arctos) selected or avoided these areas and specific resources during the moose hunting season. We found that, during both day and nighttime, female brown bears avoided areas where hunters were more likely to kill moose. We found evidence that resource selection by brown bears varied substantially during the fall and that some behavioral changes were consistent with disturbance associated with moose hunters. Brown bears were more likely to select concealed locations in young (i.e., regenerating) and coniferous forests and areas further away from roads during the moose hunting season. Our results suggest that brown bears react to both spatial and temporal variations in apparent risk during the fall: moose hunters create a landscape of fear and trigger an antipredator response in a large carnivore even if bears are not specifically targeted during the moose hunting season. Such antipredator responses might lead to indirect habitat loss and lower foraging efficiency and the resulting consequences should be considered when planning hunting seasons.

AB  - 1. Kleptoparasitic and parasitoid insects are expected to be particularly sensitive to changes in habitat availability due to their high trophic position and small population sizes compared with their hosts, but there are only few quantitative studies on their population changes.
   2. Here, we studied the distribution and abundance of 48 kleptoparasitic and parasitoid species of cuckoo wasps (Chrysididae) and eight selected host species recorded in Finland from 1840 to 2015 based on an extensive survey of entomological collections. Population trends were assessed by studying changes in occupancy in 10 9 10 km grid squares between two study periods, 1840-1967 and 1968-2015.
   3. Statistically significant decreases in occurrence were found for 11 cuckoo wasp species and one host species, while significant increases were not observed for any species. Trends of cuckoo wasps and their hosts were positively correlated, and changes were generally stronger in cuckoo wasps than in their hosts.
   4. In a comparative analysis of species traits, abundance, body size and nesting type of host were related to occurrence changes of cuckoo wasps. Scarce and small species that use above ground-nesting hosts declined more than abundant and large species that use ground-nesting hosts.
   5. Cuckoo wasp species dependent on dead wood are more vulnerable to changes in the environment than species associated with open sandy habitats. While both groups of species have probably suffered from habitat loss, the emergence of secondary habitats may have benefitted species living in sandy areas and compensated for the negative impact of habitat destruction.

AB  - Malmo, in southern Sweden, has been notable for how it has changed in recent decades and how new patterns of urban development have emerged which have been lauded as sustainable. Attention has particularly focused on the more spectacular developments such as the regeneration of the Western Harbour, and the development of Hyllie, a major transport interchange and new commercial centre alongside residential development. The focus of this paper is away from these major developments and instead looks at Norra Sorgenfri, a former industrial site, presented as a new form of sustainable urban development that moves away from the spectacular and focuses on everyday life. Here we analyse the representations of the city and urban living that are constituted by the planning vision for Norra Sorgenfri and particularly consider the role that urban forms are attributed within this vision.Our analysis highlights the ideas and representations of sustainable urban development with a focus on social sustainability and situates them within the existing literature looking at representations of urban development and urban sustainability within Malmo.

AB  - Many nutrients are lost from soil to water via tile drains. However, there are very few reliable studies of such phosphorus (P) losses under Swedish agriculture practices, especially in connection to fertiliser and slurry applications and related to nutrient balances. Tile drain losses were measured from nine experimental plots in south-west Sweden; four plots were measured for 7 years and five plots for 2-3 years. Cereals, mainly spring barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) and oats (Avena sativa, L.), were grown in six plots, while one plot was cultivated with grass, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis, L.), one with lucerne (Medicago sativa, L.) and meadow fescue (F. pratensis, L.), and the last one was a "set-aside'' with grass (Lolium perenne, L. and Trifolium repens, L.) that was neither fertilised nor used for crop removal. Attention was paid to the forms in which P was transported to water since this has important ecological implications. Average losses of particulate P (PP) from the "set-aside land'' was significantly lower than from the cereal production, but the average losses of soluble reactive P (SRP) and dissolved non reactive P (DUP) were the same. Average loss of PP from the grass ley during 3 years (0.09 kg per ha(-1) y(-1)) was significantly less than the losses from cereal production. Total P loss of 0.3 kg per ha(-1) y(-1) was equal to the average loss from the Swedish monitoring network of observation fields. Compared to the average nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching, which was 7 kg per ha(-1) y(-1) from cereals, the NO3-N leaching was very low from the plots with lucerne-grass and "set-aside''. After applying and directly ploughing in 80 kg ha(-1) of superphosphate for cereal production in November 1998, 0.6-1.8 kg SRP ha(-1) y(-1) was lost through the drain tiles. Surface application of cattle slurry in spring 1999 to the grass ley also resulted in a very pronounced increased base level of SRP. This paper documents the importance of applying slurry during dry conditions and of placing fertiliser into the soil according to crop requirements in the time perspective of one year.

Sports facilities, sports and sports facilities, sports facilities, sports and cultural facilities. The practice of building bridges made of glued wood in these countries shows that they have been in operation for decades without additional operating costs. Glued wood in modern conditions, when productive flame retardants are used that protect it from fire, antiseptics from possible decay expand the scope of such structures. One of the important obstacles to the limiting applications of large-span glued wooden structures is the complexity of the solution nodes. Bearing structures experience difficulties when exposed to static and cyclic loads. Cyclic loads can be caused by wind loads, production equipment, traffic, and seismic processes. Reinforcement in wood, reinforcement and reinforcement under load. Wood and metal are resistant to cyclic loads. Studies will be conducted at the border of the elements to be glued. This article presents the results of tests for the effects of static and cyclic loads on reinforcement from a 14 mm reinforcing bar of class A5 on FRF-50T along natural-sized glued wood fibers. Certain coefficients of the endurance of the compound when exposed to cyclic loads with two load asymmetry coefficients p = 0.5 and p = 0.2.

AB  - Tourism education has matured from vocational to more liberal education while current trends underline the importance of critical studies and the shift of curricula to more action-oriented forms of education and citizenship education. However, a gap can be noticed between theory and practice in the development of pedagogy for sustainable tourism. The research reported here draws from debates in tourism education, education for sustainability, critical studies, and education for citizenship to develop a conceptual framework for pedagogy for sustainable tourism. This framework is used to reflect on the curriculum space of a master programme in tourism in Sweden in an analytic autoethnographic approach. The analysis indicates that the master programme addresses several aspects of the reflective vocational and reflective liberal curriculum space. It would also benefit from the integration of more experiential, action-oriented learning to strengthen the communal understanding of civil action and education for citizenship. This research contributes to the conceptualisation of the curriculum space for sustainable tourism. Such efforts are considered especially important in acknowledging the complex, dynamic character of tourism higher education. The aim is to invite a dialogue about the reform and evolution of tourism education to meet the needs for a sustainable future.

AB  - The health and welfare of farmed fish are often regarded with less concern than for other production animals. This review compares the Norwegian legal health and welfare frameworks for broiler chickens and farmed salmon, with the aim of improving regulations for salmon farming in Norway. Highlighting differences in laws, regulations and governmental organisation are also highly relevant in general, especially in developing welfare regulations for farmed fish in other countries. Norwegian chicken farmers must comply with two main laws, the Norwegian Animal Welfare Act and the Food Act, governed by the same ministry and governmental agency. The salmon farmers must in addition relate to the Aquaculture Act, different ministries and several agencies with different objectives. Compared to the regulation of chicken farming, the regulation of salmon farming is more complex, has potentially conflicting aims and uses less positive welfare phrasings. Thus, the regulation may be perceived as focusing on profitability over welfare. Despite having many similar paragraphs to regulation for chicken farming, salmon farming regulation is less strict in the daily securing of animals and recordings of mortality. There is no specified slaughterhouse control of high-density productions, as there is for broiler chickens. There are also differences in the mandatory welfare courses, one being that infection prevention is a stated topic for chickens. The Norwegian Animal Welfare Act has no possibility of dispensation, meaning exceptions, and treats fish and other animals equally. Future regulatory frameworks for farmed fish production should avoid unintended downgrading of fish health and welfare.

AB  - This article analyzes different forest management strategies to meet the increasing demand of biomass for bioenergy and assesses the resulting global warming implications. Applied to maritime pine forest plantations in Portugal, the assessed strategies are: full harvest of residues (FULL); sustainable and proactive management (SMART); expansion of forest plantations on abandoned farmland (EXP); and biomass import (IMP). A dynamic CO2 inventory was obtained for each scenario using a parametric stand-level C-flux model adapted to Portuguese conditions, which was then extended to the landscape-level and coupled to a dynamic climate model. The time-adjusted absolute global warming potential (AGWP) was then calculated at both stand and landscape levels, considering the timing of all CO2 emissions and uptakes (both fossil and biogenic). To test the robustness of the findings, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Results show that, in a supply-constrained context like Portugal, SMART and EXP management strategies can provide important global warming mitigation benefits (GWP(bio) < 0), although their supply-response is slow (long-term strategies). On the other hand, FULL and IMP management strategies show moderate to null AGWP reduction potential (0 < GWP(bio) < 1), while involving other possible risks (e.g., exacerbated soil erosion, nutrient depletion or uncertain impacts abroad), but their supply-response is fast (short-term strategies). National forest regulations and energy policies should be revised to address the drawbacks related to all management strategies and to unleash the multiple environmental benefits they can provide in the short- and long-term.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses, via both surface runoff and subsurface drainage water, were monitored in an agricultural field in northern Sweden for 32 yr. The objective was to determine losses of N and P in a long-term perspective in relation to meteorological factors and impacts of agricultural land use, with a focus on relative contributions of surface runoff and subsurface drainage water to N and P losses. In order to collect surface runoff water, an embankment was installed on three sides of the field, and the fourth side had an open ditch that drove runoff water to a measuring station. Subsurface water draining from the field was collected in a fishbone-shaped drainage system that terminated at the measuring station. In 50% of years (16/32), mean annual concentration of total N (TN) was significantly higher in subsurface drainage water than in surface runoff water. An opposing trend was seen for total P (TP), with mean annual concentration being significantly higher in surface runoff water than in subsurface drainage water in all but 3 of the 32 yr monitored. Years with a barley crop had higher TN concentration in subsurface drainage water but no difference in surface runoff compared with years with ley. In contrast, years with barley had lower TN concentration in surface runoff than years with ley, with no difference in TP in subsurface drainage water.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study how local governments in Sweden view the role of public transport in society, and to investigate how public transport is used in a strategic capacity. By studying general policy documents, the ambition is to gain a wider understanding of the role of public transport based on the societal context it is situated in. Documents from 15 regions and 27 municipalities have been analysed by a qualitative content analysis. Results show that public transport is regarded as an important factor towards achieving other goals and other public values, particularly those related to economic and environmental issues; and that the social dimension is not as prioritised. Rail-bound public transport is often advocated, as are collaboration between organizations and integrated land-use and transport planning. However, the studied documents showed large overall differences in how counties and municipalities address public transport issues. It should be a priority in Sweden's main steering documents to treat public transport consistently and give it the same priority as other societal functions-not least because Sweden's treatment of public transport is a reasonable reflection of its overall society and can influence prioritisations and considerations in counties and municipalities across the country.

AB  - Landscape ecology deals with the effects of the spatial configuration of mosaics on a wide variety of ecological phenomena. Because problems in many areas of conservation biology and resource management are related to landscape use, development of a rigorous theoretical and empirical foundation for landscape ecology is essential. We present an approach to research that focuses on how individual-level mechanisms operating in a heterogeneous mosaic produce ecological patterns that are spatially dependent. The theoretical framework that we develop considers the density and distribution of a population among patches as a function of (a) within-patch movement patterns of individuals; (b) emigration from patches as a function of population density, patch configuration, patch context, and within-patch movement; and (c) loss of individuals as they disperse through landscape elements. This theoretical framework is coupled with an empirical approach that emphasizes the use of experimental model systems (EMS), small-scale systems occupying ''microlandscapes.'' Such systems are amenable to experimental manipulation with adequate replication and control and may serve as analogs of systems occurring at broader landscape scales. where rigorous empirical work is more difficult. We illustrate the use of EMS with examples from our studies of beetles and ants in North America and of voles in Norway. Finally, we consider some factors that may constrain extrapolations from EMS to other systems, scales, or levels. We believe that implementation of a mechanistic approach to landscape ecology is essential to deriving generalizations about how spatial heterogeneity influences ecological systems.

AB  - In salmon aquaculture, the sustainable management of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is limited by the adaptive capacity of the parasite. This is evident in the repeated evolution of pesticide resistance in the salmon louse population. To better prepare for resistance, we constructed a numerical metapopulation model that predicts the evolutionary dynamics of lice across an interconnected farm network. This model integrates within-farm population dynamics and between-farm louse dispersal, the latter using outputs from a state-of-the-art particle-tracking model. Distinct from previous metapopulation models, it also simulates spatial and temporal genetic variation arising from selection. The model was parameterized to simulate the evolution of resistance to the pesticide azamethiphos on farms in southern Norway. It successfully reproduced the rapid (within 10 years) evolution of azamethiphos resistance following extensive delousing treatments. It also identified strong spatial patterns in resistance, with regions of high farm connectivity being potential hotspots of louse adaptation. Rates of infestation and evolution were significantly reduced when highly connected farms were excluded from the simulation, compared to when low-connectivity or random sites were excluded. This model can be a valuable tool for coordinating pest management at a regional scale, in a way that slows or prevents the spread of resistance.

AB  - Capercaillie (Tetra urogallus) has traditionally been considered an old forest-dependent species. The lekking sites especially, were thought to be located in older forests. We studied the persistence of Capercaillie lekking areas in relation to mature forest cover at three study areas in Finland (southwestern, SW; central, CE; and northern, NO). A total of 381 leks were inspected twice at intervals of 10-30 years and were classified as either persisting or vacated. We defined mature forest as forest with > 152 m(3)ha(-1) of timber (SW and CE Finland) or > 68 m(3)ha(-1) of timber (NO Finland). We measured mature-forest cover within two radii around the leks (1,000 and 3,000 m) using satellite image-based forest inventories, and performed logistic regression analyses on these data. We did not find significant trends between mature-forest cover and lekking-area persistence in any of the study areas. However, the proportion of mature forests may have already been too low to detect the significance of this factor. The only significant factor affecting the lekking-site persistence was time lag between surveys. The positive relationship between the time lag and lekking-site persistence in CE and NO Finland may be due to the partial recovery of the landscapes in terms of forest regrowth, from extensive clear-cut harvesting in the 1950s and 1960s. In SW Finland, the relationship was negative, possibly indicating more permanent changes in the landscape that is currently characterized by human settlements and agricultural areas. We conclude that in present-day Finland, the area covered by mature forest is most likely too scarce to explain the lekking-area persistence of Capercaillie. An alternative explanation is that some important structural characteristics are missing from the current mature forests.

AB  - Cadastral information and land administration systems are central to effective land markets, land use and sustainable development. This paper focuses on one aspect of land administration dynamism: the changing uses of cadastral information. We follow a qualitative approach and offer an overview of why, how, and in what form user groups use cadastre and land register data in Finland. We then explore different user groups' perceptions of emerging changes and discuss their implications for the future land administration system. We identify six major changes that potentially have such implications: the streamlining of environmental permit procedures, the integration of public services, three-dimensional land use planning, tightening banking regulations, digital services, and e-government, and coordination among public data agencies. The paper addresses the relatively unexplored customer side of cadastral information and reiterates the need for an interoperable, accurate and reliable land administration system.

AB  - This article proposes new insights on sustainability of tourism through social innovations. The underlying aim is to find practical ways to enhance sustainability in and through tourism, as sustainability has been criticized for its abstract nature. The marginally studied relationship of sustainability of tourism and social innovations is explored by utilizing ethnographic data on tourism, which is expected to grow in Kemi, Finland. Two examined examples of social innovations-related to social inclusion, employment, and using waste food-offer insights for tourism by bringing out non-traditional public sector perspectives and novel, multi-sectoral grass-root initiatives for coping with societal challenges at the local level. This paper suggests that sustainability of tourism can be informed through social innovations as cooperative processes, which respond to local needs and create novel solutions and social and other value at the destination. It is discussed how insights from social innovations can widen the understanding of what constitutes a tourism stakeholder, bring in the holistic, multi-sectoral dimensions of sustainability, and provide examples on the use of collaborative spaces for practical tourism planning.

AB  - A novel agri-environment scheme for Environmental Fallows (EFs) was introduced in Finland to replace a former obligatory set-aside under the Common Agricultural Policy. It currently keeps fallow at nearly 7% of the agricultural land area and therefore may make a unique contribution to the enhancement of farmland biodiversity on the national scale. Farmers can chose from four types of EF fields (game, grassland, landscape, and meadow) or their combination as long as their total annual area falls within 5-15% of the field area. We studied the biodiversity value of EF fields in three regions across Finland (n = 229) based on survey data of vegetation in four fallow types. We compared EF plant communities to those of other non-cropped biotopes (margins and semi-natural grasslands) (n = 99). The meadow type sown with low competitive grasses and meadow species has proven to be the most species-rich EF type, approaching the diversity level of semi-natural meadows. Vegetation of the grassland type varied considerably ranging from swards similar to those of production grasslands to ones typical for semi-natural meadows. The vegetation composition of the game and landscape types of EF differed most from the other non-cropped biotopes, and other EFs. Plant species richness in the perennial fallows correlated positively with the parcel size (through increased within-field diversity) and age, and variation in the sward height. It was negatively related to the sward's height and density, and the reported fertility level before EF establishment. Plant species richness in EFs was not related to the forest cover in the surrounding landscape. The scheme to a greater extent than the former set-aside contributed to both the amount and diversity of non-cropped vegetation on the landscape level. The long-term efficiency of the current scheme is likely to be compromised by its untargeted and unbinding nature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth in urban population requires solutions that improve the quality of life, especially by proper waste management, reduction of air pollution and CO2 emissions, and prevention of food waste. One of the key initiatives introduced and supported by the EU is circular economy. The main principle is 'to close the loop' by greater re-use and recycling of materials. To meet these challenges, a new solution was developed in the project Food to Waste to Food. In Norwegian climatic conditions, the cultivation of vegetables and mushrooms was performed in a low-energy semi-closed greenhouse insulated with soap bubbles. Presented here are the details in a system called "digeponics", in which biogas digester residues (solid and liquid parts) were used for growing medium and fertiliser for cultivation: the solid part was vermicomposted (converting nutrients into available forms) and mixed with green waste compost (to provide structure) into a growing medium for plants - rich in nutrients and beneficial microorganisms. The liquid, high in NH4+, was used in an aerated circulating solution. Through a series of experiments, we present the key measures for rapid conversion of the organic residue into a nutrient rich (e.g., NO3-) and aerobic root zone. The main challenges were related to management of pH, EC, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrate and phosphate, which is discussed here. The input was nothing else than the waste itself. A control treatment based on mineral fertilisers and peat substrate was included. The yield of tomatoes was comparable to the control treatment. The results showed that a chemically balanced conventional system could be substituted by this microbial and waste based system, less chemically balanced, but more natural and sustainable.

AB  - Cultural tourism has become an alternative economic activity in many indigenous sites, and local tourist providers compete globally by commodifying their culture in an efficient, attractive manner. This process is not however a straightforward one, because of the need to manage both the multilingual context and the interaction between host and tourists, and this can lead to tensions for all parties. We examine a Reindeer Farm in the indigenous language space of Samiland. Based on a long-term ethnography, we identify different scripts which are used within the tourist encounter to pre-empt and manage tensions around the legitimacy of the host, the collusion and cooperation between host and tourists, and the differing linguistic resources of tourists and host - in terms of the interplay between English as a tourist lingua franca, Finnish as national language, and to a limited extent the local Inari Sami and Northern Sami languages. We argue that the stakes involved in producing cultural tourism are potentially higher in indigenous, minority language sites.
   Kulttuuriturismista on tullut yksi elinkeinon vaihtoehto monilla syrjaseuduilla. Paikalliset turismiyrittajat pystyvat kilpailemaan globaaleilla markkinoilla tuotteistamalla paikallista kulttuuria huokuttelevalla ja tehokkaalla tavalla. Tama prosessi ei ole kuitenkaan yksioikoinen ja usein siihen liittyykin erilaisia autentisuuteen, monikielisyyteen ja vuorovaikutuksen hallintaan liittyvia jannitteita osapuolten valilla. Tarkastelemme tassa artikkelissa yhta esimerkkia paikallisen kulttuurin tuotteistamisesta, vierailua porotilalle Saamenmaassa, Euroopan pohjoisimmassa periferiassa. Soveltaen diskurssintutkimusta ja etnografiaa, tarkastelemme miten ja millaisia skripteja vierailun hallinnassa ja mahdollisten jannitteiden ratkaisemisessa hyodynnetaan. Tassa kontekstissa jannitteet liittyvat sellaisiin vuorovaikutuksen hetkiin, jolloin isannan legitiimiys kyseenalaistetaan tai yhteistyo isannan ja vieraan valilla vaarantuu tai isannan ja vieraiden erilaiset kielliset resurssit kaipaavat kontrollointia.

KW  - PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT
AB  - AimsTo study the probability of seeking/undergoing aesthetic dental treatment (ADT) and compare self-perception of orofacial appearance (OA) based on sex, age, and monthly income; and to estimate the impact of OA on life satisfaction (LS) among Finnish and Brazilian adults, considering the indirect effect of receiving ADT and the moderating effects of those sociodemographic variables. MethodsThis was an online cross-sectional study. Orofacial Esthetic Scale (OES), Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire (PIDAQ) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were used. Probability of seeking/receiving ADT was calculated using logistic regression and odds ratio (OR). OA scores were compared according to sociodemographic characteristics (ANOVA, & alpha; = 5%). Structural equations models estimated the impact of OA on LS. Results3,614 Finns [75.1% female, 32.0 (SD = 11.6) years] and 3,979 Brazilians [69.9% female, 33.0 (SD = 11.3) years] participated in the study. Women were more likely to receive ADT than men in both countries (OR>1.3). However, no statistically or practical significant differences were observed in OA between sexes (p>0.05 or p<0.05, & eta;(2)(p) = 0.00-0.02). In Finland, demand for ADT (OR = 0.9-1.0) and OA scores (p>0.05) were the same among different ages and monthly income. In Brazil, younger individuals (OR>1.6) and those with higher monthly income (OR>2.7) were more likely to receive ADT, while those with lower income had a greater psychosocial impact of OA (p0.07). Individuals who were more satisfied with their own OA and had less psychosocial impact from OA had higher levels of LS (& beta; = 0.31-0.34; p<0.01; explained variance: 9.8-13.1%). ConclusionDemand for ADT is influenced by sociodemographic and cultural factors. Greater societal pressure on physical appearance is observed among women in Western countries. In countries with high socioeconomic inequalities, consumerism and social prestige are involved in this demand. Self-perception of orofacial appearance plays a significant role in individuals' subjective well-being. Therefore, the planning of aesthetic treatments in the orofacial region should consider the patient's perceptions and social context.

AB  - This paper will give an overview of the logistic situation in Finland, especially on the sustainability viewpoint. Finland has quite extraordinary logistical situation in both international and national logistics. The need for transportation is significantly higher than any other EU country mostly because the geographical position and national economic structure. Because of these handicaps our transportation performance in both materials and persons is high comparing to other EU countries. This is a significant challenge for sustainable development, which is today one of the cornerstones in EU policies. How to cut down the energy consumption and emissions created in Finland by everyday logistics without distracting the holistic functionality of our society?

AB  - This paper presents a holistic approach to sustainable urban brownfield redevelopment where specific focus is put on the integration of a multitude of subsurface qualities in the early phases of the urban redevelopment process, i.e. in the initiative and plan phases. Achieving sustainability in brownfield redevelopment projects may be constrained by a failure of engagement between two key expert constituencies: urban planners/designers and subsurface engineers, leading to missed opportunities and unintended outcomes in the plan realisation phase. A more integrated approach delivers greater benefits. Three case studies in the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden were used to test different sustainability assessment instruments in terms of the possibility for knowledge exchange between the subsurface and the surface sectors and in terms of cooperative learning among experts and stakeholders. Based on the lessons learned from the case studies, a generic decision process framework is suggested that supports holistic decision making. The suggested framework focuses on stakeholder involvement, communication, knowledge exchange and learning and provides an inventory of instruments that can support these processes.

AB  - Low-impact development (LID) structures are combined with traditional measures to manage stormwater and cope with increased runoff rates originating from heavy urbanization and climate change. As the use of LIDs for climate adaptation increases, practitioners need more knowledge on LID performance in future climates for successful planning and implementation. In this study, temporal downscaling of regional climate projections for three cities in Norway is performed, using the concept of scale invariance to downscale the distribution of extreme precipitation from daily to sub-daily timescales. From this, local-scale intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves for future precipitation were obtained. Using climate projections of daily temporal resolution as input to water balance models and the obtained IDF relationships as input to event-based models allowed for assessing the retention capacity, peak flow reduction potential and pollution control of three different types of LIDs: green roofs, bioretention cells, and detention basins. The downscaling resulted in large local variations in presumed increase of both precipitation amount and intensity, contradicting current design recommendations in Norway. Countrywide, a decrease in the overall LID performance was found, although some positive effects of temperature rises were detected. The study illustrated the importance of evapotranspiration- and infiltration-based processes in future stormwater management and how coupling of LID structures in series can significantly reduce required detention volumes.

AB  - Simple Summary Humans extirpated the wolf Canis lupus from many regions of Europe. Today, the wolf is returning to many of these areas, and with it, people's opposition due to its predatory habits on, among others, ungulate game species. Based on existing data on wolf prey selection, kill rates and territory size, we extrapolated the results from central Sweden and Poland to southern Sweden, where wolf recolonization has not yet occurred and conservation conflicts with hunters are expected. Thus, we calculated the proportion of moose Alces alces, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama and wild boar Sus scrofa that would be killed by wolves in the municipalities of southern Sweden if wolf recolonization occurs. We found that the current system of five ungulate species in southern Sweden could potentially support a wolf density two to four times higher than in the current wolf distribution in central Sweden, which are mainly inhabited by roe deer and moose. With this type of research, we can anticipate and work to ameliorate the social unrest and expected conservation conflicts that may arise once wolves or other large carnivore species recolonize areas of Europe that are returning to the wild. The ongoing recolonisations of human-transformed environments in Europe by large carnivores like the wolf Canis lupus means that conservation conflicts could re-surface, among other reasons, due to predation on ungulate game species. We estimated the effect of wolves on ungulate species using data on wolf prey selection, kill rates and territory size to build a hypothetical case of future expansion. We extrapolated results on predation from the current wolf distribution in central Sweden and eastern Poland to the eventual wolf recolonisation of southern Sweden. We then calculated the proportion of five ungulate game species killed annually by wolves, and the ratio between the predicted annual predation by wolves given future colonization and the number of ungulates currently harvested by hunters. Results showed that wolf recolonization in southern Sweden would have a minor impact on the estimated population densities of red deer Cervus elaphus, fallow deer Dama dama and wild boar Sus scrofa, but is likely to lead to a significant reduction in human captures of moose Alces alces and roe deer Capreolus capreolus. The current five-ungulate species system in southern Sweden suggests a potential for two to four times higher wolf density than the two-ungulate species system in the northern part of their current distribution. Management and conservation of recolonizing large carnivores require a better understanding of the observed impact on game populations under similar ecological conditions to ameliorate conservation conflicts and achieve a paradigm of coexistence. Integrating these predictions into management is paramount to the current rewilding trend occurring in many areas of Europe or North America.

AB  - Deadwood is recognized as one of the most important resources affecting forest biodiversity. Its absence from the forest landscape is, therefore, of concern, such that one official Swedish environmental objective is to increase the volume of deadwood. However, increasing the use of renewable energy sources, another environmental goal, is likely to work against this biodiversity objective. In this study we utilize a regional economic forest sector model, focusing on northern Sweden, in order to estimate the effect of a large scale introduction of stump harvest on the future use of forest fuel. In addition, an ecological model, describing the relationship between the availability of stumps and the abundance of saproxylic beetles, is linked to the economic model.
   The parameters used in the economic model are derived from a data set spanning 28 years while the ecological model is derived from a survey of ten clear cuts, undertaken seven years after the clear cutting, in order to investigate the abundance of saproxylic beetles in stumps. We simulate the effects of an increased demand for wood fuels in northern Sweden, with or without stump harvest. The two scenarios have different effects on all major round wood markets in the region, as well as on the abundance of saproxylic beetles. More specifically, the harvest of stumps is associated with a 5% reduction in the mean abundance of saproxylic beetles living in deadwood on future clear cuts and a 3% increase in the use of renewable energy recourses in heating plants.

AB  - Article 4 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child stipulates that state parties have a positive obligation to implement the necessary legal measures to secure the rights recognised in the Convention. The CRC Committee has stated that incorporation is its preferred method of implementation. In Sweden, the issue of incorporation has been the subject of a lengthy and contentious debate. This article aims to unpack the reasons for this. It is suggested that technical-legal arguments against the incorporation of the CRC are grounded in and intertwined with cultural-legal arguments. While these arguments may be more or less clearly expressed by the various parties in the Swedish debate, I argue that they seem to have played an important role in the process through which this international treaty has been made applicable on the domestic level in Sweden.

AB  - As the construction sector continues to be associated with highly energy-intensive practices leading to excessive carbon emissions, governments in many countries are promoting a shift towards greener building practices, like the use of wood in multistory construction (WMC). Meanwhile, local-government actors (e.g., municipalities) often act as important gatekeepers of urban development given their authority to oversee or approve zoning and land-use plans. Despite this fact, they are not much focused on in existing WMC research. This qualitative interview study serves to fill a gap by studying municipal civil servant perceptions regarding WMC, using Finland as a case study. Civil servants were asked to elicit their personal opinions on WMC, and what they perceived as favorable or unfavorable about using wood as a multistory construction material. Results show increasing support for WMC, and that this is due to key benefits made possible by the technical qualities of engineered wood products in emerging WMC projects. These products permit both the adoption of rapid construction practices that enhance citizens' quality of living, and also the sourcing of local renewable building materials that support local industries. On the other hand, barriers to the use of wood were identified, such as inadequate information distribution, a limited number of WMC industry actors, and inefficient policy measures.

AB  - A questionnaire was made to clarify the needs of future biodiversity information users in Finland. It was sent to 90 organisations, of which 48 submitted an answer. Results from four principal questions posed in the questionnaire are presented. According to the answers, the most important objectives of biodiversity measurement in the National Forest Inventories should be assessing the state and monitoring the changes of biodiversity. The respondents supported different approaches, which were direct measurement of biodiversity and assessment of biodiversity using indicators. The answers of different respondent groups were, however, highly overlapping. In respondents' opinions, the most important subjects to measure were subjects related with key habitats or key biotopes, abundance and quality of dead and decaying wood and endangered species. The estimated benefits from biodiversity information varied with the organisation groups.

AB  - Accelerating climate change is causing severe habitat fragmentation in the Arctic, threatening the persistence of many cold-adapted species. The Scandinavian arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is highly fragmented, with a once continuous, circumpolar distribution, it struggled to recover from a demographic bottleneck in the late 19th century. The future persistence of the entire Scandinavian population is highly dependent on the northernmost Fennoscandian subpopulations (Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula), to provide a link to the viable Siberian population. By analyzing 43 arctic fox genomes, we quantified genomic variation and inbreeding in these populations. Signatures of genome erosion increased from Siberia to northern Sweden indicating a stepping-stone model of connectivity. In northern Fennoscandia, runs of homozygosity (ROH) were on average similar to 1.47-fold longer than ROH found in Siberia, stretching almost entire scaffolds. Moreover, consistent with recent inbreeding, northern Fennoscandia harbored more homozygous deleterious mutations, whereas Siberia had more in heterozygous state. This study underlines the value of documenting genome erosion following population fragmentation to identify areas requiring conservation priority. With the increasing fragmentation and isolation of Arctic habitats due to global warming, understanding the genomic and demographic consequences is vital for maintaining evolutionary potential and preventing local extinctions.

AB  - Individual and organisational receptivity for change towards the use of sustainable stormwater management systems has been previously examined, but the significance of the different contexts for achieving this has been largely unexplored. This paper examines the significance of contexts associated to the actions to bring this about by proposing and evaluating an emerging framework based on two related receptivity theories: the individual or organisational approach and the contextual approach. Results from a Swedish national questionnaire with professionals in stormwater management have been used, together with a limited number of interviews to develop and understand the validity of the framework. The analysis has indicated that the respondents were professionally prepared for change (action) but not practically prepared due to inadequate supportive contexts. In response, a number of potential contexts associated to the necessary actions were identified. The framework was found to provide new insights into the influence of receptive contexts for a change in water management practice. These insights can be used by policy makers and others to better support the realization of professional openness for change and thus accelerate the process of change to sustainable stormwater practice.

AB  - This paper presents an econometric test of two hypotheses underlying the occurrence of non-indigenous species (NIS) at the global scale: openness of recipient nations which allows for international trade to act as a vector of NIS, and habitat fragmentation in recipient nations which facilitates establishment of introduced NIS. Explorative econometric methods have been utilised that combine the analysis of dimensionality with subset variable selection and multiple linear regression. Both NIS hypotheses are thereby supported, although slightly different in the cases of the mainland and island nations. It is concluded that expressions of openness have a larger impact on the number of NIS per unit territorial area in the mainland nations, whereas biota variables play a more dominant role in the case of the island nations. It is also concluded that different expressions of NIS occurrence affect the result, where NIS per area unit facilitates excellent explanatory performance.

AB  - There is an urgent need to start generating energy within cities in order to pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient society. Renewable energy by means of active solar energy systems (solar thermal, ST and/or photovoltaics, PV) can be generated using roofs and facades of buildings. In this study, the annual solar energy potential of typical Swedish city blocks was analysed in order to develop guidelines for urban planners and architects. The results show that the design of the city blocks has a significant effect (up to 50%) on the total annual solar energy production. The study also shows that the contribution from active solar energy can be significant even in the urban environment, but shading by adjacent buildings may greatly limit the total amount of energy produced.

AB  - Transformation towards sustainable development is about findings new ways of thinking, organising and doing to navigate wicked challenges such as climate change and urbanisation. Such challenges call for new governance modes that match the complexity of the systems to be handled, where multi-level governance and collaborative approaches have been suggested to contribute to such transformative capacity building. This in-depth, trans-disciplinary study investigates how the multi-level governance context in Stockholm, Sweden, influences the transformative capacity from the perspective of local sustainability initiatives. It was found that even though the decentralized governance of the Stockholm region hosts a great potential in supporting city wide transformation, it is hampered by disconnect between actors, levels and sectors and the short-term funding structure. The suggested interventions highlight the tension between enabling collaborations, while safeguarding a high local diversity of initiatives and flexibility to ensure sustained space for innovation and learning.

AB  - In this study, a temporal analysis based on extended exergy is conducted for the urban system. The exchange and utilisation of resources, products and labour forces among seven sectors and the environment are quantified. Three new indicators are proposed to measure the resource utilisation efficiency, input/output structure and environmental impact of Beijing during 1996-2006. The following conclusions can be derived:
   the industrial structure has been updated as the one with more economic value added
   the external dependence degree of Ag-sector has significantly increased, suggesting a modernised agricultural production mode despite of the intensive production and negative externalities
   the exergy efficiencies of Ex-and Co-sectors are similar to those of Norway, Italy, UK and the province of Siena, and those of Te-sector kept increasing.
   The results also suggest that extended exergy analysis could be refined to become a tool for efficiency assessment, structural regulation and environmental management.

AB  - This article describes the development processes of Swedish agriculture toward non-sustainability. It asserts that the challenge of agricultural sustainability can be fruitfully addressed within an analytical framework that consciously and explicitly considers agricultural development as consisting of processes of coevolution involving agriculture and the surrounding ecological and socioeconomic systems. When this framework and certain derived indicators for agricultural sustainability are applied to Swedish agricultural development during the twentieth century, the following conclusions are reached. First, the new system of traditional agriculture that had emerged towards the end of nineteenth century in relation to various interactive forces within the socioeconomic system was associated with strengthening rural-urban interaction and interconnectedness. The system was substantially improved during the first quarter of the twentieth century, becoming capable of producing a sufficient supply of food within rural-urban sphere. Second, Swedish agriculture was transformed during the second and third quarters into a modem industrial system characterized by weakening local coevolutionary processes and by various agro-ecological problems. Resource flows uncoupled from the surrounding ecological and socioeconomic systems and food consumption uncoupled from local food production. Third, agricultural sustainability was generally high and improving during the first quarter of the twentieth century, deteriorating during the second and third quarters, and low but improving during the fourth. Finally, attaining sustainable agriculture will likely entail the strengthening of coevolutionary processes at the municipality level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The special issue titled 'Values-based Territorial Food Networks - Benefits, challenges and controversies' and this introductory editorial aim to bridge conceptual and disciplinary differences within the literature on alternative agro-food networks and related concepts. In the editorial we outline a new umbrella term, Values-based Territorial Food Networks (VTFNs), which synthesises the key commonalities that characterise alternatives to the mainstream food system. VTFNs are defined as networks that connect agro-food and related stakeholders within a defined territory that operate according to a coherent set of ethical values centred on social justice and wellbeing, environmental integrity, participatory governance and economic fairness. We discuss how VTFNs relate to earlier concepts, showing the evolution from 'alternative' to 'values based', from 'local' to 'territorial' and from 'supply chains' to 'networks'. The editorial also gives an overview of the empirical case studies in the special issue, which explore 10 place-based food initiatives (from Austria, France, Greece, Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Hungary, Australia, Brazil and Japan) and address benefits, challenges, social learning and controversies associated with VTFNs. The cases are grouped into three thematic areas. 'Social learning and resilience' focuses on collaboration through diverse partnerships as a necessary condition for social innovation and for understanding new socio-technical practices. 'Agency, negotiations and food governance' explores the socioeconomic struggles, interrelations and negotiated values associated with VTFNs. 'Sociocultural environments, social capital and reflexive localism' discusses the interplay between the economic and sociocultural dimensions related to VTFNs. The transversality of VTFN allows us to think about these dimensions from a systemic perspective, thus advancing debates on the diverse sites and modes of agro-food sustainability.

AB  - The EU is committed to increasing the use of renewable energy sources. In the sector of transportation, the share of renewable energy is to reach 10% by 2020 and 14% by 2030, respectively, in the EU. According to the latest forecasts, the production of the first-generation biofuels made from food raw materials is showing a declining tendency in the main European producing countries. Therefore, the objective of our research is to forecast the production of some selected biofuel producing countries within the EU as well as the traditional biofuel production in Hungary. The question of land use changes due to the new regulations is crucial. Our examinations were carried out by using Verhulst's logistic function based on the biofuel production data of EUROSTAT. The function has already reached the saturation level in Germany, France and Sweden but in the case of other examined countries, biofuel production is also in the phase of slowing growth. Furthermore, findings are also justified by the 2015 regulation that restricts the share of producing first-generation biofuels in the final energy consumption to 7% and promotes the production of advanced biofuels, thereby decreasing the indirect change in land use and increasing sustainable crop production.

AB  - We sampled macroinvertebrates in 51 rapids in regulated and unregulated north Swedish rivers. Our objective was to quantify the effects on the invertebrate fauna of altered flow patterns, habitat area and isolation.
   The remaining rapids in regulated north Swedish rivers have two types of flow regime: (a) Those with altered flow pattern, but unreduced flow, are characterized by low long-term variation and high day to day variation. Typically, the spring flood is strongly reduced, whereas winter flow is greatly increased in relation to the situation in unregulated streams. (b) Rapids from which a major part of the flow has been diverted usually show high seasonal and daily variation, although there are often long periods with constant flow within seasons.
   The effects of altered flow patterns were examined using the following method. Predictive models were built for biotic responses at unregulated sites. These models did not include variables affected by regulation, such as flow magnitude and variability. The models were then used to make predictions for affected sites. The differences between observed and predicted numbers were used as a measure of the effect of regulation.
   Sites with reduced flow had 0-30 species (mean = 6) less than predicted, corresponding to a loss of 0-38% of predicted richness. The total abundance was 0-54% (mean = 12%) less than predicted. Subdivision of the fauna into functional feeding groups showed that the abundances of collectors, grazers and predators, but not filter feeders and shredders,were negatively affected. For regulated sites,with no diversion of flow, significant losses were only recorded for the abundances of collectors and predators.
   A subsequent analysis of the relationship between the effects and the regulation-related variables, which had been left out in the first models, indicated that the occurrence of large and rapid changes of discharge was the most important factor.
   No effects on overall species richness of habitat size and isolation were found, suggesting that extinction and re-establishment of subpopulations are not prominent processes on the scale considered in this investigation.
   Our data suggest that avoiding large and rapid flow changes can increase both the abundance and the diversity of vertebrates. Increasing the how will decrease flow variability but will also expand the habitable area and thus the production of invertebrates. The best effect is expected at sites where a considerable proportion of the flow has been diverted.

AB  - We studied communities of carabid beetles in residual forest patches along urban-suburban-rural gradients in three cities (Helsinki, Finland; Sofia, Bulgaria and Edmonton, Canada) to examine their responses to urbanisation. Only Finnish carabids showed a marked division of community structure along the gradient. In Bulgaria and Canada, carabids did not separate into distinct urban, suburban and rural communities. Our results provide some support for the predictions that species richness will decrease, that opportunistic species will gain dominance, and that small-sized species will become more numerous under disturbance such as that provided by urbanisation. The rather weak and varied response of carabids to this disturbance suggests that local factors and their interaction are of primary importance for community composition. Occurrence of reasonably similar carabid communities across the gradient at each of the three levels of urbanisation suggests that habitat changes commonly associated with urbanisation have not affected the ecological integrity of carabid assemblages in residual urban forest patches.

AB  - Norway produces more than one million tonnes of salmonids every year, almost exclusively in open-water net pens. In 2014, the Norwegian government announced plans to increase salmonid production. However, increasing the number of farmed salmonids can have negative effects on the marine environment that threaten the industry's sustainability. In particular, production growth can lead to an increase in density-dependent diseases, including parasitic sea lice. The aim of this study was to simulate the effects of increased salmonid production on sea lice abundance using different scenarios for increasing the number of fish and for the management of sea lice. We used a previously developed, partly stage-structured model based on Norwegian production and environmental data to simulate the different scenarios. Our results show that increasing the marine farmed salmonid population at a national level by two or five times the current production leads to an increase in the sea lice abundance by 3.5% and 7.1%, respectively. We also found that by lowering the maximum allowable level of sea lice to an average of 0.049 adult females per fish, weekly treatments can be used to control sea lice population growth with a five times increase in production. However, this increases the number of farms treating per week by as much as 281.3%, which can lead to high costs and increased mortality among farmed salmonids. Overall, the results from our study shed light on the effects of increasing salmonid production in Norway with respect to the ongoing threat of sea lice infestations.

AB  - Renting agricultural land is a common practice in many countries. The possibility to rent land provides farmers with increased flexibility in terms of production volume. Land renting may have various effects on farmland management; however, results from studies analysing these are ambivalent. Farmland in the best possible state is a prerequisite for following up ambitions of feeding a growing population through a sustainable agriculture. Decisions regarding investments on farmland are key. The aim of this study is to increase the understanding of which factors are the most important ones for farmers' decisions about investments on land they rent. We carried out a questionnaire survey followed by a multiple linear regression considering 34 variables. Although variables included in our model come out as significant in explaining investments, a large part of the variation is left unexplained (R2 = 0.22). Our interpretation of this result is that making investments is a complex decision. Non-economic factors impacting on farmers' investment decisions such as trust or norms may contribute to the un-explained variation, but may only have been captured partly by our variables. Moreover, decisions regarding investments may not only vary among farmers but also among investments made by an individual farmer. The complex nature of the decisions on how to treat rented land makes it challenging for policymakers to develop measures targeted at farmers renting land. However, the finding that farmers are driving longer distances to rented land than they find acceptable deserves political attention. One potential policy implication may be strengthened incentives for land re-allotment. Re-allotment may address increasing distances and potential consequences such as reduced productivity and increased land abandonment. However, the sustainability of a re -allotment process needs to be considered carefully in terms of economic viability, ecological soundness and social responsibility.

AB  - Many organisms respond to anthropogenic environmental change through shifts in their phenology. In plants, flowering is largely driven by temperature, and therefore affected by climate change. However, on smaller scales climatic conditions are also influenced by other factors, including habitat structure. A group of plants with a particularly distinct phenology are the understory herbs in temperate European forests. In these forests, management alters tree species composition (often replacing deciduous with coniferous species) and homogenizes stand structure, and as a consequence changes light conditions and microclimate. Forest management should thus also affect the phenology of understory herbs. To test this, we recorded the flowering phenology of 16 early-flowering herbs on 100 forest plots varying in management intensity, from near-natural to intensely managed forests, in central and southern Germany. We found that in forest stands with a high management intensity, such as Norway spruce plantations, the plants flowered on average about 2 weeks later than in unmanaged forests. This was largely because management also affected microclimate (e.g., spring temperatures of 5.9 degrees C in managed coniferous, 6.7 in managed deciduous, and 7.0 degrees C in unmanaged deciduous plots), which in turn affected phenology, with plants flowering later on colder and moister forest stands (+4.5 d per -1 degrees C and 2.7 d per 10% humidity increase). Among forest characteristics, the percentage of conifers had the greatest influence on microclimate, but also the age, overall crown projection area, structural complexity and spatial distribution of the forest stands. Our study indicates that forest management alters plant phenology, with potential far-reaching consequences for the ecology and evolution of understorey communities. More generally, our study demonstrates that besides climate change other drivers of environmental change, too, can influence the phenology of organisms.

AB  - The Arctic region is experiencing transformation due to climate change, generating both threats and opportunities to local communities. In addition to warming, the signs of climate change are expected to materialise through an increase in the frequency and intensity of weather extremes. Climate-change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) have so far operated fairly independently, but there is an emerging need to examine their synergies due to their similarities. Tourism in the Arctic is also increasingly being encouraged by the different levels of government and seen as an important tool for economic development. The special features of Arctic tourism include a high dependency on natural resources, making it vulnerable to the effects of climate change. This article introduces a methodological framework merging elements from DRR, CCA and tourism development with a focus on community-based data-acquiring technique. Its practicality is emphasised through the focus on current and past community responses to weather anomalies and consequent adaptation measures. It additionally explores the relationship between the environment, community and tourism and aims to understand the characteristics of a community. Two case-study communities in Finnish Lapland demonstrate its relevance and contribution to CCA and to wider sustainable Arctic tourism development.

AB  - 1. Forest drainage, including mainly ditching of waterlogged peatlands in order to increase wood growth, has caused substantial changes in the hydrology and water quality of Finnish streams. However, knowledge on the ecological impact of these changes is poor. This paper studies the potential impact of forest drainage, catchment characteristics and habitat factors on the water quality and benthic macroinvertebrates in headwater streams of the River Isojoki, western Finland. An intensive programme of water sampling was carried out at nine study sites, while zoobenthic samples covered a total of 18 streams.
   2. According to multivariate regression models concentrations of aluminium and suspended solids in stream water at nine study sites increased significantly with increasing forest drainage of the catchment area. Further, drainage intensity contributed significantly to the decrease in minimum values of alkalinity.
   3. In a Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the variation in macroinvertebrate species distribution and abundance was largely explained by drainage intensity, moss coverage and the concentrations of aluminium and iron in stream water. A significant positive correlation was established between the species richness of benthic macroinvertebrates and the proportional cover of vegetation on the stream bed, whereas a significant negative correlation was found between species richness and sand cover.
   4. The results suggest that drainage has significantly contributed to the deterioration of water quality and habitat structure, and impoverishment of benthic communities in the headwater streams of the River Isojoki. In order to protect the ecological integrity of such boreal headwater streams, more effective protection schemes in forestry practices and rehabilitation of the adversely affected streams and their catchment areas are needed.

AB  - The Swedish housing stock is once again in focus for national energy savings, as it was after the oil crises in the 1970s and 1980s. The contemporary debate has a one-sided focus on energy savings and barriers for implementation of existing energy efficient renovation measures but also on large stock of industrialized housing built after 1960. The need for renovation is equally urgent in older stocks of housing, also in those that already have been renovated but are in need for further interventions. In this paper we focus on multi-residential housing built before 1945 in Gothenburg, Sweden, representing cultural and historical heritage values. The opportunities to ensure high energy efficiency with new measures in a second renovation should aim to find a balance with heritage values, social values, function, aesthetics and management aspects. In order to get an understanding of the conditions of the stock in focus, we apply both a top-down and bottom-up approach. In the top-down approach, data are gathered from different sources such as energy performance certificates, the national property register, and geodata from the City of Gothenburg. By combining information from these databases, three data subsets have been defined for the bottom-up approach: non-renovated buildings, buildings renovated to a small extent and buildings renovated to a large extent. Three case study buildings were selected out of these data subsets. The choice of renovation strategy differs between the cases. Case study building 1 has been left virtually untouched while case study building 2 and 3 have been renovated to different extent. The next step in this research project is to identify suitable renovation alternatives for these building typologies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Possible strategies to mitigate the climate impact of tourism transport include encouraging tourism to closer destinations and supporting more sustainable modes of transport, including trains. Today international trips by railways only have a small market share but night trains are considered an important part of a future green Europe. However, little is known about travelers' preferences for night trains for long-distance travel in Europe. The results of an integrated choice and latent variable model (ICLV) applied to stated preference (SP) data collected from 1691 residents of Sweden show that, depending on place of origin in Sweden, in response to a set of innovations, including reduced travel time emanating from ongoing infrastructure investments, and the introduction of new, more comfortable trains, the share of plane users willing to switch to night trains to Central Europe could reach 20-30% and to Southern Europe, 6-10%.

AB  - The exploitation of natural resources such as forests leads to sustainable forest management (SFM). The key question is how to define and parametrize "sustainable use." Promoting forest use that conserves spatial characteristics of forest landscapes and the structure and composition of forest stands was proposed as a way of maintaining elements of biodiversity such as species richness and genetic variation. However, to establish the parameter space for sustainable forest use, it is essential to consider the nutrient requirements of forest systems, that is, plants and animals, the need for fertilizer application, and the effects on biogeochemical cycles, a cornerstone of biological evolution and, thus, biodiversity. The use of forest products is inevitably tied to exporting biomass from those ecosystems because products are used elsewhere, thus changing natural practically steady-state ecosystems to open ones. Continued biomass export results in soil acidification and nutrient removal. Among macronutrients, phosphorus takes a key position, but several others have been shown to be depleted in managed-forest systems. Micronutrients are more crucial for forest-dwelling animals, particularly those nutrients that are only essential to animals. Depletion of their reserves, selenium for instance, through biomass export will not affect plants, and initial subclinical effects on animals are difficult to detect. The generalized effect may be reflected in changing rates of recruitment or disease resistance, and thus ecosystem processes. Forest products and their export reduces soil-nutrient reserves, and slash burning and water runoff further add to cumulative losses of several minerals. Such impacts from forest products need to be addressed, particularly for mammals and their unique needs for several microelements. Biogeochemical cycles disturbed by exporting forest products will affect plants and animals and, therefore, ecosystems and their processes, and these effects need to be incorporated in SFM designs.

AB  - While a range of international standards defining noise, vibration and other physical environmental measures have been established, common methodologies for measuring people's reactions to these same environmental effects are still in their infancy. This reduces the comparability of prevalence statistics and exposure-effect relationships developed by different researchers. The public authorities are served incompatible or seemingly conflicting information from different surveys when deciding on appropriate guidelines and limits. Drawing on experiences with the 1998 Norwegian Socio-vibrational Survey and a Swedish socio-acoustic survey supplemented with vibration measures, a new Nordtest Method: NT ACO U 106 Acoustics-Assessment of annoyance by vibrations in dwellings from road and rail traffic has been defined. The method describes sampling requirements, and proposes a mandatory verbal 5-point categorical annoyance scale and an optional 11-point numerical annoyance scale, both with lower anchoring point "Do not notice". A survey data output format is specified to allow researchers to pool data from different surveys. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We describe an analytical process to determine how much UAS traffic is feasible. The process is a simulator and data processing tools. The two are applied to the US San Francisco Bay Area and Norrkoping, Sweden. The amount of UAS traffic is measured in flights per day and simulated up to 200,000 flights. A UAS traffic volume is feasible if specified metrics meet operational requirements with high probability and are stable, in the sense of being below thresholds observed for monotone properties in random geometric graphs. We focus on conflict cluster size and argue for it as a fundamental safety metric worthy of extraordinary consideration.

TI  - Healthy people in healthy premises: the Finnish Indoor Air and Health Programme 2018-2028

LA  - English
AB  - Clean and fresh indoor air supports health and well-being. However, indoor air can contain pollutants that can cause a variety of symptoms and reduce well-being. Individual exposure agents can also increase the risk of certain diseases. Finns have taken major steps to improve the quality of indoor air for several decades. The primary focus of these activities has been the prevention and reduction of exposure to poor indoor air quality through guidance and regulation directing remediation of damaged buildings. Nevertheless, reported symptoms related to poor indoor air quality are common in Finland. In addition to exposure to indoor air pollutants, this may be partly due to the lively public discussion on the health risks caused by poor indoor air quality, conflicting views between experts, and mistrust towards public authorities, building owners and builders. Because of the scale of the indoor air problems in Finland, people's needs for reliable information and support, and the major costs involved, there is a call for new evidence-based methods, perspectives and solutions. Therefore, the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare initiated the Finnish Indoor Air and Health Programme 2018-2028 together with a number of collaborators and stakeholders. The primary, long-term objective of the programme is to reduce hazards to health and well-being linked to indoor environments in Finland. To fulfill this objective, the programme will focus on the promotion of human health and well-being, the prevention of hazards, improved communication and engage the whole health-care sector to manage better patients ' symptoms and complaints. The 10-year Finnish Indoor Air and Health Programme consists of four areas that aim (1) to increase understanding of the effects of indoor environments on health and well-being; (2) to develop the management of problems linked to indoor environments; (3) to improve the treatment and working and functional capacity of people with symptoms and illnesses; and (4) to strengthen the competence in matters related to indoor environments. The progress of the programme and reaching the predefined, quantitative goals will be monitored throughout the programme.

AB  - This paper explores how global issues such as climate change are taken into account in tourism strategy texts and contrasts these findings with how the issue is seen at the grassroots level by local businesses. We analyse how both levels approach adaptation to climate change. Using Boltanski and Thevenot's six common "worlds" of justification model for debates on public issues, we analyse the rhetoric of national, regional, and local tourism strategies in Finland and then explore how the rhetoric is employed by interviewing 42 local tourism actors. The strategy analysis shows that strategic documents do not simply describe situations but are active in creating and shaping future development, and how different kinds of "orders of worth" are used, to establish acceptable "universal truths" to shape through consensus how tourism actors think about the sector's future. Results show that at a strategic level, climate change issues are dealt with in an abstract manner, concentrating on the viewpoints of markets and industry, while ecological justification is lacking, and lacks urgency. Operational instructions are not provided for the entrepreneurs. The actors' interviews show that structural changes in the sector are demanded but both tourism growth and nature's survival are taken for granted.

AB  - Authenticity is considered a very important means to attract tourists. Different enterprises and destinations compete for visitors and authenticity is an important factor for visitors' travel decisions. Within the context of indigenous and cultural tourism, several studies have criticized the way in which indigenous and local populations are portrayed in order to attract tourists, since they often involve colonial images and descriptions that are no longer corresponding to the contemporary situation. This study presents an alternative perspective on the discussion on tourism marketing in relation to authenticity. Through critical discourse analysis and retroduction, this study has analysed the websites of Sami tourism companies from Sweden. The discussion put forward in this study is not a generalizing picture of how the Sami peoples choose to market themselves, but it problematizes how these particular enterprises relate to issues of authenticity in the representation of cultural heritage. This paper also presents a new approach to authenticity seen as a compromise. The results of this study present one side of a multifaceted discussion on the struggle between different discourses on representations and authenticity that are often the main channel to reach and attract potential visitors.

TI  - Anders Portin of FFIF: Wood origins under scrutiny
T2  - PAPERI JA PUU-PAPER AND TIMBER
LA  - Finnish
AB  - Doubts are raised from time to time over the legality of the imported wood raw material purchased by industry. For Anders Portin, Senior Vice President, Sustainable Development and Resources, at the Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) this is a matter of some concern as many years of hard work have gone into ensuring that wood is legally sourced. "The industry has shown a strong commitment to continuously developing transparent systems with the help of local bodies and through international dialogue to make any illegal-sourcing easier to identify", he claims (article on pages 426428).
   Finland's forest products companies have been developing procedures for tracing wood sources ever since wood imports started to grow in the 1990s. The aim was to ensure that wood was not sourced from either conservation areas or old-growth forests. The industry began collecting information not just on logging permits and wood origins but also on environmental and forest management practices as well. The work has continued and the systems have been made as watertight as humanly possible. This is naturally in the industry's own interests as well as affecting its image. Portin explains that companies sign agreements with their suppliers of imported wood requiring them to inform them of the wood's origins. The agreements also oblige suppliers to comply with the environmental demands placed on logging by the Finnish companies concerned.
   "The practice is quite clear. The supplier informs the buyer of the location of the logging site from every consignment of imported wood comes. The logging permit issued by the authorities guarantees the wood's legality. On top of that, the companies concerned visit the sites to check that the information received is correct and at the same time to inspect forest management practices. Information on each wood consignment: is stored in the buyer's database and mapping system, which also shows conservation areas."

AB  - Arsenic concentrations in soil and water were examined at the European level via a literature review and data inventory in the first phase of the AgriAs European Water JPI project. Arsenic in soil can be derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources. At the European scale, the distribution of arsenic in agricultural topsoil can mostly be explained by geology. In the next step, the AgriAs project investigated arsenic concentrations in soil and water in two regions: Saxony in Germany and Verdun in France. The results were compared with arsenic data from a geogenic arsenic region around the city of Tampere in Finland. In Saxony, arsenic is partly natural and partly derived from the widespread mining and ore processing activities in the area that have lasted for centuries. Areas contaminated with As were found to cover 970 km(2) in Saxony. The soil baseline for As is only 20-40 mg/kg but the highest concentrations in soil are up to 5000 mg/kg. The large number of investigations in Saxony has given a possibility to evaluate As transfer into plants, fodder and food and to develop guidelines for farmers. In Verdun, arsenic is derived from a former chemical ammunition destruction facility that operated in the interwar period. Today, there are hot spots of As in topsoil with concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 mg/kg, while the baseline concentration in soil is 18 mg/kg. In the Tampere region, baseline concentrations of As in glacial till forest soils are relatively high (30 mg/kg) over an area of 7400 km(2), with hot spots of 1050 mg/kg in topsoil. However, agricultural soils contain clearly lower As concentrations. In all three regions, As concentrations in surface waters and in groundwater were found to be relatively low, and the As concentration in topsoil could not be linked to irrigation with As-containing water. Fortunately, As transfer from soil into plants via root systems is generally low in aerated soil, but As-containing dust can affect fodder plants. Especially in the Freiberg area of Saxony, As is usually associated with Cd contamination in topsoil, and guidelines for farmers based on Cd concentrations are also a good risk management method for As.

AB  - Despite that hydromorphological restoration projects have been implemented since the 1940s, the key to improve the effectiveness of future restoration measures remains a challenge. This is in part related to the lack of adequate aims and objectives together with our limitations in understanding the effects on the physical habitat and ecosystems from interventions. This study shows the potential of using remote sensing techniques combined with hydraulic modelling to evaluate the success of physical restoration measures using habitat suitability as a quantifiable objective. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) was used to build a high-resolution two-dimensional model for Ljungan River, Sweden, using HEC-RAS 5.0. Two types of instream restoration measures were simulated according to the physical measures carried out in the river to improve salmonid habitat: (a) stones and rocks were moved from the bank sides to the main channel, and (b) a concrete wall was broken to open two channels to connect a side channel with the main river. Results showed that the hydraulic model could potentially be used to simulate the hydraulic conditions before and after instream modifications were implemented. A general improvement was found for the potential suitable habitat based on depth, velocity and shear stress values after the instream measures.

AB  - In this manuscript, the voices of women of size in North America and Finland indicate that there is a shared experience of being fat. Based on cross-cultural analysis of our respective empirical findings, we argue that there is a shared Western fat lived experience that perpetuates a stigmatized gendered landscape of living with a fat body. The emergent themes tended to revolve around two similar contradictions-the phenomenon of hyper(in)visibility and a belief their fatness is a temporary or liminal state-both of which lead to an internalization of fat hatred. We argue that these findings stem from the tremendous stigma and mistreatment that both samples of women face in their daily lives. The present study contributes to the literature by addressing two research lacunas: 1) the lack of cross-cultural research in fat studies; and 2) the limited mainstream feminist research from the perspective of fat women.

AB  - Many industrialised nations recently concentrated their focus on hydrogen as a viable option for the decarbonisation of fossil-intensive sectors, including maritime transportation. A sustainable alternative to the conventional production of hydrogen based on fossil hydrocarbons is water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. This paper presents a detailed techno-economic optimisation model for sizing an electrolyser and a hydrogen storage embedded in a multi-domain virtual power plant to produce green hydrogen for seaborne passenger transportation. We base our numerical analysis on three years of historical data from a renewable-dominated 60/10 kV substation on the Danish island of Bornholm, and on data for ferries to the mainland of Sweden. Our analysis shows that an electrolyser system serves as a valuable flexibility asset on the electrical demand side, while supporting the thermal management of the district heating system and contributing to meeting the ferries hydrogen demand. With a sized electrolyser of 9.63 MW and a hydrogen storage of 1.45 t, the hydrogen assets are able to take up a large share of the local excess electricity generation. The waste heat of the electrolyser delivers a significant share of 21.4% of the annual district heating demand. Moreover, the substation can supply 26% of the hydrogen demand of the ferries from local resources. We further examine the sensitivity of the asset sizing towards investment costs, electrolyser efficiency and hydrogen market prices.

AB  - This paper examines how authenticity and its use as a way of conceptualising the past participates in processes of heritage production, which are here defined as both the social construction of heritage sites and the uses of heritage sites as resources to achieve social goals. We argue that the social production of place and the social values generated by place are linked by a common approach based on the use of 'place attraction' as a unifying social concept. The World Heritage Site of Roros has as an attractive place become a resource for the production of cultural capital among various stakeholders, taking the form of a large body of 'heritage knowledges'. However, a symbolic capital production of 'attractive authenticity' has today generated an idealised past and a purified iconic image of Roros as World Heritage. The discourse of 'attractive authenticity' reveals a conflict of interests where symbolic capital unfolds and makes power relations evident. This exposes a discussion about cultural heritage management practices at World Heritage Sites.

AB  - Low availability of sustainable biomass prevents transition of district heating in Europe away from fossil fuels. The need for sustainable fuels stems from current energy generation structure, which mainly relies on centralised combined heat and power operated as baseload units. Our study shows that districts with generation of renewable power, heat and synthetic natural gas can reach complete energy system decarbonisation even without biomass, only using wind and solar power as primary energy. It requires rethinking of interactions between electricity, gas and heating networks and a polygeneration solution with power-to-heat and power-to-gas technologies to fully utilise local solar and wind power and cover peak demands. Power-to-heat as baseload units supported with power-to-gas for seasonal and back-up energy storage are proposed as novel district heating approach. The operation of such polygeneration is tested successfully using a model of a Finnish district. Carbon dioxide circulation is analysed together with capacity requirements to synthetic natural gas and needed wind power installation. Resulting complete decarbonisation requires coordination and flexible operation of power-to-heat and power-to-gas capacity together with gas-fired combined heat and power plants and heat-only boilers, which ensures that renewable power production, heating and power needs, security of supply and grid limitations are met.

AB  - Acari and Collembola are the dominant groups within the mycophagous arthropods linked to fungal-based food webs in undisturbed soils. Studies on soil microarthropod communities in old, traditional, multifunctional farmland, and studies on secondary succession following marginalization and abandonment of traditional farmland are lacking in Europe. Thus, we studied patterns of microarthropod communities related to different land use regimes in a traditional farm in Western Norway. Soil mesofauna communities were analysed at four sites: site OM - old, herb rich, open hay meadow in traditional use; site F1 - abandoned hay meadow with pollarded trees (first fallow); site F2 - deciduous woodland (abandoned hay meadow with old pollards, heavily overgrown, second fallow); and site RM - restored hay meadow with scattered, newly pollarded trees. The abundance of the taxa varied considerably between habitats (for instance: total microarthropods - from 112.4 +/- 11.4 to 29.2 +/- 3.4, Acari - from 83.9 +/- 10.2 to 15.6 +/- 1.8 and Oribatida - from 68.6 +/- 9.5 to 8.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(3) m(-2), for OM and RM sites respectively).
   The abundance of total Acari, total Oribatida, Oribatida adults and juveniles differed significantly between OM-F1, OM-RM, OM-F2 and RM-F2 sites and it was significantly correlated with continuity of land use and/or tree cover. Oribatida was the group with the highest densities and percentage dominance (except RM site). The percent contribution of total Oribatida in Acari abundance was negatively correlated with the percentage of Actinedida. Nine Ptyctimina species, six Nothroidea species and four Uropodina species were detected, but most of them occurred as single individuals. Abundance of three Ptyctimina [Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus (C.L. Koch), Phthiracarus ferrugineus (C.L. Koch), P globosus (C.L. Koch)], and two Uropodina [Trachytes pauperior Berlese and Dinychus perforatus Kramer] species differed significantly between some sites. The percentage similarity (Renkonen index) has a high indicative value for measuring the distance between ecosystems with apparently similar communities of Uropodina.
   The OM and RM sites differed most and site pairs - F1-F2 and F1-RM were the most similar. The densities of some taxa were about two-or three-fold greater for the F1site than the RM site. Ratios of Acari to Collembola, total Oribatida to Collembola and total Oribatida to Actinedida were highest on OM site (3.2, 2.6, 11.8 respectively) and decreased in the following order: F2>F1>RM (as an example, total Oribatida to Actinedida ratios were 9.8 on F2 site, 6.2 on F1 and 3.1. on RM). These ratios differed significantly between the OM and RM sites. The lowest ratios on RM site are probably an effect of recent disturbance (change of land use) of this site. Our results suggest that soil in OM site, despite constant disturbance during long time (scything, hay raking and sheep grazing), has probably a stable mesofauna community with the highest abundance of Oribatida. Our results have provided new knowledge about ecosystems in traditional farmland and can be used in monitoring programmes of post-arable land.

AB  - Over the last decade, the mislabelling of seafood products has come to prominence in the fields of food science and marine conservation. This study aims to determine whether differences in fish labelling accuracy can be explained by factors associated with governance, legislation and product availability, using cod (Gadus spp.) as a case study. A total of 401 cod products from a range of different supermarket retailers in each of nine countries bordering the North Atlantic Ocean were purchased and genetically identified. The countries sampled were grouped into primarily cod-importing or cod-producing states, and belonging/not-belonging to the European Union. They comprised the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Canada. Estonia showed the highest incidence of mislabelling, with 59.4% samples mislabelled, followed by Denmark with 18.6%, Canada with 7.3%, Sweden with 4.4% and finally the United Kingdom with 2.4%. Substitute species included species within the Gadidae and Merlucciidae, such as haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Alaskan pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) and Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi), respectively, but also included species more distantly-related to cod, such as snailfish (Liparis spp.), spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), the latter a freshwater species. The remaining countries showed no mislabelling. Neither EU affiliation, production nor the type of product, i.e. fresh or processed, had a significant effect on mislabelling. It is suggested that other factors, such as country-specific differences at social, cultural or legal levels, may be the greater drivers of mislabelling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conflicting perspectives on forests has for a long time challenged forest policy development in Sweden. Disagreements about forest futures create intractable deadlocks when stakeholders talk past each other. The purpose of this study is to move beyond this situation through the application of participatory backcasting. By comparing visions of the future forest among stakeholder groups, we highlight contemporary trajectories and identify changes that were conceived as desirable. We worked with four groups: the Biomass and Bioenergy group, the Conservation group, the Sami Livelihood group and the Recreation and Rural Development group; in total representatives from 40 organizations participated in workshops articulating the groups' visions. Our results show well-known tensions such as intrinsic versus instrumental values but also new ones concerning forests' social values. Identified synergies include prioritization of rural development, new valued-added forest products and diversified forest management. The results may feed directly into forest policy processes facilitating the process and break current deadlocks.

AB  - Primary metal production operates with large tonnages and takes advantage of economies of scale. Metal recycled from low-value waste streams, competing in the same global metal market as primary production, will be more competitive by also taking advantage of up-scaling. However, an overview of metal tonnages in low-value waste streams to see upscaling potential needs to be provided in the literature. In response, this study provides estimates of copper, zinc, and lead metal tonnages in waste incineration ash-A major waste stream going to landfills. Metal concentrations and tonnages are compared to tonnages and concentration grades found in ores. Copper, zinc, and lead concentration averages are about 3-5 times lower in ash compared to the worldwide average head grade of ores. Tonnages of metal in the ash generated from waste incineration in European countries bordering the Baltic and the North Sea are about 1/3 of mining metal output from Sweden, a leading mining country in the region. Therefore, incineration ash should be considered a significant potential Cu, Zn, and Pb metal source.

AB  - This paper contributes to the recent literature on sustainability in the Arctic as a political concept. Parliamentary proceedings have increasingly been recognized as an important source of information for eliciting political issues. In this paper, we use unsupervised text mining techniques to analyze parliamentary speeches for Norway from the period from 2009 to 2016 to answer whether political coalitions talk differently about sustainability in the Arctic depending on being in opposition or government. We find that the difference between being in government and opposition, controlling for political label (left-right), is far more important than the difference between left and right, controlling for role (opposition-government). The results suggest that in the trade-off between political preferences and election success, the balance is tilted in favour of the latter. Our interpretation is that opportunistic behavior seems to dominate partisan behavior in the politics related to sustainability in the Arctic.

AB  - To fulfil the global sustainable development goals (SDGs), achieving sustainable development is becoming urgent, not least in the transportation sector. In response to this, the sustainability framework Sustainability National Road Administrations (SUNRA) was developed to contribute to improving the sustainability performance of national road administrations across Europe. In the present study, the framework has been tested, applied and further developed to be applicable for target setting and follow-up at the project level at both the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) and at municipal levels. The aim was a framework relevant for investment, re-investments, maintenance and operation projects and also to make it more user applicable. The study also investigated how the framework can contribute to sustainability, identified drivers and barriers for applying the framework and examined whether the framework can be applied and adapted to projects of different complexities. The adaptations and developments were done in collaboration between researchers and practitioners. The results show that the framework could easily be used and adapted for investment, re-investment, maintenance and operation projects in the planning stage, as well as for small municipal establishments, construction or reconstruction of residential areas and frequent maintenance. The framework contributes to increased awareness on sustainability, and it provides a common structure and transparency on how infrastructure project goals/targets are set and fulfilled. The framework can also be applied to follow the fulfilment of the goals/targets and thereby adapt the project to better fulfil the goals. Identified barriers include the lack of obligations and lack of experience in using sustainability frameworks.

AB  - In this paper, I approach urban decarbonization policy as an assembling process. Based on interview material in the municipality of Umea, Sweden, the article highlights three important aspects of how planners, strategists and project managers produce decarbonization policies, initiatives or experimental projects. The first shows how an important part of the policymaking is to contend with and bring together heterogeneous elements (e.g. low-carbon mobility initiatives, private companies, municipal transport system) to work for one goal (e.g. some families experimenting with car-free life). The second shows how cultivating relations within and outside the municipality offices allows project managers to form trusted networks that are instrumental towards more efficient policymaking and implementation. The last shows how planners unmake and remake target groups to produce coherent and effective policies. While each of these aspects, respectively, highlight typical tropes of assemblage thinking (i.e. heterogeneity, relationality and coherence) together they share a concern with the labour and work required by policy as an assembling process. Making policy on cross-sectional issues such as decarbonization, reveals labour as a relevant category to attend to the necessary tension between mission-oriented design and an openness and ability to capitalize on more serendipitous moments and opportunities.

AB  - 1. Established butterfly survey methods that are useful for monitoring species that are widely distributed and numerous may be less accurate for more rare species. We therefore need new monitoring approaches.2. We describe a plot-based survey method, where butterflies or larvae nests are counted within 1-ha grid cells. The aim was to compare this grid method with more traditional transect counts and evaluate both methods in relation to high-quality capture-mark-release (CMR) population estimates (reflecting the 'true' population). We do this using data from a large population of the marsh fritillary butterfly in Sweden. Moreover, we followed the overall population trend from 2017 to 2021 for both adult butterflies and larvae.3. Results showed a higher detection probability using the grid method compared with transect counts, which for adult butterflies seem to be explained by time effort. Moreover, grid surveys of adult butterflies showed a clear significant relationship with the estimated 'true' population size from CMR, while transect counts did not. For larvae, both methods showed significant relationships with the estimated adult population size, but the grid method found 5.7 times more larvae. The overall popu-lation fluctuated significantly across years. In years with low densities, the transect method largely failed to detect the species.4. The grid method seems more reliable for detecting the marsh fritillary and for estimating its population size, and thus, tracking the population trend. We propose this novel method to be integrated into surveys and monitoring of biodiversity, especially when focusing on rare habitat specialists that are normally underrepre-sented in monitoring based on volunteer counts.

AB  - The lack of recovery in Norwegian populations of the kelp Saccharina latissima (Linnaeus) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes, Druehl & G. W. Saunders after a large-scale disturbance that occurred sometime between the late 1990s and early 2000s has raised considerable concerns. Kelp forests are areas of high production that serve as habitats for numerous species, and their continued absence may represent the loss of an entire ecosystem. Some S. latissima populations remain as scattered patches within the affected areas, but today, most of the areas are completely devoid of kelp. The question is if natural recolonization by kelp and the reestablishment of the associated ecosystem is possible. Previous studies indicate that a high degree of reproductive synchrony in macrophytes has a positive effect on their potential for dispersal and on the connectivity between populations, but little is known about the patterns of recruitment in Norwegian S. latissima. More is, however, known about the development of fertile tissue (sori) on adult individuals, which is easily observed. The present study investigated the degree of coupling between the appearance of sori and the recruitment on clean artificial substrate beneath adult specimens. The pattern of recruitment was linked to the retreat of visible sori (i. e. spore release) and a seasonal component unrelated to the fertility of the adults. The formation and the retreat of visible sori are processes that seem synchronized along the south coast of Norway, and the link between sori development and recruitment may therefore suggest that the potential for S. latissima dispersal is relatively large. These results support the notion that the production and dispersal of viable spores is unlikely to be the bottleneck preventing recolonization in the south of Norway, but studies over larger temporal and spatial scales are still needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - The concept of co-creation has been extensively discussed in tourism and hospitality research. Most studies focus mainly on exploring the involvement of customers in experience creation and the development of tourism services and innovations. Although this way of thinking can be valuable for creating competitive tourism services, it neglects other aspects of co-creation that may play an important role in tourism. Considering this gap, we work towards a more comprehensive understanding of value co-creation processes in small tourism firms by drawing upon cultural marketing and organisational improvisation. To illustrate this process, we present two company cases from northern Sweden, Treehotel and Icehotel. The empirical material used in this study consists of qualitative data collected via semi-structured interviews, participant and non-participant observation, and documentary materials. The study contributes to the co-creation discussion in tourism and hospitality by unpacking the role of human and non-human stakeholders, material resources, and unexpected events in the value co-creation processes within a small tourism firm context.

AB  - Inclusive education and the associated consideration of the diverse needs of students from different social, economic, and cultural backgrounds and different talents and disabilities are a worldwide challenge. This article shows how by addressing different user groups, state-funded platforms for open educational resources (OER) can contribute to the implementation of inclusive education. This is done using the example of the Norwegian platform NDLA, which has been providing open educational resources for upper secondary education in Norway since 2006. This paper is based on 13 expert interviews conducted with NDLA staff, cooperation partners, and members of the opposing schoolbook publishers union in 2017. The presented results focus on the diversity of learners, teachers, and platform staff and how this diversity is addressed. The presented results focus on the diversity of learners, teachers, and platform staff and how this diversity is addressed to ensure the best possible outcomes in learning and teaching. Finally, country-specific aspects that can be addressed by an OER platform are highlighted. In summary, the transferability of the Norwegian experience to other countries is discussed.

AB  - Political party member perceptions of risk continue to attract a great deal of attention in current public discourse and media coverage, yet little research exists in terms of a comparative analysis of Finnish political parties' views on the issue. Party members are in many ways a highly significant social group, one that exercises a great deal of decision-making power in modern civil societies. This article provides a novel and up-to-date look into the key areas of perceived risk held by the members of Finland's political parties, in addition to a comparison of inter-party differences and similarities. The analysis is based on a unique survey data-set of the members of Finland's six major political parties (N = 12,427). Included are the Finns Party, Centre Party, Left Alliance, Social Democratic Party, Green League and National Coalition Party. Together, these represent the political spectrum in Finland. Risk factors included primary categories dealing with various national, institutional, cultural and economic issues. Also included in the analysis was a look into whether length of party membership affects risk concern for the included issues. Findings showed that national and external risks were more of a concern for the Finns Party, while the Left and the Social Democrats considered economic issues a greater risk than did others. Furthermore, economic risk was most concerning to the left while external risks were generally viewed in line with the current centre-right administration. Some notable differences between old and new party members were also found. Findings emphasize the importance of understanding how political party members differ in their views of various societal risks while providing new points of comparison between those parties toward improved clarity of the national political landscape.

KW  - BROWN ALGA
AB  - The brown alga Sargassum muticum has been found attached in Sweden since 1987. This paper reports the distribution in Swedish waters based on 2 major surveys in 1993 and in 1996. Attached population were found along the entire eastern Skagerrak coast, and as far south as to the middle part of the eastern Kattegat coastline. The number of populations and population size decrease when going south, although the differences had dimished between 1993 and 1996. However, the number of new sites, as well as population numbers still increase. Areas with continuous populations can now be found along the NE Skagerrak coast, and isolated localities may also be found in the inner parts of the archipelagoes. No morphological differences were seen between plants from the more saline Skagerrak and the more brackish Kattegat. The maximum plant length recorded was 4.2 In. Sargassum muticum has definitely become a permanent member of the Swedish algal flora. Although the expansion into the Baltic is slow, it is most likely that, given time, the species will colonize suitable habitats in the entire Kattegat. The possibility of further expansion into the Baltic proper, with its low biodiversity, remains a subject for speculation.

AB  - Y Carbon-14 (C-14) dominates the collective effective dose from globally dispersed long-lived radionuclides produced by and released from the nuclear power industry. Literature data on the discharge of C-14 to the marine environment from nuclear power plants (NPPs) and its dispersion in the marine ecosystem are sparse. The local marine C-14 background must be determined before the C-14 enrichment in the marine environment from a NPP can be estimated. This is not trivial since marine activity concentrations of C-14 vary spatially, partly due to longrange transport of C-14 from other anthropogenic sources. We have analysed C-14 in samples of several species of brown algae (Fucus spp.) collected at 45 sites along the Swedish coast in 2020. At sites remote from NPPs, the C-14 activity concentrations per unit mass of carbon (here expressed as Fraction Modern, (FC)-C-14) were significantly higher on the west coast than on the east coast ((FC)-C-14 up to about 1.10 in Skagerrak, and about 1.01, close to atmospheric levels, in the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia). On the west coast, (FC)-C-14 showed a strong correlation with salinity, both of which increased towards the north. This indicates that C-14 is carried from other anthropogenic sources (e.g. from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plants at La Hague and Sellafield). The highest value of (FC)-C-14 observed was close to the Ringhals NPP on the west coast, (FC)-C-14 approximate to 1.3, which is higher than expected in the terrestrial environment of this NPP. We also report on temporal variations of (FC)-C-14 in Fucus spp. collected at Sardal on the Swedish west coast during the period 1967-2020. The values of (FC)-C-14 in the Sardal marine samples collected after the 1990s are clearly higher than (FC)-C-14 in clean air CO2, indicating contributions of C-14 of anthropogenic origin.

AB  - Policy objectives aimed toward zero-energy buildings call for the utilization of building-integrated renewable energy and distributed energy resources (DER). To enhance the utilization of DER, previous literature proposed the concept of an integrated community energy system (ICES). This research suggested using superblocks (units of multiple urban blocks) to define geographical limits, social contexts, and possibly common administrations for ICESs along with other living- and sustainability-related activities in an urban context. Through interviews with key stakeholders and an analysis, this research investigates the applicability of the superblock-ICES as a way of reaching the low-carbon objectives in the Hiedanranta brownfield development project in the city of Tampere, Finland. This research confirms that the driving forces of community-based solutions are economic benefits, technical development, and objectives of sustainability, and reveals or confirms that social acceptability, missing planning practices, economic risk, and missing or hindering legislation are the main issues or barriers of superblock-ICESs. For a wider adoption of superblock-ICESs, this research suggests cross-disciplinary piloting, together with developing planning practices and simulation tools. In Finland, legislative reforms are needed to remove the barriers and clarify issues related to security, reliability, customer protection, and public interest in governing a locally and collectively owned energy system.

AB  - Based on the study of nineteenth-century travel accounts, the paper examines the place of Finland within the Russian Empire in a postcolonial perspective. After several wars against Sweden, Finland was annexed by Tsar Alexander I in 1809 and remained part of the Empire until 1917. Despite its proximity to St. Petersburg, the country remained virtually unknown to Russians at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and travellers' first impressions durably influenced the place Finland would be given on the imperial imagined geographies. As a borderland, Finland was described within a typical (post)colonial narrative: considered as uncivilised and wild, its supposedly ahistorical character supported imperialistic claims and justified its annexation by a greater power. Travellers themselves actively participated to the cultural appropriation of Finland by providing itineraries and creating remarkable sites that upheld these imperial tropes. However, there was some ambivalence in Russians' feelings regarding the country. The Vyborg governorate, also known as "Old Finland", was seen as a natural extension of Russia, similar in religion and customs to St. Petersburg's backcountry. On the other side, the western and southern coasts felt more foreign and closer to Western Europe. Yet, as an imperial possession, Finland was generally not depicted in strong antagonistic tones but, on the contrary, as an idyllic space and a refuge from the increasing difficulties of Russian elites to combine the imperial and national projects.

AB  - In Norway, recovering populations of large carnivores commonly prey on roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Understanding predator habitat use and ecology requires fine-scaled information on prey distribution and abundance. However, the massive spatial scales at which large carnivores use the landscape presents many practical and statistical challenges for developing functional prey distribution models. Pellet-count data from > 1000 km of transects gathered across southeastern Norway between 2005 and 2011 were used to derive a map of the relative prey abundance for roe deer. These data were modeled using zero-inflated hurdle models using both environmental and anthropogenic variables. Snow depth and agricultural fields were the most significant variables in explaining both presence and abundance. Internal k-cross validation of the model showed medium accuracy (Spearman's r = 0.35), whereas external evaluation carried out on the basis of independently collected snow-tracking data (Spearman's r = 0.37) and hunting statistics (Spearman's r = 0.88) showed higher accuracy. The map generated can facilitate both the study of broad scale processes linking predators and prey as well as roe deer management in southeastern Norway.

AB  - The term extinction threshold refers to a critical value of some attribute, such as the amount of habitat in the landscape, below which a population, a metapopulation, or a species does not persist. In this paper we discuss the existence and behavior of extinction thresholds in the context of metapopulation models. We review and extend recent developments in the theory and application of patch occupancy models, which have been developed for assessing the dynamics of species inhabiting highly fragmented landscapes. We discuss the relationship between deterministic and stochastic models, the possibility of alternative equilibria, transient dynamics following perturbations from the equilibrium state, and the effect of spatially correlated and temporally varying environmental conditions. We illustrate the theory with an empirical example based on the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulation in the Aland Islands in southwest Finland.

AB  - As economic and ecological crises evolve in combination, some policy strategies might aim at killing the two birds with one stone. One recent example can be found in Malmo, Sweden, where crisis management has operated, we propose, as a green fix. The district of Vastra hamnen (Western Harbour) is at the centre of the reinvention of the city: once the home of a world-leading shipyard, it is now a no less prominent neighbourhood of ecological virtues. Through outlining the history of Malmo in general and the Western Harbour in particular, we identify how the municipality and local capital in concert increasingly used "green" strategies in the urban policies that started as crisis management in the 1990s. Today Malmo is reckoned to be among the world's greenest cities, and we reflect on the importance of this international recognition for the city. Finally, we develop a critique of the green fix as concealing crucial factors of scale, and hence running the risk of myopia.

AB  - This article examines how rhythmanalysis can expand understanding of the spatiotemporal features of the host-visitor interface, examining the Telemark Canal region in Norway and its rural development and heritagization processes. Part of the heritagization of the Telemark Canal is to utilize the potential of the canal as a tourist attraction in order to generate economic, social and cultural value in the broadest sense within nearby local communities. By investigating the rhythms and polyrhythms of hosts and visitors of the canal, and revealing a significant arrhythmia, we demonstrate that there is an unfulfilled potential in how travellers along the Telemark Canal contribute socially, culturally and economically to local development. The key to local economic as well as social and cultural development from tourism is in enhancing the connections between visitors and the canal's host communities. We argue that intervening through rhythms at the interface between hosts and visitors might be the key to utilizing more of the potential of value creation from canal tourism.

AB  - Addressing unsustainable consumption patterns is an important target for fulfilling the goals set in, among others, Agenda 21 and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (1993). Gender differences in consumption patterns and their environmental impact have so far been poorly investigated. Gender differences in traveling patterns in Sweden are explored using data fi om the National Travel Survey. Such differences are shown to be large, both in terms of distances traveled, modes of transport, and energy consumption and in terms of emissions of CO2. The average CO2 emissions from mens' mode of transportation was 53% higher during 1996 compared to the CO2 emissions from womens' mode of transportation during the same year. This is due to the fact that men travel farther, but also because men travel with more energy-demanding vehicles than women. it is argued that those differences cannot be explained by differences in employment rate, but possibly by differences in sectors of employment, holder of a driving license, income, and car ownership. Gender differences in social and cultural aspects affecting environmental impacts from consumption patterns and lifestyles should not be ignored in further work for a sustainable society.

AB  - Collaborative river basin governance has been advocated both by research and legislation, while at the same time certain silvicultural practices are shown to lead to deteriorating water quality. In order for collaboration to be initiated, however, the majority of key stakeholders must be willing to participate. This paper investigates which factors at the local level are crucial for initiating collaboration over forest waters among individual private forest owners. For that purpose, a survey was sent out to all individual forest owners within a catchment area in northern Sweden. The survey was complemented by a qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. The existence of several key preconditions for the initiation of collaboration was investigated, namely: low belief and cultural heterogeneity, information diffusion, perception of the problem, existing stores of social capital, interdependence, and leadership. The results show that although the context was one of low belief and cultural heterogeneity, individual private forest owners are not interested in collaborating for improved forest water unless they perceive the issue of water quality important enough to invest resources in collaboration. It also became clear that the diffusion of information about the problem is not reaching those stakeholders who are crucial for the commencement of collaboration. Moreover, those stakeholders do not recognise their interdependence on each other for resolving the issue and therefore the need for collaboration. Finally, initiating leadership was also found to be lacking, leading to the conclusion that to successfully implement policies requiring collaborative management of natural resources among highly empowered individual forest owners, those missing factors need to be addressed by the state.

AB  - Europe's woodland and savanna rangelands, often part of silvopastoral systems known as wood-pastures, are deteriorating because of abandonment that leads to return to a forested state or lack of tree regeneration from overgrazing or tree and shrub removal. Despite numerous local studies, there has been no broader survey of the stand structure of European wood-pastures showing which systems are at risk of losing their semiopen character. This overview aims to 1) show some of the differences and similarities in wood-pastures from landscapes across Europe and 2) identify which of these wood-pastures are at risk of losing their semiopen character. We collated a dataset of 13 693 trees from 390 plots in wood-pastures from eight different European regions (western Estonia, eastern Greece, northern Germany, Hungary, northern Italy, southern Portugal, central Romania, and southern Sweden), including tree diameters at breast height, tree density, management type, and tree species composition. On the basis of their structural characteristics, we classified wood-pastures using principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis. The PCA showed a gradient from dense wood-pastures with high levels of regeneration (e.g., in Estonia) to sparse wood-pastures with large trees but a lack of regeneration (e.g., in Romania). Along this gradient, we identified three main groups of wood-pastures: 1) sparse wood-pastures with mostly big trees; 2) dense wood-pastures composed of small trees, and 3) wood-pastures containing a wide range of tree ages. Our results show a large structural gradient in European wood-pastures, as well as regeneration problems varying in their severity, highlighting the importance of social-ecological context for wood-pasture conditions. To maintain the ecological and cultural integrity of European wood-pastures, we suggest 1) more comprehensively considering them in European policies such as the Common Agricultural Policy and EU Habitats Directive, while 2) taking into account their structural characteristics and social-ecological backgrounds.

AB  - A growing body of literature has examined the dynamics of wind energy development across different mature and emerging institutional contexts. However, so far only few have paused to reflect on the differences between developed and emerging economies. Building upon the literature on institutional entrepreneurship, this paper compares institutional strategies in wind energy development in Finland and India by using the typology of political, technical and cultural work. We highlight the role of institutional approaches in studying sustainable energy transitions in mature and emerging institutional contexts, while being sensitive to the role of heterogeneous actors in shaping institutional arrangements. Our findings offer implications for debates in the institutional entrepreneurship literature by exploring how actors shape their institutional environment in different contexts, and the extent to which emerging institutional contexts provide more opportunities for institutional entrepreneurship. Finally, this paper underscores the need for developing insights into enabling conditions for successful collective institutional entrepreneurship and for developing typologies of institutional strategies which are generalizable across both mature and emerging institutional contexts.

AB  - Through analysis of the orientations, conflicts and challenges of recent energy-climate policy in Stockholm, this paper interrogates how energy and climate become (translated as) a set of issues which come to matter in the local urban arena for different social and political interests. Drawing in particular on recent theoretical work on urban materiality, it is argued that ongoing, 'everyday' local struggles over the processes and practices of transformation of the urban fabric constitute repoliticised settings through and in which the orientations of urban energy transition are materially understood, experienced and performed in diverging ways. In 'mapping' the undulating politics of energy-climate matters, the paper outlines an alternative way of following and/or measuring energy and carbon flows through the urban environment.

AB  - The article formulates the problems of research, promotion, preservation, and use of the dacha architecture of the Gulf of Finland within the boundaries of the Karelian isthmus. The features of the architectural and artistic identity of the cultural landscape of the Karelian isthmus, called "Russian Finland" in the Art-Nouveau era, are defined. They have been formed largely due to the summer housing and cultural domestic traditions as the result of fruitful cultural ties between Russia, especially St. Petersburg, and Finland at the turn of the XIX-XX centuries. The author emphasizes the urgent need to develop the special St. Petersburg program of conservation and use of dacha architecture, the rapid disappearance of the last best examples of which will lead to the disappearance of the unique layer of material culture of St. Petersburg. Positive experience of the country architecture preservation in Finland is stated.

AB  - This article summarises the results from four studies on the potential of bioenergy, and one study on the economic feasibility of distributed renewable energy production, in Ostrobothnia, Finland. The scope of the studies was to explore the degree of energy self-sufficiency that could be achieved, and the economic implications and benefits.
   The results suggest that a great majority of rural areas have the potential for being self-sufficient in their energy production through bioenergy alone, but other renewable energy sources (RES), including for example wind and solar power, will make an even greater contribution in the future. This applies to areas especially outside the largest population centres and most energy intensive industries. Indeed, in peripheral regions the renewable energy potential far exceeds the energy demand, and the spatial coverage of energy self-sufficiency is huge. Other European and global studies also show tremendous RES potential.
   The economics of small scale power generation units, here represented by biogas plants, are already feasible, despite the technology still being at an early developmental phase. Diffusion of these technologies depends on a number of factors, but single and separate units are emerging all the time. The adoption of RES based energy management systems will however be a long social process.
   The results give rise to an expectation for more RES based energy generation in Ostrobothnia and Finland and even in Europe and globally. In a time frame of 20-30 years, this development may result in structural changes across the whole energy sector. This comprehensive movement can only be understood and supported by multi- and cross-scientific approaches, and it will in future be a challenge for forthcoming research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Calibrated Route Finder (CRF), an online route generation system, successfully finds the best route when many conflicting objectives are involved by using analytics in a collaborative environment. CRF, which has been in use since 2009, uses many diverse big data sources, which must be revised continuously. One of its key features is its use of an innovative inverse optimization process that establishes more than 100 weights to balance distance, speed, social values, environmental impacts, traffic safety, driver stress, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and costs. The system enables the measurement of hilliness and curvature and incorporates rules that consider legal and practical issues related to routing in and around cities, turning in intersections, time delays, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions that result from waiting, acceleration, and braking. The system is used by all major forest companies in Sweden and in 60 percent of the two million annual transports in this sector. It has resulted in a paradigm shift from manual, imprecise, and unilaterally determined routes to automatically determined routes, which the stakeholders determine jointly. It has also enabled standardization, promoted collaboration, and reduced costs, thus strengthening the competitiveness of the Swedish forest industry in the international market.

AB  - The awareness of sediment and nutrient loss from non-point sources are of increasing environmental concern as measures to reduce point source inputs to surface waters have been introduced. Mitigation efforts to reduce loss of particles and nutrients from agriculture in Norway and other countries have mainly focused on surface runoff, whereas sub-surface drainage has received little attention. However, research has shown that the sub-surface field drains are transporting both sediment and nutrients rapidly to the watercourses. Despite these established facts there has been little development of measures to reduce these losses. This article describes how Lightweight Aggregates (LWA), Leca (R), can mitigate some of the environmental challenges connected to sub-surface field drains.
   A field experimental project was performed to assess the effects on drainage water quality hydrological performance and functionality of drainage systems based on Lightweight Aggregates compared to traditional pipe drains. Registrations of the performance of the systems were done in two separate periods, 1992-1993 and 1999-2000. After 2000 no measurement programme has run. The functionality of the drainage systems was registered in connection to ordinary farming activity.
   In 1999-2000 LWA drains showed particularly good performance with regard to reducing the content of Phosphorus, 40-90 % reduction in Total-P. The drainage water from the LWA drains contained less than half the amount of suspended solids compared to traditional pipe drains. The results from 1993 showed no significant difference between LWA drains and pipe drains with respect to Nitrogen. The results from 1999/2000 showed higher loss of Nitrogen through pipe drains with no envelope compared to all other systems.
   LWA drains may be particularly useful in reducing particles and nutrient loads from cultivated flat drained areas adjacent to environmentally sensitive and ecologically important water ecosystems. Further investigations are recommended to optimise the design of LWA drains.

AB  - Pre-treated wastewater, sewage sludge and methanogenic landfill leachate were applied to short rotation energy forestry, i.e. Salix (willow) plantations. The nutrient content in wastewater was well balanced with the nutrient uptake in Salix stems. With sludge and leachate used as the main fertilizer resource, potassium and phosphorus fertilizers, respectively, must be added for sustainable biomass production. In most cases the growth was increased after application of the waste products. Production rates at same or higher levels as conventionally-fertilized willow plantations were recorded. Water is pointed out as the single most important growth factor. Waste management according to presented concepts could offer good treatment performance without adverse effects on soil, groundwater or vegetation. During the course of the held tests full-scale applications have been established. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As climate change becomes an increasing concern in European countries, the bioeconomy could challenge previous conceptualizations about how states, citizens and corporations interact in everyday practices of natural resources governance. The conceptual understanding of responsive governance of the forest-based bioeconomy is an example of this challenge and is the topic of discussion in this paper. In Finland, there are efforts to support the transition towards the bio-based economy and to reform forest governance in an attempt to respond to local circumstances while mitigating global climate change. The recent articles have address the bioeconomy concept from political discourse point of view, the citizens participation has not yet been address sufficient in the current bioeconomy discourses. In order to fill this gap, this paper provides an empirical case from Finland and connects it to the theoretical contribution of responsive bioeconomy. The paper connects the capability approach and the forest based bioeconomy in the context of Finland. And argues that citizens could have capabilities and ability to participate in decisions about matters that directly affect their well-being. However, in the case of the forest based bioeconomy, the inclusion of citizens requires an interactive collaborative approach to empower various institutions and people to meet and debate on the development of their own living environment and environmental capability (i.e those bioeconomy opportunities to achieve outcomes people value). Citizens may not be able to find solutions and create the new innovations which the bioeconomy strategy require, yet it is the citizens who will live under the changed access to opportunities and entitlements including environmental services. For this reason, responsive governance and its adaptive and interactive administration need to ensure that many change actors are taken into account as a matter of basic justice in various processes of the bioeconomy transition. Therefore key aspects of change, such as citizens' values, interests, knowhow and environmental entitlements need to be taken into account. (C) 2017 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reintroduction of wood in rivers for restoration purposes is now recognized in a positive way by scientists. Nevertheless, the perception of wood in riverscapes is strongly affected by the socio-cultural environment. This cultural influence might explain why wood reintroduction is accepted and promoted in some regions of the world but not in others, despite the demonstrated ecological benefits. From an extensive student perception survey, we show that most of the groups from nine countries in the world considered riverscapes with wood to be less aesthetic, more dangerous, and needing more improvement than riverscapes without wood. By contrast, this way of thinking was not observed in Germany, Sweden, and Oregon (USA), where the first instances of wood reintroduction occurred.

AB  - Beavers (Castor spp.) are ecosystem engineers that induce local disturbance and ecological succession, which turns terrestrial into aquatic ecosystems and creates habitat heterogeneity in a landscape. Beavers have been proposed as a tool for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration. So far, most research has compared biodiversity in beaver wetlands and non-beaver wetlands, but few studies have explored how beaver-created succession affects specific taxa. In this study, we investigated how water beetles responded to different successional stages of wetlands in a beaver-disturbed landscape at Evo in southern Finland. We sampled water beetles with 1-L activity traps in 20 ponds, including: 5 new beaver ponds, 5 old beaver ponds, 5 former beaver ponds, and 5 never engineered ponds. We found that beaver wetlands had higher species richness and abundance than non-beaver wetlands, and that new beaver wetlands could support higher species richness (321%) and abundance (671%) of water beetles compared to old beaver wetlands. We think that higher water beetle diversity in new beaver ponds has resulted from habitat amelioration (available lentic water, shallow shores, aquatic vegetation, and low fish abundance) and food source enhancement (an increase of both dead and live prey) created by beaver dams and floods. We conclude that using beavers as a tool, or imitating their way of flooding, can be beneficial in wetland restoration if beaver population densities are monitored to ensure the availability of newly colonizable sites.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the spatial extent of heavy metal pollution in the urban part of Trondheim City and to assess the temporal variation over a period of ten years (1994-2004) by making comparisons to a previous survey. 321 surface soil samples were analysed, whereof eight of the analysed elements; arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr). copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) are presented in this study. Statistical tests show that all elements, except lead, have decreased in concentration statistically significantly over ten years. Three important pollution sources have been closed down at the end of the 1990s, the hospital waste incinerator, one of the crematories and a metal smelter. No correlation between element concentration and organic matter could be found. A principal component analysis (PCA) performed on the results also indicates that Cd, Zn, Pb and Hg correlate with anthropogenic input. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of socio-ecological resilience can be used to understand and measure to what degree farming systems are able to handle and adapt to disturbances. The article is based on the application of a framework for resilience assessment in European farming systems to the Norwegian low-intensity ovine and bovine farming systems. The aim is to identify the characteristics of farming systems and important trends in them. Interviews held at county and municipality level, and statistical data revealed that farming systems appeared quite robust, and resource-strong in terms of adhering and adjusting to current and coming environmental and animal welfare regulations, although some coming regulations may put farms under pressure and result in farm exit. Assessing the consequences of development trends envisioned by two scenarios underlines that the provision of goods and services by farming systems may be challenged in the future and that resilience needs to be enhanced. The authors conclude that the current war in Ukraine and its impacts on the food market, as well as the increased electricity prices in Norway, are examples of contextual changes that may challenge agricultural production. In this context, the article can serve as a baseline to reassess the resilience of farming systems.

AB  - In this article, I seek to bring together a number of environmental histories to think about the place of forest in our lives. It is partly autobiographical in the sense that it concerns forest issues that 1, for various reasons, have been entangled with recently. These are the making of carbon (REDD+) forests in Northeast India, preservation of the urban forests and planting of indigenous trees in Karura forests in Nairobi, Kenya, and the transformation of Swedish forests into vast industrial plantations. I come to these issues with little knowledge about the forest ecology or the flora and fauna, as such, but rather as a scholar with earlier experience of analysis of the social and political dynamics involved in conflicts over forests, that is, how differently powered actors seek to appropriate, stake claims to or control the forest. Hence, my point of departure and analytical framework is largely that of political ecology. In a conversation about the work of the anthropologist Brian Morris, I will point to the thinness of such an approach and open up aspects that are critical to Morris' way of engaging with the interactions of people, plants, insects, and animals. This, I will argue, is a truly grounded environmental anthropology.

AB  - Purpose
   The number of adolescents experiencing pain is increasing. Pain has a major impact on several areas of daily living, such as function at school and school absenteeism, loss of appetite and socializing. One out of ten pupils in Norwegian schools is immigrants, and surveys have shown that immigrants suffer from poor health more often than the general population. The purpose of this study was to explore how school nurses and teachers experience pain in young immigrants in the school setting.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A qualitative design using focus group interviews was chosen for data collection. A total of 11 focus groups (17 school nurses and 25 teachers) consisting of school nurses and teachers in junior high schools (age: 13-16 years) in Southern Norway were conducted. Data were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis.
   Findings
   School nurses and teachers experienced communication of pain with young immigrants as characterized by cultural differences and language problems. Immigrants waiting for residency permits experienced pain more often than others. They also experienced that young immigrants often were absent from school and used pain as an excuse for not participating in classes, but this was not the case at the special school for immigrants. During Ramadan, they experienced that immigrant pupils had an increase of pain, especially headaches.
   Originality/value
   Culture affects the assessment and management of pain and different strategies may assist school nurses and teachers in their encounter with young immigrants with pain. There is a need for education in cultural competence among teachers and school nurses.

AB  - Politicians and the public alike doubt the ability of nuclear power in the United States to compete as a significant low-carbon emission contributor to electricity production in a fully decarbonized electricity sector. Establishing whether or not these doubts are justified is challenged by the complexity of the highly disaggregated US electricity markets, including the highly varied mix of subsidies, production credits, and power purchase mandates that exist at the individual state level. The authors focus on answering the question of nuclear power's competitiveness by examining the electricity market of Sweden, a nation which has already fully decarbonized its electricity sector, basing its electricity generation entirely on a mix of hydroelectric power, nuclear power, and the use of biofuels, with much smaller contributions from renewables such as solar PV and wind-generated power. In this market, nuclear power is an effective competitor against renewable power generation.

AB  - Stream dwelling invertebrates are ideal candidates for the study of ecological speciation as they are often adapted to particular environmental conditions within a stream and inhabit only certain reaches of a drainage basin, separated by unsuitable habitat. We studied an atypical population of the stonefly Leuctra hippopus at a site in central Norway, the Isterfoss rapids, in relation to three nearby and two remote conspecific populations. Adults of this population emerge about a month earlier than those of nearby populations, live on large boulders emerging from the rapids, and are short-lived. This population also has distinct morphological features and was studied earlier during the period 1975-1990. We reassessed morphological distinctness with new measurements and added several analyses of genetic distinctness based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequence markers, as well as AFLP fingerprinting and SNPs mined from RAD sequences. The Isterfoss population is shown to be most closely related to its geographical neighbors, yet clearly morphologically and genetically distinct and homogeneous. We conclude that this population is in the process of sympatric speciation, with temporal isolation being the most important direct barrier to gene flow. The shift in reproductive season results from the particular temperature and water level regime in the Isterfoss rapids. The distinct adult body shape and loss of flight are hypothesized to be an adaptation to the unusual habitat. Ecological diversification on small spatial and temporal scales is one of the likely causes of the high diversity of aquatic insects.

AB  - In recent years, China has conducted considerable research focusing on the emission and effects of sulphur (S) on human health and ecosystems. By contrast, there has been little emphasis on anthropogenic nitrogen (N) so far, even though studies conducted abroad indicate that long-range atmospheric transport of N and ecological effects (e.g. acidification of soil and water) may be significant. The Sino-Norwegian project IMPACTS, launched in 1999, has established monitoring sites at five forest ecosystems in the southern part of PR China to collect comprehensive data on air quality, acidification status and ecological effects. Here we present initial results about N dynamics at two of the IMPACTS sites located near Chongqing and Changsha, including estimation of atmospheric deposition fluxes of NOx and NHx and soil N transformations. Nitrogen deposition is high at both sites when compared with values from Europe and North America (25-38 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)). About 70% of the deposited N comes as NH4, probably derived from agriculture. Leaching of N from soils is high and nearly all as NO3-. Transformation of N to NO3- in soils results in acidification rates that are high compared to rates found elsewhere. Despite considerable leaching of NO3- from the root zone of the soils, little NO3- appears in streamwater. This indicates that N retention or denitrification, both causing acid neutralization, may be important and probably occur in the groundwater and groundwater discharge zones. The soil flux density of mineral N, which is the sum of N deposition and N mineralization, and which is dominated by the N mineralization flux, may be a good indicator for leaching of NO3- in soils. However, this indicator seems site specific probably due to differences in land-use history and current N requirement.

AB  - An accumulating body of research identifies the importance of landscape structure for a wide range of countryside interests. Landscape structure reflects the results of policies and practices, and is well-suited as a target for management actions. New landscape metrics represent a potential for indicator-based management, provided such metrics relate consistently to the landscape values of interest. In this paper we propose that aspects of landscape structure. specifically heterogeneity, may be related to landscape-based values such as biodiversity, cultural heritage and human appreciation. Birds and vascular plants correlated well with our index for the heterogeneity of land types., whereas insects did not. Occurrence of prehistoric graves was also associated with land type heterogeneity, though other types of cultural remains were not. Landscape experience seems to be associated with the heterogeneity of landscape space rather than heterogeneity of land types. Different aspects of heterogeneity, scale, and variation over time all contribute to explain how our measures of landscape-based values vary in their relationship to landscape heterogeneity. Successful integration between disciplines in landscape studies depends on having a common operational framework, a shared theoretical basis, and a harmonised approach to data collection, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Climate change and urbanization are among the most significant trends of the twenty-first century, affecting global natural resources such as water, economic development and human well-being. The growth of the world population will be absorbed by the cities. The necessity of cities adapting to these trends calls for radical changes in urban water management. In this paper, baseline assessments, i.e., City Blueprints, have been carried out for 45 municipalities and regions in 27 countries, mainly in Europe. The assessments showed that cities vary considerably with regard to their water management. This is also captured in the Blue City Index(A (R)) (BCI), the arithmetic mean of 24 indicators comprising the City Blueprint(A (R)). Theoretically, the BCI has a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 10. The actual BCIs in the 45 cities and regions varied from 3.5 (Kilamba Kiaxi in Angola) to 8.5 (Helsingborg in Sweden). The BCI was positively and significantly correlated with the gross domestic product per person, the ambitions of the local authorities regarding water management, the voluntary participation index and governance indicators according to the World Bank (2013). The study also demonstrated a very significant correlation between the BCI and the University of Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index. The impacts of water scarcity and floods in cities are discussed. It is concluded that cities in transitional and developing countries are particularly at risk.

AB  - Developing a future bioeconomy has become critical for three main reasons: (1) The need for sustainability of resource use; (2) The growing demand for both food and energy; and (3) The need to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. As Zilberman observes, a transition to bioeconomy is a continuing evolutionary process of transition from systems of mining non-renewable resources to farming renewable ones. Hence, to meet the challenges created by a growing dependence on non-renewable resources, radical changes are needed that involve more than development of or changes within the individual bio-based sectors. In line with emerging attention to the bioeconomy in Europe and elsewhere, great expectations towards the bioeconomy have been launched in high level industry and policy fora, as well as in resource-based economies such as Norway's. Grounded in theories of transition and transition management, this paper discusses the Norwegian biosector's expectations regarding a bioeconomy. Analyses are based on empirical survey data from biosector representatives. Findings suggest that there are clear differences between sectors in motivation for a future bioeconomy. A transition into a complete bioeconomy will demand a system shift and more cross-sectoral integration between these regimes than currently exists.

AB  - The attainment of a sustainable transportation system necessitates changes in the travel behavior of individuals. In this article, a descriptive presentation of travel survey data as well as attitude surveys tests the hypothesis that women are potentially more adaptable to a sustainable transportation system than men are. This is accomplished in four parts. First, results from Swedish travel survey data have found that men travel more kilometers per year, use the car more than women with regard to the number of kilometers traveled per day, and make more trips as the sole occupant of a car. Second, results from attitude surveys show that women are more environmentally concerned and express more criticism of automobility than men. Third, women are more positive towards proposals that reduce or eliminate the environmental impact of car use to a greater extent than men. Fourth, women express more willingness to reduce their use of the car than men. In general, while there are not large differences between men and women and their attitudes towards automobility, women consistently show more support of ecological issues and are more positive towards measures which entail reductions in car use, such as improving and expanding public transportation. Women were furthermore more prepared to participate in ecologically benign activities to a greater extent than men, which included reducing car use. Because of the tendencies shown in the empirical results presented here, women are judged to have more potential for accommodating an ecologically sustainable transportation system in Sweden than men are.

AB  - In the past few decades, several studies have been conducted about the effects of stump harvesting on forests. Extensive stump harvesting began in Finland in 2000 for bioenergy purposes. Today, however, there are several ongoing discussions on producing energy from tree stump harvesting. Hence, the present study aimed to investigate people's knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes about stump harvesting by conducting a questionnaire survey during Silva fair in North Karelia in Finland. The results of the study indicated that 70% of the respondents showed quite good knowledge about stump harvesting. Respondents with high knowledge had critical perceptions and attitudes concerning stump harvesting. The study indicated that respondents supported stump harvesting only for forest management or site preparation, not for revenue. There were significant differences between forest owners and non-owners, between respondents with forestry backgrounds and non forestry backgrounds, and between males and females regarding revenue. Respondents with high knowledge agreed that stump harvesting is good for forest management but not for biodiversity. Respondents had positive attitudes towards learning more about stump harvesting and using fuel from stumps. The study indicated that although people have some negative perceptions and attitudes towards stump harvesting, on the whole, they accept it as part of their future bioenergy sources. We deem that the results of our study will accelerate bioenergy policy makers' interests.

TI  - Ilmar Talve as an Estonian Ethnologist
T2  - TUNA-AJALOOKULTUURI AJAKIRI
LA  - Estonian
AB  - Ilmar Talve is better known to Estonian readers as a writer and cultural historian, although for decades he was a professor of ethnology in Finland. His connection to Estonian ethnology has hitherto attracted little attention. Talve considered himself first and foremost an ethnologist, which he had studied at the University of Tartu during the war and in post-war Sweden. During those years, he was closely involved in domestic ethnology, and it is for this reason that I will concentrate on that period (circa 1938-1960) in my article.
   The teaching of ethnology at the University of Tartu had only gained a firmer foundation in 1939, when Gustav Rank started as professor. The outbreak of World War II and the subsequent occupations overshadowed the learning opportunities for the students of the time: intermittent studies, few opportunities to attend lectures, a high proportion of self-study, unexpected and rapidly approaching deadlines, and the constant uncertainty caused by all of this put their stamp on their studies. Talve was one of the few who managed to earn his master's degree, already in 1942. Like his fellow students, starting from 1940 he worked at the Estonian National Museum, which was the centre of ethnological research in Estonia at the time.
   Talve's passion for scholarship manifested itself when he was still a student. He hoped to publish each of his student papers in the future. He did indeed rewrite most of his seminar papers for publication but under difficult war conditions, his plans never materialised. During his time in Tartu, he did not confine himself to a single ethnographic topic but already then took a very broad approach to the study of folk culture. Traditional areas of material folk culture, such as wagons, and the burning of coal and tar, were addressed. Alongside these, Talve delved into the possibilities for studying the social sphere of (folk) culture, a field that was innovative in ethnology and promised to modernise the local discipline in the long term, but the war put an end to this research. Talve's grandiose plans to study Estonian social (folk) culture, which would have considerably broadened the field of research that had hitherto been established, unfortunately remained only a dream since he fled to Finland in the spring of 1943 to escape German mobilisation.
   In 1945, Talve arrived in Sweden and was hired by the Institute of Folklife Studies, which was headed by the renowned ethnologist Sigurd Erixon. A number of his colleagues were already working there, including Gustav Rank, Eerik Laid, and Helmut Hagar. He still desired to make a name for himself as a researcher, but the master's degree he had earned in Tartu was not taken into account in his new country of residence. Talve's goal was to pass the licentiate exam and write his doctoral thesis, but it took years to achieve these goals. Economic uncertainty and the standoffish attitude of the Swedish scholarly community delayed the fulfilment of his plans. However, he did manage to earn his doctorate in 1960 on the broad ethnographic topic of `The Sauna and the Drying House in Northern Europe'. Yet he did not succeed in forging a career in Sweden, but instead found work in Finland, where Talve moved as early as 1959. From 1962 to 1986, he was Professor of Ethnology at the University of Turku.
   Becoming a refugee scholar meant the need to meet new expectations and inevitable adaptation to (academic) life in the host country. Yet it also meant a conscious contribution to the study of Estonian culture so that continuity would not be broken, and disciplines would continue. He still hoped in his first years in exile for his imminent return to his Estonian homeland and dreamed of continuing professional work in Tartu in his research field amidst the domestic archives and libraries. The younger generation of researchers took Swedish ethnology as a model, which they now had the opportunity to study more closely. Talve's ideas, which he had developed in Tartu, of looking at the field of ethnology more broadly than as the mere study of material peasant culture were confirmed. Taking his cue from Erixon, he underlined the need to view ethnographic phenomena in their historical-social-economic and geographical contexts. In 1952, in order to ensure the continuity of the domestic disciplines and, at the same time, to develop them, Talve put forward his own research programme, but he and his colleagues were unable to begin their actual work. Like his wartime research plans, the ideas of the early exile era were to remain a sketch awaiting better times.

AB  - Background: Previous studies indicate that clinical guidelines using combined risk evaluation for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may overestimate risk. The aim of this study was to model and discuss implementation of the current (2007) hypertension guidelines in a general Norwegian population.
   Methods: Implementation of the current European Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension was modelled on data from a cross-sectional, representative Norwegian population study (The Nord-Trondelag Health Study 1995-97), comprising 65,028 adults, aged 20-89, of whom 51,066 (79%) were eligible for modelling.
   Results: Among individuals with blood pressure >= 120/80 mmHg, 93% (74% of the total, adult population) would need regular clinical attention and/or drug treatment, based on their total CVD risk profile. This translates into 296,624 follow-up visits/100,000 adults/year. In the Norwegian healthcare environment, 99 general practitioner (GP) positions would be required in the study region for this task alone. The number of GPs currently serving the adult population in the study area is 87 per 100,000 adults.
   Conclusion: The potential workload associated with the European hypertension guidelines could destabilise the healthcare system in Norway, one of the world's most long-and healthy-living nations, by international comparison. Large-scale, preventive medical enterprises can hardly be regarded as scientifically sound and ethically justifiable, unless issues of practical feasibility, sustainability and social determinants of health are considered.

AB  - Traffic results in negative external effects such as emissions, noise, congestion and infrastructural wear and tear. Public transport on the other hand, generates in many cases substantially larger positive system- and scale effects compared to its vehicle external marginal costs. This paper investigates actual external marginal costs of transport in Sweden for all modes of passenger transport in urban and rural areas and compare it to the level of positive system-and scale effects in local and regional public transport. The study is based on marginal costs of traffic in Sweden as reported in Transport Analysis yearly report to the government and on research on optimal public transport pricing. The numerical examples exemplify the situation in Sweden for a rural area (Jamtland County) and a larger urban area (Stockholm County). It is highlighted that taxes and fees in level with marginal costs can cover the existing financial deficit for public transport and an optimal subsidy in both the urban county and the rural county. However, among other things it is necessary to handle the legal aspects of such a funding of public transport before it could be used in the reality. Public transport are financed at county level, while the taxes and charges from traffic are an income on a national level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A decrease of flood damages in the future requires not only adaptation to flood caused by present day climate, but also climate change effects on floods should be taken into account. The paper illustrates the need to take into account changing climate conditions in flood adaptation strategies and to apply in practice the concept of integrated water resource management (IWRM). IWRM is based on a number of policy instruments, economic instruments, political signals, and also, on the effects of climate change on floods and collaboration across national, regional and local administrative units. The guidelines for a country adaptation to floods in a changing climate are outlined. A comparison of the adaptive capacities in Poland and Norway is used to illustrate the need for the implementation of proposed guidelines to assure flood risk management under climate change in a sustainable way.

AB  - Mining has become increasingly difficult for societal and environmental reasons all over the world. There is an increasing competition with other land uses, and water and energy are scarce in many important mining regions. People are not ready to radically reduce the use of mineral-based products, but increasingly oppose mining. The industry faces major challenges to improve its performance and image.
   The Green Mining concept (GM) was developed as a major tool to make Finland the forerunner in sustainable mining. It promotes material, water, and energy efficiency to reduce the environmental footprint of mineral-based product life cycles. GM allows the recovery of all useful minerals and minimises mining waste. GM aims to ensure the availability of mineral resources for future generations, which requires long-term investment in mineral exploration supported by geoscientific mapping, mineral systems research and the development of exploration techniques. An important goal of GM is to minimise adverse environmental and social impacts in all stages of the operations, and to maximise local benefits. GM helps to organise the operations in such a way that they are safe and meaningful to employees, and harmless for local residents and the environment. After mine closure, GM helps to restore the mining areas to make them safe and preferably to allow other types of land use. The broad-based participation of local residents and other stakeholders is crucial throughout the mining life cycle, from early exploration to mine closure.
   Societies, governments, and investors should not tolerate unsustainable mining companies in the future. The mining industry has to solve increasing social, ecological and technical problems of the future by applying holistic concepts, such as the Green Mining concept, if they hope to earn the social license to operate.

AB  - Calls for transformational adaptation are increasing. Government authorities, expected to lead adaptation, are in the difficult situation of changing a governance system from within. This demands a capacity for critical reflection among civil servants involved. Adopting a Social Practice Theory approach, we argue this capacity must be understood as emerging in practice, not simply held by individuals. Empirically, we focus on a central network of government authorities in Sweden's adaptation governance, and identify assumptions and routines guiding their meaning making process. We focus on how situations of contestation are dealt with to explore the practice's capacity to facilitate critical reflection. We show how a focus on efficient information transmission and an assumption of incremental adaptation as sufficient leads their practice to play down the consequences of the climate crisis. A practice approach suggests interventions to the group level in order to create joint critical reflection, necessary for enabling transformational adaptation.

T2  - URBAN STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - FINNISH
AB  - This paper is an interpretation of Finnish rural locality studies in the RURE programme framework. Rural development is described as a series of historical layers of economic development and policies. Since World War II there have been in Finland three successive national 'policy projects' with different rural impacts: the settlement project; the project of the industrial welfare state; and the emerging project of 'new rural policy'. Each one has meant more intensive integration of rural and urban parts of society. The paper focuses on the two periods of transformation from one project to the next. During the first period the earlier rural forms of economy collapsed and development paths of rural communities became diversified. The State supported industrialisation of rural areas (regional policies), rationalisation of agriculture (structural policies and price subsidies) and welfare services. Rural people responded by migrating, by giving their support to political protest parties, and later by organising into village committees. During the second period new social groups have been expressing their conflicting interests towards the countryside. The State is trying to create the 'new rural policy' to channel the funds and experts from earlier agricultural policy into more comprehensive rural development work. The paper ends with a suggestion that it is not possible to talk about rural areas as a target of one policy. That is why the 'new rural policy' might be an impossible project.

AB  - Optimization models on continuous cover forestry are complicated and typically incompatible with rotation models. This dichotomy is theoretically unsatisfactory and makes the choice between clearcuts and continuous cover forestry vague. We present a theoretically sound and empirically detailed generalized setup with an optimal clear-cut regime (or even-aged management) and optimal continuous cover regime (or uneven-aged management) as special cases. It includes a size-structured growth model, variable and fixed harvesting costs, and allows for the completely flexible optimization of harvest timing in both regimes. Flexible harvest timing becomes essential when optimizing the transition from clear-cut regimes toward continuous cover forestry. The model is applied to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) and solved as a dynamic mixed-integer problem. Low or moderate site productivity, an interest rate above 2%, and a high artificial regeneration cost support the optimality of continuous cover forestry. In its most general form, the optimal clear-cut regime does not exist when the continuous cover regime is globally optimal, and when it exists, the rotation period lengthens with interest rate. The optimal choice between forest management regimes may depend on the initial stand state and whether the naturally regenerated seedlings are utilized in solutions with clearcuts. Maximizing sustainable yield favors clearcuts.

AB  - To maintain biodiversity in managed forests we must understand how forestry affects Various organisms across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. We compared landscape structure, forest structure, and species richness and abundance of epiphytic macrolichens in three pairs of natural and managed boreal forest landscapes. Study landscapes (2500 ha) were located within and adjacent to three of the largest forest reserves in Sweden (Reivo; Muddus, Jelka). The structural heterogeneity within landscapes was higher in managed forests whereas within-stand structural heterogeneity was higher in natural landscapes. Species richness of macrolichens at the stand level (sample plot) was 23% higher in natural forests but there was no difference at the landscape level. Most (86%) of the common species were more frequent in natural landscapes. Lichen abundance (estimated by lichen litter) was two times higher in natural than in managed landscapes, 5.6 and 2.7 kg ha(-1) forest (pooled data), respectively. Both species richness and abundance were negatively related to cutting lever (number and basal area of cut stumps) and positively related to stand variables (stand age, stem density and basal area). Lichen-rich forest stands were more numerous but covered a smaller area and were more isolated in managed landscapes. This may in turn have important consequences for dispersal of lichen propagules to second-growth forests. In conclusion, the results suggest that effects of forestry on epiphyte diversity and abundance are strongly related to the spatial scale (stand or landscape). To enhance biodiversity in managed forests we must increase structural heterogeneity at the whole range of spatial and temporal scales.

AB  - The alpine gentian, Gentiana nivalis, is an obligate annual. Because of its complete population turnover every year, it is likely to be more responsive to environmental shifts than are perennials, and also likely to undergo more rapid genetic change in response to selection pressure. The detected morphological differentiation between habitats was related to different proportions of spring- and autumn-germinating individuals with a larger proportion of winter annuals in the subalpine habitats. The spring-germinating annuals that have shorter time for development and have a shorter stature can still develop at the alpine sites where competition is weaker. The subalpine habitats are all semi-natural, shaped by livestock grazing and human activities related to summer farming. Declining human impact is leading to successional changes in the mountain landscape. The future of G. nivalis in the light of current trends in landscape development and climate change is discussed.

AB  - For an efficient abatement of diffuse N pollution from arable land, it is important to have practical and reliable tools that can quantify the effect of different management practices on leaching, and also analyse the effect of alternative management scenarios aimed at reducing leaching. We present here an application of SOILNDB, a management-oriented model for quantifying nitrate leaching from arable land. Simulations with SOILNDB were compared with measurements of pipe-drain discharge of nitrate taken in a 14-year field experiment on a sandy loam soil in south-west Sweden. Following adjustment of parameters connected to litter and faeces decomposition and mineralization, the model gave satisfactory predictions of nitrate leaching for all 10 treatments. The temporal pattern was generally well captured by the model, as was confirmed by high model efficiency values (average = 0.59). This application also supports the model's ability to simulate the long-term influence of different crops and catch crops as well as different manure strategies on leaching. However, further studies should be done to evaluate the model under additional agro-environmental conditions (e.g. soils, climates, and crops).

AB  - In the southeast in Noffkoping, Sweden, is a small fjord-like bay called Slatbaken. The water quality in Slatbaken-with its narrow outlet to the Baltic Sea-depends highly on the water quality of the streams that flow in it. While point pollution sources can be identified easily in general, the non-point sources are harder to find. The most important sources for non-point pollution are agricultural areas, and the pollutants are mostly nutrients like phosphorus, which come from the fertilisation of the fields. One important catchment area for Slatbaken is the 57.7 km(2) Gisselo river basin (part of the topographic map 8GNO), which contains large agricultural areas.
   The transport of water pollutants is based on the same hydrological processes as erosion and sediment transport. The implementation of such a model in a GIS allows the analysis of a large area with a high resolution. When choosing the model, special attention was paid to the possibility of using a verified model that is easy to implement in a commercial GIS without the need of too much expert knowledge. This may allow its widespread use in many administrative applications that need non-point source information. A feasibility test for an enhanced GIS USLE model was done in the Gisselo drainage basin before it was implemented for all river basins in the whole administrative area of Norrkopings kommun.
   It is possible to use the suggested simplified USLE model to estimate the load of both pollutants and sediments, and it is able to show the areas that are critical for the water quality at the outlet of the water basin. The model has been evaluated in three studies [Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Syst. 2 (4) (1988) 365; A GIS to target critical areas for non point source management, in: Proceedings of the International Non Point Source Management Symposium, Austin, TX, November 7, 1989; Vatten 48 (1992) 117]. Then, implemented in a very simple GIS that allowed only rough estimates of terrain models and distances, the model was able to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Svarta river basin of 1539 km(2) in the same region as Gisselo and the Bornsjo river basin outside Stockholm. Besides an estimated R-2 of 0.91-0.98 (verified by a more than one year measurement from manual and automated sampling stations in the whole river basin), the benefit with the GIS implemented USLE was the possibility to identify the risk areas with high spatial accuracy. During the last decade, both available databases and software have changed the possibilities to identify areas at risk of nutrient leakage. Schein [GIS Methods for Monitoring Sustainable Development by Analysis of Land-use and Land Cover Changes in the Surroundings of Linkoping (Sweden), Institut fur Photogrammetrie und Fernerkundung, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany] and Schein and Sivertun [Method and models for sustainable development monitoring and analyses in GIS, in: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Geo-Spatial Knowledge Processing for Natural Resource Management, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy, June 28-29, 2001] show that the enhanced land use data available through the European Union agricultural support program can be used together with remote sensing data to fine tune the modified GIS USLE model. The problems with the new 50 x 50 m digital elevation data now available are also pointed out here. Obvious errors in the data and possibilities to enhance the model by introducing a better terrain model were two important suggestions in these works. In this article, two modifications to the original model are suggested. One is enhancement of the digital terrain model by using height curves from the digital 1:50 000 scale topographic map, and the other is a smooth distance function that better reflects the impact of nutrients on water bodies.
   Because of its easy implementation on standard low cost systems, the GIS USLE model is suitable for analysing huge areas for critical places. The results can lead to more detailed studies in the risk areas thus identified or to investigations on the effect of land use changes, or can be used simply for taking care in the use of fertilisers and other chemicals in the critical agricultural areas.

AB  - The Norwegian Centre for Climate Services (NCCS) has developed a production chain for climate information with the aim of delivering a knowledge base for climate change adaptation suitable for use by planners at various administrative levels in Norway. This process consists of two main steps: First, climate and hydrological projections are produced at a local scale (1 x 1 km resolution) using available results from global and regional climate models (GCMs and RCMs). In a second step, climate factsheets with abridged information relevant for individual counties in Norway have been co-produced with users and county authorities. Projections were produced by using a climate-hydrological modeling chain driven by downscaled simulations from 10 GCM-RCM combinations and two climate scenarios in which temperature and precipitation were first downscaled and bias-adjusted to a 1 x 1 km resolution. Bias-adjustment was necessary, partly due to biases in the RCMs. These results were published in the Norwegian climate assessment report "Climate in Norway 2100." The results have then been disseminated through various formats, such as reports, dataportals, visualizations and factsheets (available at ). NCCS has issued climate factsheets for 17 counties in Norway and Svalbard. The county-wise climate factsheets have become the most extensive product issued by NCCS. A challenge when developing information about climate change for use in adaptation is the issue of uncertainty, and the trade-off between robustness vs. precision in the numerical values given should guide the dissemination of climate information. Based on our experiences, we also recommend that climate information is developed in collaboration with users because this ensures that it will be understood by a wider audience. Most climate-related challenges for infrastructure are related to extreme events. For technical applications in Norway, climate change allowances are now available for heavy precipitation, floods, and storm surges as a tool for design analyses of buildings and infrastructure. This paper describes the production chain for the presently available climate projections following the release of IPCC AR5 (CMIP5), our experiences of the dissemination process, as well as our plans for further development of the next national climate assessment report based on IPCC AR6 (CMIP6).

AB  - Conservation of species threatened by habitat fragmentation is a major global challenge, and determining the genetic and demographic processes associated with isolation and reductions in population size will be critical for an increasing number of species. We conducted controlled crosses and field germination experiments to quantify the effects of inbreeding and outbreeding in the declining orchid Gymnadenia conopsea in two Norwegian populations that differ in size. We further compared our results with published estimates of inbreeding depression in orchids. There was severe inbreeding depression for seed production (delta = 0.41-0.67) and germination (delta = 0.46-0.66) in both populations, with stronger inbreeding depression in the large population. Compared to outcrossing, selfing reduced female fitness (number of seeds per fruit x proportion of seeds germinating) by 76 and 54 % in the large and small population, respectively. The magnitude of inbreeding depression for seed production was higher than the average reported for orchids, while for germination it was similar to earlier estimates. The large population also experienced considerable outbreeding depression for seed production (delta = 0.23-0.27), germination (delta = 0.33) and female fitness (delta = 0.47) following crosses with a population 1.6 km away. The strong inbreeding depression indicates that both populations harbour a substantial genetic load, and suggests that fragmentation may reinforce population decline in G. conopsea via increased inbreeding. Moreover, the local outbreeding depression indicates substantial genetic differentiation at a moderate spatial scale. This has important implications for the use of crosses between populations or plant translocations as conservation approaches.

AB  - Tourism represents the sector of services which is developing the most considerably and dynamically. However, its development is influenced by: trends in globalization, process of demographic aging, economic parameters, geographical conditions of a country, consumers, and other aspects. The following aspects contribute to its development: new destinations, markets, innovative activities in service sector, and also technological development. Tourism plays a significant economic role in a process of sustainable regional development, where it helps to develop low-growth regions. Monitoring and quantification of tourism outputs is a very complicated process. There also absents a quality database, which complicates a quantification of sector's efficiency and a creation of national and international benchmarking indicators that inform of sustainable tourism level. These aspects demand a realization of multi-dimensional analyses, which would examine causal relations between tourism factors and economic parameters of a country. The study's motivation was driven by all of the above-mentioned facts. It aims at researching an influence of tourism spending on OECD countries' productivity. Consequently, it evaluates their potential of the sector's sustainability. Multiple analytical procedures, which were determined by database availability, were performed in order to achieve the, research aim. The following analyses were performed besides the descriptive statistics: variance analysis of researched variables between individual years and OECD countries, context analysis, regression and cluster analyses. There were analysed 5 variables that characterize individual types of tourist spending: Business Tourism Spending, Domestic Tourism Spending, Leisure Tourism Spending, Outbound Travel & Tourism Expenditure , Visitor Exports (Foreign Spending) and one variable that characterizes productivity during 2010 - 2018 for all OECD countries. Spending variables were standardized per 1,000 inhabitants of a given country and productivity was measured by GDP per capita, while both groups of variables were provided in USD (fair value). The analyses' results provided interesting fmdings. The regression models' outputs confirmed an influence of tourist spending on a country's productivity. All variables that indicate spending are significant. The cluster analysis's results allowed a selection of countries into four groups. There is two huge clusters and other two clusters represent only one countries in specific cluster. Luxemburg and Iceland give us different values than countries in other clusters. The countries with higher rank are as follows: Australia (AUS), Austria (AUT), Belgium (BEL), Canada (CAN), Germany (DEU), Denmark (DNK), Finland (FIN), France (FRA), Unites Kingdom (GBR), Switzerland (CBE), Ireland (IRL), Italy (ITA), Netherland (NLD), Norway (NOR), New Zealand (NZL), Sweden (SWE), United States (USA), Island (ISL) and Luxembourg (LUX). On the other hand, the countries with lower rank are as follows: Czech Republic CZE, Spain (ESP), Estonia (EST), Greece (GRC), Hungary (HUN), Chile (CHL), Israel (ISR), Japan (JPN), Korea (KOR), Lithuania (LTU), Latvia (LVA), Mexico (MEX), Poland (POL), Portugal (PRT), Slovak Republic (SVK), Slovenia (SVN) and Turkey (TUR). These findings provide a space for a deeper research of effect between determinants of tourism development and economic indicators, while they enable to reveal a space for a growth of countries' productivity that would provide a sustainability in tourism sector.

AB  - Since the mid-1990's the European Commission (EC) has provided funding for transnational access schemes that open up existing major research facilities to outside users. In the current 6th Framework Program, two out of 14 funded projects - SUSPOWER and ENGAS - are of prime interest to the gas turbine community. SUSPOWER (KTH, Stockhom, Sweden) encompasses unique large-scale experimental facilities within the area of sustainable thermal power generation. Topics of key interest include high-temperature air combustion, catalytic combustion, gasification, aeroelasticity of turbine/compressor blades, film cooling aerodynamics, and stator/rotor interactions. ENGAS (NTNU, Trondheim, Norway) includes a complex array of specialized laboratories in the topic of environmental gas management. Relevant research topics include combustion of hydrogen and hythane, biomass gasification, CO2 absorption and sequestration, membranes for hydrogen and CO2 separation, gas storage in rock caverns, and hydrogen production and storage. This paper presents information on these projects along with a brief overview of previous EC transnational access activities as related to gas turbine research and development.

AB  - In the aftermath of a hurricane in Sweden that felled some 250 million trees, the Swedish Forest Agency advised forest owners to reduce forest vulnerability by planting different tree species. This paper analyses why forest owners failed to heed the Forest Agency's recommendation, thereby reproducing a forest vulnerable to storms. This paper focuses on the deliberations and risk evaluations of forest owners when deciding which tree species to plant. The analysis identifies three main categories of reasoning that guided the forest owners' decision-making process: short-term economic reasoning caused by the pressing situation they faced; an understanding of windstorms as natural catastrophes that are impossible to influence; and the uncertainties associated with alternative forest management practices. Furthermore, given their risk-averse strategy, their approach to understanding and coping with uncertainty was crucial in determining their responses. This paper concludes that the forest owners primarily employed experience-based, practical and embodied knowledge, implying that abstract risks and theoretical knowledge regarding future developments were not deemed relevant. An additional conclusion is that even if a huge storm felling shows the need to change forest management practice, it does not provide the most favourable social conditions for achieving change.

AB  - The article analyzes adaptations to the EU. Focus is on Norway's trade relations with the EU in the fields of food and agriculture. These fields are partially covered by the 1994 EEA Agreement (food regulations) and partly excluded (agricultural policy). The research questions are: 1) How have trade relations with the EU evolved since the EEA Agreement entered into force?; 2) What can explain Norway's adaptations to the EU? The article shows that Norway has adapted fully on areas covered by formal EEA obligations. However, Norway has gone even further in its adaptations to the EU. These "voluntary" adaptations can partly be explained by an economic logic where issue-linkages and domestic economic interests are at play, and partly by the authorities' perceived constraints and obligations to cooperate with the EU in trade liberalization. The article shows how a combination of institutional constraints and balancing of economic interests has shaped Norway's adaptations to the EU, also in areas that were not originally part of the requirements of the EEA Agreement.

AB  - The heavily industrialized NE part of Estonia has been an environmental hot spot for decades. The oil shale industry, thermal power plants, a cement factory and a Soviet-era depository of radioactive wastes have seriously impacted virtually every component of the environment. This study focuses on environmental changes in the coastal sea, which comprises the southern part of the Gulf of Finland. It is based on national marine monitoring data (since 1968), as well as on recent in situ measurements on hydrodynamics, pollution spread, and on bottom habitat recovery. Starting from the 1990s, improvement of the water quality in the Gulf of Finland is evident. After re-orientation into market economy, substantial economic recession took place in Estonia in the 1990s. The pollution load from both industrial sources and from Narva River decreased. On the other hand, new water protection directives were introduced. However, together with economic growth in the 2000s, some new threats arose, e.g. in relation with the construction of ports at Kunda, Muuga, Sillamae, and a new pulp mill at Kunda. The replacement of oil shale-based energetics with a nuclear power plant is currently under discussion.

AB  - Ongoing sustainability challenges create pressure on planning practices and institutional arrangements. Transformative policy visions, such as the circular economy and bioeconomy, create promises for designing and planning sustainable pathways in society. Moreover, research agendas on sustainability transitions, such as transition management, are developing toolkits and attempting to shift planning practice by applying evidence-based policy-making processes. In this paper, we ask what happens when sustainability visions are exposed to planning practices, and vice versa, by developing an analytical framework to discuss processes of territorialization and mobilization. We draw lessons from two contextually differing case studies in Finland; on the evaluation of spatial planning processes for the circular economy and a strategic planning intervention for the blue bioeconomy. The disparate cases show that the planning process act as a bidirectional intermediary space, refining both the general transition visions and established planning practices.

AB  - Wild geese foraging on farmland cause increasing conflicts with agricultural interests, calling for a strategic approach to mitigation. In central Norway, conflicts between farmers and spring-staging pink-footed geese feeding on pastures have escalated. To alleviate the conflict, a scheme by which farmers are subsidized to allow geese to forage undisturbed was introduced. To guide allocation of subsidies, an ecological-based ranking of fields at a regional level was recommended and applied. Here we evaluate the scheme. On average, 40 % of subsidized fields were in the top 5 % of the ranking, and 80 % were within the top 20 %. Goose grazing pressure on subsidized pastures was 13 times higher compared to a stratified random selection of non-subsidized pastures, capturing 67 % of the pasture feeding geese despite that subsidized fields only comprised 13 % of the grassland area. Close dialogue between scientists and managers is regarded as a key to the success of the scheme.

CP  - XXIV Nordic Congress of Entomology
AB  - Forty-seven bee species (31 percent of all pollen collecting species) recorded in Finland are regarded as oligoleges, collecting pollen only from plants of a single family. The proportions of oligoleges variate greatly in different families of bees. Twenty-two oligolectic bee species in Finland are regarded as narrow oligoleges collecting pollen only from plants of a single genus. Of these, five species collect pollen from Campanula and five from Salix. Bombus consobrinus is regarded as a facultative monolege of Aconitum septentrionale. The distribution limits of narrowly oligolectic Eucera a longicornis, Andrena hattorfiana, two Macropis species and Colletes daviesanus approximately follow certain areal frequencies of their principal pollen plants (Lathyrus pratensis, Knautia, Lysimachia vulgaris and Tanacetum, respectively). The area of agricultural meadows and pastured forests has drastically decreased during the last few decades in Finland and the bees have suffered considerably from the loss of these habitats. Records of E. longicornis and A. hattorfiana are given as examples of the decline of oligolectic bees in Finland since 1970.

AB  - The nature-based tourism sector is characterised by small-scale businesses often located in rural regions. As a consequence, business success is dependent not just upon the sustainable use of natural resources, but also on several external (e.g. infrastructure and destination images) and internal (e.g. management and human resources) factors. Many nature-based tourism entrepreneurs are also driven by non-monetary objectives, which imply different management priorities compared with many other businesses. This study provides an exploratory analysis of business success factors and constraints among nature-based tourism entrepreneurs in Sweden. Data collected in 2009 include 'life-history' interviews, a telephone survey of 176 entrepreneurs, and follow-up critical incident interviews. The results show that internal factors are more common for business success, while external factors dominate among the constraints. Among the 26 success items studied, management (commitment and competence), access to natural resources, and lifestyle are considered the most important. Low profitability, lack of capital, regulations, infrastructure, and taxes are given the highest weights among the constraints. The classification system of Ishikawa [(1990). Introduction to quality control (J.H. Loftus, Trans.). Tokyo: 3A Corporation] is used to analyse how business success and constraints are structured over time. This study also elaborates how success factors and constraints are associated with different types of businesses, including perceived monetary and non-monetary achievements.

AB  - 1. Quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation distribution and abundance from sedimentary pollen records provides an important baseline for understanding long term ecosystem dynamics and for the calibration of earth system process models such as regional-scale climate models, widely used to predict future environmental change. Most current approaches assume that the amount of pollen produced by each vegetation type, usually expressed as a relative pollen productivity term, is constant in space and time.
   2. Estimates of relative pollen productivity can be extracted from extended R-value analysis (Parsons and Prentice, 1981) using comparisons between pollen assemblages deposited into sedimentary contexts, such as moss polsters, and measurements of the present day vegetation cover around the sampled location. Vegetation survey method has been shown to have a profound effect on estimates of model parameters (Bunting and Hjelle, 2010), therefore a standard method is an essential pre-requisite for testing some of the key assumptions of pollen-based reconstruction of past vegetation; such as the assumption that relative pollen productivity is effectively constant in space and time within a region or biome.
   3. This paper systematically reviews the assumptions and methodology underlying current models of pollen dispersal and deposition, and thereby identifies the key characteristics of an effective vegetation survey method for estimating relative pollen productivity in a range of landscape contexts.
   4. It then presents the methodology used in a current research project, developed during a practitioner workshop. The method selected is pragmatic, designed to be replicable by different research groups, usable in a wide range of habitats, and requiring minimum effort to collect adequate data for model calibration rather than representing some ideal or required approach. Using this common methodology will allow project members to collect multiple measurements of relative pollen productivity for major plant taxa from several northern European locations in order to test the assumption of uniformity of these values within the climatic range of the main taxa recorded in pollen records from the region.

AB  - In Sweden, adaptation to climate change has been addressed in connection with some strategic projects of national significance. Hydrological upgrading of Swedish dam safety assessments has been in the forefront. This has been followed by studies of risks in the expanding metropolitan areas of Stockholm and Gothenburg, where assumptions about hydrological changes have been combined with considerations about future changes in sea level. The two big lakes, Malaren and Vanern, and the River Gota alv have also been a focus. A key subject has been how to cope with the inevitable uncertainty, as illustrated by the range of results based on the set of regional climate scenarios available. The way forward has been close co-operation with stakeholders. In the case of dam safety, this was carried out in a joint committee including industry, responsible agencies and researchers. The dialogue within this committee may serve as a model for other sectors.

AB  - The twofold aim of this study was to investigate the long-term landscape development in an intensely cultivated region of south-western Scania, southern Sweden, and to discuss the potential of pollen records from wells for this purpose. Pollen records from 36 different wells from 12 archaeological sites were compiled. Based on 35 of the wells, ranging ca 800 cal bc-cal ad 1900, regional vegetation cover for seven different time-windows was quantified using the REVEALS model and a multiple small sites approach. According to the REVALS output, landscape openness was high and relatively constant during the last ca 2,500 years (open-land vegetation covered 90-97%), whereas arable land use expanded more gradually (cereal vegetation expanded from 9% cover 800-500 bc to 38% cover ad 1700-1900). This gradual increase in arable farming at the expense of grassland enabled an increase in food production within an already agriculturally colonized landscape. The REVEALS estimates based on pollen records from wells were in general accordance with earlier published REVEALS reconstructions based on lake sediments from neighbouring regions. A GIS analysis of arable land use in south-western Scania around ad 1800, based on old cadastral maps, gave similar results as the REVEALS reconstruction of cereal vegetation cover for the ad 1700-1900 time-window. It gives support to the conclusion that pollen records from wells may be used for REVEALS reconstructions of past vegetation cover.

AB  - Purpose: Within the tourism industry, there is a considerable focus on sustainable tourism. One way for tourism service providers to address these issues and present their sustainability work is through annual reports, sustainability reports and homepages. Sustainability report is a way for tourism companies to be more legitimate and accountable toward their stakeholders. The research objective, with this study, was to investigate and analyze Swedish tourism service providers' sustainability information. What kind of sustainability information is presented? Where is the sustainability information presented and for whom?
   Design/methodology/approach: The data for this study was collected mainly during December 2015-February 2016. The research design was constructed as a qualitative explorative study on tourism companies and how they present their work with sustainability (economic, social and environmental) for their stakeholders. Data was collected from 50 different tourism companies in Sweden from their annual reports, sustainability reports and their home pages. They are large-sized tourism companies with a yearly turnover between 5-50 million euros.
   Findings: The result shows that what they present is often focused on social or environmental sustainability (not both dimensions). The tourism service providers are all presenting economic sustainability since they must do an annual report yearly. Another conclusion is that they do not use sustainability report as their communication channel to show accountability and legitimacy to their stakeholders. Home pages are used mostly for presenting their sustainability work despite that there are large differences between how much information from the companies. The stakeholders seem to be mainly the customers.
   Research/practical implications: It still seems like that many tourism companies do not see the benefits in sustainable tourism. If tourism companies want to be legitimate and accountable concerning sustainability they have the possibility to present more information about their sustainable information to stakeholders and conduct even more efforts on sustainability issues in their everyday business life. It would be interesting to make interviews to gain more insight in what they want to communicate to their stakeholders concerning their sustainability work. It would also be interesting to compare with other countries and culture concerning tourist companies' sustainability work and their communication to stakeholders.
   Originality/value: The main value of this paper is that the study focuses on large sized tourism companies that must present a sustainability report from 2017. The European Union has decided to make it mandatory for large sized companies to present sustainability reports in 2017 and this study is therefore interesting since it shows their sustainability work before this law is implemented.

AB  - The article analyzes and summarizes information on breeding and seed production of the main forest-forming and commercial species for the countries of Northern Europe and Russia: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst). It is shown that in the last 40-50 years Sweden and Finland have completed the first (primary) cycle of plus-tree breeding, and the second cycle is being actively pursued. In terms of seed production, this means a gradual replacement of the 1st generation forest seed orchards with the forest seed orchards of enhanced genetic value (of 1.5 and 2nd generation). By the middle of the 21st century, the productivity of new artificial stands is expected to increase by 20-25 % in terms of stem wood stock due to breeding work. Successful and quite large-scale works were undertaken in plus trees phenotypic breeding and forest seed orchards (1st generation) planting in some regions of European Russia in the last third of the 20th century. However, even this first (primary) cycle of plus-tree breeding has not been fully completed. The latter makes it possible to lay out the necessary areas of multiplicative populations of increased genetic value - forest seed orchards of the 1.5 generation. Although this is impossible to achieve in many subjects of the Northwestern Federal District due to the insufficient number of selected plus trees and, most importantly, the extremely small area of progeny tests. At present, the vast majority of initially selected plus trees were not genetically tested, which hinders the possibility of further development of the plus-tree breeding system. Russia also lacks special breeding zoning of the main forest-forming species, providing a spatial organization of breeding work and the use of seeds from forest seed orchards. A federal program for the preservation and sustainable management of forest genetic resources of the Russian Federation, together with a number of subprograms for genetic research and breeding of the most important forest-forming species, should be developed to achieve progress in this direction, considering current advances in molecular genetics and biotechnology.

AB  - This paper, by highlighting the experiences and reflections of experts and practitioners, aims to increase knowledge of how social impact assessment is managed and handled at various stages of the planning process in major infrastructure investments in Sweden. Interviews were conducted with nine experts and practitioners working with issues of transport planning and social sustainability. The informants represent the national and regional level and three established consultancies. The results largely confirm earlier research, and the area of social impacts assessment in transport planning in Sweden can be seen as being fragmented. Many fundamental issues in the field remain to be addressed for future development, including issues such as public procurement, the role (and competence) of the client, the role (and competence) of the practitioner, how SIA should be included in the whole planning process taking into account the different stages (including how the SIA should be documented, delivered and monitored), how methods should be managed and included, and how the genuine experts should be included, i.e. those living and working in the affected areas.

AB  - This paper presents insights from a six-month field operational test (FOT) in Gothenburg, Sweden, during which 195 participants tested the UbiGo mobility service for everyday travel. The service integrated both public and private solutions into a new type of collective transport and thereby contributed to Swedish societal goals of a reduction of private car use and ownership. A triangulation approach to data sources and collection methods was adopted to identify matches and mismatches between the expectations and experiences of three stakeholder groups: users (FOT participants customers), commercial actors (mobility broker and service providers), and society. Identified matches included the concept of a transportation smorgasbord, reduced private car ownership, and increased pretrip planning. Identified mismatches related to the greater than expected reduction in car use, the respective business models of the mobility broker and service providers, back-office administration, and the smartphone platform. Gaps included the infeasibility of some trips and the need for more carsharing sites. The FOT was successful, with 93% of participants satisfied with their travel and 97% wanting to continue using UbiGo. However, before a commercially viable mobility service can be created, the mismatches and gaps need to be resolved or at least deliberated. The conclusion is that to create integrated solutions, truly collective transport must involve close cooperation between public and private actors and the consideration of at least the three, sometimes conflicting, stakeholder perspectives. Furthermore, new business models are needed to address the challenges associated with future integrated urban mobility solutions.

AB  - Increased demand on forests to produce renewable biomass have accelerated the use of non-native tree species in forestry worldwide, often with negative effects on native biodiversity. In Sweden, the North American lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex. Loudon var. latifolia) was introduced already in the 1970's. Even though the species now covers large areas, effects on native flora and fauna have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, we used a large-scale field experiment with 30 paired P. contorta and P. sylvestris stands in central and northern Sweden to study the effects of P. contorta plantation on the abundance and activity of red wood ants of the Formica rufa-group, density and species richness of other ant species, as well as possible effects on the abundance of the specialized ant predator Pella humeralis. We collected epigaeic insects with pit fall traps, surveyed wood ant mound density and volume, and monitored ant activity on trees in all stands. Our analyses revealed a trend with higher mound density in P. sylvestris compared with P. contorta stands, although wood ant worker catch did not differ between the pine species. However, red wood ant activity was significantly higher in P. sylvestris stands, suggesting that P. contorta is not a preferred tree species for the tending of aphids for honeydew. Total ant species richness as well as the catch of Camponotus herculeanus and Myrmica ruginodis were higher in P. sylvestris stands, suggesting that they constitute a more favorable habitat for ants. Ant species richness was negatively influenced by wood ants in P. sylvestris stands only. A similar pattern was shown for C. herculeanus. Myrmica ruginodis was more abundant in P. sylvestris stands only if no thinning had been applied. Wood ant catch was positively correlated with catch of the specialized predatory rove beetle Pella humeralis showing that there is a strong interaction between the predatory beetle and wood ants.Our results suggest that P. contorta plantations impact both red wood ants and associated species and although competition from wood ants is more pronounced in P. sylvestris stands they still constitute a more favorable habitat for most ant species. Thus, large scale plantation of the non-native but closely related P. contorta may negatively impact epigaeic assemblages, a pattern that is not compensated by released competition by dominant red wood ants.

AB  - The hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) colonised Turku and Helsinki, two cities in southern Finland, in the first half of the 20th century as a breeding species. Their urban population densities, however, remained low for decades, in spite of considerable changes in the urban environment. Since the 1960s, the breeding populations have increased very rapidly in both cities. The possible causes of the early colonisation of cities, the long period of low population density, and the recent rapid population increases are discussed based on environmental history data. The establishment of city parks in the 19th century was probably a prerequisite for initial colonisation, although it cannot alone explain the timing of colonisation. Hooded crow populations did not increase before the 1960s, although biological waste production increased considerably and large landfills were continuously available near both cities. In Turku, the rapid increase of the crow population took place after the availability of biological waste in the main landfill had decreased due to opening of a municipal waste incinerator. Suitable habitats created by urban expansion and a lack of predators in cities during the breeding season may have promoted urbanisation. The main factor promoting urban population growth has probably been decreased persecution in cities since the 1960s. Low levels of persecution in urban areas have facilitated the habituation of crows to humans and traffic, and probably explain the recent colonisation of city centres as breeding habitats.

AB  - Many studies worldwide have emphasized the need to map the potential of commercial ports to function as receiver and donor areas for nonindigenous species (NIS). In this study, the macroinvertebrate composition of hard and soft sea bottoms, hydrographical conditions, and traffic connections of four Finnish coastal harbours (Naantali, Koverhar, Porvoo, Hamina) were investigated and compared with 'natural' reference areas lacking anthropogenic constructions. The harbours hosted macroinvertebrate communities fairly similar to those found in adjacent reference areas, but sediment community diversity was slightly higher in harbour basins relative to in surrounding areas. A total of eight NIS were registered in the study. With regard to hydrography, NIS that tolerate low salinities, low temperatures and eutrophic conditions are most likely to survive local conditions and hence pose a potential risk for larger areas of the Baltic Sea. A ship traffic analysis revealed that the most important donor and recipient areas of ballast water to and from the study harbours are coastal harbours of other parts of the Baltic Sea and of the North Sea. Some suggestions are made for future harbour surveys along the Finnish coast.

AB  - In the essay, "Necropolitics', Achille Mbembe attends to the contemporary subjugation of life to the power of death - exceptional violence that exceeds the biopolitical aim of fostering life - thus alluding to a state of emergency in which law is suspended and martial rule is brought into force. However, as several commentators have suggested, exceptional politics does not need to be legitimized by a declared state of emergency, such as in cases where governmental and non-governmental actors are vested with powers to take strong measures against specific urban sub-populations in the name of security or order maintenance. Still, even these reworked and expanded approaches to death-politics revolve around sovereign exceptionality and the accompanying fabrication of undesirable "others'. Somewhat counterintuitively, the present article advances an analysis of racialized security politics issuing from the breakdown of representational, topographical boundaries between "inside' and "outside', "us' and "others'. Illustrated by a case from Malmo, Sweden, it urges greater attention to how necropolitics could operate entirely outside the trope of emergency as exception. The principal argument is that urban security politics, when operating within the frame of resilience governance, involves distinctly different configurations of necropolitics, which require a critical-theoretical vocabulary outside the traditional framework of securitization.

AB  - This article presents a coevolutionary model of agricultural development that is based on observations from the environmental history of agriculture and the need for addressing development processes toward sustainability. It asserts that the challenge of agricultural sustainability can be fruitfully addressed within an analytical framework that consciously and explicitly considers agricultural development as consisting of processes of coevolution involving agriculture and the surrounding ecological and socioeconomic systems. Widening the processes to include strong interconnectedness with national and global systems with respect to off-farm resources and farm outputs has led to various agro-ecological problems. Strengthening local interaction and interconnectedness in a rural-urban context is found to be essential for developing a system of sustainable agriculture. Such development requires influencing many subsystems and implementing changes in production methods and land use as short-term responses to the problem, and technological development, resource allocation and changes in values as long-term responses. It also requires some sustainability principles and indicators in order to direct actions and to facilitate communications, which can be derived from the model. Applying the model on Swedish agricultural sustainability during the twentieth century reveals some, probably, important findings for "building" sustainable agriculture and lends support to the usefulness of the model.

AB  - Varied applications of seismic interferometry have arisen in the last decade; however, the potential of the method to improve reflection seismic processing in hardrock environments has not explicitly been regarded. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the potential of retrieving the first arrivals originally hindered by high noise level in the exploitation of controlled-source data acquired over the iron-oxide apatite-rich deposit at Grangesberg (Sweden) and its mining-induced structures. The supervirtual first arrivals retrieved using interferometry methodologies allowed first breaks to be picked more extensively than in the original data. Revised static corrections significantly improved the linearity of the first arrivals and continuity of reflections in the source gathers. Especially, reflections considerably enhanced in the source gathers stacked constructively in the final section. Comparison with geological data, supported by traveltime forward modelling, indicates that these reflections represent the unmined part of the deposit. Other reflections at shallower depth are interpreted as anthropogenic faults possibly located at lithological contacts. Tomographic inversion was also run using the augmented traveltime data. The greater resolution and penetration of this new tomographic image allowed better bridging with the results of the reflection seismic section. Velocity anomalies depict the presence of mining-induced structures and a potential 'Brewery fault', which is believed to put at risks an urban area. Even though the potential of first-arrival retrieval seems to be case-dependent, this study illustrates that interferometry may substantially improve the accuracy of static corrections and subsequent stack for hardrock imaging, as well as in the penetration and resolution of traveltime tomograms.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine wellness as a means of self-branding. The phenomenon is addressed through the introduction of a new concept - wellness branding - and by identifying those wellness practices that are currently most valued. Design/methodology/approach - A series of focus group interviews were conducted in the USA and Finland. Altogether, 12 discussion sessions (N = 57) were carried out, 6 in each country.
   Findings - Both wellness and self-branding represent current forms of identity and lifestyle construction and self-promotion. Moreover, they represent an entrepreneurial view of the self, which emphasizes self-governance. The findings indicate that wellness has moved beyond the merely physical dimension, to significantly involve emotional/mental, spiritual, social and intellectual aspects. This further strengthens the transformational nature of wellness and the increasing need for balancing one's life in order to reach one's optimal self. The logic of wellness branding involves the creation of one's optimal, balanced self while communicating it to others.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper makes insightful contributions to the branding literature by broadening the scope of self-branding to a new and timely context. The paper further adds to the consumer research literature by addressing wellness as a form of transformative consumption and an essential part of the current self-care culture.
   Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to discuss self-branding in the context of wellness, introducing a new concept of wellness branding, thus offering a novel area for research.

AB  - Calls for densification of urban structure highlight questions of compensation: do residents in dense urban environment compensate for the relative lack of gardens, parks and outdoor leisure opportunities in their primary residential area by traveling to second homes or other leisure destinations? How should compensation be addressed in urban planning? In Finland the use of second homes is widespread and may be such a compensation mechanism. The compensation hypothesis has previously been explored in the context of second home ownership. This study examines compensation for the first time with respect to the actual use of second homes. Use is a more flexible variable and second home users are a larger and socio-economically more heterogeneous group than the owners. The quality of the permanent home's residential environment was assessed by four factors: building density, access to private garden, and accessibility of local and larger green areas. The impact of these residential environment variables on both second home use and ownership was analyzed by regression analysis in which the socio-economic and demographic factors were controlled. Statistical relationships were found between the residential area and second home use, which provides support for the compensation hypothesis. When building density increases or the access to a private garden is reduced, the use of second homes increases. However, accessibility to green areas does not explain use. Analysis reveals that second home use is a more valid indicator for compensation than ownership. None of the residential environment variables explain the ownership of second homes.

AB  - Freight transport is of major importance for the European economy and is growing thanks to increasing global trade. About three quarters of inland freight transport in the European Union is on roads. It has the potential to go through a dramatic change over the next decades thanks to the recent development of technologies such as wireless communication, cloud computing, sensor devices, and vehicle electronics. They enable a new integrated goods transport system based on optimized logistics, real-time traffic information, vehicular communications, collaborative driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we discuss challenges in creating a more efficient and sustainable goods road transportation system and how some of them can be tackled with a networked control approach. In particular, we discuss a method to improve the efficiency of the transportation system by minimizing the number of empty transports needed to fulfill the assignments on a given road network. Assignments with overlapping route segments might lead to further improvements, as the formation of vehicle platoons yields reduced fuel consumption. For realistic scenarios, it is shown that such collaboration opportunities arise already with relatively few vehicles. The fuel-efficient formation and control of platoons is also discussed. Some of the presented methods have been tested on real vehicles in traffic. The paper shows experimental results on automatic formation of vehicle platoons on a Swedish highway. The influence of traffic density on the merge maneuver is illustrated. The results indicate that platoon coordination could be improved by support from appropriate traffic monitoring technologies.

AB  - This article investigates if the recommendations provided in the statutory documents of the UNESCO MAB (Man and Biosphere) Programme introducing the World Network of Biosphere Reserves to follow a participatory management approach are implemented in practice. We discuss the results of two different empirical data sets: First, in a global setting we show how and why conservation professionals and managers of biosphere reserves regard participation as one of the most important success factors for management. Second, these findings are amplified by results from a comparative case study analysis of three biosphere reserves in Finland, Estonia, and Germany. Biosphere reserve centres have the potential of becoming parallel learning organisations fostering participatory management across all relevant sectors at the specific sites. Training and capacity building are necessary prerequisites for the successful application of participatory methods. Several innovative tools can be applied to involve even larger numbers of people.

AB  - In the boreal forest, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is a key species due to its many strong food web linkages and its exploitation of niches that form in the wake of human activities. Recent altitudinal range expansion and a perceived population increase have become topics of concern in Scandinavia, primarily due to the potential impacts of red foxes on both prey and competitor species. However, despite it being a common species, there is still surprisingly little knowledge about the temporal and spatial characteristics of its population dynamics. In this study, we synthesized 12 years of snow-track transect data covering a 27,000-km(2)study area to identify factors associated with red fox distribution and population dynamics. Using Bayesian hierarchical regression models, we evaluated the relationships of landscape productivity and climate gradients as well as anthropogenic subsidies with an index of red fox population size and growth rates. We found that landscapes with high human settlement density and large amounts of gut piles from moose (Alces alces) hunting were associated with higher red fox abundances. Population dynamics were characterized by direct density-dependent growth, and the structure of density dependence was best explained by the amount of agricultural land in the landscape. Population equilibrium levels increased, and populations were more stable, in areas with a higher presence of agricultural lands, whereas density-dependent population growth was more prominent in areas of low agricultural presence. We conclude that human land use is a dominant driver of red fox population dynamics in the boreal forest. We encourage further research focusing on contrasting effects of anthropogenic subsidization on predator population carrying capacities and temporal stability, and potential impacts on prey dynamics.

AB  - Due to an increasing demand of forestry products, nitrogen (N) fertilization of coniferous forests may in the future become a standard silvicultural practice in parts of the boreal region that is not too remotely situated. Beside positive effects on productivity, forest fertilization may induce changes in species composition of the ground vegetation. More information on the magnitude of such side effects is needed to evaluate whether commercial forest fertilization is in accordance with principles of sustainable forestry and preservation of biodiversity.
   We examined the effects of forest fertilization on ground vegetation in boreal forest by comparing species composition in unfertilized stands and stands fertilized twice (>20 years since the last fertilization) with 150 kg N ha(-1) per event. By using stands that had been clear-felled and replanted 8-11 years ago, we addressed whether effects of fertilization persists over more than one forest generation. The ground vegetation in fertilized stands was denser, showed decreased species evenness, lower biodiversity, and higher Ellenberg N values. The abundance of dwarf shrubs was reduced by more than 40%, while grasses and some nitrophilous herbs increased by >100%.
   For bottom layer species, fertilization favoured litter-dwelling bryophytes (e.g. Brachythecium spp.), while Hylocomium splendens and ground living lichens were disfavoured. For the dwarf shrub Vaccinium myrtillus, fertilization reduced the density of current annual shoots by >60% and berry production by >70%. Fertilization had, however, no effect on berries produced per annual shoot. Leaf tissue N concentrations were higher in V. myrtillus, and Deschampsia flexuosa growing in previously fertilized stands, indicating N enrichment although more than 20 years had past since the last fertilization event.
   Because residual effects of commercial forest fertilization on forest ground vegetation appear to be substantial and extend over more than one forest generation, we question whether forest fertilization, as performed today in the Nordic countries, can be considered a long-term sustainable silvicultural practice that is in accordance with principles of preservation of biodiversity.

AB  - With increasing power production from renewable energy sources, sub-daily variations in energy demand need to be balanced. Today, hydropower is commonly used as balancing power. In this study, we quantified the impact of capacity constraints, in terms of reservoir volume and hydropower capacity, on the potential to comply with instant energy demand. To evaluate the impact, we developed two new metrics, power market impact and system efficiency ratio, which are based on two threshold flow regimes derived from natural flow as lower threshold release and regulated flow (based on hourly energy prices) as upper threshold release. The operation support model comprises 96 different regulation scenarios based on varying combinations of hydropower and reservoir capacities. For each scenario, an hourly water balance was simulated, to obtain the highest complying with upper threshold release based on actual energy demand. We tested the framework on the Kemijoki river with defined thresholds based on the natural flow regime (tributary river Ounasjoki) and the hourly energy price in Finland in 2017, and estimated the impact of regulation on hourly flow regime at the Taivalkoski hydropower station. The annual flow regime impact in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was estimated to be 74%, 84% and 61%, respectively, while the monthly impact varied from 27% to 100%. Our framework for evaluating interactions between the power market and sub-daily regulation practices is a useful novel tool for sustainable river management and can be easily applied to different rivers and regions and evaluated for different timescales.

AB  - Translocation and introduction of non-native organisms can have major impacts on local populations and ecosystems. Nevertheless, translocations are common practices in agri- and aquaculture. Each year, millions of wild-caught wrasses are transported large distances to be used as cleaner fish for parasite control in marine salmon farms. Recently, it was documented that translocated cleaner fish are able to escape and reproduce with local wild populations. This is especially a challenge in Norway, which is the world's largest salmon producer. Here, a panel of 84 informative SNPs was developed to identify the presence of nonlocal corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) escapees and admixed individuals in wild populations in western Norway. Applying this panel to similar to 2000 individuals, escapees and hybrids were found to constitute up to 20% of the local population at the northern edge of the species' distribution. The introduction of southern genetic material at the northern edge of the species distribution range has altered the local genetic composition and could obstruct local adaptation and further range expansion. Surprisingly, in other parts of the species distribution where salmon farming is also common, few escapees and hybrids were found. Why hybridization seems to be common only in the far north is discussed in the context of demographic and transport history. However, the current lack of reporting of escapes makes it difficult to evaluate possible causes for why some aquaculture-dense areas have more escapees and hybrids than others. The results obtained in this study, and the observed high genomic divergence between the main export and import regions, puts the sustainability of mass translocation of nonlocal wild wrasse into question and suggests that the current management regime needs re-evaluation.

AB  - A new solution method to solve the even-aged stand management problem that results when biodiversity-related demands are taken into account is presented. The model was based on single-tree growth functions, the meta-heuristic optimisation technique. tabu search and greedy heuristics. The timing of thinnings and final harvest was recognised, and fixed entry cost included. Biodiversity considerations were expressed in terms of stand attribute targets for coarse woody debris, tree-size diversity and tree retention. The performance of the model was demonstrated with a case example, where the model was applied to simulated, mixed stands of Norway spruce and birch. The model was able to solve huge problems in a short time. Cost curves for the non-timber outputs are presented. The biodiversity considerations typically affected the time for final harvest, number of thinnings and thinning form. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article describes the erosion of institutions that support farmers' learning and the construction of knowledge in agriculture in an area of agricultural decline. It is based on a qualitative study in northern Sweden, exploring farmers' learning to farm, their peer networks, contacts with advisory services and their sales relationships. As farming is increasingly differentiated, with an intensification of production in some areas and increasing farmland abandonment in others, so are the institutions that support farmers' learning. Farmers handle this in different ways, and the article indicates that resourceful farmers, dependent on farm income, seek out and create contexts for learning. Others seem increasingly decoupled from advisory institutions and upstream industries, selling their produce in local networks. The article illustrates that the widening gap in agrarian production is related to a differentiation of social and institutional preconditions for the construction of knowledge in farming.

AB  - The sustainable management of phosphorus (P), an essential element for life, is currently discussed intensively in research and policy. In order to provide a data basis for national P strategies, various substance flow analyses (SFA) of P on a national level have been published in recent years. The quantification of flows and stocks helps to identify hot-spots and potentials for sustainable measures within the particular country analysed. However, the national SFAs that have been conducted so far differ with regard to their system definitions, i.e. the processes, flows and stocks identified. This makes comparisons between countries difficult, hinders the transnational transfer of lessons learnt and hampers supranational policy efforts. Therefore, we (i) develop a standardised visualisation format, i.e. a blueprint, which allows for transnational comparability and facilitates future national SFAs of P; (ii) present a systematic comparative analysis of seven European SFAs (Austria, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) using fluxes, indicators and cluster analysis; and (iii) to exemplarily show the added value of a linkage between material flow analysis and social system analysis. Our results show regional disparities with regard to losses and efficiencies of current national P use and to the potential of secondary P to increase national self-sufficiency. The countries analysed can be categorised in three clusters providing a first classification according to selected variables comprising key flows and indicators. By using the current discussion on the application of sewage sludge on agricultural land in Germany as an example, we show the added value of the integration of flow and governance.analyses.

AB  - Increased nutrient and sediment loading can affect the functioning and biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. Lacking long-term monitoring data, paleolimnological techniques enable the estimation of habitat and diversity change through time. Using these methods we assessed the effects of eutrophication on diatom community structure and species richness over the past ca. 200 years in coastal waters of the Gulf of Finland. The abundance of planktonic diatoms has increased markedly because of increased eutrophication and turbidity. The loss of benthic habitats resulted in a clear decrease in diatom species richness after a threshold of 400-600 mu g L-1 total dissolved nitrogen; no unimodal pattern between diversity and productivity was observed in our data. The urban sites displayed a marked decrease in species richness starting in the late 19th century with increased urbanization. A clear recovery was visible after the cessation of point source loading by the mid-1980s at two sites, whereas at the third site no recovery was detected because of diffuse loading from the large catchment. Changes in the rural sites were minor and did not start until the 1940s.

AB  - The Arctic tundra is currently experiencing an unprecedented combination of climate change, change in grazing pressure by large herbivores and growing human activity. Thickets of tall shrubs represent a conspicuous vegetation state in northern and temperate ecosystems, where it serves important ecological functions, including habitat for wildlife. Thickets are however labile, as tall shrubs respond rapidly to both abiotic and biotic environmental drivers. Our aim was to assess how large-scale spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent, configuration and habitat structure affected bird abundance, occupancy rates and species richness so as to provide an empirical basis for predicting the outcome of environmental change for riparian tundra bird communities. Based on a 4-year count data series, obtained through a large-scale study design in low arctic tundra in northern Norway, statistical hierarchical community models were deployed to assess relations between habitat configuration and bird species occupancy and community richness. We found that species abundance, occupancy and richness were greatly affected by willow areal extent and configuration, habitat features likely to be affected by intense ungulate browsing as well as climate warming. In sum, total species richness was maximized in large and tall willow patches of small to intermediate degree of fragmentation. These community effects were mainly driven by responses in the occupancy rates of species depending on tall willows for foraging and breeding, while species favouring other vegetation states were not affected. In light of the predicted climate driven willow shrub encroachment in riparian tundra habitats, our study predicts that many bird species would increase in abundance, and that the bird community as a whole could become enriched. Conversely, in tundra regions where overabundance of large herbivores leads to decreased areal extent, reduced height and increased fragmentation of willow thickets, bird community richness and species-specific abundance are likely to be significantly reduced.

AB  - This paper assesses the opportunities for resource- and energy-efficient biojet fuel production from forest-based biomass utilising existing industrial infrastructure in Sweden. Two categories of production pathways are considered: one including technologies that are certified for the production of biojet fuel, and the other uncertified technologies under development. Aspects included are production potential, regional balance between biomass feedstock and eligible host industries, potential demand and supply of biogas-based hydrogen for upgrading, economic incentives for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and future markets for the coproducts generated. The overall conclusion is that energy integration through the use of combined heat and power plants, sawmills and pulp mills to produce biofuel intermediates leads to a lower net demand for biomass feedstock, which can be met by the long-term sustainable potential of forestry residues and sawdust. The regional balance between the long-term, sustainable availability of forestry residues and sawdust, and the demand at eligible host industries is good where over 80% of this demand can be met by regionally produced biomass feedstock. The biofuel intermediates can then be upgraded to biojet fuel in centralised refineries connected to the gas grid in the southwest of Sweden, and with current Swedish policy tools it is economically motivated to use biogas-based hydrogen. Co-product demand will not limit commercial development since the future markets are predicted to grow when replacing fossil counterparts. Thus, current policy tools that promote biojet fuel with low life-cycle GHG emissions provide important incentives for the commercial development of resource- and energyefficient combined biojet fuel and biofuel production systems based on biomass residues and existing industrial infrastructure.

AB  - Distribution pipe biofilms can provide sites for the concentration of a wide range of microbial pathogens, thereby acting as a potential source of continual microbial exposure and furthermore can affect the aesthetic quality of water. In a joint project between Stockholm Water, the MISTRA "Sustainable Urban Water" program, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and the Royal Technical University, Stockholm, the aim of the current study was to investigate biofilms formed in an urban water distribution system, and quantify the impact of such biofilms on potential pathogen accumulation and persistence within the Greater Stockholm Area, Sweden. When used for primary disinfection, ultra-violet (UV) treatment had no measurable influence on biofilm formation within the distribution system when compared to conventional chlorination. Biofilms produced within a model pilot-plant were found to be representative to those that had formed within the larger municipal water distribution system, demonstrating the applicability of the novel pilot-plant for future studies. Polystyrene microspheres (1.0 mu m) and Salmonella bacteriophages demonstrated their ability to accumulate and persist within the model pilot-plant system, where the means of primary disinfection (UV-treatment, chlorination) had no influence on such phenomena. With the exception of aeromonads, potential pathogens and faecal indicators could not be detected within biofilms from the Stockholm water distribution system. Results from this investigation may provide information for water treatment and distribution management strategies, and fill key data gaps that presently hinder the refinement of microbial risk models.

AB  - During the past decade, Finland has been the target of a global boom in the quest for untapped mineral resources. Based on the mapped information of mineral potential provided by the state, multinational mining corporations are making reservations for and conducting mineral explorations particularly in Finland's peripheral regions. This paper investigates the emergence of an anti-mining movement in Ohcejohka, in northernmost Finland, in 2014-2015, and the ontological conflict manifested in the outside mapping of the land as "mineral rich" as well as the local people's various knowledges of the land as a lived place. By producing a holistic counter-mapping of their social, ancestral and meaningful landscape, the movement questioned the state's and the company's homogenising knowledge in the production of land and resources. While the reality making effects of modern maps have previously been studied, the entanglements of such mappings in environmental conflicts with local ontological realities and knowledge spheres have not been extensively studied. This paper argues that rather than imposing a "one world ontology", maps and mappings of land and resources are culmination points in environmental conflicts, where they become renegotiated, challenged and redefined in the local and dynamic enactments of reality.

AB  - To reduce environmental burdens from the food system, a shift towards environmentally sustainable diets is needed. In this study, the environmental impacts of the Swedish diet were benchmarked relative to global environmental boundaries suggested by the EAT-Lancet Commission. To identify local environmental concerns not captured by the global boundaries, relationships between the global EAT-Lancet variables and the national Swedish Environmental Objectives (SEOs) were analysed and additional indicators for missing aspects were identified. The results showed that the environmental impacts caused by the average Swedish diet exceeded the global boundaries for greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use and application of nutrients by two- to more than four-fold when the boundaries were scaled to per capita level. With regard to biodiversity, the impacts caused by the Swedish diet transgressed the boundary by six-fold. For freshwater use, the diet performed well within the boundary. Comparison of global and local indicators revealed that the EAT-Lancet variables covered many aspects included in the SEOs, but that these global indicators are not always of sufficiently fine resolution to capture local aspects of environmental sustainability, such as eutrophication impacts. To consider aspects and impact categories included in the SEO but not currently covered by the EAT-Lancet variables, such as chemical pollution and acidification, additional indicators and boundaries are needed. This requires better inventory data on e.g., pesticide use and improved traceability for imported foods.

AB  - Cumulative effects assessment (CEA) remains an Achilles heel in the licensing of mining projects on indigenous lands globally, but especially in the European North. Yet, rather than legislating on indigenous rights and CEA failures, governments tend to rely on companies to mitigate cumulative impacts through new corporate social responsibility actions. This paper considers if these voluntary actions improve companies' CEA performance and so provide grounds for indigenous communities and decision makers to trust the industry more. Findings are presented from a systematic review of corporate impact assessments for 56 mining concession permit applications on Sami lands in Sweden. We show how companies that adopt additional voluntary measures provide somewhat richer assessments. Overall, however, the performance remains poor also for 'frontrunners', with persistent lack of clarity on methods and limited analysis of consequences, social and cultural impacts and interactions with other (past, present or future) projects. We conclude that progress in voluntary actions in regard to assessing cumulative impacts has only led to cosmetic improvements in CEA performance. We therefore argue for stronger regulatory role of government and recognition of the right of indigenous communities to lead or co-manage impact assessments on their own lands.

AB  - Building the first planned immersed tunnel in Norway, give birth to environmental challenges different from other road projects in Norway so far. The masses that have to be removed and deposited to make space for the tunnel elements are of very different type and degree of contamination. This is due to natural conditions and prior activities in the area. Further, the chance to find boats or constructions protected by the Cultural Heritage Act is quite high in part of the area for the proposed road track. Environmental goals are set for all parts of the project and integrated in a separate environmental program The program will be followed up through an own steering system.

AB  - Waste collection is one of the life cycle phases that influence the environmental sustainability of waste management. Pneumatic waste collection systems represent a new way of arranging waste collection in densely populated urban areas. However, limited information is available on the environmental impacts of this system. In this study, we compare the environmental sustainability of conventional door-to-door waste collection with its hypothetical pneumatic alternative. Furthermore, we analyse whether the size of the hypothetical pneumatic system, or the number of waste fractions included, have an impact on the results. Environmental loads are calculated for a hypothetical pneumatic waste collection system modelled on an existing dense urban area in Helsinki, Finland, and the results are compared to those of the prevailing, container-based, door-to-door waste collection system. The evaluation method used is the life-cycle inventory (LCI). In this study, we report the atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), SO2 and NOx. The results indicate that replacing the prevailing system with stationary pneumatic waste collection in an existing urban infrastructure would increase total air emissions. Locally, in the waste collection area, emissions would nonetheless diminish, as collection traffic decreases. While the electricity consumption of the hypothetical pneumatic system and the origin of electricity have a significant bearing on the results, emissions due to manufacturing the system's components prove decisive.

AB  - The total network of Finnish forest roads has increased from a few hundred km in 1950 to currently over 120,000 kin, but the ecological consequences of that process on invertebrates are poorly understood. I pitfall-trapped carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at roadsides and in adjacent forests along six forest roads in Finland. I carried out two studies oil whether roads function as obstacles to the movement of forest carabids, or dispersal corridors for generalist and open-habitat species. In addition to these two studies, I compiled carabid observations from national entomologists to get an overview on carabid richness and on life-history traits associated with roadside carabids. A forest carabid Calathus micropterus (Duftschmid) was less abundant on the roadsides, compared to the adjacent forests. However, species richness and the abundance of a habitat generalist Pterostichus niger (Schaller) showed the opposite, and open-habitat species were solely caught on the roadsides. At the roadsides, generalists decreased in abundance with increasing distance to the nearest large open-habitat area along the road. This result may indicate that roadsides are dispersal corridors and/or "sink" habitat for these carabids. I did not detect such a trend for open-habitat species, which may indicate that roadsides are habitats, not just dispersal corridors for these carabids. Multivariate Regression Trees showed that the roadside and forest carabid assemblages were different. Forest type played a key role in shaping carabid assemblages of forests, whereas roadside carabid assemblages were mostly affected by factors related to lighting conditions (road width, proximity of open habitat, and compass direction). I caught several forest carabids between the ruts of forest roads, indicating that these beetles frequently cross forest roads. The 97 carabid species found by Finnish entomologists from different kinds of roadsides, reported here, indicate that roadsides host rich carabid assemblages of relatively common species mostly associated with open and man-made habitats.

AB  - Understanding how changes in the sizes of large carnivore populations affect the attitudes of the public is vital in order to mitigate social conflicts over large carnivore management issues. Using data from two Swedish postal surveys in 2004 and 2009, we examined the probable social effects of a continued increase in the Swedish populations of bear and wolf by comparing levels of direct experience of bears and wolves with public attitudes towards these animals. We report an increase in direct experience of bears and wolves, lower levels of acceptance of the existence of these animals, and a lower degree of support for the policy goals of both species in 2009 compared to 2004. We also find that these changes are more prominent in areas with local carnivore populations than in other areas of Sweden. Our results imply that attitudes towards bears and wolves are likely to become more negative as populations continue to grow. The uneven distributions of the carnivore populations are likely to generate more frequent social conflicts in the future as they could cause an increase in the attitudinal divide between those members of the Swedish public who have had direct experiences of carnivores and those who have not.

AB  - The results of atmospheric deposition of trace elements in a 2015 moss survey in Georgia are reported. The 36 moss samples were collected in different regions of the Caucasus in compliance with the UNECE ICP Vegetation guidelines. Elemental determination was carried out by epithermal neutron activation analysis (ENAA). For the first time, 47 elements were determined for the sampled areas. The scanning electron microscopy with x-ray energy-dispersive analysis was applied to examine the origin of atmospheric particles accumulated by mosses. Microanalysis of moss samples collected in the highlands of Georgia showed the presence of clastic, anthropogenic, and cosmic dust particles. Comparison of the determined values with corresponding data from a pristine area of Norway was carried out. Multivariate statistical analysis of the results obtained was used to identify and characterize pollution sources in the sampled areas of Georgia. Elevated levels of heavy metals were revealed in Western Georgia, where many industrial mining enterprises and high-traffic roads are located.

AB  - Increasing bioenergy production from forest harvest residues decreases litter input to the soil and can thus reduce the carbon stock and sink of forests. This effect may negate greenhouse gas savings obtained by using bioenergy. We used a spatially explicit modelling framework to assess the reduction in the forest litter and soil carbon stocks across Europe, assuming that a sustainable potential of bioenergy from forest harvest residues is taken into use. The forest harvest residue removal reduced the carbon stocks of litter and soil on average by 3% over the period from 2016 to 2100. The reduction was small compared to the size of the carbon stocks but significant in comparison to the amount of energy produced from the residues. As a result of these land-use-related emissions, bioenergy production from forest harvest residues would need to be continued for 60-80years to achieve a 60% carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction in heat and power generation compared to the fossil fuels it replaces in most European countries. The emission reductions achieved and their timings varied among countries because of differences in the litter and soil carbon loss. Our results show that extending the current sustainability requirements for bioliquids and biofuels to solid bioenergy does not guarantee efficient reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the short-term. In the longer-term, bioenergy from forest harvest residues may pave the way to low-emission energy systems.

AB  - This article aims to understand how the introduction of blue-green solutions affects ethical concerns and expectations of an urban environment. Blue-green solutions are complementary technical solutions, introduced into urban water management, in order to deal with the impact of urbanisation and climate change. These kinds of solutions establish new affordances that have an impact on everyday life in the urban environment. This article describes how blue-green solutions become part of urban settings and how they influence the inhabitant's perceptions, desires and matters of care concerning these settings. The article examines the interplay between blue-green technologies and the social, material and cultural context in the Augustenborg district in Mailing, Sweden. The study is based on the analysis of free-text answers to a questionnaire aimed to collect information about the interaction between blue-green solutions and everyday life in public spaces. By exploring the inhabitants' point of view, the article then seeks to recognise the meanings and thoughts entangled with place concerning different types of blue-green solutions. We summarise the main concerns raised by the inhabitants and discuss how the implementation of blue-green solutions relates to the transformation of everyday ethicalities and matters of concern relating to the neighbourhood. We conclude that blue-green infrastructure seems to come with a new kind of sensitivity, as well as with an intensification of concerns, in an existing urban environment. This has important social repercussions, which also makes it important to study the social role and implications of blue-green technologies further.

AB  - Impacts of anthropogenic activities on coastal seabirds might be extensive, especially in the breeding season. Identifying important foraging areas and associated habitats is important for a proper management of seabirds. To identify habitat characteristics driving the selection of foraging sites of breeding European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis, this study used tracking data (GPS- and TDR-loggers), from 282 individual birds comprising 905 foraging trips and 27,303 dives with known locations, to create habitat selection models. To explore possible effects of regional differences in habitat on foraging behavior, the study was performed at two Norwegian colonies, Sklinna in the Norwegian Sea (65 degrees N, 11 degrees E) and Hornoya in the Barents Sea (70 degrees N, 31 degrees E), with distinct differences in seascape structure and habitat availability. Shags at Sklinna foraged further away from the colony than those at Hornoya but diving depth and duration were similar at the two colonies. In both colonies, sea depth was an important predictor of habitats selected by chick-rearing shags during foraging, with birds preferring shallow depths. At Sklinna, shags also selected for flat areas with high probability of kelp forest occurrence. There was no difference in trip length and duration between sexes, but males dived deeper than females in both colonies. This suggests that males and females might utilize different microhabitats within the same foraging area. The study discusses the application of habitat selection modeling to identify important foraging areas for coastal seabirds, and how this may contribute to the management, conservation and assessment of impacts of human activities.

AB  - The objective of this pilot study was to compare resource use in a mountainous summer farming landscape between old and modern dairy cow breeds during a five-day period. The modern breed used a larger part of the landscape than the old breed, most likely due to differences in habitat patterns. The old breed group preferred semi-natural pastures, while the modern breed preferred overgrown semi-natural meadows, intermediate fen, intermediate wooded fen, and grass-rich sub-alpine birch woodland. Both breeds spent most time grazing grasses, but the modern breed showed a higher frequency of grasses and Vaccinium myrtillus in its diet, while the old breed showed a higher frequency of bushes and trees. The pilot study shows some trends supplementing and strengthening earlier results on how modern and traditional cattle breeds are differing in their impact on vegetation based on their use of space and their different diets.

AB  - Context: Agile methods in offshored projects have become increasingly popular. Yet, many companies have found that the use of agile methods in coordination with companies located outside the regions of early agile adopters remains challenging. India has received particular attention as the leading destination of offshoring contracts due to significant cultural differences between sides of such contracts. Alarming differences are primarily rooted in the hierarchical business culture of Indian organizations and related command-and-control management behavior styles. Objective: In this study, we attempt to understand whether cultural barriers persist in distributed projects in which Indian engineers work with a more empowering Swedish management, and if so, how to overcome them. The present work is an invited extension of a conference paper. Method: We performed a multiple-case study in a mature agile company located in Sweden and a more hierarchical Indian vendor. We collected data from five group interviews with a total of 34 participants and five workshops with 96 participants in five distributed DevOps teams, including 36 Indian members, whose preferred behavior in different situations we surveyed. Results: We identified twelve cultural barriers, six of which were classified as impediments to agile software development practices, and report on the manifestation of these barriers in five DevOps teams. Finally, we put forward recommendations to overcome the identified barriers and emphasize the importance of cultural training, especially when onboarding new team members. Conclusions: Our findings confirm previously reported behaviors rooted in cultural differences that impede the adoption of agile approaches in offshore collaborations, and identify new barriers not previously reported. In contrast to the existing opinion that cultural characteristics are rigid and unchanging, we found that some barriers present at the beginning of the studied collaboration disappeared over time. Many offshore members reported behaving similarly to their onshore colleagues.

AB  - This research provides new evidence on factors associated with the use of four different shared mobility options - bike-sharing, e-scooter sharing, car-sharing, and ridehailing (Uber) - in the same urban region. Factors examined are sociodemographic characteristics, concern about climate change, access to a private car, and built envi-ronment characteristics of users' residential locations. The analyses are based on survey and GIS-measured, individual-level geospatial data from Oslo and its surrounding Viken county in Norway. Findings suggest that bike-sharing users are more likely to be younger, men, single, concerned about climate change, and living in denser neighborhoods with good access to public transport. E-scooter sharing users are more likely to be younger, men, without disabilities, and less educated, and live in denser neighborhoods. Car-sharing users are more likely to be living with a partner or spouse and children, not have access to a private car, and live in transit-oriented neighborhoods. Uber users are more likely to be younger and less educated, have higher incomes, be less worried about climate change, and live in proximity to the city center. These outcomes offer input for critical issues of urban and transport planning including compact urban form, sustainable mobility, and transport equity.

AB  - The existing cultural heritage mapping in Norway is incomplete. Some selected areas are mapped well, while the majority of areas only contain chance discoveries, often with bad positional accuracy. The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns.
   A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for 'Simple Faster R-CNN' was downloaded from Github.
   On 737 test images (16.6 km(2)) not seen during training, 87 % of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 % of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m x 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km(2) area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 % of the true grave mounds, with 89 % false positives. On a 937 km(2) area covering Ovre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 % of the charcoal kilns, with 38 % false positives.
   In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated response of abiotic and biotic factors to the acidification process in littoral communities in Swedish forest lakes. In structuring the acidified community three major forces can be recognized. Firstly, abiotic variation, including changed water chemistry and habitat structure, has a strong impact on all trophic levels. Low pH and increased toxicity of metals, especially aluminum, are ultimate causes of the extinction and succession of species during acidification. In the acidified community, the abiotic factors affect both the top-down and bottom-up forces, and changes can be triggered at all trophic levels. The second force structuring the community is a bottom-up effect caused by reduced nutrient cycling and a shift in plant heterogeneity. This shift, mainly resulting from a shift in the CO  2-system of the water and increased water transparency, enhances the biomass of primary producers, e.g. Sphagnum and Juncus, and alters habitat heterogeneity in higher trophic levels. The third force structuring the acid community is atop-down effect; the loss of the fourth link in the food chain (fish) alters the impact on the third trophic level. From being mainly regulated by predation from fish, the heterogeneity of the third level will be regulated by abiotic variation and competition in the acid state. This effect cascades down the food web, and the second trophic level, the herbivores, will now be preyed upon by invertebrates instead of fish.

AB  - The meiofauna was studied from springs in Finland which was completely ice-covered during the last glacial epoch. Of the 31 springs that were examined, 15 were in areas considered to be in a natural state and 16 had catchment areas subject to anthropogenic disturbance from one of four sources: agriculture, inhabitation, gravel extraction or winter road de-icing with NaCl. The taxa recorded were a mixture of those already described from epigeic waters or groundwaters and some which may be regarded as characteristic of springs. Statistical analysis revealed differences in the meiofaunal taxa in relation to the water quality or catchment area variables. Of the major meiofaunal groups the nematodes favoured springs influenced by agriculture, oligochaetes were most tolerant of road de-icing, cladocerans and copepods preferred springs in a natural state, ostracods could withstand the influence of road de-icing and gravel extraction, whilst dipteran larvae could withstand the influence of agriculture. Oligochaetes comprised 13.4% of meiofaunal numbers. The most abundant species was Aeolosoma quaternarium, which was most numerous in springs in a natural state, while Dero digitata preferred eutrophic conditions. Harpacticoids comprised 14.1% of individuals and clearly preferred a natural state, Bryocamptus echinatus and Moraria brevipes being the most abundant species. Ostracods, of which the most abundant species was Potamocypris pallida, were the most numerous animal group, constituting 21% of the meiofaunal population, and their numbers were greatest in springs influenced by road de-icing or gravel extraction. Dipteran larvae, of which the majority were chironomids, comprised 14.9% of individuals. The ostracods Potamocypris pallida and three species of Candona and the harpacticoid Bryocamptus cuspidatus are new records for Finland.

AB  - Measurements of primary productivity and its heterogeneity based on satellite images can provide useful estimates of species richness and distribution patterns. However, species richness at a given site may depend not only on local habitat quality and productivity but also on the characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In this study we investigated whether the predictions of species richness of plant families in northern boreal landscape in Finland can be improved by incorporating greenness information from the surrounding landscape, as derived from remotely sensed data (mean, maximum, standard deviation and range values of NDVI derived from Landsat ETM), into local greenness models. Using plant species richness data of 28 plant families from 440 grid cells of 25 ha in size, generalized additive models (GAMs) were fitted into three different sets of explanatory variables: (1) local greenness only, (2) landscape greenness only, and (3) combined local and landscape greenness. The derived richness-greenness relationships were mainly unimodal or positively increasing but varied between different plant families, and depended also on whether greenness was measured as mean or maximum greenness. Incorporation of landscape level greenness variables improved significantly both the explanatory power and cross-validation statistics of the models including only local greenness variables. Landscape greenness information derived from remote sensing data integrated with local information has thus the potentiality to improve predictive assessments of species richness over extensive and inaccessible areas, especially in high-latitude landscapes. Overall, the significant relationship between plants and surrounding landscape quality detected here suggests that landscape factors should be considered in preserving species richness of boreal environments, as well as in conservation planning for biodiversity in other environments.

AB  - Ulmus laevis is mainly distributed in Central and Eastern Europe. The present study took place in Southern Denmark, which together with southern Sweden and Finland, is the Northern range of the species distribution area. The study site (Krenkerup Haveskov) is the only presumed natural continuous population of U. laevis in Denmark. The forest is a part of a formerly larger carr forest. Scattered trees (U. laevis) are found in nearby woods. With seven polymorphic microsatellite loci, we revealed a fairly low genetic diversity in the parental generation with 2-7 alleles per locus and average gene diversity (H (e)) = 0.5. There were no signs of a recent population decrease in U. laevis from Denmark. In contrast, the only known larger population of U. laevis from the Netherlands showed significant genetic signals of a recent bottleneck. The outcrossing rate was not significantly different from 1, indicating absence of self-pollination. Gene flow was found between the continuous population and trees in the nearby woods. We found significant spatial genetic structure which may be due to short dispersal distances of the winged fruits of U. laevis. Due to the low genetic diversity, the strong spatial genetic structure and the outcrossing nature of the species, it may be especially vulnerable to size reductions.

AB  - Making cities more sustainable is high on the agenda in many countries, but a major challenge is the identification of which actors should contribute, and how. This paper departs from an assumption that visions may guide urban development work, and examines and compares national and local governments' visions of future sustainable cities in Norway. The case study is the urban multilevel governance program 'Cities of the Future'. Previous literature on urban sustainability and multilevel governance stresses the importance of shared visions and goals between stake-holders. However, the paper finds that, in the context under investigation, visions were partially dis-aligned between national and local stakeholders. Nevertheless, participants from both national and local governments considered the Cities of the Future program as successful. This was especially due to the learning networks facilitated by the program. The paper critically discusses the assumption of alignment and suggests a shift of attention from the content of vision to the processes of vision making. By this, we may understand visions as possible trading zones for the negotiation of future directions in urban sustainability.

AB  - This paper presents results from a multidisciplinary study of a negotiation process between farmers and wildlife authorities which led to an agricultural subsidy scheme to alleviate conflicts between agriculture and geese in Norway. The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased considerably over the last decades and conflicts with farmers have escalated, especially at stopover sites in spring when geese feed on newly sprouted pasture grass. In Vesteralen, an important stopover site for geese in North Norway, farmers deployed scaring of geese at varying intensity dependent on the level of conflict during 1988-2012. We assessed the efficiency of a subsidy scheme established in 2006, in terms of its conflict mitigation, reflected in a near discontinuation of scaring activities. The presence of pink-footed geese was analysed in relation to scaring intensity, the total goose population size and the increasing occurrence of another goose species, the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis. Scaring significantly affected the number of geese staging in Vesteralen, both in absolute and relative terms (controlling for total population size). The geese responded immediately to an increased, and reduced, level of scaring. Despite the establishment of the subsidy scheme, the number of pink-footed geese has recently declined which is probably caused by the increasing number of barnacle geese. For the farmers, the subsidy scheme provides funding that reduces the economic costs caused by the geese. Sustaining a low level of conflict will require close monitoring, dialogue and adaptation of the subsidy scheme to cater for changes in goose population dynamics.

AB  - Management of the fisheries for non-human consumption species in the North Sea has become increasingly politicised, with a growing number of stakeholders seeking influence over the decision-making process. In relation to management of the sand eel and Norway pout fisheries, two different issues are discussed. Conservationists and fishermen targeting fish for human consumption argue that particularly the sand eel fishery is reducing the forage for sea birds and other fish stocks. In the Norway pout fishery, the clash of interest is a classic example of a conflict within fisheries (national or international) due to large by-catch of primarily haddock and whiting. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been applied to evaluate the preference of the various stakeholders for management of these fisheries. The AHP was undertaken through conducting a questionnaire survey supplemented with interviews among 12 stakeholders in Denmark and the UK, representing industry organisations, conservation groups, management authorities and fisheries research institutions.

AB  - Presence or absence of threatened species in samples is information that is widely used in designing and implementing conservation actions. We explored the effectiveness of beetle (Coleoptera) inventories and contribution of different sampling methods in revealing occurrences of threatened and near threatened species in boreal forests. The number of species caught using traps in a particular area proved to be a useful indicator of the representativeness of data, the relationship between total number of species and the number of threatened and near threatened species being almost exponential. Samples containing less than 200 trapped species (or 2000 individuals) are almost useless in surveying threatened and near threatened species. The probability of finding such species increases considerably when the number of trapped species exceeds 400. Window traps attached directly on the trunks of dead trees proved to be the most efficient sampling method in trapping threatened beetles, whereas many other standard methods gave relatively poor results. We suggest that the best alternative in surveying threatened species in boreal forests is a combination of intensive direct searching and trunk window traps. Finding threatened beetles with rigorous probability requires very large sample sizes, even if the most effective sampling methods are used. For example, ranking 10 boreal forest areas to be protected according to the occurrence of threatened species with some reliability may require trapping of over 100000 beetle individuals. Collecting and identifying these large samples routinely in conservation actions is not feasible, which means that shortcuts (indicators etc.) are necessary. However, a lot of good-quality inventories with appropriate sampling efforts are needed before these shortcuts can be identified and elaborated. Such inventories are also crucial for the improvement of the classification of threatened species and full assessment on how past forest management has eventually affected the biota.

AB  - This text grew out as a commentary on the article "Hydropowering sustainability transformation: policy frames on river use and restoration in Finland" (Albrecht et al. 2023) during the manuscript review process. While the article itself is a timely contribution to expanding our understanding on how rivers are framed and related to in a national context where the history of coercive 'modernization' meets an urgent demand to decarbonize, the authors' observations also invite discussion beyond the explicit scope of water governance. Considering the range of extractive and renewable resource projects that are expected to unfold across the country in response to the demands of the 'green transition', I make use of this text as an opportunity to discuss Albrecht and colleagues' (2023, 58) conclusion that "more emphasis should be placed on [...] governance that recognises the local dynamics and interactions within the social-ecological systems". I take a focus on the inseparably political, affective and situated nature of all resource-related developments and debates, which all pose their unique challenges for translating the idea(l)s of locally aware environmental and resource governance frameworks into practice.

AB  - We argue that there is scholarly potential in linking theory on industry clusters with theory on value networks. To date, these two theoretical streams have developed largely in parallel, limiting understanding of how the two are integrated in practice. By considering these theories in combination and the unique context of creative industries, we generate insight on the management of clusters as value networks. Our ongoing longitudinal empirical case is a new media cluster called 'Mediapolis' in the city of Tampere, Finland. The case study commenced at the time the cluster was in the planning and early operational stage. Results demonstrate the usefulness of linking the two theories, and support a future research agenda examining the types of cluster configurations meeting the criteria of value networks, and the conditions under which value network cluster configurations are more sustainable than simply a spatial agglomeration of clusters.

AB  - In the last decades, the structural and functional role of standing dead trees and lying deadwood in forests has been widely recognized by scientific community and forest managers. However, a large amount of deadwood in forests can have negative impacts on recreational forests by reducing the aesthetic value and site attractiveness. The aims of the present study are to investigate whether deadwood in forests is truly perceived negatively by people and whether socio-demographic characteristics influence the respondents' perception. To achieve these aims, the study was implemented by submitting an online questionnaire to a sample of 1292 Italian citizens. The results show that 73.4% of respondents have previous knowledge of the concept of deadwood in forests, while 26.6% have never heard this concept. For most of the respondents, standing dead trees and lying deadwood have a negative aesthetic effect on the landscape (52.2% and 42.9%), while for only 7.5% and 23.0% of respondents standing dead trees and lying deadwood have a positive effect on forest landscape. The results show that for all six forest stands proposed (Old European beech coppice, Mediterranean maquis, Norway spruce high forest, simple sweet Chestnut coppice, European beech high forest, black pine high forest) the respondents prefer the situation without deadwood. Finally, the results show that deadwood - both standing dead trees and lying deadwood - in forests is on average more appreciated by male (rather than female), young people (rather than old people), and people with a low level of education (rather than people with a high level of education).

AB  - We studied the floristic composition in the pastures of the Southern Alps (Trento Province, Italy). One hundred and five plots in seven different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2) montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5) calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures. Forward selection and variation partitioning were applied to identify the most important factors controlling the species composition and plant traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main environmental filters: climate, resource availability, and grazing pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect. Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature, soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type - soil pH. Our results confirm the importance of taking the effects of climate and resource availability into account when describing plant and community functions of grasslands.

AB  - Urban development bestows a great opportunity to increase sustainability in the built environment as cities are responsible for the majority of environmental impacts. However, the urban development process is fragmented and sub-optimization leads to unsustainable life cycle outcomes. The purpose of this study is to examine the urban development process from a life cycle perspective and identify how different actors understand life cycle management. By utilizing an inductive qualitative research design, 38 in-depth thematic interviews were conducted within the Finnish urban development industry including a case study and independent interviews from different phases of the urban development life cycle. The theoretical perspective is a combination of the ecosystem construct and life cycle management. Results show that there is no clear responsible actor for life cycle management in urban development. All actors claim that there is value to be added, mostly in economic, but also environmental and social terms. This study reveals that investors should be the responsible actor in the urban development process. By claiming responsibility and focusing on life cycle leadership we can improve sustainability in urban development, and respond to the urban sustainability challenge, thus improving the quality of life and welfare in our urban society.

AB  - Energy conservation in the passenger transport sector of cities is an important policy matter. There is a long history of transport energy conservation, dating back to the first global oil crisis in 1973-1974, the importance and significance of which is explained briefly in this paper. Detailed empirical data on private and public passenger transport energy use are provided for Sweden's ten largest cities in 2015 (Stockholm, Goteborg, Malmo, Linkoping, Helsingborg, Uppsala, Jonkoping, orebro, Vasteras and Umea), as well as Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, which is a benchmark small city, well-known globally for its sustainability credentials, including mobility. These data on per capita energy use in private and public transport, as well as consumption rates per vehicle kilometer and passenger kilometer for every mode in each Swedish city and Freiburg, are compared with each other and with comprehensive earlier data on a large sample of US, Australian, Canadian, European and Asian cities. Swedish cities are found to have similar levels of per capita car use and energy use in private transport as those found in other European cities, but in the context of significantly lower densities. Possible reasons for the observed Swedish patterns are explored through detailed data on their land use, public and private transport infrastructure, and service and mobility characteristics. Relative to their comparatively low densities, Swedish cities are found to have healthy levels of public transport provision, relatively good public transport usage and very healthy levels of walking and cycling, all of which help to contribute to their moderate car use and energy use.

AB  - Large herbivores can have large impacts on their habitats through extensive browsing. Similarly, human actions can have large impacts both on habitats and on the animals utilizing the habitats. In Finland, the increase in clear-cut areas has been highly positive for moose in particular, because these areas provide an easy and abundant source of winter food. For the forest owners, moose browsing causes growth and quality losses or even the destruction of whole stand. We aimed to identify moose browsing damage from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and to predict damaged areas. The data was used to detect the difference in forest structure caused by moose browsing (lost branches and twigs) in relation to reference areas without moose browsing. The damaged areas were located, measured, and confirmed by forestry professionals, and ALS data was collected after the damage. In the end, the structural differences that browsing caused proved to be clear enough to be detected with metrics calculated from ALS data. Many variables were significantly different between the damage and no-damage areas. With logistic regression, we were able to differentiate the areas with significant, large-scale damage from no-damage areas with a 76% accuracy. However, the model was too keen to predict false-positive cases (classifying no-damage areas as damaged). It was shown that ALS data can be used in detecting moose browsing damage in a case where the damage is extremely severe (like in here). Yet, to make the results more accurate, better field data about the damaged areas would be needed.

AB  - With the increased emission requirements in Europe over the past century the role of Integrated Passenger and Freight (IPF) transport for sustainable first- and last mile (FLM) transport have increased. IPF transport by ferry has the potential to increase sustainability in FLM transport in coastal rural areas. A literature review followed by a single case study was conducted to examine six core elements of IPF transport by ferry for improvement of environmental, economic, and social- sustainable FLM transport in a Swedish coastal rural areas. In addition to the literature review, empirical data was collected from a total of 346 semi-structured interviews with passengers (i.e., visitors, tourists, residents), goods owners and policymakers, observations (at ferries, piers) and a hackathon. The study show that environmental sustainable FLM transport could be improved by increasing usage of free capacity in ferries, and improved planning of the IPF transport by ferry. The study indicate improved environmental sustainable FLM transport linked to introduction of electrical ferries for IPF transport. Economic sustainable FLM transport related to the long-term viability of IPF transport by ferry could be improved by enhanced compliance between traffic planning programs and the execution of FLM transport in coastal rural areas, and adjustment of passengers' one-way ticket fare of IPF transport. The study suggest introduction of modul-based ferries to improve economic sustainability of FLM transport based on IPF transport by ferry. To improve social sustainability of FLM transport, safety risks in IPF transport of bicycles, management of freight and passengers at piers, accessibility of passengers and goods owners at piers should be considered. The study indicate improvement of social sustainabiltility related to accessibility of passengers and goods owners at piers.

AB  - To be able to predict habitat quality and potential distribution of threatened species is key to developing successful conservation strategies for threatened species with fragmented distributions. The aim of this study was to assess factors that limit the local distribution and density ofLycaena helle, an endangered butterfly, in central Sweden, and to estimate its mobility in order to classify local populations according to their importance for the connectivity on a regional level. An additional aim was to test ifL. hellehabitat quality could be assessed using remotely-sensed data such as laser scanning (LiDAR). We derived potential predictors ofL. helleoccurrence from laser scanning data and used a resource selection function to assess their predictive power. We used a mark-recapture approach to studyL. hellemovement and estimate dispersal distances. The probability of occurrence ofL. helleincreased with higher solar irradiation and was negatively affected by sloping terrain, but the LiDAR data generally had low predictive power. Population density increased with host plant density, but this effect was weak. The mark-recapture study confirmed thatL. helleis very sedentary, with a mean movement distance of only 114 m and a maximum of 600 m. The studied population extends over a large network of interconnected linear habitats, which probably facilitates dispersal and thereby population persistence. Our study highlight the importance of a warm micro-climate and of man-made habitats like road verges and power-line corridors for the conservation ofL. helle.

AB  - In this study, due to the high contribution of the transportation sector to generate CO2 emissions, an evaluation for the best scenario of the replacement of petroleum derived fuels by renewable and sustainable alternatives was assessed with a multi collative approach suggesting the second-generation bioethanol as the most promising one. In this context, this paper focused on the practices over the past 23 years in the following four countries; Turkey, China, Sweden, and Brazil, with a comparative regression analysis between the CO2 emissions generated from the consumptions of total energy and biofuels. Accordingly, a curve-fitting and an estimation on the formation of CO2 emissions with the incrementing blends of gasoline by 3 to 100% of bioethanol was forecasted for 2020 to 2030. The outcomes of the comprehensive research indicated the international and national benefits of biofuel use, thus, promoting the potential integration of bioethanol in the Turkish transportation sector.

KW  - Speed limits

KW  - Mobility
KW  - Decision making
AB  - Background and aim In most European countries, the often difficult policy process of setting and implementing speed limits on specific roads is delegated to public administration on local and regional levels. The purpose of this paper is to describe and analyze the perspectives and priorities of regional actors, specifically planners and elected officials within public administration, concerning their everyday work in setting speed limits within a Swedish county.
   Result and discussion The analysis indicates significant conflicts among actors with regard to the priorities, politics and goals that should guide the setting of speed limits on regional and local roads. Some groups of actors support a mobility perspective that gives priority to relatively high speed limits in the interests of accessibility and mobility. This perspective is, however, in sharp contrast to the views of other actors, who share a commitment to improve traffic safety through lower speed limits, thereby adopting what can be called a traffic safety perspective. The paper concludes with a discussion of the politics and power relations among actors and their implications for our understanding of decision-making on the issue of speed limits.

AB  - The industrial service business in Finland has developed swiftly during the last two decades, mainly because of outsourcing, market openings and European Union (EU) regulations. Throughout this time, transformations in the energy, telecom and forestry industries have created a new industrial services sector. This article analysis the changes and structuring of Finnish industrial service companies, their customers and business networks. In the research methodology, the following methods were used to find out the changes and transformations in the industrial service sector: financial analysis desk studies, direct questionnaires and interviews with customers and service companies. Based on research results, a new competitive advantage framework was developed. The framework contains four main conceptual processes: (1) Critical Competence Resource Planning Model, (2) Profitable Growth Model, (3) Market Analysis and Customer Proximity Model and (4) Service Business Development Model. In this paper, we report in detail regarding our conceptualised Critical Resource Plan.

AB  - This study aims to explore the central success factors behind the growth and prosperity of festivals. In line with resource dependency theory and the model of competitive strategies, it was assumed that successful festivals both adapt to, and influence, their contexts to their own advantage while also providing benefits for their environment. A capital framework was employed to examine the relationships between a successful festival and its context, employing a case study design and multiple methods. The case chosen was Extreme Sports Week, an annual extreme sports festival at Voss, Norway, which has become the largest extreme sports event worldwide during its 10 years of existence. It brings together sports and forms of cultural expression concentrating mainly on new trends in advanced sports activities and street culture music, combined with local food traditions. Factors in its success are the six "capitals" of the region: natural, human, social, cultural, physical, and financial. The festival balances the exploitation of these capitals, although indirectly with respect to natural capital, hence constituting an example of sustainability in festival management. Interestingly, the festival was successful in spite of very limited access to local financial capital. The analysis also revealed that a seventh capital construct - administrative capital - is relevant to the understanding of festival development. However, this form of capital was the only one where investments were perceived as problematic, and the festival repaid far more than the authorities had invested in the event.

AB  - Ungulate species have experienced severe declines over the past centuries through overharvesting and habitat loss. Even if many game species have recovered thanks to strict hunting regulation, the genome-wide impacts of overharvesting are still unclear. Here, we examine the temporal and geographical differences in genome-wide diversity in moose (Alces alces) over its whole range in Sweden by sequencing 87 modern and historical genomes. We found limited impact of the 1900s near-extinction event but local variation in inbreeding and load in modern populations, as well as suggestion of a risk of future reduction in genetic diversity and gene flow. Furthermore, we found candidate genes for local adaptation, and rapid temporal allele frequency shifts involving coding genes since the 1980s, possibly due to selective harvesting. Our results highlight that genomic changes potentially impacting fitness can occur over short time scales and underline the need to track both deleterious and selectively advantageous genomic variation.
   Collection and analysis of 200 years of Swedish moose genomes reveals regional differences in genetic load, candidate regions for positive selection and an overall limited impact on human-driven bottlenecks on today's moose population.

AB  - This article examines the role of transboundary trust throughout the evolution of relations regarding the Swedish Barseback nuclear power plant, located opposite Copenhagen on the narrow straits separating Denmark and Sweden, which created cross-border tensions until its closure in 1999/2005. The article examines changes in transboundary trust in and between the actors relevant for decision-making regarding the plant, during the three phases of the conflict. It focuses on three aspects, which shaped the development of transboundary trust: first, the role played by pre-existing structures of cross-border institutional, interpersonal and ideological trust, secondly, practices of trust-building that various actors applied to maintain, enhance or rebuild transboundary trust, and thirdly, the growing discourses of mistrust and even distrust in the institutions advocating the use of nuclear power - regardless on which side of the border they were located. The article argues that changes in contemporary views on nuclear risk and the concomitant politicisation of the issue of nuclear power broadened the range of relevant actors, and contributed to changing trust relations. It suggests a mutually reinforcing interaction between interpersonal, institutional and ideological trust, and finds few differences in discourses about institutional trust between transboundary and domestic authorities. Its findings highlight the importance of productive mistrust for nuclear safety, and thus demonstrate that both trust and mistrust are important for living with, but also for limiting (nuclear) risk.

AB  - Creatively treated materials from nature transform, through technological processes and design practice, into cultural objects containing function and meaning. Views on nature, culture, and technology are gradually in a process of change and thus contribute to new practices. Multidisciplinary, innovative thinking within the Norwegian forestry industry has led to new, aesthetic experiences in nature that might influence product-design thinking. Forestry business with complex technologies has been linked in various ways to the built environment, architecture, and design. The research question of this study was: how sustainable products can be developed through an innovative combination of nature, culture, and technology in a master student project? This was illustrated through a case study of a master student's development of a lamp design. The product included semantic references to old woodworking techniques and cultural heritage, and evolved to an innovative product with commercial success. Methods used were document analysis and participatory observation. The product has contributed to a marketing strategy of corporate, social responsibility for the Forest Owners' Association. Students can get an expanded view of how design practice can be seen as an integral part of a sustainable worldview that includes both self-realisation and commercial realism. The learning outcomes from this study are related to knowledge, skills, and general competence.

AB  - The main objective of this paper is to analyze the potential goal conflict between two of Sweden's environmental objectives: Sustainable Forests and Reduced Climate Impact - or, more precisely, the conflict between forest conservation and the supply of wood fuel. To accomplish this, we use a forest sector model that includes the suppliers and major users of roundwood. The econometric results, based on a data set that spans 40 years, show that all the own price elasticities have the expected signs. Among the three forestry products, the supply and (long-term) demand of forest fuel seems to be most sensitive to a price change. In a second step, the estimated model is used to simulate the effect of increased forest conservation - the Sustainable Forest objective - on the supply of wood fuel. If oil is used as a substitute, Swedish emissions of greenhouse gases will increase by almost 0.92 percent, which indicates a clear conflict with the Reduced Climate Impact objective.

AB  - The 1992 Rio Earth Summit represented a crucial point in time at which the key role of the local level for sustainable development was importantly endorsed. However, since this UN summit, ideals about how to design local sustainable development have changed significantly. This paper investigates how local policy in ten second-rank cities in Sweden has adopted decoupling arguments and endorsed green growth concepts established through international governance communities. Using content analysis of politically ratified steering documents in these cities, the main findings suggest that local strategising related to the policy goals of green growth is mainly related to energy efficiency. Derived from the decoupling argument, one factor behind shallow integration of green growth into municipal policy is that green growth could be considered a political and contested concept. The fact that there has been limited implementation of this framework across the investigated municipalities prompts reflections on how the results could be explained by institutional match' or mismatch' between local institutional environments for policy interventions and the green growth concepts promoted by international communities. The adoption of green growth concepts requires local authorities to broaden their commitment for interventions in interactions with industry and business.

AB  - Urban forests are usually not intensively managed and may provide suitable environments for species threatened by production forestry. Thus, urban forests could have the potential of enhancing biodiversity both within cities and at a larger landscape scale. In this study, we investigated stand structures of boreal urban forests to assess them in terms of naturalness and biodiversity conservation potential. We sampled two types of urban spruce-dominated stands: random urban stands as representatives of average urban forests, and valuable urban stands known to host high polypore richness and assumed to represent urban biodiversity hotspots. Urban forests were compared to rural forests with different levels of naturalness. Living and dead trees and cut stumps were measured from all studied stands. Urban forests had generally diverse living tree structures with abundant large-diameter trees. Random urban forests had more dead wood (median 10.1 m(3) ha(-1)) than production forests (2.7 m(3) ha(-1)) but still considerably less than protected, former production forests (53.9 m(3) ha(-1)) or semi-natural forests (115.6 m(3) ha(-1)). On the other hand, valuable urban forests had relatively high median volume of dead wood (88.2 m(3) ha(-1)). We conclude that the combination of diverse stand composition and the presence of old-growth characteristics in boreal urban forests form a strong baseline from which their biodiversity value can be further developed, e.g. by leaving more fallen or cut trees to form dead wood. We propose that urban forests could become significant habitats for biodiversity conservation in the future.

AB  - The present paper reports on how green qualities as well as characteristics for well-being and recreation have been handled in a development project in Lomma Harbour north of Malmo in southern Sweden. The balancing principle of nature and landscape resources has been used to achieve a certain amount of green qualities and an efficient distribution of well-being characteristics. Two separate balancing methods were carried out in this paper, one concerning the biotopes and one concerning recreational functions. Each biotope was evaluated using a green area factor between 0-1, and then summarized to an average for the total site. This was done at the starting point and in each architect sketch. That biotope analysis forced the developer to make major improvements during the process to reach accepted levels. The recreational balancing used eight quality criteria for health and well-being developed in recent environmental perception research. The balancing was easier to achieve because the starting point of the development area was largely previous industries. After the project, the analyses are used to strengthen the marketing of the area and its new apartments.

AB  - Human perception of riverscapes with and without large wood (LW) has been investigated with a photo-questionnaire submitted to 2250 students in ten countries, capturing reactions to 20 pictures in terms of naturalness, danger, aesthetics and need for improvement. Principal component analysis performed on average scores per country per item showed that the primary discriminating factors are human modification, turbulence and extent of water shown in the scenes. Wood discriminated the perception of student groups, but other factors are also critical. Features associated with human activity (channel deepening and straightening, rip-rapping) were perceived to be less aesthetically pleasing than wood. Perception of the most dangerous riverscapes is not specifically affected by wood, but by turbulent flows and wide rivers. The presence of wood clearly discriminated the need for human intervention. Perceptions differed among countries, reflecting different cultural contexts. Students from Germany, Sweden and Oregon perceived LW more positively as a natural and wild component of watercourses. These perceptions are linked to positive attitudes towards natural riverscapes. Other students, such as those from China, Russia or India, perceived rivers with wood as needing regulation and maintenance. Whatever the socio-cultural context, large wood elicits an emotional influence on how one perceives riverscapes.

AB  - Exploring how actors translate public policy content into practice provides new insight into policy processes. Because they are driven by contextual circumstances and values, that is, they are socially constructed, studying the interpretations and negotiations involved in the translation process advances our understanding of what shapes implementation agents, and subsequently the success of policy implementation. The Swedish moose policy, a legislative framework for decentralizing moose management in order to balance the various interests affected by the presence and abundance of moose, was used as a case study. In response to the task of implementation, some of the key stakeholders sought their own strategies for successful implementation and to achieve the national policy goals. This response expressed itself as two separate agreements, in 2016 and 2019, between different constellations of implementing actors (landowner and hunter organizations). These agreements provide an example of how key actors can translate policy, and expose inadequate policy designs. Revealing how the implementing actors perceive the policy and each other helps explain the continued presence of social and political conflict. Our results indicate that power struggles underpin the translation process; by constructing the core problem differently, not sharing ideas about management and using language that discourages collaboration, the actors' translations, together with a lack of clarity in policy design, hinder the chances of successful policy implementation. Policy processes have become increasingly complex, and differences between implementers present as obstacles that have to be overcome. The paper contributes to our understanding of implementation processes within a collaborative governance setting, where the responsibility of the implementation process has been devolved to non-state actors.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable practices has become widespread in tourism and has led to the proliferation of sustainability evaluation tools. They focus mainly on measuring outcomes, making scientific expertise an essential part of evaluations. This study argues that involving stakeholders throughout the evaluation process is essential if evaluation is to play a role in promoting the necessary understanding of sustainability to address the ecological and social concerns within a tourism setting. Drawing upon multi-stakeholder thinking, ethics, the Bellagio Principles and action research, this paper introduces a theoretical and methodological framework for engaging tourism organisations in collaboration with stakeholders in planning and implementing sustainability evaluations. The application of the framework is illustrated using a study of tourism product development, involving a group of eight craft-based entrepreneurs and their stakeholders in Finnish Lapland. A focus is placed on using ethical theories to promote dialogue and critical reflection and to expose the plurality of moral orientations behind the multiple views of sustainable tourism. Through discourse analysis, four moral discourses, ethical egoism, utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics, are constructed and examined. The paper shows how each influences the various ways in which stakeholders perceive sustainable tourism and the practical outcomes of the process.

AB  - In this study, we examine the cross-cultural differences in human resource (HR) managers' beliefs in effective HR practices by surveying HR practitioners in Finland (N = 86), South Korea (N = 147), and Spain (N = 196). Similar to previous studies from the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, there are large discrepancies between HR practitioner beliefs and research findings, particularly in the area of staffing. In addition, we find that interpersonal-oriented aspects of HR practices tend to be more culturally bound than technical-oriented aspects of HR practices. We interpret the differences using Hofstede's cultural dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism versus Collectivism, Masculinity versus Femininity, Long-Term Orientation versus Short-Term Orientation, and Uncertainty Avoidance). We discuss the overall nature of the science-practice gap in HR management, and the implications for evidence-based management. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As a result of local governance, municipalities and housing developers work together to define housing development projects and to co-create value propositions. The purpose of this study is to explore how value propositions are co-created during the front-end of housing development projects and how this affects housing developers' ability to drive change and innovation. The value co-creation process is explored through interviews, documents and observations in a case study of an urban development programme in Sweden. The findings illustrate how emerging conflicts and the process of resolving them are central drivers for value co-creation between these actors. However, conflicts that are not managed and resolved constructively can lead to the co-destruction of value. In this study we illustrate how value co-creation processes that precede procurement limit the flexibility of housing developers and determine the scope for value that can be realised.

AB  - The constant increase in CO2 emissions into the global atmosphere draws the attention of researchers and policymakers to its causes. Renewable energy has grown in popularity since it is less polluting, cheaper, and more effective than traditional energy sources. This research aims to evaluate the asymmetric impact of hydropower energy consumption on environmental quality in the top-10 hydropower energy-consuming countries (China, Canada, Brazil, United States, Russia, Norway, India, Japan, Turkey, and France) by utilizing data for the years 1991 to 2018. Most previous research relied on panel data methodologies to access hydropower energy-environment nexus, neglecting the reality that certain countries have no evidence of such type of linkage individually. On the contrary, the current study employs a novel methodology called "Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ)," which can measure time-series dependence for every economy individually to give worldwide yet economy-specific insights into the asymmetric link between the variables. Except for Turkey, hydropower energy consumption considerably minimizes CO2 emissions in our sample economies at different quantiles. Moreover, the magnitude of asymmetry in the hydropower-environment nexus differs by country, needing additional care and government attention when formulating hydropower and environmental sustainability regulations.

AB  - Losses of nutrients from arable land significantly contribute to the eutrophication of lakes and coastal waters. Consequently agricultural nutrient and water management strategies have been emphasized during the last decades. The problem of excessive drainage at certain times of the year in conventional drainage systems (CD) can in many cases be overcome by implementing controlled drainage strategies (CWT). The data for this paper is based on water management projects, at both plot and field scales, which have been carried out in Southern Sweden during the period 2002 to 2005. The studies included water table strategies in which the subsoil was subjected to various degrees of water status at different times of the year by means of controlled drainage system. They were run on one site with small plots and two sites with field scale plots, and each site consisted of one CD plot and three CWT plots.
   Compared to CD, CWT had lower subsurface runoff all years of measurement. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in subsurface drainage water revealed no significant differences between CWT and CD. N and P losses, in contrast, tended to be lower in CWT than in CD, possibly due to lower runoff volumes in CWT. The yearly losses of NO3-N, Total-N, PO4-P and Total-P through the drainage system were on average 40% lower in CWT than in CD. The yield and N uptake by crops, in most measurements, were higher in CWT due to more water available during the cropping season and thereby improved N efficiency of the applied fertiliser. The results from the experiments revealed that controlled drainage has a potential to lower non-point source leaching of nutrients from agricultural land, improve N and P use efficiency and increase yields.

AB  - Pesticide losses to the environment are undesirable because of possible environmental hazards. Loss of pesticides is likely in watersheds where pesticides are used. Small constructed wetlands (CWs) in first- and second-order streams can reduce the loss of pesticides, since water-purification processes are stimulated. Four herbicides and three fungicides were applied on arable soil on two watersheds in Norway. The two CWs are situated in western and eastern Norway. The CWs cover 0.15% and 0.4% of the watershed, respectively. This study presents the pesticide retention obtained in the two CWs. All applied pesticides were found in the streams, with the highest concentrations being found immediately after spraying. The pesticides added to the watersheds decreased on average, through the whole sampling periods, from 3 to 67%. The retention increased with the size of the wetland. In many cases, the CWs reduced the peak concentrations to values regarded as non-toxic for aquatic life.

AB  - Effects of isolation, habitat size and several microhabitat variables on presence/ absence of the monophagous Bolitophagus reticulatus (L.) (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) were investigated in 58 forest fragments in an agricultural landscape (15 km(2)) in south-eastern Norway. All potential habitats of the beetle, dead Fomes fomentarius (L.) Kicks basidiocarps (n = 587), were collected from trees (n = 185) within the study area. The basidiocarps were dissected and the number of B. reticulatus specimens (larvae, pupae and adults) counted. The material was analysed at four distinguishable spatial scales: basidiocarp-, tree-, tree-group- and forest island level. Different patterns of beetle presence emerged at the different scales. Increasing habitat size and decreasing degree of isolation increased the probability of B. reticulatus presence at three (basidiocarp-, tree- and forest island level) and one (tree level) scales, respectively, whilst no such trends were found at the fourth level (tree-group level). Increasing insolation and thereby higher ambient temperatures, indicated by several microhabitat variables, improved the probability of beetle presence amongst the trees. The number of beetle specimens correlated positively with an increase in the habitat size at the tree level.

AB  - Coastal aquaculture is a globally expanding enterprise. Currently, 1200 salmon farms operate in coastal Norway, yet their capacity to aggregate and subsequently modify wild fish distributions is poorly known. Aggregations of wild fish at 9 farms and 9 control locations were counted on 3 separate days in June to August 2007. On each sampling occasion, 6 counts were made at 5 distinct depth-strata at each farm and control location. Wild fish were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude more abundant at farms than at control sites, depending on the location. Gadoid fish (Pollachius virens, Gadus morhua and Melanogrammus aeglefinus) dominated farm-associated assemblages and were present across a wide range of sizes, from juveniles to large adults. Estimated total farm-aggregated wild fish biomass averaged 10.2 metric tonnes (t) per farm across the 9 farms (range: 600 kg to 41.6 t). Applied across the geographical range of Norway's 1200 salmon farms, our estimates indicate that salmon farms attract and aggregate over 12 000 t of wild fish into a total of just 750 ha of coastal waters on any given clay in summer. Possible consequences of these persistent, substantial aggregations of wild fishes at farms include a heightened potential for the transfer of pathogens from salmon farms to wild fish and among adjacent salmon farms, and altered availability of wild fish to fisheries. Restrictions on fishing in the immediate surrounds of salmon farms may avoid farms acting as ecological traps, particularly for species with depressed populations such as G. morhua, which are highly attracted to farms.

AB  - The aquaculture industry is a main industry in Norway, and it must be sustainable, i.e. experience long-term growth and development: It is necessary to build an environmentally sustainable aquaculture industry that minimizes risks to the marine environment and biological diversity, - including the transmission of fish diseases. The process of fish disease transmission in aquaculture systems is influenced by many factors, including individual (fish and pathogen) conditions, movement behavior and environmental conditions. Fish disease dynamics originates from a complex system, and the transmission of viruses is an unstable process, making it difficult to predict and analyze. In preparation for this paper, we built an agent-based model to predict patterns of pathogen transmission with the purpose of identifying risks and hazards in the space and time domains. The model presented explores the potential effects of different factors, such as the conditions of agents, movement behavior and environmental conditions, on the simulated spread of a fish disease.
   We applied the model developed to different case studies in the Norwegian fjords. The results demonstrated how the infection risk at any point around the infected site is dependent on both the pathogen and the fish density at that point, and the infection risk increases when the pathogen or fish densities increase. The pathogen density decreases exponentially as a function of an increase in the water temperature, and the pathogen density increases with the velocity of the current or the fish density at the infected site. The pathogens are moved faster by higher current velocity, so this will slow the infection process at the local infected site. Nevertheless, the current will carry the pathogens to nearby places faster. The direction of the current is very important since the pathogens are predominantly moved by the currents.
   The agent-based method helps us advance our understanding of pathogen transmission and builds risk maps to help us reduce the spread of infectious fish diseases. By using this method, we may study the spatial and dynamic aspects of the spread of infections and address the stochastic nature of the infection process.

AB  - In Europe, many semi-open pasture woodlands with oaks (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) have been invaded by other trees. The management alternatives for such stands are often debated. Protection (i.e. no cutting) versus partial harvest to favour oak regeneration was studied in two matched plots in 25 forests in Sweden. A mast year produced on average 45,000 oak seedlings/ha in 2001. On average 26% of the tree basal area, but no large oaks, was harvested in experimental plots in the winter 2002/03. In 2005, seedling densities were on average 3,900 per ha in control plots (protected) and 11,600 in experimental plots (mainly seedlings from 2002 to 2004). Seedling survival and growth rate from 2003 to 2005 were higher in experimental than cutting plots (66% vs 44%; and +2.8 cm vs -0.8 cm, respectively). Survival and growth were positively related to canopy openness; other vegetation, pH, and oak basal area had no or little effect. Seedling height before cutting was also a positive predictor of survival. The plots contained many more intermediate and large oaks than small oak trees. The number of small oak trees (1.3 m tall to 5 cm in diameter at 1.3 m) was positively related to canopy openness, but unrelated to other measured factors. Thus, minor partial cutting increases seedling densities, and adequate light favours seedlings/small trees. When oak regeneration is important for mixed closed canopy stands with high biodiversity values, such partial cutting is useful (e.g. for CO2-neutral biofuel) but needs careful evaluation, including effects on biodiversity.

AB  - Spatial planning is relatively new term for the Baltic Sea Region (BSR). Under a pressure of globalization the European states authorities work on shaping the policies at intergovernmental cooperation level with a target of territorial policy-making and entire integration across Europe. This causes an erasure of the boundaries between the countries, replacing a number of existing instruments, ensuring coherence and simplifying assistance programming and management. A territory plays a very important role in the spatial planning, since a territory is an actual location for the interaction of the external and internal aspects. The BSR covers Russia and Byelorussia, Norway and Germany as obviously important partner areas of the traditional tight politically-economical relations with the EU's Eastern boundary. The BSR as macroregion moves towards the regional economic approach and knowledge-based economy. In the frame of a strong decentralization of the spatial planning systems the adoption and integration of knowledge from the Germanic and Scandinavian planning families are the topical issues for the new EU members of the area (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania). Regional economic planning is often directed towards stimulating commercial and industrial environment of a region.
   The results of the analysis on the current topics, trends and multidimensional modelling in the frame of the economic framework in spatial planning of the BSR are presented in the Paper. The authors rely on the created model of the industrial real estate market segment development considering the countries' resource potential by the influence of the climate change for the next 25-30 years on a sample of the Republic of Latvia. The proposed model provides significant quantitative growth of the modern industrial real estate stock. It implies making a balance and corrections for the other branches of the national economy.

AB  - The article presents two aspects of sludge management: regional planning and product recovery. The introduction of these two elements can reduce the cost, close the ecocycle and make the management more sustainable. A spreadsheet program to optimize the regional location of different facilities is presented. The simple example shows the potential of the model. The brief comparison of formal problems concerning sludge disposal in Poland and Sweden is also discussed. Requirements of phosphorus recovery and recycling of phosphorus to the phosphate industry make sludge fractionation in combination with product recovery a new development in wastewater handling. Phosphorus recovery from sludges with chemical bound phosphorus requires complex and expensive process technology and may therefore lead to increased regional sludge management with a central sludge treatment plant.

AB  - In this article, we investigate whether increased participation offers a way of addressing wicked policy problems. We utilize a natural policy experiment in the form of a 2010 reform of Swedish wildlife management policy aiming to solve longstanding conflicts over predators through increased stakeholder participation in regional Wildlife Management Boards. Using a panel study design containing quantitative and qualitative data, we estimate pre- and post-reform levels of three wickedness-reducing mechanisms: legitimacy, deliberation, and conflict intensity. Despite a substantial increase in participation, we find no evidence of reduced wickedness after the reform.

AB  - Gaining and maintaining legitimacy serves as one of the central goals for public officials for the sake of efficacy. Operating in a legitimacy deficit raises both political and economic costs as citizens lose trust in public institutions and processes hit delays and policy is ignored. For administrators tasked with resource extraction, strong incentives exist to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their activities. To do this, understanding the citizens directly affected by resource development - their values and beliefs on sustainability - aids government in accomplishing its goals with lower costs. The greater the congruence between government and citizens perspectives, the greater the legitimacy. Norrbotten and Vasterbotten, Sweden and Saskatchewan, Canada serve as the two cases in this paper. Both jurisdictions have established mining operations and, in the international context, strong regulatory frameworks. Further, during the mineral price boom, both regions saw increased foreign investment and new mine applications. Using survey data that focused on the perspective and values of residents living near potential mining operations, we look at the connection between trust in government and the acceptability of mining. Our findings indicate that trust in government holds the potential to overcome differences in values on sustainability; important for the on-going contentious debates on resource development.

AB  - Nordic agriculture must adapt to climate change to reduce vulnerability and exploit potential opportunities. Integrated assessments can identify and quantify vulnerability in order to recognize these adaptation needs. This study presents a geographic visualization approach to support the interactive assessment of agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We have identified requirements for increased transparency and reflexivity in vulnerability assessments, arguing that these can be met by geographic visualization. A conceptual framework to support the integration of geographic visualization for vulnerability assessments has been designed and applied for the development of AgroExplore, an interactive tool for assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change in Sweden. To open up the black box of composite vulnerability indices, AgroExplore enables the user to select, weight, and classify relevant indicators into sub-indices of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. This enables the exploration of underlying indicators and factors determining vulnerability in Nordic agriculture.

AB  - Purpose - The objective of this paper is to describe a corporate implementation and application of a "sustainable business cycle".
   Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a single case study of a regional producer of dairy products in Sweden. The data were collected from non-structured interviews with managers and available corporate documentation.
   Findings - The company's "sustainable business cycle" may be divided into nine stages beginning with the arable land through to the dairy and transportation of products to market, where the final two stages involve external retailers and consumers, all of which is important to fulfilment of the earlier seven internal stages.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings stress the importance of connecting and reconnecting not just to immediate environmental concerns of business, but also to planet Earth, which is under non-sustainable pressure and evidently faces an unpleasant destiny.
   Practical implications - The case highlights advantages and challenges facing a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) tasked with implementing a sustainable business cycle for a commodity product in a highly competitive market, dominated by powerful retailers.
   Social implications - Changing consumer behaviours and purchasing patterns, as well as state interventions imposed at top political levels worldwide, will gradually increase the necessity to create sustainable business cycles.
   Originality/value - The main contribution of this article is to present a rare detailed case study of a sustainable, organic milk supply chain. It highlights the areas where sustainability is effective. It also illustrates the challenge for an SME trying to extend the reach and to create awareness of added value to the consumer. Hopefully some lessons will be learned and emphasized in this case study.

AB  - In Finland, cross-country skiing is part of the cultural heritage and an important leisure activity. However. its future is uncertain as, according to climate scenarios, southern Finland will he on the boundary of the winter snow cover. Behavioral responses to change raise the question of who twill give tip skiing and who will be able to continue the activity in a changed climate. In analyzing skiing participation and frequency, this study extends the multiple hierarchy stratification perspective (MI-ISP) by showing that the socio-demographic variables gender, age, socioeconomic status and living environment have an interaction effect. The results also indicate that female gender, a lower socioeconomic status and an urban living environment are associated with a higher sensitivity to climate change.

AB  - The paper distinguishes beach wrack, the marine generated organic part of beach cast, as a separate management object and discusses research questions related to its management and economically viable use. Based on experiences from the Baltic Sea and existing practices from countries with different management systems clear distinction between the management of natural and anthropogenic components of cast material is seen as an essential prerequisite for developing sustainable product chains that allow beach wrack to be used as a resource of commercial value. Presenting and discussing examples from Denmark (Koge Municipality), Germany (Kuhlungsborn, Rugen and Poel Island), Poland (Gulf of Gdansk), Russia (Curonian and Vistula spits) and Sweden (Kalmar municipality and Oland), social, ecological, and economic consequences of beach wrack removal are analysed to improve the attractiveness of beaches for recreational purposes. It also includes potential contribution to Baltic Sea water restoration processes through the removal of the organic part of beach cast, where indeed more studies about the chemical (nutrients, metals) composition of beach wrack are required for reliable calculation of a depuration rate. For local economies within the Baltic Sea region, the organic part of beach cast (beach wrack and terrestrial debris) has reasonable economic prospects as a renewable natural resource, e.g. for soil improvement products, in fertilisers and bio-coal production, for landfill covers (contributing to climate change mitigation), biogas generation, and even for coastal protection by providing humus-like material for accelerated dune vegetation succession. For all these recycling options the development of cost-efficient technologies for collecting beach cast on sandy as well as stony beaches and also for separating the organic part from sand and anthropogenic litter (mainly plastic), is urgently required. Amendments of legal regulations, that better reflect the dualism of beach cast are also required. In essence, dualism results from the fact that beach wrack is a part of nature (or a natural resource) when it remains on a beach. However, beach wrack immediately becomes legally categorised as waste once humans collect it irrespective of its litter content. Another legal aspect being dealt with originates from the migration of the beach wrack between water and beach, whilst it is an object of epleagl cleaning operations only at the beach it onto the beach, but not whilst in the water.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic changes in boreal lakes have been studied utilizing paleolimnological methods, but the spatial variation in the natural conditions of lakes and its connection to geological factors has drawn less attention. Our aims were to examine the spatial distribution of naturally eutrophic lakes on the previously glaciated terrain of central-eastern Finland and the relationship between pre-human disturbance water quality and geological factors related to the basins and their catchments. Furthermore, we studied the pre- to post-human disturbance changes in the diatom assemblages and water quality of 48 lakes (51 sampling sites) across the pre-disturbance phosphorus gradient by using the top-bottom sampling approach and multivariate statistics. According to our results, naturally eutrophic boreal lakes are more common than previously thought, occurring on fine-grained and organic Quaternary landforms, including fine-grained till. Our study emphasizes the importance of the previously overlooked matter of till grain-size variation as a driver behind the spatial variation in the natural trophic states of boreal lakes. The location of a lake in the hydrologic landscape and basin morphology appear to be important factors as well. Shallow, naturally eutrophic lakes with short water residence times and high catchment area to lake area and volume ratios have been particularly sensitive to anthropogenic forcing. Our results indicate that cultural eutrophication is not the only water protection challenge for the relatively remote and dilute boreal lakes, but salinization and alkalinization are also serious threats that should be taken into account. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the notable variation in the natural conditions of boreal lakes in addition to mitigating the effects of anthropogenic forcing, such as nutrient loading, catchment erosion, salt pollution, and climate change, in order to achieve efficient water protection.

AB  - Forest management is classically modeled as a deterministic planning problem where decisions are determined in advance unconditionally to future events. This approach has led to the development of efficient optimization methods based on linear programming which can solve large forest management problems as encountered in Scandinavian countries. Recent research results have nevertheless established that it could be essential from an economical point of view to consider stochastic phenomena in the definition of long term forest management problems such as natural hazards and market uncertainties.
   Climate change will have important effects on forest ecosystems in the long run. It is a new fundamental reason to go beyond deterministic planning approaches in forest management. According to the last scenarios published by IPCC, the average temperature increase in the world might be in the range of 1.4 to 5.8 by year 2100. At regional level, a model developed by SWECLIM for Sweden predicts an increase between 2.5 degrees C to 4.5 degrees C by 2100, but there is also a considerable uncertainty regarding the future climate trajectory.
   In the study presented in this paper, we investigated the impact of such climate change uncertainty on the solutions of forest management problems for typical Swedish stands with several species. Our main objective was to determine whether taking into account uncertainty can improve the best deterministic solutions obtained by considering average temperature change scenarios. Such stochastic planning problems are theoretically solved by dynamic programming or related methods. However, these approaches can rarely be employed when complex growth and yield models are used. The second methodological objective of this study was thus to assess the effectiveness of new alternative stochastic simulation methods like simulation-based optimization or reinforcement learning for solving forest management planning problems with stochastic features.
   In the work described in this paper, we analyzed approximate optimal policies obtained for forest management problems under climate variability and change. These problems were defined on the basis of a forest management model called GAYA and a climate change model developed for the purpose of this study. Approximate optimal policies were obtained with Linear-Q-learning(lambda), a reinforcement learning algorithm. They were compared with approximate optimal plans obtained by considering average climate change scenarios.
   We studied fictive stands with one, two and three species. The stands were located in southern and northern Sweden and contained the species pine, spruce and birch. The stands were simulated for 20 five-year long periods years. Reinforcement learning converged toward approximate optimal policies after few simulations, even for complex stands with several species, either for problems with deterministic or stochastic scenarios.
   Ours results showed that there was a gain in considering stochastic models, but also that the magnitude of this gain was small. Considering climate change uncertainty improved the value of approximate optimal programs, but deterministic plans was sometime still optimal. This important conclusion can be explained by the relatively small estimated value of the growth effect, that lead to a quasi-deterministic dynamics of the stand state, and by the symmetry of the temperature change distribution around the average scenario.
   Our analysis lies entirely on the stochastic climate change model we developed, based on the SWECLIM regional climate modeling for northern Europe. Its main limitation is its stationary assumption on probabilities of the future climate change scenarios. Modeling today the probable fall of uncertainty in the future may be a complicated task. Note however that such a decreasing uncertainty model should strengthen our present conclusions.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Low-emission zones (LEZ) have been increasingly implemented in cities throughout Europe as a measure to reduce the adverse health effects and premature deaths associated with traffic-related air pollution. In the present study, a health impact analysis was conducted to estimate the effect of a hypothetical LEZ on mortality and morbidity in Malmo, Sweden. Baseline health statistics were gathered from health registers and applied to each resident according to individual-level data on age and/or sex. Concentration-response parameters were derived from current epidemiological literature, specifically meta-analyses. A Gaussian dispersion model (AERMOD) combined with a detailed emission database was used to calculate NO(2 )emissions from traffic, which could be applied on an individual-level using data on each person's residential coordinates. The adjusted exposure scenario replaced all vehicles on municipal roads having Euro 5 or lower emission standards with Euro 6 equivalents. This LEZ would, on average, decrease NO2 concentrations by 13.4%, preventing an estimated 9-26 deaths in Malmo each year. Additionally, 12 respiratory disease hospitalizations, 8 childhood asthma cases, and 9 cases of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were estimated to be avoided annually. These results suggest that LEZs can effectively improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and safeguard public health.

AB  - We evaluated the economic effects of a predicted shift from Norway spruce (Picea abies (Karst) to European beech (Fagus sylvatica (L) for a forest area of 1.3 million ha in southwest Germany. The shift was modelled with a generalised linear model (GLM) by using presence/absence data from the National Forest Inventory in Baden-Wurttemberg, a digital elevation model, and regionalised climate parameters from the period 1970 to 2000. Two scenarios from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (B1, A2) for three different time scales (2030, 2065, and 2100) were investigated. The GLM predicted a decrease of the suitable area for growing Norway spruce between 21% (B1, 2030) and 93% (A2, 2100) in comparison to 2000. This corresponds to a reduction in the potential area of Norway spruce from between 190,000 and 860,000 ha. The financial effect of this reduction in area was then evaluated by using a classical Faustmann approach, namely the land expectation value (LEV) as an economic parameter for forests of Norway spruce versus European beech. Underlying cash flows were derived from a distance dependent, single-tree growth simulator (SILVA) based on data for prices and costs of the year 2004. With an interest rate of r = 2%, the predicted loss in the potential area of Norway spruce is related to a decrease of the LEV between 690 million and 3.1 billion Euro. We discuss the sensitivity of these results to changing interest rates, risk levels, and rotation lengths. Results suggest that managing forestland for profitability will be increasingly difficult under both climate scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The vegetation dynamics and landscape management during 20 years of a temperate deciduous forest protected as a nature reserve in western Norway are analysed. Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), an alien species in northern Europe, has become abundant in parts of the forest and the paper discusses how nature management has formulated and interpreted the introduction of sycamore. Scientists and nature managers regard the species as aggressive and a threat to the local natural biodiversity, but in this respect empirical evidence has been replaced by assumption and prejudice, and this is critically reviewed in the paper. The development of the forest has been monitored annually since 1988 and the long-term forest dynamics and behaviour of sycamore are discussed in relation to the attitudes of nature managers. The views held by nature managers are based on their own values and ideas regarding what is valuable nature, and alien species are often assumed to be invasive and aggressive, yet with no reference being made to site ecology and human local history. As an alternative to an a priori understanding of the role of alien species, the paper suggests that proper knowledge of ecosystem dynamics can only be achieved through analysis of ecological variation in space and time. The management of any species should not be according to its status as native or alien, but according to a judgment of its role and long-term behaviour. The values of nature conservationists should not be confused with the intrinsic values of nature.

AB  - On 25 April 1998, the mineral waste retaining wall at the Swedish-owned pyrite mine at Aznalcollar (Seville, Spain) burst, 2 causing the most harmful environmental and socio-economic disaster in the history of the River Guadiamar basin. The damage was so great that the regional government decided in May 1998 to finance a comprehensive, multidisciplinary research initiative with the objective of eradicating or at least minimising all of the negative social, economic and environmental impacts. This paper utilises a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis to identify eight strategic measures aimed at providing policymakers with key guidelines on implementing a sustainable development model, in a broad sense. Empirical evidence, though, reveals that, to date, major efforts to tackle the negative impacts have centred on environmental concerns and that the socio-economic consequences have not been completely mitigated.

AB  - This study analyses variations in the operational setting in the context of nature-based tourism (NBT) and draws much needed attention to the supply side of this sector by segmenting the NBT service providers based on their setting preferences. This paper focuses on the setting of NBT as an important alternative avenue for understanding the operational context of NBT supply. This approach is subsequently empirically explored through a national survey among the NBT service providers in Sweden. The data analysis demonstrates that the companies can be rather clearly clustered based on the variations in the perceived importance and impact of NBT setting components. This study therefore helps in understanding the role of a commercial setting in explaining NBT supply, which has a potential to not only contribute to developing the research of this sector further but also help in avoiding possible conflicts with other natural resource users and improve its overall management.

AB  - There has been great concern about negative effects on crop production resulting from the ban on insecticide seed treatments containing neonicotinoids. I examine how the neonicotinoid ban has affected crop protection and crop production in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) using Sweden as a case study and compare the Swedish situation with that in leading countries growing winter and spring oilseed rape, respectively. The cropping area of winter and spring oilseed rape in Sweden has increased by approximately 40% to around 100 000 ha and decreased by approximately 90% to around 4000 ha, respectively following the ban and there are trends for increased pest and disease pressure. Overall, however, the ban has not had any major impacts on total oilseed rape cropping area or crop yields per hectare of either winter or spring oilseed rape, which is in contrast to elsewhere in Europe. In Germany and the United Kingdom, for example, the cropping area has decreased following the ban on neonicotinoid seed treatments, attributed to increased insect pest pressure especially from cabbage stem flea beetle, Psylliodes chrysocephala. I conclude that winter oilseed rape has remained a viable crop to grow in Sweden without insecticide seed treatments, but that further investments into integrated pest management are needed for sustainable insect pest control in oilseed rape in the future.

AB  - Background Soil-based on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWSs) are suspected to contribute to eutrophication of surface waters, due to the discharge of phosphorus (P). However, along the flow path between the facilities and surface waters, different processes contribute to delay the transport of phosphorus through the ground. This may reduce the unwanted impact on receiving water bodies. However, the strength and significance of this so-called soil retention remains unclear.
   In Sweden, there are nearly one million OWSs. To protect surface waters, a high P removal rate (up to 90%) is often required by the local municipalities. However, since these requirements may have costly consequences to property owners, it is debated as to whether they are too strict. In this debate, it is often claimed that the retention of P occurring in natural environments may be underestimated by authorities. Accordingly, there is a need for a scrutiny of the available evidence related to soil retention of phosphorus from OWSs. This is the objective of the planned systematic map. Focus will be on boreal and temperate climate zones.
   Methods Searches will be made for peer-reviewed articles and grey literature using bibliographic databases, search engines, specialist websites and stakeholder contacts. The references will be screened for relevance according to a predefined set of eligibility criteria. At stage one, after testing and clarifying the eligibility criteria, the references will be single-screened based on title and abstract. At stage two, potentially relevant references will be screened in full-text independently by two reviewers. We will compile a detailed database of the relevant studies. Moreover, a narrative report will be produced, describing the research landscape in general terms. This will be carried out with a conceptual model, describing the processes involved in P retention in natural environments, as a foundation. It will be discussed where the respective studies/study types fit into the conceptual model, and also evaluated how each study/study type can be related to the overarching question of eutrophication. Moreover, we will describe identified knowledge gaps that warrant further primary research effort, as well as identified knowledge clusters that could be suitable for systematic reviews.

AB  - The planning of heating and cooling supply and demand is key to reaching climate and sustainability targets. At the same time, data for planning are scarce for many places in Europe. In this study, we developed an open source dataset of gross floor area and energy demand for space heating and hot water in residential and tertiary buildings at the hectare level for EU28 + Norway, Iceland, and Switzerland. This methodology is based on a top-down approach, starting from a consistent dataset at the country level (NUTS 0), breaking this down to the NUTS 3 level and further to the hectare level by means of a series of regional indicators. We compare this dataset with data from other sources for 20 places in Europe. This process shows that the data for some places fit well, while for others, large differences up to 45% occur. The discussion of these results shows that the other data sources used for this comparison are also subject to considerable uncertainties. A comparison of the developed data with maps based on municipal building stock data for three cities shows that the developed dataset systematically overestimates the gross floor area and heat demand in low density areas and vice versa. We conclude that these data are useful for strategic purposes on aggregated level of larger regions and municipalities. It is especially valuable in locations where no detailed data is available. For detailed planning of heating and cooling infrastructure, local data should be used instead. We believe our work contributes towards a transparent, open source dataset for heating and cooling planning that can be regularly updated and is easily accessible and usable for further research and planning activities.

AB  - In many European cities, support for public transport and cycling in daily mobility is considered an efficient means to reduce air pollution, traffic jams, and carbon emissions. Shared bicycle systems have turned out effective in increasing cycling in many urban areas, particularly when combined with public transportation. In this study, we make an effort to model a hypothetical shared bike system and quantify its spatial effect on public transport travel times. The study area is one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in Europe, the Greater Helsinki area in Finland. We model the travel times between the population and 16 important destinations in the city centre of Helsinki by public transportation and by public transportation extended with shared bikes. We use open route and timetable databases and tools developed in-house to perform extensive data mining through application programming interfaces (APIs). We show 1) that open transport information interfaces can provide a new effective means to evaluate multimodal accessibility patterns in urban areas and 2) that the launch of a bicycle sharing system could reduce public transportation travel times in the study area on average by more than 10%, meaning some 6 min per each individual trip. We conclude that bicycle sharing systems complementing the traditional public transport system could potentially increase the competitiveness and attractiveness of sustainable modes of urban transport and thus help cities to promote sustainable daily mobility. Finally, we emphasize that the availability of open data sources on urban transport information such as the public transport data in our case - is vital for analysis of multimodal urban mobility patterns.

AB  - Assessment of the potential impact of climate change on water systems has been an essential part of hydrological research over the last couple of decades. However, the notion that such assessments should also include other changes is relatively recent. In this study, the potential impacts of climate change and continued urbanisation on stormwater flows to a suburban stream, Helsingborg, south Sweden, have been assessed using drainage simulations for present conditions as well as two climate (medium and high gas emission) and two water management storylines for subdivision. Climate change was simulated by altering a high-resolution rainfall record according to the climate-change signal derived from a regional climate model. Subdivision and urbanisation was simulated by altering model parameters chosen to reflect current trends in demographics and water management. The simulations were run for a 15 month period. It was found that city growth and projected increases in heavy rainfalls, both together and atone, are set to raise peak flow volumes and increase flood risk. Conversely, installation of a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) has a positive effect on the urban environment in general and can largely allay the adverse impacts of change road. The relative impacts of changes in climate and urbanisation are assessed for the combined sewer system which serves central Helsingborg in Semadeni-Davies et al.

AB  - Increasing the resource use efficiency of agricultural production is considered as a central element in Sustainable Intensification (SI) of agriculture, which is a promising strategy to satisfy increasing demand for food while reducing negative impacts on farm economy and environment. One challenge for SI is that degradation of agricultural soils and resulting crop yield losses are affecting negatively farmers' incomes and environment. This study analyses economic profitability of soil renovation investments aimed for tackling soil compaction in a regional context of south-west Finland, where some individual land parcels are compacted on many farms, implying crop yield losses, which we assume as -30%. We use a dynamic optimisation farm model with multiple input-use responses on crop yields. Explicit field parcel-specific crop-rotation constraints are accounted for in solving the farmers' decision problem of soil-renovation investments. Our results calculated over a 30 year time period suggest that soil-renovation investments are profitable since they produce a positive net present value (NPV) assuming 2000-2014 average crop prices, at all discount rates up to 10% when 30% yield decrease due to soil compaction is assumed. Higher than average crop prices would increase the value of soil renovation investment significantly while lower than average future crop prices would have a relatively small effect on the profitability of soil-renovation investment. The payback times of soil-renovation investments are approximately 8-11 years, depending on the discount rate, but largely independent on crop prices. Soil renovation increases production of higher valued crops, but the utilisation of the whole production potential of a farm is dependent on crop prices. We found that the full increased production potential may not be utilized after the renovation investment if not utilized already without the investment. It is concluded that one may recommend soil-renovation investments as a profitable long-term investment in a typical case, but one cannot recommend the soil renovation if no significant yield gains are possible, or if only low valued crop are to be produced. Nevertheless the field parcel-specific restrictions to avoid soil compaction after the renovation are important to be accounted for in evaluating the profitability of soil renovation at the farm level, since avoiding soil compaction is one part of more sustainable production strategy.

AB  - To properly simulate phosphorus (P) loading from agricultural land to waters, changes in soil P status and processes affecting soil P have to be described adequately. For practical reasons, a model has to rely on data that are commonly available. In this study, the P submodel of the ICECREAM model, based on the CREAMS, GLEAMS, and EPIC models, was adapted to simulate young acidic soils, which prevail in Finland. These soils have a high P sorption capacity, plenty of inorganic P in a non-reactive apatitic form, and the organic matter content (Or) in the plow layer is commonly about 5%. The model was modified mainly on the basis of 12 long-term fertilization experiments and tested on three other soils. The P pools considered were labile P (P-il), active inorganic P (P-ia), stable inorganic P (P-is), fresh organic P (P-of), and more stable organic P (P-oh). The major model modifications made were: (1) initialization of Pil from the Finnish soil test results (ammonium acetate extractable P, P-AAc); (2) initialization of P-ia and P-is from P-il, assuming equilibrium; (3) revision of the P availability factor (F-l), which regulates the flow between P-il and P-ia; and (4) calculation of the initial values of P-oh from soil organic carbon content. These modifications aimed to improve simulation of P-il on the basis of data obtained from soil testing. Proper simulation of changes in P-il, reflected by the soil test P (P-AAc), is critical since it regulates the level of dissolved P in runoff water After the modifications, the model was able to predict changes in P-AAc at annual P application rates of 0 and 30 kg ha(-1) in cereal cropping, but could not fully cope with a large surplus of P resulting from an annual rate of 60 kg P ha(-1).

AB  - Climate change accelerates biodiversity alterations in northern ecosystems. A prevalent example is that tundra regions are invaded by boreal species. This impacts negatively on native species through competition, predation and transmission of zoonoses. Scandinavian red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have emerged into the tundra and have altered the structure and function of the tundra community. For instance, they threaten persistence of the endangered Swedish Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus). County board administrations implement control of the tundra red foxes, but little is known about the underlying expansion dynamics. A broad-scale study revealed high connectivity where northern areas were supplemented with red foxes from surrounding population. However, red fox expansion is most prevalent in tundra regions and the fine-scaled expansion dynamics in these areas have not yet been disseminated. With the aim of identifying the invasive pathways of tundra red foxes, we present microsatellite data for 205 Swedish red foxes and mitochondrial sequence variation in 102 foxes sampled across the historical boreo-nemoral distribution and recently colonized tundra regions. Genetic structuring was low with high levels of ongoing, asymmetric dispersal from surrounding boreal zones into tundra habitats causing high genetic admixture. In both tundra and boreo-nemoral regions, inter-individual relatedness decreased with increasing geographic distance and data suggests male-biased dispersal patterns. Overall, fine-scaled expansion patterns were affected by multiple factors and we discuss its implications for future red fox management.

TI  - By-Catch of Grey Seals (<i>Halichoerus grypus</i>) in Baltic Fisheries-A Bayesian Analysis of Interview Survey
T2  - PLOS ONE

AB  - Baltic seals are recovering after a population decline. The increasing seal stocks cause notable damage to fisheries in the Baltic Sea, with an unknown number of seals drowning in fishing gear every year. Thus, sustainable seal management requires updated knowledge of the by-catch of seals-the number of specimens that die in fishing gear. We analyse the by-catch of grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) in Finland, Sweden, and Estonia in 2012. We collect data with interviews (35 in Finland, 54 in Sweden, and 72 in Estonia) and analyse them with a hierarchical Bayesian model. The model accounts for variability in seal abundance, seal mortality and fishing effort in different sub-areas of the Baltic Sea and allows us to predict the by-catch in areas where interview data was not available. We provide a detailed description of the survey design and interview methods, and discuss different factors affecting fishermen's motivation to report by-catch and how this may affect the results. Our analysis shows that the total yearly by-catch by trap and gill nets in Finland, Sweden and Estonia is, with 90% probability, more than 1240 but less than 2860; and the posterior median and mean of the total by-catch are 1550 and 1880 seals, respectively. Trap nets make about 88% of the total by-catch. However, results also indicate that in one of the sub-areas of this study, fishermen may have underreported their by-catch. Taking the possible underreporting into account the posterior mean of the total by-catch is between 2180 and 2380. The by-catch in our study area is likely to represent at least 90% of the total yearly grey seal by-catch in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - In the context of climate change, several forest adaptation options have to be advocated such as a shift to more resistant species.
   We provide an economic analysis of timber species change as a tool for adapting forests to climate change.
   We use the framework of cost-benefit analysis, taking uncertainty into account both exogenously (sensitivity analysis) and endogenously [(quasi-)option value calculations]. We apply the method to assess the economic rationale for converting Norway spruce stands to Douglas-fir in the French Black Mountain.
   We find that the Douglas-fir conversion is land expectation value (LEV) maximizing under a wide range of a priori (subjective) probabilities attached to high mortality of Norway spruce under climate change (for probabilities higher than 0.25-0.31). If information about the impacts of climate change is expected to increase over time, and given the large sunk costs attached to conversion, a delay strategy may be preferable to transition and to status quo when the impacts of climate change on Norway spruce mortality are sufficiently ambiguous. In such cases, getting information earlier increases the LEV by a,not sign5-60/ha.
   Beyond the specifics of the case study, this paper suggests that quasi-option value is a relevant tool to provide insights to forest owners dealing with adaptation decisions in the context of climate change.

AB  - Culture is increasingly recognised among traffic psychologists to be a factor influencing driving behaviour. This study examines whether a cultural background characterised by rapid social change and high levels of violence and aggression, as in the South African context, has any discernible influences on driving standards or the behaviour of individual drivers. The experiences and attitudes of young drivers in South Africa are compared with a group of young drivers from Sweden, a country whose society has exhibited high levels of stability and where road user behaviour is renowned for its restraint and compliance with regulations.
   The two cohorts provide information about their exposure to traffic injuries, their attitudes to other drivers and to a range of traffic offences, and to the types of behaviour they personally engage in. Among the South African respondents the notion of a declining standard of driving emerges very clearly, and specific new norms of driving are identified. Such norms are explained to be a consequence of new social values or challenges inherent within contemporary South African society. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing forests sustainably for multiple objectives requires multi-faceted socio-technical knowledge. This study explores the challenges of using knowledge within social and technical knowledge systems in decision-making about and the management of privately-owned forests in Finland. We define the technical knowledge system as the collection of standardized forms of knowledge and the IT systems supporting their storage and distribution. The social knowledge system consists of people who use and generate knowledge, as well as the societal norms that regulate their actions. We draw from two data sources: focus group discussions with representatives of forest and environmental stakeholders (n = 60) and notes from forest professionals' (n = 35) training workshops. Theories of knowledge management and knowledge lifecycle frame the analysis. We identify problems with knowledge use that are related to the functioning of both the technical and social knowledge systems, as well as to the mismatch of these systems. The results show many points of discontinuity in the flow of knowledge within and between forest-related actors and organizations. To enhance the knowledge flows, more attention must be paid to i) social structures that guide the ways in which knowledge is used and validated in the organizations, and ii) a more balanced manner to produce and co-utilize different forms of knowledge.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether the value-belief-norm theory can explain reported travel mode change in the Norwegian urban population. The results are based on a self-completion questionnaire survey carried out among representative samples in six urban areas in Norway (n = 1043). Using structural equation modelling, values and beliefs explained 58 per cent of the variance in personal norms. Three groups of transport mode users were identified: Frequent users of public transportation, frequent users of a car, and a group of people frequently walking or using bicycle. Both personal norms and situational factors were found to be significant predictors of reported travel mode choice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scenarios with either 3% or 5% of the productive forest stock in Western Europe set-aside for conservation are compared to a baseline case. The latter case is further compared to cases where the whole of Europe and North America join the 5% conservation program. The scenarios are created by employing a global forest sector model, EFI-GTM. The aggregate conservation impacts seem relatively low, mainly because international trade counterbalances regional shortages and because roundwood harvests are well below the annual forest growth in many European countries. Conservation increases the forest owners' wood sales income. The 5% set-aside raises roundwood prices in Western Europe by 4% and decreases harvests by 3% from the base case levels during 2010-2020. The production of pulp and mechanical forest products then decrease by 1.4 and 1.7%, respectively. The paper market is affected least. The leakage impact of forest protection is most pronounced in Russian roundwood harvests. Simultaneous conservation in the whole of Europe raises the roundwood costs of the Western European forest industry, but it does not prevent the leakage of roundwood harvests to Russia. Conservation in North America has a low impact on the European roundwood market. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Apart from its contribution to climate change, offshore oil and gas extraction is also a potential threat to the diversity and function of marine ecosystems. Routine monitoring of the environmental status of affected areas is therefore critical for effective management. While current morphology-based monitoring is relatively time consuming, costly and prone to identification bias, environmental DNA metabarcoding offers an attractive alternative for assessing the impacts of oil drilling, extraction or spills. However, to be ready for routine monitoring, its performance needs to be demonstrated through agreement with assessments based on physicochemical measurements and current bioindicators. To this end, we applied metabarcoding to sequence the metazoan (COI) and total eukaryotic (18S) benthic components. We targeted a range of sites, with a gradient of low to high level of impact, located near active production installations and reference sites, in the North and Barents Seas. Alpha diversity and community structure of both datasets correlated strongly with a physicochemical pressure index (PI) based on total hydrocarbons (THC), PAH16, Ba and Cu. Calculations of the macroinvertebrate-based Norwegian Sensitivity Index (NSI) based on COI metabarcoding data agreed well with corresponding morpho-taxonomy values and with the PI. Further, we identified a set of bioindicator taxa from both metabarcoding datasets, to develop novel biotic indices and demonstrate their predictive performance using cross-validation. Finally, we compared co-occurrence networks from impacted vs. non-impacted sites, to improve the understanding of the ecological consequences of impacts. Our study demonstrates that metabarcoding can act as a meaningful and relatively accurate complement to the current morpho-taxonomic approach.

AB  - The size and location of agricultural fields that are in active use and the type of use during the growing season are among the vital information that is needed for the careful planning and forecasting of agricultural production at national and regional scales. In areas where such data are not readily available, an independent seasonal monitoring method is needed. Remote sensing is a widely used tool to map land use types, although there are some limitations that can partly be circumvented by using, among others, multiple observations, careful feature selection and appropriate analysis methods. Here, we used Sentinel-2 satellite image time series (SITS) over the land area of Norway to map three agricultural land use classes: cereal crops, fodder crops (grass) and unused areas. The Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and two variants of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), are implemented on SITS data of four different temporal resolutions. These enabled us to compare twelve model-dataset combinations to identify the model-dataset combination that results in the most accurate predictions. The CNN is implemented in the spectral and temporal dimensions instead of the conventional spatial dimension. Rather than using existing deep learning architectures, an autotuning procedure is implemented so that the model hyperparameters are empirically optimized during the training. The results obtained on held-out test data show that up to 94 % overall accuracy and 90% Cohen's Kappa can be obtained when the 2D CNN is applied on the SITS data with a temporal resolution of 7 days. This is closely followed by the 1D CNN on the same dataset. However, the latter performs better than the former in predicting data outside the training set. It is further observed that cereal is predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by grass. Predicting the unused areas has been found to be difficult as there is no distinct surface condition that is common for all unused areas.

AB  - The archipelago of Svalbard is a good example of an Arctic locale undergoing rapid changes on multiple levels. This contribution is a joint effort of three anthropologists with up-to-date ethnographic data from Svalbard (mostly Longyearbyen and Barentsburg) to frame and interpret interconnected changes. The processes impacting Svalbard are related to issues such as geopolitical interests, and increasing pressure by the Norwegian government to exercise presence and control over the territory. Our interpretations are based on a bottom-up approach, drawing on experiences living in the field. We identify three great ruptures in recent years - the avalanche of 2015, the gradual phasing out of mining enterprises and the COVID-19 pandemic - and show how they further impact, accelerate or highlight preexisting vulnerabilities in terms of socio-economic development, and environmental and climate change. We discuss the shift from coal mining to the industries of tourism, education, and research and development, and the resulting changed social and demographic structure of the settlements. Another facet is the complexity of environmental drivers of change and how they relate to the socio-economic ones. This article serves as an introductory text to the collection of articles published in Polar Record in 2021/2022 with the overarching theme "changing Svalbard". Issues discussed range from socio-economic change and its implications for local populations including identity of place, through tourism (value creation, mediation, human-environment relations, environmental dilemmas, balancing contradictory trends), to security and risk perception, and environmental and climate change issues.

AB  - The agricultural sector in Norway has undergone structural changes over the past 50 years. The objective of this study was to analyze the distribution of concerns about farm economy, work time, and mental complaints among Norwegian farmers. In a sample of single principal owner-operators (n = 2,676), we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted odd ratios (ORs) for concerns about the farm economy, concerns for insufficient time to complete work, and high symptom load of mental complaints. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to explore the associations between farm characteristics, concerns, and mental health. Farmers had a high probability for an increased symptom load of mental complaints. The level of farm income was more strongly associated with economic concerns and mental health concerns when a major part of total household income resulted from farming. The high workload required in farming combined with off-farm supplemental employment was additionally associated with higher levels of time concerns and mental complaints. Norwegian farmers have a relatively high workload both in farming and in off-farm work but are able to make sustainable plans for their individual workload needs. The high individual workload in both these arenas poses a challenge, but was not associated with a greater probability for a high symptom load of mental complaints.

AB  - Twenty-six Hooded Crows (Corvus corone cornix) breeding in a fragmented farmland-forest landscape in southeastern Norway were radio-tracked between April and June in three years. The 95 % home range size averaged 0.15 km(2). The proportional distribution of habitat categories in the home ranges was compared with that in the landscape; EDGE (forest <30 m from open habitats) and FIELD (mainly pastures and gardens) ranked first, followed by CROP (farmland ploughed annually), OLD (forest >30 m from open habitats) and YOUNG (clear-cuts and young planted forest). The same ranking was found when the habitats used were compared with those available within the home ranges. Crows devoted more time to perching, mostly in EDGE, than to foraging, mostly in FIELD and CROP. Use of EDGE increased with increasing availability of EDGE in the home range, but the crows used EDGE more than expected from availability only as long as the proportion of EDGE was <0.40. Home range decreased as the proportion of EDGE in the home range increased. The results suggest that an increase in the farmland-forest edge-to-area ratio may increase the density of breeding Hooded Crows, and thus increase the predation risk on bird nests in edge habitats.

AB  - Ensuring sustainability of the world fisheries is a key conservation and economic objective. Traceability of seafood from the final sale back to the point of harvest is an important aspect, supporting both fishery management and consumer protection. Stable isotope-based geolocation can be applied to trace the spatial origin of seafood, drawing on comparisons between the isotopic compositions of the product and those of a reference dataset from known spatial locations. This study tests the extent to which stable isotope-based geolocation can be applied to identify catch location of the Norwegian lobster Nephrops norvegicus. Carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isoscapes across UK shelf seas are used as the reference dataset and test the accuracy of assignment estimates using a variety of bivariate and multivariate stable isotope geolocation approaches. Two alternative Bayesian inversions, one balanced and one weighted, are applied to the outcomes of the statistical models to determine the most accurate methods of assignment. Of all the methods trialed, the multivariate approach using carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur isoscape data produced the most accurate assignments, with c. 60% of samples from each site correctly assigned among six possible fishery origins. Weighted Bayesian approaches resulted in more correct assignments to highly fished sites, but at a cost of reduced correct assignments to sites of low fishing activity. Processed Nephrops samples obtained from supermarkets were assigned to potential fishery location, with results indicating the majority were captured in the west of Scotland. The isoscape methods explored can be calibrated to any marine feeding organism and provide a useful tool for more efficient management of marine stocks.

AB  - Individual local governments are key players in Sweden's strategy for climate adaptation but their authority does not match the scale of climate change and its impacts. Competences are divided among local, regional and national authorities. Climate adaptation thus requires cooperation, particularly in metropolitan regions. This raises issues of coordination, legitimacy and effectiveness of adaptation measures recommended in local Master Plans. The focus here is on how the 13 municipalities in the Gothenburg Metropolitan Areaexpected to be the part of Sweden most affected by impacts of climate changeaddress and act upon issues of climate change adaptation within the framework of Sweden's Planning and Building Act, which places responsibility for the common interest of climate adaptation with local governments. Analysing municipal Master Plans, as well as the comments on these plans from the regional County Administrative Board and from Goteborg Region Association of Local Authorities, the inter-municipal association charged with infrastructural planning, I identify patterns in terms of coordination, legitimacy and effectiveness of planning for climate change adaptation. Results are discussed in relation to propositions from recent research on planning for climate adaptation in multi-level contexts.

AB  - The mutual interaction of climate change and the highly weather-dependent ski tourism business is drawing increasing attention from the academic, commercial and political arenas. Changes in the cryosphere are becoming major determinants of the sustainability of ski areas. Therefore, there is a great deal of literature entailing impact and adaptation studies regarding ski areas, resorts, and destinations; however, research on the demand side of the issue is relatively limited. In this paper, the relationship between climate change and a niche segment of ski tourism, summer skiing, is discussed with regard to the awareness, perceptions, and mitigation and substitution behaviours of visitors to the summer downhill ski centres in Norway - an underresearched country, despite its recognition as the cradle of skiing. For this purpose, a comprehensive survey was administered to a sample of 224 subjects. The results revealed high climate change awareness but limited climate friendliness, and a strong emphasis on the immediate climate impacts on summer skiing that create a tendency towards ski activity substitution within Norway. Individual profiles also played a significant role in the anticipated mitigation and substitution behaviours. The implications of the results involving demand attitude and behaviour are further discussed with regard to the suppliers.

AB  - This paper aims to fill a research gap in the area of consumer-citizen attitudes to business models for decentralized energy storage, at the level of households and buildings. The study focuses on the interaction of such attitudes and their underlying motivation factors with socio-cultural, contextual factors. Self-determination theory (SDT) is used as a theoretical framework, to connect interpersonal and contextual factors, addressing the question of how contexts influence the motivation to support energy storage. Drawing on SDT, this study examines the role of autarky (independence from the energy system), autonomy (control over energy management) and relatedness (degree of sharing required) in this regard, embedded and interpreted in the socio-cultural local context of two demonstration sites in Sweden and Portugal. A mixed method approach is used. Quantitative survey data provides information on local social and cultural dimensions, followed by stakeholder consultation workshops that elicit participants' views on different models of decentralized energy storage. The findings raise questions of how to improve autarky and autonomy for prosumers, while keeping the need for time investment low and provide flexibility regarding the required degree of interaction between prosumers. Implications for business models and policy support for citizen-centered sustainable urban energy systems are derived.

AB  - Modern intensified agriculture has decreased farmland heterogeneity, which has led to strong negative effects on farmland biodiversity. However, partly forested landscapes seem to offer many alternative habitats for open habitat species such as butterflies, since modern forestry and development of infrastructure has created several new environments such as forest road verges and power-line corridors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the importance of power-line corridors (PLCs) as butterfly habitats by testing i) if species richness and abundance of butterflies in PLCs are affected by adjacent habitat composition (i.e. comparisons of PLCs with different adjacent habitats), ii) if PLCs act as source habitat through spill-over of individuals into adjacent forest roads and semi-natural pastures and iii) if species composition differs among the investigated habitat types. To investigate this we censured the butterfly fauna in 23 study landscapes in south-central Sweden. We found support for the hypothesis that PLCs may act as source habitats for butterflies in forest roads and pastures, since species richness and abundance were decreasing with increasing distance to PLC from 0 to 500 m. In addition, the species composition in forest roads and pastures close to and far from PLCs was similar, suggesting that this increase was not due to an increase of PLC specialists in the other two habitats. Thus, we have shown that PLCs in themselves are important butterfly habitats independently of adjacent habitat composition (adjacent mature forest, clear cuts or arable land), and they contribute to increased species richness and abundance of butterflies in surrounding areas over 10 times larger than their own width.

AB  - Aims To validate the POLLSCAPE simulation model of pollen dispersal and deposition, and evaluate the effect of factors such as pollen productivity, wind speed and regional plant abundance, using a data set of AD 1800 pollen assemblages and historical land cover data.
   Location Denmark.
   Methods AD 1800 land cover from historical maps is digitized for 2000 m radii around 30 Danish lakes (3.5-33 ha). The simulation model POLLSCAPE is used to predict sedimentary pollen assemblages in the lakes from the plant abundance data inferred from these maps, with different model parameter settings for wind speed, pollen productivity, regional pollen loading, etc. The model predictions are compared with observed AD 1800 pollen assemblages from the lake sediment records. Furthermore, pollen productivity is estimated from the AD 1800 pollen and vegetation data using the Extended R-value model.
   Results Generally the model reproduces the patterns in the observed pollen assemblages, and for most pollen types there are significant correlations between observed and predicted pollen proportions. The pollen proportions predicted by the POLLSCAPE model are sensitive to the pollen productivity estimates used, the regional background pollen loading and average wind speed. There is a difference in background pollen loading between eastern and western Denmark, especially of Calluna pollen. The fit between predicted and observed pollen assemblages is best at wind speeds around 2.5 m s(-1), and decreases rapidly at lower wind speeds. The pollen productivity estimates from the AD 1800 data set are comparable with estimates from moss polsters in modern analogues of traditional cultural landscapes in Sweden and Norway.
   Main conclusions The POLLSCAPE model reproduces the patterns in the observed pollen assemblages from the lakes well, considering the uncertainty in the historical plant abundance data. This study indicates that the simulation model can be a useful tool for investigating relationships between vegetation and pollen composition, but also that the simulated pollen proportions are sensitive to the pollen productivity estimates, the regional background and to wind speed.

AB  - This article discusses the evolution, scope, and impact of ecosystem thinking in public service management in the city of Espoo, Finland. Discussion starts with a brief introduction to the emergence of ecosystem thinking and the ideas on which the conceptualization of ecosystems in the given local context have been anchored. The second task is to describe, on the basis of the document analysis and two key informant interviews, how the city of Espoo started to build the conceptual tools, models, and strategies associated with ecosystem thinking. We will assess the added value of such an approach in four areas of public management, which deal with service innovation, competence issues, customer relationships, and citizen engagement. Lastly, this article will elaborate briefly three contextual ecosystem-related issues. First, to what extent the ecosystem thinking depends on the critical mass of producers, developers, and other stakeholders in terms of scalability, urbanization economies, and opportunity enhancement? Second, what is the role of digitalization in the development of ecosystem thinking? Third, how is the application of ecosystem thinking in public service management conditioned by its inherent institutional context, such as the democratic and bureaucratic aspects of local self-government? This article highlights the preconditions and forms of the real-life ecosystem thinking in the context of a progressive local government in the Nordic welfare society, and further assesses the promise of ecosystem thinking as a paradigmatic approach to public service management adjusted to the conditions of the global digital age.

AB  - Anticipation is increasingly central to urgent contemporary debates, from climate change to the global economic crisis. Anticipatory practices are coming to the forefront of political, organizational, and citizens' society. Research into anticipation, however, has not kept pace with public demand for insights into anticipatory practices, their risks and uses. Where research exists, it is deeply fragmented. This paper seeks to identify how anticipation is defined and understood in the literature and to explore the role of anticipatory practice to address individual, social, and global challenges. We use a resilience lens to examine these questions. We illustrate how varying forms of anticipatory governance are enhanced by multi-scale regional networks and technologies and by the agency of individuals, drawing from an empirical case study on regional water governance of Malaren, Sweden. Finally, we discuss how an anticipatory approach can inform adaptive institutions, decision making, strategy formation, and societal resilience.

AB  - Climate has an important role in shaping the composition and structure of woodlands. There is considerable uncertainty regarding how woodlands will respond to climate change over the next hundred years. To better understand likely responses to contemporary climate change, this paper analyses taxonomic richness, evenness and community similarity in palaeoecological data from 31 European woodlands during an abrupt cooling and warming event c. 8200 years ago. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated there was no significant overall difference in richness or community evenness over time. A single significant pairwise contrast was found (richness decreased as climate warmed) but was short-lived, indicating that high-level effects were temporary. However, analysis of species turnover measured using community similarity revealed substantial changes (only 24% of species remained at some sites after climatic change), indicating that the actual species within that community had altered. General(ised) linear models showed variation in the direction and magnitude of community change was not related to the broadscale biogeographical variables of latitude, longitude or altitude. Our research has several important implications for practitioners involved in community ecology research and woodland management. Although site-level richness is largely unaffected, we caution that there will be considerable species turnover in woodlands as the climate warms. As species turnover at individual sites will have a negligible effect if driven by localised random processes, we recommend practitioners to consider long-term gamma diversity wherever possible. This shifts focus towards landscape-scale approaches that span generations rather than the typical 3-5-year span of funding, management plans and political cycles.

AB  - In modem forestry, attempts to mitigate negative effects on biodiversity include the integration of conservation actions into forestry activities, e.g. by leaving trees at harvesting. This practice has been used on a large scale for more than two decades without solid scientific support of whether desirable effects are achieved or not. To increase the knowledge of changes in the lichen flora on retained aspen trees (Populus tremula) with time since clear-cutting we made a study in boreal Sweden where 720 retained aspens in 24 stands were surveyed. Twelve stands were clear-felled 0-4 years and 12 where clear-felled 10-16 years prior to the inventory. Total lichen species richness increased with time since clear-cutting, as did richness of aspen-dependent lichens and lichens adapted to open environments. There was no difference between the age classes regarding the number of cyanolichens. We show that retained aspens function as lifeboats for old-forest lichens and as a new habitat for lichens adapted to open, sun-exposed habitats. Our results indicate that epiphytic species richness on retained trees is higher after the logging, due to coexistence of remaining species and colonizing species. We suggest that the retention of old aspen and the promotion of aspen generation in the production forest would benefit epiphytic lichens and are thus important conservation measures.

AB  - Background The aim of this study was to investigate overweight and obesity among a representative population of 15 966 Norwegian 15-16 year olds and the associations with different socio-economic and cultural risk factors.
   Methods Self-reported data were obtained from school-based surveys in six counties during 2000-04. Overweight and obesity were calculated using Cole's index.
   Results The prevalence of overweight and obesity were 11.8% and 2.4%, respectively, higher among boys. Logistic regression analyses revealed that adolescents in Nordland, Troms and Finnmark (the northernmost counties) were 70-90% more likely to be overweight and obese compared with adolescents in Oslo (the capital and southernmost county) (OR for overweight in Finnmark = 1.7, CI = 1.3, 2.3). Lower educational plans and poor family economy were both significantly associated with overweight and obesity. So was physical inactivity (OR 1.2, CI = 1. 1, 1.3 and OR = 1.6, CI = 1.2, 2.1, respectively). Eating breakfast was positively associated with not being overweight/obese.
   Conclusion Overweight and obesity is associated with socio-economic factors and with factors related to food habits and nutrition, suggesting important areas for prevention.

AB  - Palaeoecological investigations of mires suggest that agriculture was established north of the Arctic Circle in Norway during the late Bronze Age (1100-500 b.c.) and Pre-Roman Iron Age (500-1 b.c.). The lack of archaeobotanical and archaeological investigations has made it difficult to assess the nature of this early agricultural expansion into the Arctic in any detail. Here we present the first well documented archaeobotanical investigation from north Norway that covers this agricultural pioneer phase. Remains of charred seeds show that barley (Hordeum) was already being cultivated in the late Bronze Age, and that wheat (Triticum) was introduced in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. Large amounts of crowberry (Empetrum) seeds are also typical of the Pre-Roman Iron Age and were obviously an important food plant at the time, at least locally. Charcoal rich layers dated to the late Bronze Age suggest that the local birch forest was initially cleared away with the help of fire, possibly related to a slash-and-burn cultivation practice. Lithostratigraphic and pollen-analytical results indicate that the cultivation practice of the Pre-Roman Iron Age was a form of bush-fallow system with intensive soil re-working alternated with long periods of fallow.

AB  - Temporal and spatial characteristics of temperature were studied in and around the city of Turku (175,000 inh.). The main aim was to unravel the spatial diurnal and seasonal temperature differences during the observation period of 20022007 and the behaviour of observed temperature differences in relation to land use, topography and the vicinity of water bodies. The material consisted of a temperature data set from a network of 36 Hobo H8 temperature loggers that monitor T at 30 min interval. A buffer analysis of landscape parameters surrounding the loggers was employed for spatial analysis, and their relative importance was assessed with a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Spatial temperature difference in the area for warmest and coldest average temperatures was 1.9 degrees C. The differences were largest among the daily minimum temperatures (3.6 degrees C). The respective difference in daily maximum temperatures was 1.0 degrees C, and in the diurnal temperature ranges 3.4 degrees C. The spatial differences in temperatures were largest at the end of summer and smallest during the cold season. On average, the market square in the city centre was the warmest place. In autumn, a relatively warm zone was formed along the coast due to the remnant heat released by the sea. In spring, daytime maximum temperatures were typically highest in rural inland areas resulting in an urban cold island. The results of the linear regression model indicate that it is the daily minimum temperatures that can best be explained by the combination of land use, topography and water bodies. The explanatory force of the model was weakest in case of maximum temperatures. Land use was the most significant factor causing spatial differences in minimum and average temperatures as well as diurnal temperature range in the study area.

AB  - Novel genome editing techniques allow for efficient and targeted improvement of aquaculture stock and might be a solution to solve challenges related to disease and environmental impacts. This review has retrieved the latest research on genome editing on aquacultured finfish species, exploring the technological progress and the scope. Genome editing has most often been used on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus Linnaeus), followed by Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar Linnaeus). More than half of the studies have focused on developing solutions for aquaculture challenges, while the rest can be characterized as basic research on fish genetics/physiology or technology development. Main traits researched are reproduction and development, growth, pigmentation, disease resistance, use of trans-GFP and study of the omega-3 metabolism, respectively. There is a certain correlation between the species identified and their commercial relevance, indicating the relevance of most studies for present challenges of aquaculture. Reviewing geographical origin of the research, China has been in the forefront (29 publications), followed by the United States (9) and Norway (7). The research seems not to be dependent on regulative conditions in the respective countries, but merely on the purpose and objectives for the use of genome editing technologies. Some technical barriers identified in the studies are presented together with solutions to overcome these-off-target effects, ancestral genome duplication and mosaicism in F0. One of the objectives for use is the contribution to a more sustainable aquaculture, where the most prominent issues are solutions that contribute to minimizing impact on biodiversity.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to present a historical case study of Norwegian transnational entrepreneurs (1880s-1930s) and the ecosystems that they founded in Russia's Arctic periphery. Drawing from the contemporary transnational entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial ecosystem literature, and inspired by AnnaLee Saxenian's concept of "brain circulation," this study explores the journey and impact of these entrepreneurs in a time of evolving political turbulence. Design/methodology/approach This study applies a mixed-methodology approach, drawing from nine qualitative interviews held in 2021 and secondary material, including historical books, a podcast, videos and archival data. Findings The Norwegian entrepreneurs were both "pulled" by and "pushed" to the Russian region, their "New America," where they could apply their personal skills and exploit their rich social and financial capital to establish a local entrepreneurial ecosystem. However, radical political change altered the context, which led many of the entrepreneurs to re-migrate to Norway. Research limitations/implications This paper demonstrates the role of the political context for contemporary entrepreneurship and management research, as transnational entrepreneurs and international expatriates remain vulnerable to political change. Practical implications Public-policy actors and managers in companies need to support highly-skilled transnational entrepreneurs, including expatriates, in a setting with turbulence, crisis and even war, to foster the sustainable contribution of entrepreneurial migrants to regional economic development across different countries. Originality/value This paper presents an original, novel case study on the historical role of transnational entrepreneurs across different cultural settings, their impact on a foreign peripheral location, including social-network building and evolving political change in the historical context. The findings are relevant for contemporary management literature.

AB  - We present data from detailed observations of City Wall, a large multi-touch display installed in a central location in Helsinki, Finland. During eight days of installation, 1199 persons interacted with the system in various social configurations. Videos of these encounters were examined qualitatively as well as quantitatively based on human coding of events. The data convey phenomena that arise uniquely in public use: crowding, massively parallel interaction, teamwork, games, negotiations of transitions and handovers, conflict management, gestures and overt remarks to co-present people, and "marking" the display for others. We analyze how public availability is achieved through social learning and negotiation, why interaction becomes performative and, finally, how the display restructures the public space. The multi-touch feature, gesture-based interaction, and the physical display size contributed differentially to these uses. Our findings on the social organization of the use of public displays can be useful for designing such systems for urban environments.

AB  - The achievement of sustainable development (SD) in the supply of minerals poses significant challenges for governments and public administrations on all levels, because ensuring a sustainable supply constitutes a "wicked" problem that has no clear set of alternative solutions due to its social, institutional and scientific complexities. This paper explores how this problem is addressed through "governance for SD" principles (horizontal policy integration and participation; long-term vision/short-term action; and reflexivity and learning) in the design and delivery of national mineral policy strategies (NMS) in five EU Member States (Austria, Finland, Greece, Portugal and Sweden). Following a grounded theory approach on data collected through document analysis and complementary qualitative interviews, the author identified several analytical categories for the selected governance for SD' principles. Although no "one-size-fits-all" recipe for best practice on governance for SD exists in the five NMS, Finland, Portugal and Sweden meet high standards: These NMS display practical examples of governance for SD integration and, thus, lay the foundations for achieving policy outcomes in the sectoral policy strategies of the mineral supply.

AB  - Background
   Despite Sweden's strong entomological tradition, large portions of its insect fauna remain poorly known. As part of the Swedish Taxonomy Initiative, launched in 2002 to document all multi-cellular species occurring in the country, the first taxonomically-broad inventory of the country's insect fauna was initiated, the Swedish Malaise Trap Project (SMTP). In total, 73 Malaise traps were deployed at 55 localities representing a wide range of habitats across the country. Most traps were run continuously from 2003 to 2006 or for a substantial part of that time period. The total catch is estimated to contain 20 million insects, distributed over 1,919 samples (Karlsson et al. 2020). The samples have been sorted into more than 300 taxonomic units, which are made available for expert identification. Thus far, more than 100 taxonomists have been involved in identifying the sorted material, recording the presence of 4,000 species. One third of these had not been recorded from Sweden before and 700 have tentatively been identified as new to science.
   New information
   Here, we describe the SMTP dataset, published through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data on the sorted material are available in the "SMTP Collection Inventory" dataset. It currently includes more than 130,000 records of taxonomically-sorted samples. Data on the identified material are published using the Darwin Core standard for sample-based data. That information is divided up into group-specific datasets, as the sample set processed for each group is different and in most cases non-overlapping. The current data are divided into 79 taxonomic datasets, largely corresponding to taxonomic sorting fractions. The orders Diptera and Hymenoptera together comprise about 90% of the specimens in the material and these orders are mainly sorted to family or subfamily. The remaining insect taxa are mostly sorted to the order level. In total, the 79 datasets currently available comprise around 165,000 specimens, that is, about 1% of the total catch. However, the data are now accumulating rapidly and will be published continuously. The SMTP dataset is unique in that it contains a large proportion of data on previously poorly-known taxa in the Diptera and Hymenoptera.

AB  - The food system is a major driver of anthropogenic environmental impacts and in Sweden a sizeable proportion of the country's relatively large per capita ecological footprint is attributable to food. In short, sustainable eating practices need to become mainstream. Actors within the food-provisioning system likely have valuable insights into how such a transition could be enabled. This article presents the results of a qualitative study that aimed to examine the perspectives of these individuals on such a transition in Sweden using a social practice framework to identify framings of barriers and potentials for mainstreaming sustainable eating practices. We found that conventional framings and models for explaining change and transitions dominate. These approaches center on providing alternative food products, with some attention devoted to normalizing sustainable eating through product design, communication, and marketing. However, exceptions to these strategies include calls for redefining business profitability in terms of human and planetary health and notions of a decentralized food-provisioning system consisting of small-scale actors and limited by the regional and seasonal supply of food. Our analysis suggests that interventions for mainstreaming sustainable eating practices need to move beyond a constrained recrafting of mainstream eating practices and toward systematic practice substitution that favors considerations regarding how eating practices connect to other practices that constitute people's everyday lives. We conclude by discussing implications for the food-provisioning system and suggest directions for further research that could lead to the development of strategies for mainstreaming sustainable eating practices in Sweden and elsewhere.

AB  - Questions Does the influence of forest edges on plant species richness and composition depend on forest management? Do forest specialists and generalists show contrasting patterns?
   Location Mesic, deciduous forests across Europe.
   Methods Vegetation surveys were performed in forests with three management types (unthinned, thinned 5-10 years ago and recently thinned) along a macroclimatic gradient from Italy to Norway. In each of 45 forests, we established five vegetation plots along a south-facing edge-to-interior gradient (n = 225). Forest specialist, generalist and total species richness, as well as evenness and proportion of specialists, were tested as a function of the management type and distance to the edge while accounting for several environmental variables (e.g. landscape composition and soil characteristics). Magnitude and distance of edge influence were estimated for species richness per management type.
   Results Greatest total species richness was found in thinned forests. Edge influence on generalist plant species richness was contingent on the management type, with the smallest decrease in species richness from the edge-to-interior in unthinned forests. In addition, generalist richness increased with the proportion of forests in the surrounding landscape and decreased in forests dominated by tree species that cast more shade. Forest specialist species richness, however, was not affected by management type or distance to the edge, and only increased with pH and increasing proportion of forests in the landscape.
   Conclusions Forest thinning affects the plant community composition along edge-to-interior transects of European forests, with richness of forest specialists and generalists responding differently. Therefore, future studies should take the forest management into account when interpreting edge-to-interior because both modify the microclimate, soil processes and deposition of polluting aerosols. This interaction is key to predict the effects of global change on forest plants in landscapes characterized by the mosaic of forest patches and agricultural land that is typical for Europe.

AB  - Coastal areas are exposed to a variety of threats due to high population densities and rapid economic development. How will this affect human welfare and our dependence on nature's capacity to provide ecosystem goods and services? This paper is original in evaluating this concern for major habitats (macroalgae, seagrasses, blue mussel beds, and unvegetated soft bottoms) in a temperate coastal setting. More than 40 categories of goods and services are classified into provisional, regulating, and cultural services. A wide variety of Swedish examples is described for each category, including accounts of economic values and the relative importance of different habitats. For example, distinguishing characteristics would be the exceptional importance of blue mussels for mitigation of eutrophication, sandy soft bottoms for recreational uses, and seagrasses and macroalgae for fisheries production and control of wave and current energy. Net changes in the provision of goods and services are evaluated for three cases of observed coastal ecosystem shifts: i) seagrass beds into unvegetated substrate; ii) unvegetated shallow soft bottoms into filamentous algal mat dominance; and iii) macroalgae into mussel beds on hard substrate. The results are discussed in a management context including accounts of biodiversity, interconnectedness of ecosystems, and potential of economic valuation.

AB  - The depiction of landscape in art has played a major role in the creation of cultural identities in both China and Europe. Landscape depiction has a history of over 1000 years in China, whilst in Europe its evolution has been more recent. Landscape art (shan shui) has remained a constant feature of Chinese culture and has changed little in style and purpose since the Song dynasty. In Europe, landscape depictions have been significant in the modern determination of cultural and national identities and have served to educate consumers about their country. Consideration is given here to Holland, England, Norway, Finland and China, demonstrating how landscape depictions served to support a certain definition of Chinese culture but have played little political role there, whilst in Europe landscape art has been produced in a variety of contexts, including providing support for nationalism and the determination of national identity.

AB  - Mean sea level (MSL) variations across a range of time scales are examined for the North Sea under the consideration of different forcing factors since the late 19th century. We use multiple linear regression models, which are validated for the second half of the 20th century against the output of a tide+surge model, to determine the barotropic response of the ocean to fluctuations in atmospheric forcing. We find that local atmospheric forcing mainly initiates MSL variability on time scales up to a few years, with the inverted barometric effect dominating the variability along the UK and Norwegian coastlines and wind controlling the MSL variability in the south from Belgium up to Denmark. On decadal time scales, MSL variability mainly reflects steric changes, which are largely forced remotely. A spatial correlation analysis of altimetry observations and gridded steric heights suggests evidence for a coherent signal extending from the Norwegian shelf down to the Canary Islands. This fits with the theory of longshore wind forcing along the eastern boundary of the North Atlantic causing coastally trapped waves to propagate over thousands of kilometers along the continental slope. Implications of these findings are assessed with statistical Monte-Carlo experiments. It is demonstrated that the removal of known variability increases the signal to noise ratio with the result that: (i) linear trends can be estimated more accurately; (ii) possible accelerations (as expected, e.g., due to anthropogenic climate change) can be detected much earlier. Such information is of crucial importance for anticipatory coastal management, engineering, and planning.

AB  - Aim: Species distribution models built with geographically restricted data often fail to capture the full range of conditions experienced by species across their entire distribution area. Using such models to predict distribution shifts under future environmental change may, therefore, produce biased projections. However, restricted-scale models have the potential to include a larger sample of taxa for which distribution data are available and to provide finer-resolution projections that are better applied to conservation planning than the forecasts of broad-scale models. We examine the circumstances under which the projected shifts in species richness patterns derived from restricted-scale and broad-scale models are most likely to be similar.
   Location: Europe.
   Methods: The distribution of butterflies in Finland, Belgium/Netherlands and Spain was modelled based on restricted-scale (local) and broad-scale (continental) distribution and climate data. Both types of models were projected under future climate change scenarios to assess potential changes in species richness.
   Results: In Finland, species richness was projected to increase strongly based on restricted-scale models and to decrease slightly with broad-scale models. In Belgium/Netherlands, restricted-scale models projected a larger decrease in richness than broad-scale models. In Spain, both models projected a slight decrease in richness. We obtained similar projections based on restricted-scale and broad-scale models only in Spain because the climatic conditions available here covered the warm part of the distributions of butterflies better than in Finland and Belgium/Netherlands.
   Main conclusions: Restricted-scale models that fail to capture the warm part of species distributions produce biased estimates of future changes in species richness when projected under climatic conditions with no modern analogue in the study area. We recommend the use of distribution data beyond the boundaries of the study area to capture the part of the species response curves reflecting the climatic conditions that will prevail within that area in the future.

AB  - A method was developed for designing 'fair' diets (not using more than globally available arable land per capita) and for assessing the sustainability of such diets. The diets were based on the principle of 'ecological leftovers' for livestock production, i.e. raising livestock on pasture and by-products not suitable for or wanted by humans. The method was applied to Sweden using three different scenarios for livestock production, all taking the starting point that semi-natural pastures should be grazed by ruminants for reasons of biodiversity conservation. The scenarios also included differing use of by-products (from crop production and food processing) to either boost milk production (I-Milk scenario) or produce eggs and pig meat (E-Milk and Suckler scenarios). In I-Milk, milk and meat were produced in intensive systems in which dairy cows and their offspring only grazed to a limited extent, resulting in the human diet containing recommended levels of dairy products (350 ml milk per day) and meat twice a week. Milk could also be exported. In E-Milk, pasture was used more for dairy cows and their offspring, resulting in fewer animals and less milk (150 ml milk per day) and four servings of meat per week. In the Suckler scenario, pasture was grazed by suckler herds providing no milk but meat four times per week. The environmental impacts of the diets were assessed using the planetary boundaries framework. The results showed substantially lower environmental impacts compared with the average current Swedish diet, but the strict absolute climate boundary and the N and P input boundaries were still exceeded for all diets. The approach adopted, of letting the ecological resource capacity act as the constraining factor for livestock production, is in line with agroecology principles and efficient use of land to improve food security, and could be useful in discussions about sustainable consumption of animal products.

AB  - While the behavior and objectives of non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners have been studied extensively, studies that systematically test the underlying measurement model are lacking in forest economic literature. Our paper reports the results obtained from a recent large-scale survey conducted in Finland in 2011 (n = 557). Results indicate a novel way to systematically analyze the objectives of forest ownership by testing the validity of the developed measurement scale using the structural equations modeling technique. From an exploratory factor analysis of 22 items measuring forest owner objectives, a four-dimensional structure is identified in the background objectives of NIPF owners. These dimensions are labeled as recreation and leisure time, sense of economic security, nature conservation and aesthetics, and timber sales income objective. Having undergone a confirmatory testing process, results from the four-dimensional model support the validity of the developed 16-item measurement model. Based on these findings, we argue that the logical NIPF owner objective structure in Finland consists of experiential forest value, as perceived in current and future time contexts, as well as of current and future economic objectives. As the theoretical structure divides forest owner objectives into the evaluation of the present objectives, supplemented with a psychological evaluation of the future objectives, a novel classification of NIPF owner objectives is suggested.

T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA  - English
KW  - FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES
KW  - EXTINCTION
AB  - Osmoderma eremita, an endangered beetle restricted to hollow trees, was surveyed in stands of different size, isolation and physical characteristics in an area in south-eastern Sweden. To infer habitat occupancy the presence/absence of fragments of adult body parts was used. Mark-release-recapture of adults with pitfall traps set in tree hollows was carried out to estimate local population size. Habitat occupancy/tree was higher in larger stands than in smaller stands, but there was no correlation between occupancy/stand and isolation of stands. This suggests dispersal is important in the population processes within stands, but not between stands. Osmoderma eremita was found in most of the larger stands and this probably mirrors the fact that the density of old-growth oaks has been much higher in the area than today. Habitat fragmentation over the last two centuries has disrupted the network of habitat patches, thus preventing dispersal into smaller, younger stands. A minimum number of suitable trees aggregated in stands seems to be necessary to provide long-term viability of local O. eremita populations. To preserve viable O. eremita populations, it is therefore necessary to increase size and connectivity of stands with hollow trees.

AB  - Dead wood is essential for biodiversity in forests and is therefore often surveyed in conservation inventories. Usually only coarse downed trees (logs) and standing dead trees (snags) are surveyed, but dead wood also occurs on living trees, in stumps, and in fallen branches. Attached, standing (including stumps) and downed dead wood with a diameter of more than I cm was surveyed in 25 semi-natural stands of temperate broadleaved woodland dominated by oak in southern Sweden (most trees younger than 70 years but with an older generation of Quercus, and often Corylus scrub). This study is primarily motivated by the rising interest in biofuel harvesting by thinning which will affect dead wood structure in forests, especially the finer dead wood fractions. The sites in this study contained on average 14.3 m(3)/ha coarse dead wood (defined as wood with a diameter >10 cm), which is more than twice as much as in production woodland. Fine dead wood (diameter 1-10 cm) made up another 12.2 m(3)/ha (45% of the total dead wood volume). Of the fine dead wood, on average 20% was oak wood and 71 % was wood from other broadleaved trees. The coarse dead wood fraction consisted equally of oak wood (46%) and wood from other broadleaved species (47%). Coniferous wood amounted to 7% (coarse dead wood) or 8% (fine dead wood). The total dead wood volume was dominated by downed (66%) and standing dead wood (22%), while attached dead wood and stumps amounted to smaller fractions (6% each). The total volume of fine dead wood did not correlate with the total volume of coarse dead wood. These results therefore suggest that fine dead wood cannot be predicted from conservation surveys of coarse dead wood. The value for biodiversity of fine dead wood is discussed, and should not be overlooked in conservation work due to the fact that for example, many fungi and insects are associated with it.

AB  - High-quality weather and climate services (WCS) can be critical for communicating knowledge about current and future weather and climate risks for adaptation and disaster risk management in the agricultural sector. This paper investigates the structure and performance of weather and climate services for farmers from a governance perspective. Empirically the paper compares the institutional design and operations of agro-meteorological services in Maharashtra/India and Norway through a 'most different case study' approach. The two cases were selected to represent great diversity in location, scale and institutional design. A governance approach based on semi-direct interviews and policy and institutional analysis was combined with local survey data of farmers' perceptions and use of the services. Despite the fact that the context for the two agromet advisory services was very different from a climate-weather, eco-agriculture and socio-institutional angle, the analysis reveals great similarities in the services structures and critical governance challenges. In both countries the agromet services communicated knowledge that was largely perceived not to be well tailored to farmers' needs for decisions in specific crops- and farm operations, spatially too coarse to address local issues, and, often unreliable or inaccurate in terms of the quality of data. Farmers did, however, respond positively to specific and locally relevant information on e.g., warnings about high rainfall and spread of pests. Observing such similarities across very diverse contexts enhances the generalization potential, precisely because they evolved under very different circumstances. Similar observations find support in the wider WCS literature. Based on the empirical findings, we propose a more deliberate approach to institutional design of WCS in order to enhance governance performance and co-creation of the services at local, district and national scales. It is suggested that greater participation of farmers and agricultural extension agents in the co-creation of these services is a necessary means of improving the services, supported by the WCS literature. However, we insist that greater participation is only likely to materialize if the deficiencies in institutional design and knowledge quality and relevance are addressed to greater extent than done today. The comparison between the two services shows that Norway can learn from India that a more ambitious scope and multiple forms of communication, including the use of social media/WhatsApp groups, can facilitate greater awareness and interest among farmers in multi-purpose agromet services for multi-way communication. India can learn from Norway that a more integrated and decentralized institutional design can strengthen the network attributes of the services, foster co-creation, and improve participation of both poor and large-scale farmers and extension agents.

AB  - The area of species-rich hay meadows in Norway has been drastically reduced during the 20th century. This continuing process results in fragmentation and isolation of remaining habitats. Small and isolated populations may have reduced gene flow. This is a crucial factor for the structure and cohesiveness of populations. Gene flow in plant species is regulated by pollen and seed dispersal, and pollen dispersal is controlled by the species' mating system. As part of a research project on habitat fragmentation three meadow species (Dactylorhiza sambucina, Hypochoeris maculata, Polygala vulgaris) with different life strategies were therefore selected for studies of their mating systems. A hand pollination experiment showed that both Dactylorhiza sambucina and Polygala vulgaris were self-compatible. Seed set in H. maculata was low and the species may be considered as pseudo-self-compatible or self-incompatible. Using Bawa's (1974) criteria, however, also Hypochoeris maculata should be considered as self-compatible. All three species enhanced outbreeding but P. vulgaris also proved to be a good selfer and autogamous.

AB  - We compared the management and housing of dairy heifers from calf to calving in herds that were very successful versus less successful in preventing mastitis in early lactation primiparous cows. This retrospective observational study included 170 Swedish dairy herds. Eligible herds were identified from the Swedish official milk recording scheme (SOMRS). Each herd had at least 60 cows per year, production data from 3 consecutive years, and at least 10 primiparous cows per year with their first milk recording 5 to 35 d after calving and their second milk recording 20 to 40 d after the first milk recording. In each herd, primiparous cows with a low (<= 75,000 cells/mL) cow somatic cell count (CSCC) at both the first and second milk recording were categorized as low-low (LL); those with a high (>100,000 cells/mL) CSCC at both recordings were categorized as high-high (HH). Cows with high CSCC at the first recording and low at the second were categorized as high-low (HL). The annual proportions of LL, HL, and HH cows within each herd were calculated. Herds with an above-median proportion of LL, HL, or HH cows during the first year of a 3-yr selection period, and above the third quartile proportion of LL, HL, or HH cows, respectively, during the second and third year were identified. These herds (LL herds, n = 129; HL herds, n = 92; HH herds, n = 139) were contacted until a maximum of 60 herds per category had agreed to participate. Field technicians/veterinarians visited each herd once in the mid to late indoor season to collect data on housing and management of the heifers from birth to calving. Additional data were retrieved from the SOMRS. Associations between herd category (LL, HL, or HH) and variables collected were analyzed in 8 multivariable multinomial logistic regression submodels covering herd characteristics, milk-fed calves, heifers in early pregnancy, heifers in late pregnancy, calving and colostrum period, miscellaneous factors, summarized heifer housing data, and general health, culling, and fertility data. A final multivariable model was built from the results of the submodels and univariable analyses. The final model showed that having a standard operating procedure for colostrum feeding was more common in LL and HL herds than in HH herds; the mean bulk milk SCC and overall culling rate due to udder health was higher in HH herds than in LL and HL herds; and automatic milking was less common in LL herds than in HL and HH herds. Several herd and management variables differed between herd categories in the submodels. In conclusion, we identified several success factors for herds with good udder health among early lactation primiparous cows. This knowledge can be used to improve preventive measures in dairy herds to ensure sustainable and economic milk production.

AB  - The research aim is to identify minimum forest areas necessary for birch (Betula pendtda) stands to provide the sustainable development of farms in forestry in Latvia. The situation in private forests was analysed, and the income level of forest owners (who are at the same time employees as well) was employed as the key indicator, which depends on the dominant tree species and forest type with suitable conditions for growth. Birch is the second dominant species of trees in Latvia behind pine (Pizzas sylvestris), as birch stands occupy 895 thou. ha or 29% of the total forest area. Sixty one percent of the total area covered by birch trees belongs to private owners; therefore, it is important to assess an opportunity to earn at least minimum income from economically managing birch stands, which is determined by forest type and the forestland moisture regime. The calculations were based on the minimum income level at EUR 10 619 per year per employee, which is equivalent to the average wage in Latvia in 2013 with employer mandatory social insurance contributions added. The research has found that growing birch trees in the forest type Oxatidosa is the most efficient way, as 93 ha under private management and 83 ha under the management of a cooperative are necessary to earn at least one minimum income.

AB  - Environmental policy research fails to integrate procedural and recognitional justice perspectives and collective actions in governance learning for just climate adaptations. Drawing on the insights of two cities experiencing climate impacts differently, Bergen (Norway) and Istanbul (Turkey), this paper assesses how collective actions influence different levels of governments (local to national) to learn from these actions to implement just climate actions in their localities. Using environmental justice (specifically recognition and procedural) and policy learning literature, we contextualize a three-governance learning typology that emerges through collective actions that may trigger governance structures for policy integration: governance learning by resisting, co-opting, and expanding. We identify what kind of learning is introduced to the existing governance structures in Bergen and Istanbul, and how that learning shapes or is shaped by the governance structures, local government in Bergen and local to national governments in Istanbul, while developing climate adaptation policies and actions. Overall, this paper shows what types of knowledge and information are incorporated or ignored after collective actions and how power mediates interactions between actors across multiple urban settings for just climate adaptation.

AB  - The most important anthropogenic sources of primary particulate matter (PM) in ambient air in Europe are exhaust and non-exhaust emissions from road traffic and combustion of solid biomass. There is convincing evidence that PM, almost regardless of source, has detrimental health effects. An important issue in health impact assessments is what metric, indicator and exposure-response function to use for different types of PM. The aim of this study is to describe sectorial contributions to PM exposure and related premature mortality for three Swedish cities: Gothenburg, Stockholm and Umea. Exposure is calculated with high spatial resolution using atmospheric dispersion models. Attributed premature mortality is calculated separately for the main local sources and the contribution from long-range transport (LRT), applying different relative risks. In general, the main part of the exposure is due to LRT, while for black carbon, the local sources are equally or more important. The major part of the premature deaths is in our assessment related to local emissions, with road traffic and residential wood combustion having the largest impact. This emphasizes the importance to resolve within-city concentration gradients when assessing exposure. It also implies that control actions on local PM emissions have a strong potential in abatement strategies.

AB  - The harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) experiences high rates of incidental mortality in commercial fisheries, and in some areas these rates are sufficiently high to justify concern over population sustainability. Given the high incidental mortality, the resolution of population structure will be important to conservation and management, but in the North Atlantic the relationships among many of the putative populations remain unclear. A previous genetic study demonstrated substantial genetic differences between eastern and western North Atlantic populations, however the location of this break remained unresolved. In the present study, we addressed this issue by including new samples from Iceland. To investigate population structure, variation in the mitochondrial DNA of 370 porpoises was compared among six locations corresponding to several of the putative populations (Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, West Greenland, Iceland, Norway). The first 342 base pairs of the control region were sequenced and genetic variation investigated by analysis of molecular variance (F-ST and Phi(ST)) and chi(2) with permutation. Although some fine scale population structure was detected, porpoises from Iceland were found to be more similar to the western populations (W. Greenland, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, Gulf of Maine) than to Norway. Furthermore, porpoises from Norway were different from all other regions. These patterns suggest the existence of a discontinuity between Iceland and Norway, possibly the result of isolating events caused by repeated range contractions and expansions throughout Quaternary glaciation events within the North Atlantic. These results suggest that harbour porpoise populations within the North Atlantic are distinguishable, but patterns must be interpreted in light of their historical biogeography.

AB  - Questions: Could the seed bank increase biodiversity during restoration of abandoned, species-poor, formerly cultivated vegetation? Is it possible to identify how climate, soil and former and present management and vegetation affected the seed bank?
   Location: The study sites were eight abandoned grasslands, four in Orkdal, central Norway and four in Gaular, western Norway.
   Methods: 144 seed bank samples were collected from three depths. Each sample was sown and placed in a greenhouse. After three months, the trays were dried and stored at 4 C in a dry place for two months. This was repeated twice.
   Results: There was a separation of the two regions along the first DCA axis in both the seed bank and in the vegetation analysis and also a clear separation of the seed bank from the vegetation along the second axis. These results are caused by differences in former management as well as temperature, precipitation and soil type between Gaular and Orkdal. We found more annuals, short-lived species and species demanding light open conditions in the seed bank than in the vegetation probably because these species have the capacity for producing persistent seeds. Most of the species found only in the seed bank were found in very few samples and with few individuals.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that it may be difficult to increase vegetation biodiversity through restoration of grasslands such as those investigated if the natural soil seed bank is the main seed source.

AB  - Increasing production to meet the growing demand for food whilst conserving biodiversity and reducing pressure on natural ecosystems is a dual planetary challenge of the highest order. The world's small farmers are at the forefront of this challenge, being asked to make greater contributions to both enhancing food and nutrition security, and to the stewardship of natural assets. We focus on rewilding involving the conservation, management, and reintroduction of species, and how the praxis impacts small farmers in Europe, simultaneously being encouraged to increase food production. We present empirical data from four European case studies featuring Norwegian wolves, Scottish Sea Eagles, and wild boar in both Spain and Italy. We adopt Beck's World Risk Society concept to situate what small farmers report as trade-offs, within a broader sociological schema, to show underlying features of a new landscape.

AB  - Since the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972, the discourse has evolved from an initial focus on sustainable development to green and blue growth. Blue growth necessitates a different focus from business-as-usual policy as regards the fishing industry, requiring enhanced research and investment in value generating, clean aquatic-related activities. Given this change, the question emerges of whether the current policy environment is equipped to stimulate increased research and investment efforts within the fishing industry, sufficient to encourage the industry to contribute to blue growth. Do the fishing industries in the Nordic countries realise an opportunity in blue growth in the next several years and what drivers and barriers do they perceive in this regard? This paper relies on in-depth, semi-structured, elite interviews conducted in Iceland and Norway to reveal the perspectives of the fishing industry regarding the perceived drivers and barriers for investing in blue growth. Policy implications and possible directions for enhancing national policies to support the fishing industry in contributing to blue growth are addressed in the discussion.

AB  - Livestock depredation by large carnivores entails economic damage to farmers in many parts of the world. The aim of this paper is to analyse and compare the costs of livestock depredation by carnivores in Sweden across different carnivore species and counties. To this end, we estimate the government's compensation cost function using Swedish data on the county level over the period of 2001 to 2013. Compensation costs due to depredation by three large carnivores are considered: the brown bear (Ursus arctos), the wolf (Canis lupus) and the lynx (Lynx lynx). The results show that a 1% increase in the density of the carnivores leads to a 03-0.4% increase in compensation costs, whereas a 1% increase in the density of sheep results in a 0.8 and 1.1% increase in the compensation costs for brown bears and wolves, respectively. A larger share of unfenced pastures is associated with higher compensation costs for brown bear. The marginal cost of an additional carnivore individual varies considerably between counties, ranging between 1 and 82 EUR for lynxes, 0 and 266 EUR for brown bears, and 52 and 1067 EUR for wolves.

AB  - This article explores the construction of the green wedge in the planning discourse in Helsinki's Central Park over three phases: its establishment in the early twentieth century, the first statutory plan of the 1970s and in the present context. Often described in quantitative methods emphasising physical and spatial qualities, the study instead examines the conceptual and historical dimensions of the park. The thematic analysis of the planning discourse looks at four principles characteristic of the green wedge model- the relationship between the park and the city; the continuity and connection from the centre to the outskirts; recreation and health; and nature as beauty and biodiversity. With the focus on the consistencies and changes, this study highlights the resilience of this over 100-year-old green wedge and demonstrates that Central Park has been able to accommodate new needs and functions while sustaining most of its original aims.

TI  - DISTRIBUTION OF CORDED WARE IN THE AREAS NORTH OF THE GULF OF FINLAND - AN UPDATE
T2  - ESTONIAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Research of the Corded Ware phenomenon in the areas north of the Gulf of Finland has been scanty during the last several decades, and consequently outdated views, distribution maps, and numbers of finds still prevail. This paper aims to update data on the distribution of Corded Ware in Finland and Karelia (Russia), and to discuss the results in the context of the old research tradition, and to highlight some aspects of the northern Corded Ware. The current data shows that there are ca 360 Corded Ware settlement sites, 30 burial sites and over 1300 stray find locations of battle axes in the research area. Contrary to much of Europe the areas north of the Gulf of Finland accommodate a large amount of settlement sites but only a few burials. No singular reason for this can be pointed out but the most likely explanations include modest later land use at the locations, factors related to archaeological visibility and research methods, and also to local Corded Ware cultural practices. Despite certain short-comings the northern Corded Ware material is exceptional and holds a great potential for further studies of the phenomenon, especially its domestic sphere and everyday practices.

AB  - In UNESCO's recent publication Education for Sustainable Development: A Roadmap the idea of community is described as playing an important role in the organization of education for sustainable development as a means of supporting transformations towards sustainability. In the present study we examine the relationship between community and the organization of Early Childhood Education and Care for Sustainability (ECECfS). This examination is based on case studies of Swedish preschool teachers' perspectives and practices in relation to ECECfS. Drawing on Cultural Historical Activity Theory and the concept of ontological Communities of Learners, we describe ways in which community-based characteristics of the preschools shape and are shaped by cultural tools used to pursue ECECfS. Themed-Project Work (TPW), a common means in Swedish preschools of organizing day-today activities, emerged as an important practice through which to examine questions of community within and across preschools. We describe organizational tensions concerning how pedagogical practices like TPW change from being tools to support a preschool's activities, to being objects toward which these activities are oriented. Such changes can enable or constrain a preschool's possibilities for building pluralistic and democratic ECEC environments. We also discuss how the said organizational tensions are rooted in how community is conceived of in preschool provision. Community is constituted not only through the relationships among members of individual preschools but also through the relationships that preschools have with other preschools in their administrative networks. We discuss contradictions that emerge in this matrix of relationships that shape how preschools enact good governance in the pursuit of ECECfS.

AB  - The growing interest for alternative food initiatives has ignited the debate on scaling-up such initiatives. Empirical studies on such initiatives tend to ignore the underlying psychological constructs that affect farmers' intentions and decisions. This paper investigates the intention to scale-up their businesses in Sweden based on a survey of 338 Short Food Supply Chain producers utilising the construct of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) as a theoretical framework. The findings show that attitude can be considered the most important driver for their intention to scale-up their business. Also, the perceived level of control and the positive perception of personal referents, i.e. family members, co-workers and consumers, foster their intention to scale-up. In contrast, perceptions of other farmers and competitors as well as the perception of framework conditions (e.g. state support, availability of financial resources) do not have any significant influence. However, several socio-economic characteristics such as size of farm, type of production and use of infrastructure are identified as significant influences. This insight is relevant for the numerous countries experiencing growing interests in alternative food initiatives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Visionary imaginaries of desirable 'smart' urban energy futures entice city governments into innovation and collaboration aimed at large-scale urbanism. As part of attending to actualizations and materializations of 'smart' urban imaginaries, this paper contributes to moving beyond idealized framings of smart urban publics, towards more embedded reflexive accounts of how 'real people' in urban contexts make sense of and reason about smart urban developments. Through a living lab intervention in Bergen, Norway, we open up a space for critical deliberation, to explore situated imaginations and geographies of smart urban futures. We analyse how people reason about their experiences with smart technological devices, expanding on existing practice-oriented urban studies by applying the pragmatic framework of 'regimes of engagement'. We analyse shifts people make between different regimes of argumentation and justification, showing how participants pragmatically handle their (simultaneous) status as energy consumers, urban citizens, and responsible users in an urban energy grid.

AB  - Prior studies have recognized the importance of events in destination branding, but the focus has been on the roles of mega-events or sport events, while smaller cultural and free-time events have received far less attention. The stakeholder involvement in destination branding has also been attracting interest lately by many researchers, but there is lack of knowledge on how to utilize events in the branding processes. This study aims to fill the research gap through a case study in the South Savo region, eastern Finland. The purpose of this study is to examine the roles events have in destination branding, and how events are involved in cocreating the destination brand. The empirical data were collected through 13 semistructured interviews of event organizers and local tourism developers. The study identified four different roles and several involvement methods. The findings revealed the importance and potential of organized events in the branding, but it also revealed that they are not yet effectively utilized at the destination. However, there is a consensus about the importance of stakeholder involvement and a common will towards involving events in the branding process. The findings of this study can be utilized by tourism developers and stakeholders to improve destination branding processes.

AB  - Carabid data compiled from six independent studies, consisting of 97 799 individuals trapped by pitfalls from Finnish agricultural fields and identified to I 11 species were analyzed. Shannon-Wiener H' diversity index was typically around 2.5 and expected species number rarefied to 600 trapped individuals was typically around 30 species. The five most abundant species accounted for 42% of the total catch, and the thirty most abundant species made up 98% of the total catch. Percentage similarities among the assemblages by PS-index were from 16% to 48%. In comparison to published data about carabid diversity in boreal forests, which form the dominating habitat matrix in which Finnish farmland is embedded as relatively small patches, arable fields harbor more species rich assemblages, with more even rank-abundance distributions but variable species composition. Importance of landscape (regional) level, instead of spatial level of crop fields, in understanding carabid diversity in farmland is discussed. Inclusion of carabids into monitoring schemes of agro-biodiversity at landscape level is suggested.

AB  - In the important coastal fishery for Atlantic cod in Norway quality-based pricing is largely absent. Thus, driven by a focus on fish quantity, not quality, a high share of downgraded fish is landed. This study identified some encouraging exceptions with actors trying to align incentives and increase revenues in both fishing and processing. More specifically, we examine two cases involving quality-enhancing fishing and find indications of substantial improvements in fish quality and importantly, that this is rewarded with higher prices. In a revenue sharing arrangement with a focus on high quality fish delivered outside of the main season, fishers obtain approximately 50 % higher prices than comparable vessels fishing with the same gear in the same period. In the other case, fishers' "skip" the Norwegian ex-vessel market and sell their high-quality cod catches at Danish auctions at significantly higher prices than comparable vessels fishing in the same area and delivering in South Norway. The cases may guide fishers and fish buyers in increasing revenues through quality-enhancing fishing but also involve important dilemmas for policymakers which are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - The origin and developmental history of Fagus sylvatica forests in south-eastern Norway have been studied through pollen analysis and AMS radiocarbon-dating of peat from two small forest hollows. In this area F. sylvatica appears to have a long history, from the first occurrence of F. sylvatica pollen at ca. 9100 cal. b.p. to its local expansion ca. 1300-1200 cal. b.p. At this time a shift from a diverse landscape mosaic with many plant taxa present, including broad-leaved trees, to a less diverse landscape mosaic with Picea abies and F. sylvatica trees is interpreted from the pollen data. The long history of F. sylvatica suggests that the existing forests are not recent plantations, but implies that these forests are native. The presence of pollen indicative of anthropogenic activity combined with charcoal before the expansion of F. sylvatica, as well as comparison with data from nearby sites, suggest that the forest development was likely to be a result of human activity and climatic changes, particularly changes in moisture conditions.

AB  - Many bird species typical to farmland have declined in numbers in recent decades. Some farmland bird species occur outside farmland in other open man-made habitats, such as forest clear-cuts. Given that in Sweden the total area of clear-cuts (5-6 %) almost equals that of farmland (8 %), clear-cuts have the potential to be an important habitat for some farmland birds. We investigated how bird community composition and species abundance on Swedish clear-cuts varied with geographical region, clear-cut characteristics and the surrounding landscape, with special focus on farmland species. Based on short visits in 2017-2019, we surveyed the occurrence of birds on 300 representative clear-cuts in Sweden, including six regions and 1300 km of latitude. We counted 1170 birds of 66 different species, including 10 out of 15 bird species in existing farmland bird indicators. Both bird community composition and species abundance varied with clear-cut size, age, vegetation height, region and proportion of nearby farmland, depending on species' ecology. All six farmland species being proportionally common on clear-cuts are, when in farmland, dependent on residual habitats such as pastures and field borders with bushes and trees. In contrast, a third of the dedicated farmland species were scarce in clear-cuts, probably avoiding them because of predator-related avoidance of forest edges and/or a lack of suitable nest sites or food resources. To determine the full importance of forest clear-cuts for farmland species, and potentially make them more favourable for farmland birds, more studies are needed on the reproductive success on clear-cuts and which site features make them suitable habitat. This study did not determine the consequences of clear-cuts for forest birds across the forest cycle, consequences which needs to be balanced against any gains for farmland birds.

AB  - The integration of infrastructure domains and resource flows such as electricity, heat, water and waste increasingly gains currency in strategies to achieve more resource-efficient, smart and resilient cities. While widely discussed concepts of a nexus of resource systems, such as energy-water-food, aim at a more optimised and integrative management of resource flows, this article investigates how infrastructure integration is accomplished through the establishment of new interfaces and junctions between formerly separated systems. In particular, it focuses on households as an arena where different urban infrastructures intersect and different kinds of sometimes contradicting demands are imposed to co-manage these infrastructures, such as in the case of own electricity generation from photovoltaics along with the charging of electric cars and the management of household energy consumption. The installation of meters and the constant monitoring of resource use and consumption feedback to household members is regarded as a crucial element in such a transition towards more sustainable urban infrastructures. Empirically, the article studies the introduction of hot tap water meters in urban households in Sweden and the resistance and reactions of these households to such a metering regime. Our study shows how meters as new junctions between energy suppliers and users but also between separate infrastructures of electricity, hot tap water and room heating become contested political terrains which are linked to broader socio-political questions of urban change. In contrast to system management perspectives, such an 'inside-out' approach rather lends itself to context-sensitive and navigational governance approaches of infrastructure integration.

AB  - Marine protected areas have become one of the main tools in the battle to curb marine biodiversity loss and habitat degradation. Yet, implementation of permanent fishery closures has often generated resource user conflicts that ultimately undermine conservation goals. Here we assessed the influence of an alternative and often more accepted measure - seasonal fish spawning closures - on large predatory fish and coastal food webs in the western Baltic Sea (Sweden). In spring 2017, we conducted a multivariable field survey in 11 seasonal closures and 11 paired references areas open to fishing. In each area, pike was sampled through angling, and perch and mesopredators through gillnet surveys. To assess trophic cascades, we measured zooplankton abun-dance and loss of tethered gammarids from predation. Catches per unit effort of northern pike (Esox lucius) - the main target species in recreational fisheries - were ca. 2.5 times higher per unit effort in closures than reference areas; an effect that may be caused by higher abundance and/or higher catchability of pike in the absence of fishing. Catch and weight per unit effort of the more common predator European perch (Perca fluviatilus), and the mesopredators roach (Rutilus rutilus) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in survey nets were, however, unaffected by closures. Moreover, a previously hypothesized trophic cascade from perch to zooplankton via three-spined stickleback was supported by the analyses, but appeared independent of closures. Yet, predation risk for tethered gammarid amphipods (a prey of stickleback and an important grazer on mac-roalgae) was three times higher in fished areas than in closures; a cascading closure effect that may potentially be caused by small predatory fish being less active in protected areas to avoid pike predation. Overall, our results suggest that spawning closures impact pike abundance and/or behavior and could help limit the effects of fishing, but that more research is needed to disentangle i) what mechanism(s) that underlie the protection effect on pike catches, ii) the apparently weaker closure impacts on other fish species, as well as iii) the potential for cascading effects on lower trophic levels. Therefore, new seasonal spawning closures should be implemented in addition to (and not instead of) much-needed permanent closures, which have well-known effects on the wider ecosystem.

AB  - Managing animal units is essential in biological conservation and requires spatial and temporal identification of such units. Since even neighbouring populations often have different conservation status and face different levels of anthropogenic pressure, detailed knowledge of population structure, seasonal range and overlap with animals from neighbouring populations is required to manage each unit separately. Previous studies on genetic structure and morphologic separation suggests three distinct populations of harbour porpoises with limited geographic overlap in the North Sea (NS), the Belt Sea (BS) and the Baltic Proper (BP) region. In this study, we aim to identify a management unit for the BS population of harbour porpoises. We use Argos satellite data and genetics from biopsies of tagged harbour porpoises as well as acoustic data from 40 passive acoustic data loggers to determine management areas with the least overlap between populations and thus the least error when abundance and population status is estimated. Discriminant analysis of the satellite tracking data from the BS and NS populations showed that the best fit of the management unit border during the summer months was an east-west line from Denmark to Sweden at latitude 56.95 degrees N. For the border between BS and BP, satellite tracking data indicate a sharp decline in population density at 13.5 degrees E, with 90% of the locations being west of this line. This was supported by the acoustic data with the average daily detection rate being 27.5 times higher west of 13.5 degrees E as compared to east of 13.5 degrees E. By using this novel multidisciplinary approach, we defined a management unit for the BS harbour porpoise population. We recommend that these boundaries are used for future monitoring efforts of this population under the EU directives. The boundaries may also be used for conservation efforts during the summer months, while seasonal movements of harbour porpoises should be considered during winter. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Monitoring of species and their ecosystem attributes is a fundamental requirement in applied ecology and conservation. However, landscape scale monitoring requires an immense effort and commitment, especially when species have a wide distribution or are migratory in nature. Participatory monitoring, whereby local communities are engaged, is increasingly being proposed to address landscape scale monitoring. Its implementation is met with many challenges related to finances, motivation of the local people, lack of trained manpower, and nondirect legal use of the species in question. It is of interest to determine what makes a participatory monitoring program interesting for locals to ensure their long term engagement. Using the unique 26-year program of hunters' observations of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden as a case study, we present the evolution of this highly successful participatory monitoring program and show that tackling the motivation to monitor, early involvement of local NGOs, social activities revolving around use of the resource, the biology and economic value of the species, and technical and practical aspects related to the monitoring, together create a successful participatory monitoring program. When users benefit directly from the resource, participate in conservation/management decision making, socialize with other participants, and get rewards for their commitment and effective monitoring, participatory monitoring schemes can then become rewarding and sustainable.

AB  - We combine previously separate models of Northern European power markets, local district heating and cooling (DHC2) systems, and biomass supply in a single modelling framework to study local and system level impacts of bioenergy technologies in phasing out fossil fuels from a DHC system of the Finnish capital. We model multiple future scenarios and assess the impacts on energy security, flexibility provision, economic performance, and emissions. In the case of Helsinki, heat only boiler is a robust solution from economic and climate perspective, but reduces local electricity self-sufficiency. Combined heat and power solution is more valuable investment for the system than for the city indicating a conflict of interest and biased results in system level models. Bringing a biorefinery near the city to utilize excess heat would reduce emissions and increase investment's profitability, but biomass availability might be a bigger limiting factor. Our results show that the availability of domestic biomass resources constrains bio-based technologies in Southern Finland and further highlights the importance of considering both local and system level impacts. Novel option to boost biorefinery's production with hydrogen from excess electricity is beneficial with increasing shares of wind power. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper explores how climate change adaptation concerns were integrated into the Swedish forestry debate and policy process during the period of 1990-2012, and draws lessons on barriers and opportunities identified in this process. Using a framework focusing on "advocacy coalitions", we analyze how the adaptation debate in the forestry sector evolved over the period; who the main advocates for and against adaptation were; and which main arguments and processes affected the debate and policy. The results show that academics advocating climate change adaptation, aided by outside influences, such as political pressure for adaptation responses and the negative impacts of the 2005 storm Gudrun, contributed to an increased general awareness and understanding of adaptation issues amongst forestry stakeholders. Nonetheless, the strong dominance of actors arguing for increased forest production and the limited number and relatively poor organization of adaptation advocates have acted as barriers to mainstreaming adaptation concerns into forestry policy and practice. The dominant coalitions and their values have also determined the direction of debate and policy. The main conclusions for policymakers aiming to further this integration process are the importance of stimulating adaptation coalitions and the value of creating arenas for multiple stakeholder learning about adaptation.

AB  - Based on a meta-study, the paper describes the existing options, areal extents, and Swedish farmers' conditions for energy crop production promoted by the governments to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The drivers of and barriers to cultivating various energy crops are described in terms of a variety of motivational factors. The approach used peer-reviewed and gray literature using three Internet sources. Questions addressed include the energy crops available to Swedish farmers and how well established they are in terms of areal extent. What drivers of and barriers to growing energy crops do farmers perceive? How do various motivational factors for these drivers and barriers correspond to the adoption of certain energy crops? The results indicate that 13 energy-related crops are available, of which straw (a residue), oil crops, and wheat are the most extensively produced in terms of cultivated area. Results confirm earlier research findings that converting from annual to perennial crops and from traditional crops or production systems to new ones are important barriers. Economic motivations for changing production systems are strong, but factors such as values (e.g., esthetic), knowledge (e.g., habits and knowledge of production methods), and legal conditions (e.g., cultivation licenses) are crucial for the change to energy crops. Finally, there are knowledge gaps in the literature as to why farmers decide to keep or change a production system. Since the Swedish government and the EU intend to encourage farmers to expand their energy crop production, this knowledge of such motivational factors should be enhanced. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the last years, a shift in the promotion of sustainable development in Higher Education from a focus on universities' core areas of teaching and research to "whole institution approaches" with an emphasis on the operational management of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can be observed in different countries. With the aim to foster sustainability, HEIs have increasingly built cross-sectoral networks, involving not only academics but also practitioners in order to relate sustainability not only to research but also to outreach activities. Although there is an increasing body of literature evaluating such initiatives according to supposedly objective management criteria and indicators, there is still a lack of studies that investigate how the social meaning of knowledge production is (re-)negotiated in and through these partnerships. In this article, we analyze how individuals engaged in a cross-sector partnership make sense of the organizational dilemmas and ambiguities that stem from the complexity of working together across sectors in pursuit of an integrative approach to knowledge production. With the term "sector" we refer to the professional affiliations of the individuals involved in the partnerships, e.g., higher education, administration, formal education or non-governmental organizations. We focus on an illustrative cross-sectoral partnership: The Institute for Sustainable Urban Development (ISU), a collaborative project between Malmo University and Malmo's city administration to facilitate research and planning collaborations between both organizations in respect to furthering sustainable urban (re-)development and higher education in Malmo, Sweden. By employing a constant comparative approach based on Grounded Theory to analyze data collected with focus groups, semi-structured qualitative interviews and document analysis, we claim that rather than entering a partnership with predefined identities, values and sectoral or professional preferences, individuals engage in a narrative struggle about the organizational character of their partnership. Accordingly, an important avenue for investigating cross-sector partnerships is to explore the constructive dilemma of different organizing principles in a cross-sector partnership, and the way people negotiate the boundaries between them. For the cross-sector partnership studied the constructive dilemma for those engaging in it was to separate and link project, organizational and network organizing principles in their work. Implementing whole institutions approaches in order to promote sustainable development in and through HEIs, would accordingly profit much from a deeper analytical investigation of the process of navigating professional identities and organizational narrative(s) in boundary-spanning, cross-sector partnerships.

AB  - Managed forest stands are typically younger and structurally less diverse than natural forests. Introduction of non-native tree species might increase the structural changes to managed forest stands, but detailed analyses of tree-and stand-structures of native and non-native managed forests are often lacking. Improved knowledge of non-native forest structure could help clarify their multiple values (e.g. habitat for native biodiversity, bioenergy opportunities). We studied the structural differences between the introduced, non-native Pinus contorta and the native Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies over young forest stand ages (13-34 years old) in managed forests in northern Sweden. We found that P. contorta stands had greater mean basal areas, tree heights, diameters at breast height, and surface area of living branches than the two native species in young stands. The surface area of dead attached branches was also greater in P. contorta than P. abies. Although this indicates greater habitat availability for branch-living organisms, it also contributes to the overall more shaded conditions in stands of P. contorta. Only one older 87 years old P. contorta stand was available, and future studies will tell how structural differences between P. contorta and native tree species develop over the full forestry cycle.

AB  - BackgroundEvery walk takes place in a route environment, and it can play an important role in deterring or facilitating walking, and will always affect the environmental unwell-well-being of pedestrians. The aim of this study is to illuminate which the important route environmental variables are in this respect. The focus is, therefore, on pedestrians' perceptions of route environmental variables and how they relate to overall appraisals of route environments as hindering-stimulating for walking and unsafe-safe for reasons of traffic. MethodsCommuting pedestrians in the inner urban area of Stockholm, Sweden (n = 294, 49.5 +/- 10.4 years, 77% women), were recruited via advertisements. They evaluated their commuting route environments using a self-report tool, the Active Commuting Route Environment Scale (ACRES). Correlation, multiple regression, and mediation analyses were used to study the relationships between the variables and the outcome variables. ResultsAesthetics and greenery appear to strongly stimulate walking, whereas noise, a proxy for motorized traffic, hinders it. Furthermore, aesthetics is positively related to traffic safety, whereas conflicts have the opposite role. Conflicts is an intermediate outcome, representing several basic environmental variables, some of which were directly and negatively related to unsafe-safe traffic. ConclusionRoute environmental variables appear to be potent factors in deterring or facilitating walking. This knowledge is of importance for policymakers and urban planners when designing route environments with the aim of attracting new pedestrians, and simultaneously stimulating those who already walk to keep on.

AB  - This study surveyed 1562 wellness tourists in Finland, the St. Petersburg area, and Lithuania to explore what were their motivations for taking a wellness trip, to investigate what differences there were between different nationalities and determine how wellness tourists could be segmented based on their motivation. As most previous studies analysed wellness tourism motivations in one chosen destination, this study fills the gap in cross-cultural analysis of motivations. Exploratory factor analysis revealed six motivational factors including status, beauty and appearance, personal development, nature and outdoors, socialization, and resting and relaxation, the latter factor being dominant across all nationality groups. Seemingly unrelated regression analysis revealed significant differences in terms of the importance of beautification, improving physical condition, nature, and the desire to indulge in luxury experiences.

AB  - The structure of the Finnish forest sector is in transition due to institutional, social and market-driven factors. While non-industrial private forest owners have been researched extensively, the pressures faced by public forest owners have been left relatively unexplored. Our study is a part of a broader research programme attempting to form new understanding concerning the municipal forest owners in Finland. Our research questions were: (1) how are municipal forests divided into different usage categories, (2) how is their current usage expected to change in the future, (3) what various preferences exist among municipal decision-makers concerning the use of municipal forests, (4) what various aims might the different decision-making preferences represent (both conflicting and complementing), (5) do municipal decision-makers representing different types of municipal backgrounds elicit differences in the way they orientate themselves towards forest usage? Survey data were collected during 2011-2012 using a web-based questionnaire sent to all continental municipalities in Finland. Responses were received from 139 municipalities (a response rate of 43%). Based on the survey, there is need for multifunctional municipal forest management. However, service markets seem to mostly support commercial forest usage. Besides timber production, a four-dimensional structure describing decision-making in municipal forest management was linked with (a) nonwood economic values of forests, (b) health effects of forests, (c) image of the municipality and (d) carbon neutrality goals.

AB  - Beneficial utilisation of process industry residues provides possibilities to reduce energy consumption, to avoid environmental impacts caused by increasing land-filling and promotes sustainable management of natural resources. As traditional utilisation of steel industry residues lies within the realm of civil construction, complementary applications could be found from the integration with pulp and paper industry residues to promote sustainable forest management through forest soil amendment. In our study we show that three different soil amendment matrices, providing slow release and materials handling advantages, were successfully produced according to conventional cement testing practices. The concepts we develop for forest soil amendment incorporate the use of fly ash in tandem with granulated blast furnace or steel slag as binder materials, the utilisation of paper mill sludge as reactive aggregate and the use of green liquor dregs and lime waste from chemical pulping as alkaline components. The neutralising (35.8-38.6%) and reactivity (33.3-38.0%) values (expressed as Ca-equivalents d.w.) with supporting high pH-values (12.9-13.0) indicate liming and buffering capacities of the test matrix materials are comparable to commercial ground limestone products. Additionally, concentrations of Ca, K and Mg and concentrations of Cu, Mn and Zn were found to be higher than organic and mineral soils normally found in the Ostrobothnia region of Northern Finland. Only under severe leaching test conditions (HNO3 and HCl microwave digestion) did the total concentration of Cr in the soil amendment matrix exceed respective Finnish statutory limit value set for the use of fertilisers in forestry. However, as illustrated by the leaching procedure, less than a fifth of the total Cr is likely to become mobile in conditions normally found in nature.

AB  - The demand for foresight on how climate change will alter the competitiveness of ski destinations continues to increase. Norway is often considered the country where modern skiing began, yet its climate change risk remains largely unknown. The SkiSim2 model is run with RCP 4.5 and 8.5 emission climate futures to analyse implications for ski season at 110 alpine ski areas in Norway in the 2030s, 2050s, and 20805 with only natural snow and with advanced snowmaking. A considerable shortening of the ski season in projected as early as the 2030s for the half of ski areas that currently lack snowmaking. Naturally snow reliable ski areas decline from approximately half in the 2030s to a third in the 2050s. With snowmaking, ski season losses are substantially reduced and the majority of ski areas remain snow reliable until the end of the twenty-first century in a lower emission future. A substantial shortening of the ski season (up to 40 days) nonetheless begins in the 2050s under a high emission scenario. The need to invest in snowmaking will continue to increase, with attendant financial and sustainability implications. The differential climate risk among five regions of Norway and the European Alps is also discussed.

AB  - Red wood ants (RWA) of the Formica rufa group are ecosystem engineers and important species in boreal and temperate forests. However, the permanent and temporal loss of forest habitats is a serious threat to their existence and is likely to increase with climate change. Due to the current threat of losing species, quick actions are needed. Reported here is the biogeography, relative abundance and habitat preferences of five species of RWA in Finland based on citizen science data. Species that occur in the lowlands of the Alps also occur throughout the southern parts of Finland. Only two of the five species, F. aquilonia Yarrow, 1955 and F. lugubris Zetterstedt, 1838, were common throughout the country, including northern Lapland. As their name suggests, RWAs occur mostly in forests and forest edges, but they also sometimes inhabit open or semi-open yards, mires and meadows. The most forest-specialist species is F. aquilonia and the least F. rufa Linnaeus, 1761. Surprisingly, the meadow wood ant F. pratensis Retzius, 1783 is the second most forest dwelling species, however, its preference for forest edges is clearly higher than for forest interiors. Based on current data, F. rufa may be the most tolerant of living close to buildings as its relative abundance in yards was much higher than that of the other species. The data obtained on distributions and relative abundances could be compared in the future with the results of similar surveys to detect changes in species distributions, relative abundances and habitat preferences.

AB  - The main aim of this article is to present results of the Waterpraxis project and to share the project experience. The Waterpraxis project entitled "From theory and plans to eco-efficient and sustainable practices to improve the status of the Baltic Sea," partly funded by the EU Baltic Sea Region Program 2007-2013, focuses on developing water management practices, as well as on preparing water protection action plans and measures for selected pilot sites around the Baltic Sea to meet environmental objectives of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Waterpraxis identifies needs for improvement of current water management practices and, on the basis of experience gathered during the project, proposes also some changes to current practices. In addition, it provides improved water management action plans and makes it possible to prepare a set of investment plans for selected measures in the project's pilot areas in Poland, Lithuania, Denmark, and Finland. The study area in Poland is the Sulejow Reservoir (Lodz Region, Central Poland). The artificial reservoir is a typical shallow lowland water body covering a large area and is particularly prone to eutrophication, which is determined by a relatively long retention period, shallow depth, and the impact of the inflow of rivers and the direct basin. As a result, the project provides a significant improvement in the level of protection of the local environment. Implementation of the project will also have a positive impact on the standards of living and business environment in the area of the Sulejow Reservoir. It will also contribute significantly to improving quality of life in the area and raise environmental awareness among both local authorities and inhabitants.

AB  - To an increasing degree, rural landscapes are being transformed into sites for leisure. Even though tourism is welcomed as a rescue plank of agricultural communities in decline, it may at the same time also be associated with unwanted changes. In case where the natures within these landscapes are labelled as wilderness by conservationists and tourist industries alike, inhabitants of local communities may perceive that the social and cultural aspects of the landscapes they themselves strongly identify with are being disregarded. These issues are approached through explorations of how local anglers and hunters in rural communities of the south-eastern part of Norway react to new trends within angling and hunting tourism. In particular, it is looked at in terms of how meanings of wilderness emerge through anglers' and hunters' diverse modes of engaging with natures and the various landscapes. As fish and game are killed and consumed, at least some local anglers and hunters like to understand it as acts of commitment to the landscapes. While the "naturalness" of fish and game is a precarious question in a wilderness perspective, which is often associated with visiting anglers and hunters, local practices, where forest and mountains areas are experienced as extensions of the declining agricultural practices of the settlements, imply to a greater extent that the "culturalness" of animals are enacted. It has been concluded that strong voices among the local inhabitants express views which imply that non-consumptive hunters and anglers are made into symbols of a faired process in which their own landscape is being transformed into a leisurely landscape commoditized as wilderness.

AB  - Disasters and climate change impacts, as well as increased water demand, pose serious risks to the provision of sustainable urban water services, e.g., drinking water, sanitation, and safe drainage, especially in cities. These challenges call for a transition toward improved water management, including considerations of "resilience." However, because the resilience concept has multidisciplinary origins it is open to multiple interpretations, which poses a challenge to understanding and operationalizing the concept. We explore how resilience thinking can be translated into urban water practice to develop the conceptual understanding of transitions toward sustainability. The study is based on a literature review, interviews with water experts, as well as four case studies in South Africa, India, Sweden, and the Philippines. We identify seven key principles or attributes of urban water resilience and the related transition process. We find that resilience building needs to discern between and manage three levels (i.e., socioeconomic, external hazard considerations, and larger social-ecological systems) to be sustainable. In addition, we find that human agency is a strong driver of transition processes, with a certain level of risk awareness and risk perception providing one threshold and a certain capacity for action to implement measures and reorganize in response to risks being another. The difficulty of achieving "knowledge to action" derives from the multiple challenges of crossing these two types of identified thresholds. To address long-term trends or stressors, we find an important role for social learning to ensure that the carrying capacity of urban water services is not exceeded or unwanted consequences are created (e.g., long-term trends like salinization and water depletion). We conclude that the resilience term and related concepts add value to understanding and addressing the dynamic dimension of urban water transitions if the key principles identified in this study are considered.

AB  - Gathering information on how invasive species utilize the habitat is important, in order to better aim actions to reduce their negative impact. We studied habitat use and selection of 55 GPS-marked raccoon dogs (30 males, 25 females) at their invasion front in Northern Sweden, with particular focus on differences between males and females, between movement states, and between seasons and times of the day. Daily movement pattern was used to classify GPS-locations into dispersing and settled. We focused on both anthropogenic and natural landscape characteristics. Since we did not have any a priori knowledge about the spatial scale of raccoon dog habitat selection, we first assessed how landscape characteristics of random points changed with distance from the GPS-location they were paired to. Because changes in habitat use became less pronounced at approximately 5 km for all variables, we focused on habitat use at two spatial scales: fine (500 m) and coarse (5 km). Habitat selection was strongest at the coarse scale, and reflected the results found for habitat use. Raccoon dogs selected agricultural areas and wetlands, lower altitudes, and shallow slopes, and avoided forests, open natural areas, and areas close to water and roads. There were no differences in habitat selection between males and females, or between movement states. This lack of sexual segregation increases the probability of encountering potential mates during dispersal, and therefore the likelihood for reproduction in new areas. The seasonal and diurnal pattern of habitat use may provide guidance for where and when to aim management efforts.

AB  - In this paper we present a suggestion for a sustainability assessment framework using genome editing of salmon as a case study. The salmon farming industry is facing several challenges hindering sustainable production. Genome editing has entered as a tool that can improve selective breeding and feed ingredients in aquaculture, hence providing solutions such as resistance to salmon lice and other pathogens, and sterility reducing inter-breeding with wild, threatened stocks. As a goal for aquaculture is that its practices and products contribute to sustainability, the use of genome editing needs to be assessed with regards to sustainability, too. In our work, we draw on three sources of information; strategy and policy documents published by governmental offices and industry organizations; relevant GMO regulations and operationalization reports; and qualitative empirical data from 19 semi-structured interviews with Norwegian key stakeholders, and four semi-structured citizen groups. The findings from our analyses are discussed in relation to a Wedding cake-model for sustainability developed at the Stockholm Resilience Centre based on the UN SDGs and the three pillars of sustainability: biosphere, society, and economy. Analysis of document and interview data shows three main findings, one within each of the sustainability pillars. First, we identified that the biosphere pillar, including protection of the environment and the wild salmon, is the major sustainability issue and therefore important for the assessment of sustainability in the aquaculture industry and for the potential introduction of genome-edited salmon. Second, in the pillar for society the preservation of cultural and natural resources should be included, and in the Norwegian context this includes preserving the S ' ami culture reliance on the wild salmon stocks. Third, in the economy pillar animal welfare needs to be included both for efficiency and ethical responsibility in farming. With some adoption to local and national conditions and the fish species in question, the same framework can be used for sustainability assessment of genome edited finfish in general.

TI  - Transforming cities. The role of the configuration of the network of public spaces in urban life.
T2  - SPACE SYNTAX 5TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
CP  - 5th International Space Syntax Symposium
AB  - The concepts of housing estate and street system characterize two planning strategies involved in the formation and transformation of cities during the last century. This paper presents a comparative study which aims to explore the functional, social and cultural contents of the spatial configurations generated in cities through adoption of these concepts in planning. The Swedish city of Gothenburg is compared to the cities of Yazd and Abadan in Iran. The method of Space Syntax is applied in the analysis of the spatial systems of the studied cities.
   The functional and structural position of the historic core in the cities of Gothenburg and Yazd reflects the original characteristics of these cities and their different courses of transformation. The urban structure in the old city of Gothenburg was based on a well integrated street network. The traditional city of Yazd, on the contrary, had a deep segregated spatial structure. In Gothenburg, in contrast to the city of Yazd, the historic core is now a well functioning city centre, a real public space. However, adopting two different planning models in the long course of urban development, Gothenburg has gained many of the global structural properties of Iranian traditional cities and Yazd has become more akin to the traditional city of Gothenburg.
   In Abadan segregated self-contained housing estates determined the original structure of the city. Abadan is the first company town in Iran built almost a century ago. It was a product of the latest experimentation of advanced industrial capitalism of the day in social engineering. Nevertheless Abadan became a prominent example of emancipation from rigid modern paternalist urbanism. The later process of urban development in Abadan was managed by two parallel organizations, the Company and the Municipality. The result, however, was not a parallel but an integrating city. The control over the public space was strongly contested, leading to the appearance of a new human and democratic urban culture, a flourishing urban life with its street based spatial organisation. The analysis of urban structure in Abadan and Gothenburg displays interesting similarities though the processes of development of the two cities have been the reverse of each other.

AB  - Aim Ecological marginality is the existence of species/populations in the margins of their ecological niche, where conditions are harsher, and the risk of extinction is more pronounced. In threatened long-lived species, the disparity between distribution and population demography may provide understanding of how environmental heterogeneity shapes ecological marginality, potential extinction patterns and range shifts. We set out to evaluate this by combining a species distribution model (SDM) with population-specific demography data. Location Sweden, 450,000 km(2). Major Taxa Studied Freshwater pearl mussel (FPM, Margaritifera margaritifera) and two salmonid fish species. Methods A SDM for the mussel was constructed with MaxEnt using salmonid host fish (Salmo trutta plus S. salar) density, extreme low and high temperatures, precipitation, altitude, and clay content as explanatory variables. The output was used to test the ecological marginality hypothesis by evaluating whether lowly predicted populations had higher loss of recruitment. Logistic regression was used to explicitly test the factors involved in recruitment loss. Results Host fish density contributed the most (50.3%) to the mussel distribution, followed by lowest temperature the coldest month (34.3%) and altitude (10.3%), while the remaining explanatory variables contributed minimally (<3.3%). Populations with lower SDM scores lacked recruitment to a significantly higher degree. Populations inhabiting areas at low altitude, with lower densities of host fish, and warmer winter temperatures have lost recruitment to a higher degree. Main Conclusions We found support for the ecological marginality hypothesis. The patterns indicate that FPM habitat niche may shift northwards over time. Salmonid host fish density seems to be a driving factor for both historical distribution and recent demographic performance. Finally, we emphasize the value of combining SDMs with independent data on population demography as it both lends rigidity to model validation and understanding of how ecological marginality affects species distribution and viability.

AB  - Industrial symbioses (ISs) and eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are key concepts of industrial ecology (IE). The aim of ISs and EIPs is to minimise inefficient material and energy use by utilising local by-product and energy flows. Industrial symbioses tend to develop through spontaneous action of economic actors, for gaining of economic benefit, but these systems can be designed and promoted via policy instruments as well. A literature review showed that national programmes for eco-industrial parks can be found in different parts of the world. In the action programmes and other sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policy documents of the EU, on the other hand, industrial symbioses gain less recognition as a path to enhanced sustainable production. In this article, we consider this and also analyse how the evolution and environmental performance of an industrial symbiosis system centred on a Finnish pulp and paper mill have been affected by SCP policy instruments. With regard to the system forming the subject of the case study, and Finnish industrial systems in general, policy instruments have succeeded in reducing emissions but not in systematically encouraging operators toward symbiosis-like activities. All in all, few studies exist on the overall impact of policy instruments promoting design of eco-industrial parks. It is not self-evident that symbiosis-like production systems would be sustainable in every case, as the background assumptions for political promotion of EIPs suggest. We concluded that industrial symbioses should be analysed and developed on a life cycle basis, with documentation of the real environmental benefits due to efficient resource use and decreased emissions in comparison to stand-alone production. ISs can then bring eco-competitiveness to companies in relation to SCP tools, such as environmental permits, ecolabels, and future product regulation based on the Ecodesign Directive in Europe. Indirect encouragement of symbiosis through land-use regulation and planning, in such a way that material fluxes between companies are possible both in operations and in financial terms, may prove effective. The same holds for waste policies that encourage increased reuse of a company's waste by other enterprises. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this case study, we aimed to investigate residents' agency through their participation in the development of their residential area in the city of Espoo, Finland. With the aid of seven themes, we identified by thematic analysis five types of residents in terms of agency: free floaters, home troops and helpers, representative information brokers, informed reviewers, and change agents. Relational agency, rooted from the cultural-historical activity theory, necessitated recognizing the available resources, understanding the motives of others, and collaborating in joint activities. The results of 30 interviews showed that residents are willing to participate, and they need space and structure to exploit their relational agency in order to build common interests in their neighbourhood. The findings are discussed with reference to the potential of residents' agency while participating in neighbourhood governance and volunteering. Our study contributes to the understanding of residents' relational agency in community development and in volunteering.

AB  - Evaluating the value of a building is a complex matter in itself. With an ambition to evaluate the value of a building embedded in its surroundings, and with a wider societal perspective, the task becomes even more complex. A new conceptual evaluation model was introduced at the 8th Nordic conference in Tampere, 2015. The model is further developed and tested since then, and this paper gives an update on the results.
   The original model was based on principles from well-established evaluation methods and inspired by the OECD integrated evaluation model. It was made as simple as the authors found reasonable, considering the reduction in precision that comes with simplification. The authors tested the original model on three real-life case-projects in the development phase. Initial results proved promising, but also indicated issues for further development.
   After this initial development, the authors tested the model on two real-life building projects in parallel with testing a different evaluation model developed by Sweco Norway. The purpose of the two models are similar, but the methods have different takes on the process and what information is used as basis for evaluation. The direct comparison gave interesting findings and signals for further development of both models. Both models are developed in Norway and may be characterized as adapted to the Nordic context.
   The model evaluates the whole urban planning situation, including the neighborhood and transport infrastructure. The model has the potential to help practitioners achieve better results in terms of real sustainability in urban planning. Successful implementation and use of the model may lead to more conscious choices in urban planning and a more sustainable community.
   The authors also wanted to test the application of the tool as a self-assessment-tool, and one case study was conducted as self-study. And although the results clearly indicated that the tool need some improvements, the results shows that the method has a potential as a self-assessment-tool, for early phase decision making.

AB  - The effects of restorative grazing on the abundance of butterfly and moth species were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands of SW Finland differing in management history: (1) old continuously grazed, (2) restored (with ca 5 years of reinitiated grazing), and (3) abandoned former pastures.
   Generalized linear modelling of species abundances and indicator species analysis produced qualitatively similar results. Only three species (Polyommatus icarus, Lycaena hippothoe and Camptogramma bilineatum) were most abundant in old pastures, whereas 12 species (Polyommatus semiargus, Polyommatus amandus, Brenthis ino, Aphantopus hyperantus, Scopula immorata, Idaea serpentata, Scotopteryx chenopodiata, Epirrhoe alternata, Cybosia mesomella, Polypogon tentacularius, Hypena proboscidalis and Cryptocala chardinyi) were most abundant in abandoned pastures. None of the old-pasture species had become more abundant in restored pastures. Three species, Epirrhoe hastulata, Xanthorhoe montanata and Chiasmia clathrata. occurred equally abundantly in abandoned and in restored pastures indicating a slow progress of restoration.
   Species associated with old pastures differed from species associated with abandoned pastures in their recent distributional changes in Finland. The species of old pastures showed decreasing trends. whereas those of abandoned pastures showed mainly increasing trends in their distribution. In five out of I I species, the preferred successional stage differed markedly between this study and previous studies conducted in Central Europe.
   We conclude that (1) ca 5 years of restorative grazing in mesic grasslands has been insufficient for the colonisation of old-pasture species in the restored sites, (2) different management intensities are needed regionally for the maintenance of grassland insect diversity and (3) application of the knowledge on successional preferences of different species in conservation management. even in climatically similar regions, should be made with caution.

AB  - Forest edges have numerous implications for structure and function of forest ecosystems. Previous studies on edge quantity have used broad classifications. However, edge influence is driven by the contrast in vegetation structure between adjoining ecosystems, and thus we need detailed site-specific data to assess the role of edges in forests. We studied the variability of sharp edges in 28 boreal landscapes (4 km x 4 km) across an 830 km gradient throughout northern Sweden. Our objectives were: (1) to compare the length of natural and created edges, (2) to classify edges in detail by edge origin, maintenance and forest attributes, and (3) to examine relationships between length of edge and landscape variables. Data were collected using stereo-interpretation of high spatial resolution colour infrared aerial photographs, in combination with line intersect sampling and plots. The length of edge varied from 12 to 102 m ha(-1) among landscapes, with an overall mean of 54 m ha(-1). Created edges dominated most landscapes (mean 33 m ha(-1)) and had greater variability than natural edges (mean 21 m ha(-1)). Maintained edges (e.g. roads, agricultural land) were more abundant than regenerating edges caused by logging. Thirty percent of total edges adjoined narrow linear features. Seventy percent adjoined wider patches and showed high variability (35 classes). Overall, high-contrast edges towards mature forest dominated, i.e. ones that may experience strong edge influence. The amount of edge increased with percent of landscape affected by disturbance, and decreased with latitude and elevation. This study shows that edges are both abundant and highly variable in boreal forests and that forestry is the main driver behind edge creation. Detailed classification of edges based on site-specific forest and patch attributes may help to estimate edge influence at landscape level, and can guide experimental design for examining the impact of edges on structure and function of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Green Care practices have received increasing scholarly attention in the last decade. Yet most studies are concerned with the aspect of human well-being, with less attention given to other caring dimensions and their relation to sustainability. This paper aims to contribute to an integrative understanding of Green Care by proposing an analytical framework inspired by the ethics of care literature and, in particular, Tronto's five stages of caring (about, for, with, giving, and receiving). The goal is to use a relational lens to appreciate the diverse caring practices and their potential in three Finnish cases studies-a care farm, a biodynamic farm, and a nature-tourism company. We apply the framework on data gathered during three years through an in-depth participatory action-oriented research. Findings show that: (a) Green Care practitioners share sustainability concerns that go beyond human well-being and that translate into practices with benefits for the target users, wider community, and ecosystems; (b) caring is a relational achievement attained through iterative processes of learning. Two concluding insights can be inferred: a care lens sheds light on practitioners' moral agency and its sustainability potential; in-depth creative methods are needed for a thorough and grounded investigation of human and non-human caring relations in Green Care practices.

AB  - Historical research on urban epidemics has focused on the interaction of diseases with social and spatial gradients, such as class, ethnicity, or neighborhood. Even sophisticated historical studies usually lack data on health-related behavior or health-related perceptions, which modern analysts tend to emphasize. With detailed source material from the Finnish city of Tampere during a typhoid epidemic in 1916, we are able to combine both dimensions and look at how material and social constraints interacted with behavior and knowledge to produce unequal outcomes. We use data on socioeconomic status, location, and physical habitat as well as the self-reported behavior and expressed understandings of transmission mechanisms of the infected people to identify the determinants of some falling ill earlier or later than others. Applying survival analysis to approximately 2,500 cases, we show that disease avoidance behavior was deficient and constrained by physical habitat, regardless of considerable public health campaigning. Behavioral guidelines issued by authorities were sub-optimally communicated, unrealistic, and inadequately followed. Boiling water was hampered by shared kitchens, and access to laundry houses for additional hygiene was uneven. Centralized chemical water purification finally leveled the playing field by socializing the cost of prevention and eliminating key sources of unequal risk.

AB  - Two-thirds of Europeans currently live in urban areas, predicted to rise to 80% by 2050. Sustainable development, and in particular sustainable urban living, will become ever more challenging as urban densities increase 2 and civil engineers will need to provide solutions. The European Commission initiated the European Green Capital Award in 2010 to reward the achievements of cities in terms of current environmental performance, plans for a more sustainable future and to act as a role model for other cities. This paper describes notable civil engineering features of some of the winning cities to date, which include Stockholm in Sweden, Hamburg in Germany, Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain, Nantes in France, Copenhagen in Denmark and Bristol in the UK.

AB  - As landscapes become ordered according to certain sets of economic, political, ecological or social practices and discourses, other possible orderings become limited in their potential. This article illustrates this with an example taken from the field of tourism and place marketing. The empirical focus is golf experiences in Scania, Sweden, bookable by individual consumers over the Internet. The ordering of what is termed the 'golfscape' is unfolded with the help of an assemblage of arguments taken from writings on mobility, biopower and subjectification, post-foundational views of the materiality of the social and recent conceptualisations of the socio-cultural and spatial impact of tourism. The booking sequence, i.e. the interaction between consumer and booking software, is analyzed as a series of negotiations, techniques and technologies of control and enactments of power. It is concluded that mobility studies can benefit from a Foucauldian power perspective when explaining practices of mobility and spatial fixation.

AB  - When modelling forest growth, capturing the effects of climate change is needed for reliable longterm predictions and management choices. This remains a challenge because commonly used mensurational forest growth and yield models, relying on inventory data, cannot account for climate change effects. We developed hybrid physiological/mensurational basal area growth and yield models, which combine physiological response to climatic conditions and empirical relations. We included climate and site effects by replacing time with light sums of photosynthetically active radiation and modifying the latter with monthly soil water, vapour pressure deficit, temperature, and frost days. When parameterised with permanent sample plot data for Scots pine and Norway spruce across Sweden, the hybrid models could reproduce observations well, although with no increase in precision compared with time-based mensurational models. When considering different climate scenarios, a significant impact on productivity from climate change emerged. For example, a 2 degrees C warming enhanced Scots pine production by up to 14% in regions where temperatures were originally cooler and soil water deficit was low (i.e. northwest Sweden), but depressed it, up to 9%, elsewhere. Hence, climate-sensitive models that take local variations into account are necessary for accurate predictions and sustainable forest management.

AB  - Two long-lasting high-pressure systems in summer 2018 led to persisting heatwaves over Scandinavia and other parts of Europe and an extended summer period with devastating impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and human life. We use five climate model ensembles and the unique 263-year-long Stockholm temperature time series along with a composite 150-year-long time series for the whole of Sweden to set the latest heatwave in the summer of 2018 into historical perspective. With 263 years of data, we are able to grasp the pre-industrial period well and see a clear upward trend in temperature as well as upward trends in five heatwave indicators. With five climate model ensembles providing 20 580 simulated summers representing the latest 70 years, we analyse the likelihood of such a heat event and how unusual the 2018 Swedish summer actually was.
   We find that conditions such as those observed in summer 2018 are present in all climate model ensembles. An exception is the monthly mean temperature for May for which 2018 was warmer than any member in one of the five climate model ensembles. However, even if the ensembles generally contain individual years like 2018, the comparison shows that such conditions are rare. For the indices assessed here, anomalies such as those observed in 2018 occur in a maximum of 5 % of the ensemble members, sometimes even in less than 1 %.
   For all of the indices evaluated, we find that the probability of a summer such as that in 2018 has increased from relatively low values in the pre-industrial era (1861-1890, one ensemble) and the recent past (1951-1980, all five ensembles) to higher values in the most recent decades (1989-2018). An implication of this is that anthropogenic climate change has strongly increased the probability of a warm summer, such as the one observed 2018, occurring in Sweden. Despite this, we still find such summers in the pre-industrial climate in our simulations, albeit with a lower probability.

AB  - The historical production responses of planktonic diatoms over the last 150-200 years were quantified using palaeolimnological methods. Planktonic diatom biomass (as biovolume) estimates were compared for three small lakes with contrasting types of lake disturbance: acidification (Gaffeln. SW Sweden), point-source eutrophication (Lough Augher. Northern Ireland) and catchment agriculture (Kassjon. Northern Sweden). The lakes are small (6-23 ha) and have similar mean (approximately 5 m) and maximum depths (12-16 m). Sediment and diatom deposition patterns change over time, therefore diatom frustule accumulation rates in centrally located cores were corrected for within-lake spatial variability by taking the area-weighted mean of a number of cores. Diatom frustule accumulation rates (as frustules cm-2 year-1) do not allow for between-taxa differences in size, so they were corrected for cell volume to give biovolume accumulation rates (mum3 cm-2 year-1). The biovolumes used were estimated from measurements of diatoms preserved in the sediments and from the literature. At Gaffeln, biomass declined steadily with acidification until extinction of the planktonic diatoms about 1970. At Kassjon. maximum biomass coincided with the maximum areal extent of arable agriculture (about 1870) and. at Augher, nutrient input from a creamery resulted in steady biomass increases with a peak in the late 1960s. Although the maximum estimated biomass accumulation rates range from approximately 120 x 10(6) mum3 cm-2 year-1 at Gaffeln to 4 mm3 cm-2 year-1 at Augher, the differences between the latter and the maximum at Kassjon (approximately 2 mm3 cm-2 year-1) are small compared to those expected from productivity inferences based on the ecology of the different taxa. This relatively small difference in biovolume between Kassjon and Augher is probably due to differential retention of diatoms in the sediments and outflow losses between the two lakes. Preservation is very good at Kassjon, while there is more dissolution at Augher. The implications of these data for making palaeoproductivity inferences about planktonic diatoms and their response to ecological disturbance are discussed.

AB  - This article reviews the history of the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative, its activities in capacity building and policy-oriented research, and case studies at its centres in Chile, China, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania. EfD promotes research-based policies to manage natural resources as engines of development. Since 1991, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) has provided funding for students from developing countries to earn a PhD at the Environmental Economics Unit (EEU) of the University of Gothenburg. Returning home, these economists face institutional and academic gaps that limit the adoption of research-based policies. In response, the first EfD centre was founded in 2004, and six more followed. Research focuses on agriculture, climate, fisheries, parks, wildlife, forestry, energy and policy design. This has yielded 200 peer-reviewed articles. Successful policy outcomes depend on relationships with policy makers, community involvement in livelihood strategies, strengthened institutional support, interdisciplinary approaches, and dissemination of research results.

AB  - Arctic and subarctic ecosystems are experiencing substantial changes in hydrology, vegetation, permafrost conditions, and carbon cycling, in response to climatic change and other anthropogenic drivers, and these changes are likely to continue over this century. The total magnitude of these changes results from multiple interactions among these drivers. Field measurements can address the overall responses to different changing drivers, but are less capable of quantifying the interactions among them. Currently, a comprehensive assessment of the drivers of ecosystem changes, and the magnitude of their direct and indirect impacts on subarctic ecosystems, is missing. The Tornetrask area, in the Swedish subarctic, has an unrivalled history of environmental observation over 100 years, and is one of the most studied sites in the Arctic. In this study, we summarize and rank the drivers of ecosystem change in the Tornetrask area, and propose research priorities identified, by expert assessment, to improve predictions of ecosystem changes. The research priorities identified include understanding impacts on ecosystems brought on by altered frequency and intensity of winter warming events, evapotranspiration rates, rainfall, duration of snow cover and lake-ice, changed soil moisture, and droughts. This case study can help us understand the ongoing ecosystem changes occurring in the Tornetrask area, and contribute to improve predictions of future ecosystem changes at a larger scale. This understanding will provide the basis for the future mitigation and adaptation plans needed in a changing climate.

AB  - The degradation of forest ecosystems may be attributed to various natural and anthropogenic factors such as climatical extremes, biotic stresses, selection of tree species, harvesting regimes, litter raking, off-site amelioration measures, former land use, air pollutant deposition and soil acidification, as caused by internal and external processes. An important factor for a loss of tree vitality are nutritional disturbances, eventually leading to declining stand stability and productivity. Therefore, the potential risks of forest fertilization as a major tool for rehabilitation of naturally or anthropogenically degraded ecosystems are discussed. In this respect, both salt-like and lime fertilizers contribute positively to revitalization of nutrient deficient stands. Experience indicates that forest liming may indeed counterbalance the progress of soil acidification as caused by high H deposition. However, specific reactions within the rhizosphere, the enhanced mineralization and loss of organic matter, the mobilization of heavy metals and M-a(+) cations and an increased NO3 leaching are possible risks of forest liming. The results from experiments with salt-like fertilizers do not show any negative influence of dissolved aluminium on root vitality but succeeded in revitalization of nutrient deficient stands. In the case of sulfatic fertilizers, both increased sulfate leaching and storage of sulfate in the bulk soil have been reported, Therefore, selection of fertilizer has to be based on a precise characterization of site specific chemical and physical conditions, including relevant stand parameters. Besides fertilization, forest regeneration with site-adapted tree species may greatly contribute to the rehabilitation of forest ecosystems, since the capacity for storage of C and N and hence, for a closer nutrient cycling, may be improved significantly through this approach.

AB  - Fourier and wavelet analyses were used to reveal the dominant trends and coherence of a more than one-century-long time series of precipitation and discharge in several watersheds in Sweden, two of which were subjected to hydropower and intensive agriculture. During the 20th century, there was a gradual, significant drift of the dominant discharge periodicity in agricultural watersheds. This study shows that the steepness of the Fourier spectrum of runoff from the May to October period each year increased gradually during the century, which suggests a more predictable intra-annual runoff pattern (more apart from white-noise). In the agricultural watershed, the coherence spectrum of precipitation and runoff is generally high with a consistent white-noise relationship for precipitation during the 20th century, indicating that precipitation is not controlling the drift of the discharge spectrum. In the hydropower regulated watershed, there was a sudden decrease of the discharge spectrum slope when regulation commenced in the 1920s. This study develops a new theory in which the runoff spectrum is related to the hydraulic and hydro-morphological characteristics of the watershed. Using this theory, we explain the changes in runoff spectra in the two watersheds by the anthropogenic change in surface water volume and, hence, changes in kinematic wave celerity and water transit times. The reduced water volume in the agricultural watershed would also contribute to decreasing evaporation, which could explain a slightly increasing mean discharge during the 20th century despite the fact that precipitation was statistically constant in the area.

AB  - Societies are increasingly characterised by increasing mobility of people and materials. Consequently, harmful environmental impacts of transport are likely to increase unless specific policies aimed at mitigating these impacts can be successfully implemented. Based on EU-level requirements for carbon dioxide emission reductions, a car tax reform was enacted in Finland in 2008. By using the environmental protection process (EPP) framework as a conceptual tool, we perform a quantitative content analysis of media discussion of the car tax reform. The EPP framework is an integrative tool, aimed at an overall view of the characteristics of environmental problems and mitigation measures. The results show that societal factors, emissions, measures and the potential side-effects of the reform dominated the media discussion. Short-term impacts were emphasised over longer-term perspectives in the discussion's future-orientation. Overall, it seems that in spite of a relatively wide-ranging discussion, the media debate contributed only marginally to public understanding of the prerequisites for environmentally sustainable transport.

AB  - A central objective of environmental management is to maintain biodiversity, including populations of threatened species. Freshwater ecosystems are increasingly assessed by their biotic properties, but whether the resulting classifications of biotic condition are sufficient to protect species with conservation status has received very little consideration. We used data from 225 reference and impacted river sites from Finland to examine whether the occurrence and abundance of threatened macroinvertebrate species (TS) are associated with a commonly used estimate of biological condition (Observed-to-Expected number of predicted taxa of macroinvertebrates or O/E-ratio of taxonomic completeness, based on a predictive model). We suggest that a minimal acceptable condition below which restoration is needed, equivalent to, e.g. 'good' ecological status described by the European Union Water Framework Directive, should also ensure the occurrence of TS populations. We therefore followed conventional procedures for condition assessment, and examined two classifications by using the 10th or 25th percentiles of a reference O/E-distribution as alternative upper boundaries for the acceptable condition. The number and abundance of TS, and occurrence of individual TS showed positive relationships with the O/E. However, particularly if the 10th percentile threshold was used, there were only few occurrences and low abundance of TS in the suggested 'good' condition. The results imply that conventional criteria for satisfactory condition may not be sufficient for preservation of threatened river macroinvertebrates. However, our approach could bring an objective, meaningful, and societally acceptable means for setting site quality criteria in freshwater assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using economic and historical yield data models in this paper we outline the socioeconomic and ecological conditions for sustainable use of fish resources in commercial lake fisheries in Finland, in the context of fragmented private ownership and owner-based management. Interlocked use refers to area greater than the typical current area on one or two lakes, and that could be used as a joint resource by the fishers in the area. The results of the economic model show that the management of the interlocked fishery, in particular by encouraging mobility of fishers, can produce higher sustainable economic benefits from the fishery. The yield data analysis shows that an interlocked resource may considerably decrease fluctuations of yield in commercial vendace fisheries. This implies that the interlocked use approach would increase the cost-effectiveness and decrease the interannual variability in income to the fishers, thus promoting sustainability in the fishery and making it potentially a more viable livelihood in rural areas.

AB  - In the wake of the trade in ancient materials, several ethical and political issues arise that merit concern: the decimation of the cultural heritage of war-torn countries, proliferation of corruption, ideological connotations of orientalism, financial support of terrorism, and participation in networks involved in money laundering, weapon sales, human trafficking and drugs. Moreover, trafficking and trading also have a harmful effect on the fabric of academia itself. This study uses open sources to track the history of the private SchOyen Collection, and the researchers and public institutions that have worked with and supported the collector. Focussing on the public debates that evolved around the Buddhist manuscripts and other looted or illicitly obtained material from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq, this article unravels strategies to whitewash SchOyen's and his research groups' activities. Numerous elements are familiar from the field of antiquities trafficking research and as such adds to the growing body of knowledge about illicit trade and collecting. A noteworthy element in the SchOyen case is Martin SchOyen and his partners' appeal to digital dissemination to divorce collections from their problematic provenance and history and thus circumvent contemporary ethical standards. Like paper publications, digital presentations contribute to the marketing and price formation of illicit objects. The Norwegian state's potential purchase of the entire SchOyen collection was promoted with the aid of digital dissemination of the collection hosted by public institutions. In the wake of the SchOyen case, it is evident that in spite of formal regulations to thwart antiquities trafficking, the continuation of the trade rests on the attitudes and practice of scholars and institutions.

AB  - Management systems on agricultural land in Norway are causing concern because of increasing area wide soil erosion, consequent increase in sediment loads and nutrient losses to waters, and their consequent pollution.  Monitoring of areas in autumn is important because this is the start of a season when much of the erosion occurs.  This is often caused by management systems in autumn, but also because climatic conditions in this season are important for erosion processes.
   We have investigated several sources of remote sensing data, with a view to assembling the best overall monitoring system for this geoscience problem.  The sources were digitised CIR (colour infrared pseudocolour) aerial photography, SPOT and ERS-1 SAR.  CIR photography proved more accurate than SPOT data, especially with regard to exposed soils as result of CIR's continuous spectral sensitivity.  We found that SPOT is clearly limited as a monitoring tool for soils and there is a need for better sensors in range 680 to 790 nm wavelengths.
   ERS-1 SAR provides information when the optical sources cannot, but is dependent on good digital elevation models.  We found that the most effective monitoring is done using a combination of microwave and optical sources.

AB  - Ocean-based economic development arising from an increasing interest in the 'blue economy' is placing ecosystems and small-scale fisheries under pressure. The dominant policy response for dealing with multiple uses is the allocation of coastal space through coastal zone planning (CZP). Recent studies have shown that the rush to develop the blue economy and regulate coastal activity can result in social injustices and the exclusion of less powerful and unrecognized groups (e.g., small-scale fishers, women, Indigenous peoples and youth). To achieve a primary goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda to "leave no one behind", it is important to understand the implications of coastal planning and development for these groups. Here, we present a social survey protocol for examining perceptions of justice related to small-scale fisheries (SSF) in the context of the blue economy in coastal areas. Specifically, we designed the survey instrument and sampling protocol to assess whether decisions about the use of the coastal zone over the last five years have i) followed principles of good governance, ii) recognized fishers' knowledge, culture and rights and iii) been attentive to impacts of changed coastal zone use on fisheries. The survey will engage coastal planners (N = app. 120) and fishers (N = app. 4300) in all the coastal municipalities (N = 81) in Northern-Norway. The sampling protocol is designed to ensure representation of different sectors of society, including those defined by gender, age, ethnicity and occupation (e.g., small-scale fishers, large-scale fishers, coastal planners).

AB  - 1. The distribution of brown bears (Ursus arctos L.) expanding into suitable habitat in Sweden following near extermination was estimated using harvest data from the period 1981-93. Core areas were defined as female concentration areas, where 90% of the hunter-killed females were taken.
   2. Three predictions were tested, based on results of earlier bear dispersal studies, which show that females are extremely philopatric. Prediction 1: the relative density of females declines more rapidly from the centre of a core area towards the edge than for males. Prediction 2. males dominate in the peripheral areas, especially males in the age of most active dispersal (2-4 years of age). Prediction 3: females in the periphery are found closer to the edge of the core area than males.
   3. The results of the present study supported Predictions 1 and 2, but not Prediction 3. This indicates that males were more prone to disperse from the core areas than females. However, females that did disperse did not differ from males in distance from the core areas, and females were found up to 80-90 km from them. Such long-distance female dispersal has apparently not been previously documented in other bear populations that are stable or declining. The results strongly suggest that presaturation dispersal, i.e. dispersal occurring before the carrying capacity of the habitat has been reached, is occurring in this increasing population. This phenomenon might be more common in increasing populations of large mammals than was previously thought. Regarding conservation of bears, this result is positive for gene flow and metapopulation dynamics and negative for livestock losses in formerly bear-free areas.
   4. Core and peripheral areas can be identified based on the age and sex of shot bears. This allowed us to classify Norway as a peripheral area. Bear density appears difficult to estimate near an expansion front because of large differences in densities over short distances.

AB  - The 1.8 million ha of forest south of the Caspian Sea represent a remarkably intact ecosystem with numerous old-growth features and unique species assemblages. To protect these forests, Iranian authorities recently passed a law which protects healthy trees but permits the removal of injured, dying and dead trees. To quantify the biodiversity effects of this strategy, we sampled saproxylic beetles and true bugs in 24 plots across the entire altitudinal gradient of Oriental beech. The composition of these communities as well as their overall richness and the richness of endemic and old-growth indicator species were best explained by dead wood volume compared to other environmental variables. Due to the striking evidence that dead wood is the major driver of saproxylic diversity in these forests, we urge Iranian authorities to reconsider their law, redirecting logging toward healthy medium sized trees. Otherwise, a major loss in biodiversity, similar to that experienced in European beech forests, can be expected.

AB  - Targeted sampling of water was performed in streams, the river mouth, and the municipal drinking-water tap in the vicinity of San Francisco, South Leyte, Philippines. Samples were processed on site and transported back to Sweden for analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the pesticides commonly used in the area. Collaborations were initiated with employees at the local Department of Agriculture and Municipal Disaster Coordinating Council to learn more about the rice cultivation in this area and times for spraying. Detectable levels of pesticides lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin (0.0005-1.4 mu g/L) were found in representative water samples. In 47% of samples the detected levels exceeded the recommended limit values for pesticides in surface water according to Swedish guidelines (Swedish Chemicals Agency, 2008). The analysis of samples taken at the river mouth revealed measurable levels of lambda-cyhalothrin and cypermethrin, which means that residues of pesticides applied to rice paddy fields were shown to end up at the river mouth. The success of the sampling and analysis methods was confirmed by the data which was in accordance with the expected effect of dilution from day to day. Variable levels of insecticides in the river and all the way down to the sea may have adverse health effects on people using the water and on the aquatic environment, including sensitive coral reefs. This situation is applicable not only to the Philippines, but also to the whole of Southeast Asia, with approximately 70% of their human population living in coastal areas. As Southeast Asia encompasses approximately 34% of the world's coral reefs and between a quarter and a third of the world's mangroves, as well as the global biodiversity triangle formed by the Malay Peninsula, the Philippines, and New Guinea, the need to reduce the impacts of marine pollution in this region is of great importance.

AB  - Volunteer tourism is one of the latest branches of the ever expanding globalised tourism. The initiative Workaway, an expression of this trend, was established in the late 90s with the aim of promoting "cultural understanding between different peoples and lands throughout the world". The figure of the workawayer as a new cosmopolitan subjectivity started to take shape. With the growth of the tourism industry, the Workaway scheme has started to be of interest also to tourism entrepreneurs, especially in the global peripheries such as northern Lapland, home to the indigenous minority language community of the Sami. By signing up as a volunteer in a heritage tourism resort, the workawayer, the cultural adventurer, becomes linked up to the network of the globalised new economy. Drawing on aspects of governmentality studies, discourse studies and ethnographic approaches, this study traces the translocal formation of the figure of the workawayer through two crucial technologies of subjectification: the Internet portal workaway.info and the actuality of everyday work in a Sami heritage tourist resort in northernmost Finnish Lapland. Although the Workaway initiative positions itself as non-capitalist if not anti-capitalist, the study shows how the workawayer is gradually shaped to meet the requirements of the contemporary neoliberal world of work. If Workaway offers new languages and cultures with a flavour of romanticised multiculturalism, in the tourist resort actual encounters are governed by straightforward market rationality. Here, languages are valued as skills among others, but not above others, since ultimately "you don't necessarily need any language for money transactions".

AB  - We investigate relevant scales and cost-efficient methods for measurements of habitat for saproxylic, aspen-associated beetles, in two boreal forest landscapes in south-eastern Norway. We sampled saproxylic beetles with window traps on fresh aspen dead wood and conducted field surveys of dead wood in the surroundings (1, 2 and 3 km radius). In addition, we used maps derived from satellite imagery to extract data on forest age and volume for the same surroundings. We found that species richness of saproxylic beetles was related to dead wood volume estimated by field survey within 1 or 2 km radius from the trapping points. However, the map-derived variable describing area of forest with high levels of deciduous wood volume was the overall best predictor of species richness. The scale of response to this variable differed; species richness of all saproxylic beetles was best predicted by estimates for the 2 km radius whereas richness of species more strongly associated with aspen was best predicted by estimates for the 3 km radius. This might indicate that aspen-associated beetles disperse over larger distances than many other beetles; possibly an adaptation to the scattered distribution and ephemeral nature of aspen dead wood in boreal forests. Our results show that substrate variables must be measured at the scale that is ecologically relevant for the study organism to elicit a response. We also show that remote sensing data -often easy to obtain for large scales-can be used to complement studies of scale-specific responses and thus improve conservation measures for saproxylic beetle species.

AB  - Large-scale multi-species data on population changes of alpine or arctic species are largely lacking. At the same time, climate change has been argued to cause poleward and uphill range shifts and the concomitant predicted loss of habitat may have drastic effects on alpine and arctic species. Here we present a multi-national bird indicator for the Fennoscandian mountain range in northern Europe (Finland, Sweden and Norway), based on 14 common species of montane tundra and subalpine birch forest. The data were collected at 262 alpine survey plots, mainly as a part of geographically representative national breeding bird monitoring schemes. The area sampled covers around 1/4 million km(2), spanning 10 degrees of latitude and 1600 km in a northeast-southwest direction. During 2002-2012, nine of the 14 bird species declined significantly in numbers, in parallel to higher summer temperatures and precipitation during this period compared to the preceding 40 yr. The population trends were largely parallel in the three countries and similar among montane tundra and subalpine birch forest species. Long-distance migrants declined less on average than residents and short-distance migrants. Some potential causes of the current decline of alpine birds are discussed, but since montane bird population sizes may show strong natural annual variation due to several factors, longer time series are needed to verify the observed population trends. The present Fennoscandian monitoring systems, which from 2010 onwards include more than 400 montane survey plots, have the capacity to deliver a robust bird indicator in the climate-sensitive mountainous regions of northernmost Europe for conservation purposes.

AB  - Background: Coastal Norwegian heathlands have been regularly managed by burning for about 5000 years. This practice, supporting sustainable herbivore production, did, however, seize in the 1950s and was virtually absent for 60-70 years. Loss of biodiversity, increased fire hazard due to biomass accumulation and loss of visual landscape qualities recently propelled new interest in traditional landscape management. Loss of know-how makes this a dangerous activity. The present study focuses on the emergence and learning processes of a civic group established for resuming prescribed burning in Northern Rogaland in order to possibly assist similar initiatives elsewhere. Methods: Study of written information, interviews with core prescribed burners and participant observation have been undertaken. The topics at four annual prescribed burning seminars, arranged by the studied civic group, have been analyzed. Participant observation at civic group winter meetings, debriefing sessions and field work has also been undertaken. Results: Pioneers who, without guidance, resumed prescribed burning relied on experience gained as part-time firefighters and relations to farming, in particular sheep grazing. Building good relations with local fire brigades and support by local and regional environmental authorities (especially the local agricultural advisory office) enhanced the practice. Short weather window, assembling a big enough burner group on the working days, as well as possible liability issues were identified as challenges. They were self-taught through "learning by doing" and open to new technologies/artifacts, i.e., leaf blowers for fire control. Their use of artifacts, together with supporting the fire brigades during a wildfire, strengthened their group identity. A connection to academia improved the focus on safe and effective prescribed burning through deeper insight into the physical parameters that govern burning in the terrain. Conclusions: The study provides valuable insight into favorable preconditions and possible key personnel for resuming prescribed burning in other areas in Norway and elsewhere. Content and teaching methods for a possible future standardized prescribed heathland burning course are suggested.

For a transition to become reality, all groups of society have to be part of it, and the social sciences have a role in investigating the conditions for these groups to be involved. The extent to which diverse (including marginalised) communities and households are part of this transition and have equitable access to the relevant technologies, including smart technologies, and the degree to which the transition is a shared value and aspiration is still unclear. We want to explore what steps are being taken in Sweden to incorporate these groups in planning and technology access, and to what extent this is supported by a range of entities, from the Swedish Energy Agency to grassroots organizations, with a particular focus on social, gender and migrant perspectives. Our preliminary evaluation of Swedish energy policy documents indicates that, while social justice and gender considerations are acknowledged, little funding is actually allocated towards social science covering these areas. Moreover, there is no mention of ethnic equality or the inclusion of migrant communities in the documents that we reviewed. With this Perspective we highlight the need for further research to develop a more nuanced understanding of the different narratives embedded in household sustainable energy usage and decision-making around the adoption of sustainable energy technologies at the household level.

AB  - In Western culture, oceans have traditionally been perceived as timeless, separate from society and practically boundless in resources and absorptive capacity. As a result, the entangled histories of people and marine environments have largely been neglected in historical research. This is changing with the development of marine environmental history together with increasing recognition of oceans' vulnerability and importance in earth systems. Against this background, we review the current state of historical knowledge of how different actors within Swedish society have perceived and impacted the Baltic Sea environment, as well as discovered and responded to marine environmental change. We find that this environmental history, as distinct from other forms of historical research, has so far received limited attention. While the environmental histories of terrestrial resources in Sweden - including forests, agriculture, minerals and energy - have been thoroughly studied, there is little comparative knowledge about the formation and development of the major scientific institutions and public agencies involved in Baltic Sea governance. In light of this, we discuss how knowledge about Sweden's marine environmental history can be improved, and the importance this may have for the future sustainability of the Baltic Sea.

TI  - High-accuracy coastal flood mapping for Norway using lidar data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA  - English
KW  - SEA-LEVEL RISE
KW  - FENNOSCANDIA
AB  - Using new high-accuracy light detection and ranging (lidar) elevation data we generate coastal flooding maps for Norway. Thus far, we have mapped similar to 80 % of the coast, for which we currently have data of sufficient accuracy to perform our analysis. Although Norway is generally at low risk from sea level rise largely owing to its steep topography and land uplift due to glacial isostatic adjustment, the maps presented here show that, on local scales, many parts of the coast are potentially vulnerable to flooding. There is a considerable amount of infrastructure at risk along the relatively long and complicated coastline. Nationwide we identify a total area of 400 km(2), 105 000 buildings, and 510 km of roads that are at risk of flooding from a 200-year storm surge event at present. These numbers will increase to 610 km(2), 137 000, and 1340 km with projected sea level rise to 2090 (95th percentile of RCP8.5 as recommended in planning). We find that some of our results are likely biased high owing to erroneous mapping (at least for lower water levels close to the tidal datum which delineates the coastline). A comparison of control points from different terrain types indicates that the elevation model has a root-mean-square error of 0.26 m and is the largest source of uncertainty in our mapping method. The coastal flooding maps and associated statistics are freely available, and alongside the development of coastal climate services, will help communicate the risks of sea level rise and storm surge to stakeholders. This will in turn aid coastal management and climate adaptation work in Norway.

AB  - Transformation acquires its meaning within contexts and particular settings where transformative change is experienced, and where people engage in meaning-making. We used the forest-climate nexus in Sweden as an empirical case study, and the leverage-points perspective as an analytical lens. The aim was to investigate contextual leverage for transformative change, and how our use of context and relations shapes our understanding of transformation and leverage for change. The empirical basis was a whole-day workshop, held in both northern and southern Sweden, for local forest stakeholders. To detract from current conflict and barriers to change, we asked the stakeholders to reflect on transformative change in the past and in the future, and the spatio-temporal relations that form the forest-climate nexus. Our analysis suggests that leverage associated with a transformative change in the future is commonly seen as universal and detached from context, reflecting, for example, national and global discourses on forests and climate change. Regarding transformative changes in the past, however, contextual leverage is linked to the community values and pluralism that drove the change in particular situations. Focusing on the complex spatio-temporal relations and meaning-making helps identify how leverage emerges from context, and how leverage also acquires a richer meaning for people experiencing transformative change.

AB  - In addition to causing shifts in regional climate, climate change will also affect the combination of climatic conditions and dominant soil type. This may be reflected in crop responses; however, currently, empirical knowledge in this regard is limited. We hypothesised that 1) the weather patterns most influencing forage crop yield variation vary among soil types 2) the yield responses of forage crop species and cultivars to agro-climatic variables depend on soil type, and 3) response diversity of the forage crop species and cultivars to agro-climatic factors depends on soil type. To assess these assumptions, we utilized the Finnish long-term multi -location Official Variety Trial and weather data for 1979-2012 as a case study. The yield responses of timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.), tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb)/Festuca arundinacea (Schreb)), Festulolium (Festuca sp. x Lolium sp.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), and Italian ryegrass (Lolium mutt -Om -um L.) to the critical agro-climatic variables depended in most cases on whether the trials were located on clay, coarse mineral, or organic soils. The average yield response to weather was 10% in clay and organic soils and 8% in coarse mineral soils. The diversity of forage crop responses was also dependent on soil type. The demonstrated dependency of crop responses to climate change on soil type emphasizes that attention should be paid to the plausible shifts in soil -climate combinations when planning adaptation.

AB  - Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is not a new idea in forest management but there has been renewed interest in it for the potential it has to meet the sustainability requirements which are part of the Rio/Helsinki process and certification. Broadly speaking CCF includes those silvicultural systems which involve continuous and uninterrupted maintenance of forest cover and which avoid clearcutting. However, there is considerable confusion with regard to terms and definitions and even the phrase continuous cover forestry is not universally known. CCF systems are being introduced throughout Europe, where there is emphasis on the direct transformation of existing even-aged plantations to some form of mixed, uneven-aged woodland. There is also the opportunity to establish such woodlands either at re-stocking or when afforesting former agricultural land but so far there has been little discussion of the methods that can be used to do this. One approach would be to use nurse crops to aid establishment of desired species, especially where there are difficult site conditions or the trees naturally require cover for optimal growth. The use of nurse crops is already a familiar part of forest practice and has found various applications in Britain, Scandinavia and other parts of Europe. This paper outlines the historical roots of continuous cover forestry, discusses definitions and features of the current debate and explores potential silvicultural methods with special attention to the direct establishment of mixed forest stands through afforestation and restocking.

AB  - To implement policies about sustainable landscapes and rural development necessitates social learning about states and trends of sustainability indicators, norms that define sustainability, and adaptive multi-level governance. We evaluate the extent to which social learning at multiple governance levels for sustainable landscapes occur in 18 local development initiatives in the network of Sustainable Bergslagen in Sweden. We mapped activities over time, and interviewed key actors in the network about social learning. While activities resulted in exchange of experiences and some local solutions, a major challenge was to secure systematic social learning and make new knowledge explicit at multiple levels. None of the development initiatives used a systematic approach to secure social learning, and sustainability assessments were not made systematically. We discuss how social learning can be improved, and how a learning network of development initiatives could be realized.

AB  - Migratory species have geographically separate distributions during their annual cycle, and these areas can vary between populations and individuals. This can lead to differential stress levels being experienced across a species range. Gathering information on the areas used during the annual cycle of red-throated divers (RTDs; Gavia stellata) has become an increasingly pressing issue, as they are a species of concern when considering the effects of disturbance from offshore wind farms and the associated ship traffic. Here, we use light-based geolocator tags, deployed during the summer breeding season, to determine the non-breeding winter location of RTDs from breeding locations in Scotland, Finland, and Iceland. We also use delta N-15 and delta C-13 isotope signatures, from feather samples, to link population-level differences in areas used in the molt period to population-level differences in isotope signatures. We found from geolocator data that RTDs from the three different breeding locations did not overlap in their winter distributions. Differences in isotope signatures suggested this spatial separation was also evident in the molting period, when geolocation data were unavailable. We also found that of the three populations, RTDs breeding in Iceland moved the shortest distance from their breeding grounds to their wintering grounds. In contrast, RTDs breeding in Finland moved the furthest, with a westward migration from the Baltic into the southern North Sea. Overall, these results suggest that RTDs breeding in Finland are likely to encounter anthropogenic activity during the winter period, where they currently overlap with areas of future planned developments. Icelandic and Scottish birds are less likely to be affected, due to less ship activity and few or no offshore wind farms in their wintering distributions. We also demonstrate that separating the three populations isotopically is possible and suggest further work to allocate breeding individuals to wintering areas based solely on feather samples.

AB  - Several projects and measures have been developed to enhance the design of public roads. Nevertheless, the critics of their design remain numerous. To further the discussion on road aesthetics, this paper makes suggestions for a more consistent terminology and presents a theoretical framework for assessing the visual quality of roads. Based on a literature review, twelve visual characteristics are identified: coherence, imageability, simplicity, visibility, maintenance, naturalness, integration, contrast, variety, aesthetics of flow, legibility and orientation. These characteristics are presented and described and where possible their theoretical and empirical backing is given. Only a few visual characteristics in road design have been subjected to empirical perception studies, so their importance for road users and residents remains unclear. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Natural mixed forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), Norway spruce (Picea (Abies alba) were way spruce (Picea widely replaced by spruce-dominated stands in the montane belt of the northern Calcareous Alps in historical times. This accounts for changing forest structure, diversity, and hemeroby. observations in other parts of Europe suggest that this development should have led to a replacement of the native understorey vegetation by species typical of coniferous forests and to an increase in plants that are indicators for acidity and nitrogen. The statistical relationships between understorey vegetation structure and species richness, Ellenberg indicator values, and the proportion of Norway Spruce in the tree layer were studied in 84 stands selected in a stratified random design in the Bavarian Alps, while controlling for the influence of the natural environment. The results show that the richness of coniferous forest species and the occurrence of acid indicators have been significantly favored by Norway spruce canopies, while understorey species characteristic of deciduous forests and nitrogen indicators have not been affected. While bryophytes and some shallow-rooted vascular plants respond positively to a coniferous canopy, most vascular plants are resilient to changes in the canopy. This can be attributed to the high buffering capacity of the soils under the mountain forests studied.

AB  - Livestock-guarding dogs are an effective way of protecting rangeland sheep from predators. However, opera mountain/forest range and widely ranging sheep are factors that may make adaptation tar Norwegian conditions difficult. This paper focuses on the dogs' working patterns and effectiveness under different working regimes. A 3,500 ha. unfenced forest/mountain range pasture in bear habitat comprised the research area in which 624 sheep from 2 herds grazed. The field trial lasted 3 months, and a total of 10 Great Pysenees participated for various time intervals. Three different working regimes were: evaluated: Ib loose dogs without the command of a dog handler (Method A); 2) loose dogs under the command of a dog handler (Method B); and 3) loose dogs guarding sheep inside a fenced, 1 km(2) forest pasture (Method C). Nocturnal behavioural activity patterns and data on predation were recorded. Method A proved too uncontrolled for Norwegian conditions, because sheep dispersed too widely and dogs ranged too far, causing conflicts in nearby settlements with wildlife, and with livestock. Pasture dogs (c) were >3 times less active and were engaged in guarding activities < 59% as often as patrol dogs (B). However, they barked >15 times more frequently, and no sheep carcasses were found inside the fence. Therefore, Method C probably had the best preventive effect.

AB  - Diffuse phosphorus (P) losses from arable land need to be reduced in a cost-efficient way, taking into account their temporal and spatial variability. This study, based on 16 farms across southern Sweden, examined possibilities for identifying critical source areas for P losses based on the combined results of high-resolution erosion modelling, independent risk assessments by farmers, soil survey and SWOT analysis performed by farmers. Statistically significant differences in dissolved P release were found between soil P test classes in the studied area, whereas soil textural classes and not P content governed potential mobilisation of soil particles and unreactive P. Spatial comparison of problem areas identified by farmers and modelled features showed that the modelled erosion pathways intersected 109 in a total of 128 (85%) observed problem areas. The study demonstrates the value in involving farmers in the identification of critical source areas in order to select and support implementation of effective countermeasures.

AB  - Our aim was to map the performance of local (native) dairy cattle breeds in Austria, Switzerland, Poland, and Sweden with regard to production, fertility, longevity, and health-associated traits and to compare them with commercial (modern) breeds. For this purpose, we analyzed test-day records (July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2014) and treatment records (Austria, Sweden) of cows managed on organic farms. We performed country-wise comparisons of 123,415 lactations from Original Braunvieli (OB) and Grey Cattle (AL) with Braunvieh (BV; Brown Swiss blood >60%) in Switzerland; AL with BV (Brown Swiss blood >50%) in Austria; Polish Black and White (ZB), Polish Red and White (ZR), and Polish Red (RP) with Polish Holstein Friesian (PHF) in Poland; and Swedish Red (SRB) with Swedish Holstein (SH) in Sweden. Average milk yields were substantially lower for local compared with commercial breeds in all countries; differences ranged from 750 kg (Sweden) to 1,822 kg (Austria), albeit on very different average levels. Local breeds showed a longer productive lifetime by 0.64, 0.83, 1.42, and 0.20 lactations in Switzerland, Austria, Poland, and Sweden, respectively, again on very different levels in each country. Regarding fertility traits, calving interval was shorter in local than in commercial breeds by 13 (Sweden), 14 (Switzerland), and 20 d (Austria, Poland). Insemination index was lower in certain local breeds by 0.15 (Switzerland), 0.14 (Austria), 0.21 (Poland), and 0.13 (Sweden). Several local breeds showed a lower proportion of cows with >100,000 somatic cells/mL. This was the case in Switzerland (OB 24.2%; BV 35.8%), Austria (AL 25.3%; BV 36.9%), and Sweden (SRB 42.4%; SH 43.4%). In contrast, the respective proportion in Poland exceeded 82% in all breeds except the commercial PHI? (76.1%). In Sweden, lactations with veterinary treatments were considerably less prevalent in SRB (15.6%) than in SH (21.7%). In Austria, breeds differed only in treatments for udder disorders, which favored AL. In conclusion, the markedly lower milk yields of local breeds are partly counterbalanced by (somewhat inconsistent) advantages in longevity, fertility, and health traits across 4 European countries. This indicates that the robustness of local breeds can contribute to improved sustainability of organic dairy systems.

AB  - The Lumparn Bay, due to its nature, is prone both to natural and anthropogenic environmental pressures. It is a semi-enclosed rather large, but relatively shallow bay filled with glacial and postglacial sediments. Unlike any other areas in the world the seafloor in this area is filled with gas domes. Comparison with the chemistry of some 2000 surface core samples from the Gulf of Finland revealed that the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, lead, zinc, and sulphur from the Lumparn Bay were in general on a low level, indicating only minor pressures on the seafloor. However, when compared to established sediment quality guidelines there are a few points of possible concern as some samples exceed the probable effects level for arsenic and quite a few samples exceed the effects range - median level for nickel. Also a few comparably high molybdenum concentrations exceed the lowest effects level.

T2  - URBAN TRANSPORT VI: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
LA  - English
CP  - 6th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment for the 21st Century
AB  - More sustainable urban travel highly depends on the administrative and legal frameworks within cities have to operate. In order to identify examples for "best practice" in Europe, a comprehensive picture was conducted as part of the LEDA project, funded by the European Commission's DGVII [1]. The study extends to all EU states, five Central and Eastern European states as well as Switzerland and Norway. As the project demonstrates, the legal, financial and administrative powers granted to local governments vary considerably by country. While there is rather tight central government control in some countries (e.g. the UK), there is much more "elbow room" in others (e.g. Switzerland, Scandinavia, Germany, Austria). Local authorities are at their greatest autonomy regarding their own local road network, e.g. parking management, traffic calming, local public transport, cycling and walking. The LEDA project also reveals that, in order to transfer "good" transport policy and measures from one country to the other, the different legal frameworks are less important as major barriers than political and public acceptance.

AB  - This paper looks at aspects of two institution building and development projects funded by the European Commission (EC) in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) and Palestine in the fields of pilgrimage, tourism, and the cultural industries. Both projects involved co-operation between universities and civil society organisations within the two partner countries together with academic and other institutions in member states (Italy and the UK in the case of BiH, Finland and the UK in the Palestinian case). They took place during the period between 2003 and 2008, both lasting for about three years. The aim of the projects was to educate and train a cadre of young specialists (25 in the BiH case, 10 in the Palestinian case) in the fields of tourism and the cultural industries, starting with the construction and delivery of a Masters degree in both cases, in order to contribute to the development of tourism and the cultural industries in their respective countries and regions. Both projects were founded on the hope and belief of the authorities both in the two countries and in the EC that these fields would provide a stimulus to post-conflict economic growth. Both projects were part of the EC's TEM PUS Programme. This is a Programme that supports and encourages the development of universities in countries on the borders of the European Union (EU) by encouraging them to link closely to other civil society organisations and institutions in the public and private sectors and then to use the enhanced power and effectiveness of such 'de-centralised co-operation', as the language of the EC has it, to make an decisive and beneficial impact on the field. If the key feature of the TEMPUS Programme in general is the embedding of the activities of higher education institutions within civil society institutions, the central feature of the two projects to be described here was, as has been said, that both of them concerned aspects of 'culture', 'cultural heritage', and the economic and development possibilities that both provide through tourism and allied activities. Thus the paper has three parts. The first briefly discusses the notions of civil society, culture and cultural heritage. The second explores some of the work of the projects as this was manifest in a selection of the Master degree dissertations produced by project participants. The third part looks back at the projects and assesses their relation to the present state of BiH and Palestine.

AB  - Outbreaks of spruce bark beetle Ips typographus have devastating effects on European forest landscapes. Salvage removal of windfelled trees is deemed effective to prevent the outbreaks, although adverse effects on ecosystem recovery, ecologically valuable legacies, and unclear economic performance raise concerns about the widespread use of this practice. Here, we formulated a novel management framework aiming for the salvaging of a limited number of windfelled stands with the highest leverage for outbreak risk, potentially replacing the current largescale uniform treatments. We demonstrated our concept in a Central European forest landscape using the forest disturbance model iLand and a newly developed optimization tool based on graph theory. We simulated the removal of 33% and 66% of windfelled trees in (i) stands randomly distributed on the landscape and (ii) stands identified by the optimization algorithm. Moreover, we tested the effect of (iii) a no-treatment strategy and (iv) complete removal of windfelled trees.
   We found that the spatially optimized salvaging that aimed to remove 66% of the windfelled trees reduced the level of damage from bark beetles by 55%, whereas the non-optimized treatments, which removed the same volume of windfelled trees, reduced the damage by only 10%. In contrast to the reference treatments, the optimized approaches also retained their efficiency under elevated air temperature, which amplified the outbreaks. Although effects on deadwood retention were variable, the optimized treatments mitigated the economic impacts of the outbreak more effectively. The total loss of 7487 EUR ha1, incurred without any treatment, was reduced by 36.7%-68.9% (range for 33 % and 66 % salvaging intensity), whereas the loss reduction under the reference treatments was only 27.6%-57.7%.
   We conclude that the spatially optimized salvaging proposed here can better balance multiple management objectives than the broadly applied uniform treatment, including the reduction of secondary disturbance from bark beetles, deadwood retention and economic goals.

AB  - Improving productivity in forest logging operations while reducing negative impact on soil and streams has gained increasing attention. Positioning primary extraction routes is crucial in these efforts, as it has a huge impact on efficient and sustainable forwarder passages. To minimize the total forwarding distance and avoid steep terrain and impact on soil and water, we developed a decision support system, including a detailed optimization model and solution method. The main source of information consisted of a detailed digital terrain model, depth-to-water maps, and forest volume density. The information was supplemented with the extent of the stand, position of the landing(s), nature and culture conservation sites, and any known unavoidable crossings in the terrain (e.g., streams). Because fast solution time was a critical requirement, we developed a decomposition method based on Lagrangian relaxation. The system was evaluated in two case studies in Sweden. In the first case, the optimization model performance was analyzed at 30 final harvesting sites. In the second case, experienced forest company staff evaluated the primary extraction routes at 19 harvest sites in operational conditions. The results indicated that the model allowed for faster planning, shorter driving distances, and the potential to reduce negative impact on soil and water.

AB  - The global renewable energy landscape is changing rapidly. Green energies reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diversify the energy supply, and lower dependence on volatile and uncertain fossil fuel markets. The future looks promising for green energy sources, which are taking on an increasingly important role, especially in the current context, as governments are trying to identify viable solutions to the energy crisis and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Worldwide, there is a growing interest in and support for green energy sources, a factor that could help accelerate the current energy transition. Despite these positive developments, much remains to be done globally to make the energy transition a reality. In this respect, the European Union member states have committed to a wide neutrality target by establishing an increase in the total share of energy from renewable sources to 55% (by 2030) and, at the same time, reducing the net greenhouse gas effect emissions by at least 55% until 2030 to reach the neutrality target by 2050. Green energy sources are essential for long-term efforts to mitigate climate change and will play an important role in improving energy security and accessibility. The efforts of every country to strengthen the energy sector through the development of green energies will reduce geopolitical risks and disproportionate external costs for society. The large-scale use of green energies will contribute to sustainable development. The objective of our research is to review the literature on green energy in the context of sustainable development by analyzing research conducted by various authors and international organizations on these topics. The period considered for this study is 2011-2020. Our research focused on the EU 27, but the review also took into account the results obtained by other countries worldwide, such as China, the USA, Norway, and Iceland. The main research method used was the analysis of scientific papers, studies developed by international organizations, and a wide set of agreements and political commitments assumed by different states for developing green energy as a solution for sustainable development. The obtained results show an interesting international debate about green energies and how they can contribute to sustainable development. This paper's results also show that in 2019 at the global level, low-carbon energy sources, including nuclear power and renewable energy, accounted for 15.7% of primary energy (solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal and wave and tidal), while in 2021, for the EU 27, the share of energy from renewable sources reached 22%. According to international statistics, more than 90% of the governments of many countries are making investments to efficiently capitalize on green energy sources and to design new models of sustainable economic and social development, in order to lower pollution levels, reduce the dependence on fossil fuel imports and limit the climate change impact.

AB  - At the end of October 2018, the "Vaia" storm hit the eastern sector of the Italian Alps, causing major damage to forests. The resulting changes in habitat and resource availability are expected to shape the structure and abundance of soil communities. In this research, a soil arthropod community is studied one year after the catastrophic Vaia event in forests affected by the storm (W: Windthrow) to highlight the shift in the soil faunal community in a Mediterranean area increasingly impacted by climate change. Intact forests (IF) close to W were studied as a control condition and meadows (M) were considered to understand if W is moving toward a conversion to M or if the wooded character still prevails. Soil organic matter content was higher in IF than in W and M. The arthropod community was different between M and forests, both W and IF, while no differences were detected between W and IF considering the whole soil arthropod community. The Vaia catastrophic event does not appear to have radically changed the soil arthropod community and biodiversity after one year, despite upheaval to the vegetation cover, but the response is partially OTU (operative taxonomic unit)-specific. Hymenoptera adults and Coleoptera and Diptera larvae appear to be the most affected OTUs, showing lower abundance in W than IF. Conversely, Chilopoda seemed to benefit from the habitat changes, the result strongly related with the W condition. The two most present OTUs, Collembola and Acarina, were not affected by the Vaia storm. We may conclude that the soil system needs longer time to show a clear shift in the soil arthropod community.

AB  - For residents of Finnish Lapland, snow frames outdoor and indoor activities during the entire year, both in its presence and in its absence. This article focuses on people's social and aesthetic perspectives on what is commonly referred to as "snow work",lumityo. In ethnographic tradition, the aim is to understand "doing living with snow" in contemporary urban society - with snow that falls and, unlike other forms of precipitation, stays around for many months to come, thus creating physical, mouldable obstacles that have mental, social and environmental consequences. The shovelling of snow is considered an important physical activity that allows people to practice their individual expert knowledge and lets them socialise during long annual periods of potential isolation. Hence, apart from its restricting features, snow and ice enhance the meaning of homeowners' dwelling in the open. In this context, aesthetic and creative concepts are essential where they draw on people's gardening and artistic skills, and bring satisfaction to those engaging with this mundane and unavoidable activity.

AB  - The research goal is to investigate whether several cross-cultural dimensions proposed in the Hofstede cultural model link international companies and their affiliations operating in Scandinavia and Baltic countries. Although cultural aspects have got much more attention in internationalisation studies over the last decade, there is still room for research focusing on such study areas. The authors start with the analysis of the literature review. Presenting the holistic approach affecting internationalisation and a list of factors necessary for internationalisation, later on, the authors present the cultural dimension of Hofstede, and then give various qualitative methods applied for studies on internationalisation. Design/Methodology/Approach: To complete the research, the authors selected the database from Nasdaq (2021), listed MNE companies from six countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The mother company is located in Scandinavia, and the daughter company is in the Baltics based on FDI flows. The author's research included 56 MNE companies from Nasdaq Baltic stock exchange. We used the correlation matrix to support the research and present the direction of identified connections to proceed with it. Findings: Obtained results revealed that there are strong links among several cultural dimensions. The results show seven positives and four negative links when discussing cross-cultural links. This finding shows that talking about intercultural relations, only four out of six Hofstede cultural dimensions have at least one strong connection operating business internationally. Originality/Value/Practical implications: The authors identified that some cross-cultural dimensions could not be analysed further because they do not have significant links. The limitations of the study and further research directions are also provided.

AB  - Dispersal is a key determinant of the population dynamics of species. Thus, a better understanding of how dispersal is affected by the landscape structure and how animals make decisions about moving across different landscapes is needed. We studied the dispersal of 60 radio-collared juvenile Siberian flying squirrels (Pteromys volans) in southern Finland. The effect of landscape structure on selected dispersal direction, dispersal distance, and straightness of dispersal path was studied. Flying squirrels were capable of dispersing over long distances in fragmented forest landscapes. The patches used as temporary roosting sites during dispersal were of a lower quality than were those used as finally occupied patches. The patches used were larger than were patches on average in the study areas. There was a very clear directional bias in the dispersal path (i.e., it was nearly a straight line), which remained over a large scale, but wide-open areas obstructed the straightness of the path. As the distances between crossed patches increased, short-distance dispersers were found further away from their natal home range. However, there were no differences in the landscape that could explain the differences between individuals in decisions to remain philopatric or to become short- or long-distance dispersers. In addition, whereas short-distance dispersers dispersed in random directions, long-distance dispersers started to disperse in directions dominated by preferred habitat. Thus, there were behavioral differences between dispersers. Our results supported the hypotheses stating that individuals decide to disperse long or short distances before the onset of dispersal.

AB  - In June 1997, we visited the Magnifica Comunita di Fiemme (MCF), a community forest in the Alps of northern Italy. We have prepared this article to help broaden the perspectives of Forestry Chronicle readers on community forests and what they mean in various parts of the world. We first describe the area and its forests, and then give a brief history of the MCF. Then we review the forest-management strategies used in this Norway spruce forest, and summarize the logging and wood-processing activities of the enterprise. We continue with a comparison of this community forest with three community forests in Canada, concluding that generalization on what makes a community forest successful is dangerous - each situation is unique. Finally, given that the MCF recently won permission to use the eco-label of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), we discuss our perceptions of how the MCF operation does and does not meet the FSC's Principles and Criteria of Forest Stewardship. Despite several shortcomings, we believe that the MCF is in most respects a sound example of sustainable forest management.

AB  - Oxygen deficiency in the near-bottom water associated with eutrophication has been shown to have negative impacts on marine benthos in many Scandinavian waters. In the present study, the benthic fauna and the sedimentary habitat have been studied between 7 and 34 m depth; at 14 stations in three Swedish fjords in four different years, and at 12 stations along the Swedish coast in three different years. Ignition loss of the top sediment indicated generally enriched conditions. The benthic fauna showed temporal declines in number of species, numerical abundance and biomass, particularly since the first samplings in 1976 at the fjord stations, and in 1987 at the coastal stations. Benthic macrofauna was lacking at some stations and very low numbers were recorded in several samples. Highest quantities were recorded at the deepest fjord and coastal stations. Multivariate analysis showed that the faunal composition changed with time. Analysis of sediment profile images classified the benthic habitat as disturbed with a thin vertical depth distribution of the apparent redox potential discontinuity. It is the first time reductions in benthic fauna have been shown to occur in relatively shallow waters over large coastal areas at the Swedish Skagerrak coast. The cause of the deterioration of the fauna is suggested to be low oxygen concentrations at the bottom in association with detached vegetation, leading to organic enrichment and locally even to anoxic sediment conditions.

AB  - In several regions in Europe, the horse is becoming a common grazer on semi-natural and cultivated grasslands, though the pasturing benefits for animals and biodiversity alike are not universally appreciated. The composition of ground vegetation on pastures determines the value of both the forage for grazing animals as well as the biodiversity values for species associated with the pastoral ecosystems. We studied three pastures, each representing one of the management types in southern Finland (latitudes 60-61): semi-natural, permanent and cultivated grassland. All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several decades. We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses' welfare, on the one hand, and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions, on the other. Though there were differences among the pastures, the nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing season. Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the requirements, and supplementation of Cu, Zn and Na is needed to balance the mineral intake. Only minor injuries or health problems were observed. All metrics of biological values, as well as number of species eaten by horses, were particularly high in a semi-natural pasture compared to other pasture types. The highest ratio of species cover preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent pasture, while at the regularly re-seeded pasture, there was a particularly high cover of species, indicating low biodiversity values on grassland. There was, therefore, a trade-off between the quantity of forage and biological values in pastures, but not in quality. The results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity management. In each pasture type, specific management is needed to simultaneously achieve objectives of adequate pasturing and biodiversity. The short duration (only one grazing season) must be considered when applying the results.

AB  - It is well known that forests play a crucial role in preventing soil erosion and landslides; however, forests are also subjected to dynamic evolution driven by natural processes and anthropogenic factors. This dynamic evolution affects spruce and chestnut forests in some European regions (e.g., Italian Alps, central and northern Europe), where these species have been forced by management practice to establish over long periods where other species, such as European beech, would be expected to occur as a result of natural processes.
   Using a large dataset of field and laboratory measurements of root density and root mechanical properties, the performances of Norway spruce, Sweet chestnut and European beech are analyzed from a slope stability perspective by using a model based on the limit equilibrium principle within a probabilistic framework.
   The results showed differences and similarities between the root systems of the analyzed species, both in terms of root distribution and mechanical properties. However, the probabilistic distribution that better fits the root reinforcement values obtained by the experimental work is, in all cases, a lognormal function.
   The developed method can be used to estimate the factor of safety for several combinations of geotechnical and hydrological parameters and different root reinforcement probability distributions using Monte Carlo techniques. The obtained values have been evaluated in terms of probability to have a factor of safety of less than 1 for increasing values of slope steepness.
   Although each single hillslope should be studied individually to account for local stand conditions that strongly affect root system performance, European beech is generally more efficient than Sweet chestnut and Norway spruce in terms of enhancing slope stability.
   Based on our results, in all cases where the stability of slopes represents a concern and spruce and chestnut communities are perishing, the natural colonization by European beech should be evaluated positively and possibly promoted by forest managers. Moreover, the developed method provides a general framework that could be applied to other species and conditions to define the consequences of different forest management scenarios in terms of slope stability.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present renewable energy market development with particular regard paid to biofuels in the EU. The analysis included data on the share of renewables in Gross Island energy consumption, changes of renewable energy in the years 2004-2016 and the amount of liquid biofuels. The authors of the paper used descriptive and statistical methods to describe the changes in bioenergy development in the European Union (EU). The biggest share of biofuels and renewable waste can be seen in Latvia (31.2%), Finland (26.7%) and Sweden (24.8%). The highest percentage of wind energy in 2015 was found in: Denmark (7.2%), Portugal (4.3%), Ireland (4.0%) and Spain (3.5%). The highest share of solar energy in 2015 was found in Cyprus (3.5%), Spain (2.6%) and Greece (2.2%). The highest contribution of geothermal energy was found in 2015 in Italy (3.5%), Portugal (0.8%) and Slovenia (0.7%). Hydropower was the biggest in 2015 in Sweden (14.2%), Austria (9.6%) and Slovenia (5.0%). The highest coefficients of variation of the share of electricity from renewable energy sources were found in the years 2004-2017 in Malta (140.3%), Cyprus (101.1%) and United Kingdom (71.9%). In addition, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in heating and cooling in the years 2004-2017 were found in Malta (72.4%), United Kingdom (69.81%) and Hungary (44.91%). Moreover, the highest coefficients of variation of share of renewable energy sources in transport in the years 2004-2017 were found in Finland (113.78%), Malta (115.52%) and Belgium (96.53%).
   The biggest producers of ethanol and biodiesel in EU were Germany, France and Poland. Cluster analysis data show that Germany and France are of key importance in the production of biodiesel and ethanol. The biodiesel production increased in the years 2003-2017 from 719,32 million liters to 13323 million liters (increase 1852.2%). However, in the years 2014-2017 a stagnation in biofuel production was observed from 13673 million liters to 13323 million liters (-2,56%).

KW  - corporate social responsibility and CSR management
AB  - This paper presents a roadmap of Finnish companies adopting and managing corporate social responsibility (CSR). It discusses the companies' views on CSR and highlights the practices that Finnish companies have adopted or are currently adopting. It also presents a framework that outlines the CSR processes and management prospects.
   Results showed that Finnish companies are progressively managing CSR. This newly revived thinking about social responsibility is viewed as an issue traced back from Finland's history of industrial development. There is no general definition of CSR; however, various concepts are connoted into it. Driven by several factors, CSR is developing gradually as indicated by the positive responses and initiatives of the companies.
   CSR management and practices towards employees, suppliers, community and customers are well defined locally based generally on established socially responsible behavior which could be articulated by laws and regulations, corporate values and business ethics. However, managing CSR with a global scope, problems such as; lack of information and structured management system, different views and interpretations, supply chain complexities, overlap with environmental issues, etc. often lead some companies to manage CSR haphazardly. Views and management of CSR are also influenced by some distinct Finnish cultural attributes.
   An initial conceptual framework for CSR is drawn reflecting the current practices and prospects for management strategies. Such framework can be used in organizing and streamlining CSR elements for effective management approaches and measuring of performance. It could be expected that in due time, the efforts of the companies will become more evident, organized and systematically managed.

AB  - Based on ethnographic research on the encounter between local culture and schools in multicultural suburban areas, this article explores possibilities suggested by autonomous learning activities in a hip-hop collective that may have a potential to break urban segregation patterns. The collective's artistic production raises questions that have not been answered in schools, such as how the increasing class divisions between different parts of the urban landscape should be understood and dealt with. Different types of learning are identified connected to the self, others, and careers. Implications for schooling are briefly discussed.

AB  - Concentrations of organic acids in freshwaters have increased significantly during recent decades across large parts of Europe and North America. Different theories of the causes (e.g., recovery from acidification, climate change, land use) have different implications for defining the preindustrial levels for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which are crucial for assessing acidification and other aspects of water quality. We demonstrate this by classifying the acidification status of 66 lakes with long-term observations, representative of about 12,700 acid-sensitive lakes in nemoral and boreal Sweden. Of these lakes, 47% are classified as significantly acidified (Delta pH >= 0.4), assuming preindustrial DOC levels were equal to those observed in 1990. But if instead, the higher DOC levels observed in 2009 define preindustrial conditions, half as many lakes are acidified (24%). This emphasizes the need to establish reference levels for DOC and casts new light on the classic controversy about natural versus anthropogenic acidification.

AB  - Although celebrating five hundred years in Sweden in 2012, only little attention has been given to the Roma's long-term presence in the Swedish landscape, and even lesser to their historical presence in urban contexts. Bearing in mind the Roma's twentieth-century European history and knowing of their contemporary situation, this knowledge gap is no surprise. This paper will present a study that has assembled various traces of Roma dwelling in a Swedish urban setting from the late nineteenth century until the 1950s. The study enables a pinning down of the mobile-immobile nexus around which the Swedish Roma everyday cultural practices of dwelling evolved during the particular period before citizenship and subsequent settlement: regulation, seasonality, income opportunities and material devices. Hereby it hopes to contribute to an understanding of Roma urban dwelling as moored in history by corporeality and materiality, and as related both with locality and with elsewhere'. The following questions are posed: Which were these urban places of dwelling and what characteristics do they have; what kinds of social connections and interactions were established at these places (co-habitation); in what sense can these places reveal a differentiated Roma history of dwelling? Besides uncovering a particular ephemeral multi-sitedness', the study also reveals Roma urban dwelling as related to broader spectrum of tenure than hitherto recognized.

AB  - Aim Abundances of animals vary according to species-specific habitat selection, but habitats are undergoing rapid change in response to anthropogenic alterations of land use and climate. The long-term decline of snowfall is one of the most dramatic abiotic changes in boreal regions, with potential to alter species communities and shape future ecosystems. However, the effects of snow cover on habitat-specific abundances remain unclear for many taxa. Here we explore whether long-term declines in snow cover affect the abundances of overwintering birds. Taxon Fifty bird species. Location Finland, Northern Europe. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models to analyse citizen-led monitoring data from 196 transects over a 32-year period to assess whether abundances of birds have changed in built-up areas, farmlands and forests, and whether these covary with warming temperatures and decreasing snow. We then explored if changes in abundance can be explained by body mass, migration strategy or feeding guilds of the species. Results Over the study period, the abundance of overwintering birds increased. This increase was most pronounced in farmlands (69.6%), where abundances were positively associated with decreasing snow depth. On the other hand, while abundances in built-up habitats (19.5%) decreased over the study period, they increased in periods of high snow depths. Finally, we found that the short-distance migration strategy explains changes in bird abundances with snow. In farmlands, ground feeding birds and heavier birds also show a positive trends in abundance with decreasing snow depths. Main conclusions Local snow conditions are driving habitat selection of birds in the winter; birds in farmlands were most responsive to a decrease in snow depth. Changing snow depths can affect bird movements across habitats in the winter, but also influence migratory patterns and range shifts of species.

AB  - The positive trend of increased use of railway transportation in Europe has resulted in an increased sensitivity to and occurrence of traffic disturbances. In addition to the need for extensions of the infrastructure, the need to effectively limit and predict the effects of disturbances becomes apparent. The kernel of the disturbance management problem is to revise the original timetable in line with the new conditions and decide where, when and how trains should overtake or meet to minimise the negative effect of the disturbance. In previous research, the author has designed optimisation-based approach for rescheduling, which seems promising, but for some scenarios it is difficult to find good solutions within seconds. Also, more detailed constraints will have to be included, which makes the problem even more complex and difficult to solve. Therefore the author developed a greedy algorithm that effectively delivers good solutions within the permitted time. To quickly retrieve a feasible solution, the algorithm performs a depth-first search using an evaluation function to prioritise when conflicts arise and then branches according to a set of criteria. A performance analysis of the algorithm was carried out using simulated experiments showing its strengths and weaknesses.

AB  - Headwater streams are intimately linked to their riparian zones, yet in conservation planning streams have attracted much less attention than riparian forests. We assessed the relation between the conservation status of riparian forests and taxonomic completeness (ratio of observed to expected taxa richness, O/E) of stream bryophytes and benthic invertebrates in fifty northern Finnish headwater streams. The streams represent three levels of riparian modification: pristine old-growth forests (Woodland Key Habitats, WKHs), slightly modified and strongly modified (mainly drainage ditching) forests. Macroinvertebrate O/E ratios were significantly, by about 40%, higher in natural than in modified sites. Bryophyte O/E ratios in strongly modified sites were about half of those in pristine sites (mean O/Es: 0.95 vs. 0.50, respectively) whereas the pristine and slightly modified sites did not differ. O/E ratios of both groups were negatively correlated with fine sediments, indicating drainage as the primary factor impairing stream condition. Eight streams,(four pristine, four slightly modified) monitored through six years showed little temporal variability in taxonomic completeness. Nonetheless, inter-annual variability in O/E was sufficient to cause frequent misclassifications of stream status, slightly modified sites being frequently classified as no different from the reference. For macroinvertebrates, sites indicative of high conservation value (CV) were rather evenly distributed among the three status classes, whereas the bryophyte CV index was lower for the strongly modified than for pristine sites. Several sites defined degraded a priori scored high values for the CV index of macroinvertebrates. Conservation efforts focusing on small-scale key habitats may therefore be insufficient and need to be complemented by sites that remain beyond protected area networks (WKHs), yet support high conservation value in terms of rare taxa occurrence. Conclusions about the performance of protected area networks should not be based on a single taxonomic group as different groups may yield different assessment outcomes. We also suggest that sites that are in inferior ecological condition (O/E < 1.0) yet support unexpectedly high numbers of rare taxa (CV > 1.0) should be addressed as 'restoration priority sites' that might benefit from in-stream or riparian (or both) restoration.

AB  - As a consequence of past decades of extensive afforestation in Norway, mature forest volumes are increasing. National forestry politics call for sustainable and efficient resource usage and for increased regional processing. Regional policies seek to provide good conditions for such industries to be competitive and to improve regional value creation. We demonstrate how methods from operations research and regional macro-economics may complement each other to support decision makers in this process. The operations research perspective is concerned with finding an optimally designed wood value chain and an aggregated planning of its operations, taking a holistic perspective on strategic-tactical level. Using Input-Output analysis methods based on statistics and survey data, regional macro-economics helps to estimate each industry actor's value creation and impact on society beyond immediate value chain activities. Combining these approaches in a common mathematical optimization model, a balance can be struck between industry/business and regional political interests. For a realistic case study from the northern part of coastal Norway, we explore this balance from several perspectives, investigating value chain profits, economic ripple effects and regional resource usage.

AB  - Between 1955 and 1967, Jussi Jannes had the opportunity to design and build most of the public space of Tapiola, a new Finnish town that was conceived as a laboratory in which experimental solutions susceptible to being extrapolated to other urban interventions could be studied. This experimental condition allowed him to elaborate a delicate sequence of intermediate spaces that could articulate the different scales and spheres of the city, from the territorial to the domestic, thus favoring environmental connectivity and social inclusiveness as qualitative values of the urbanscape. The present article addresses an analysis of this experience with the aim of contributing to the identification and assessment of the role played by mediation spaces, in this case arising from the overlapping and intertwining of multiple realities, in the life of the public space of our cities. The critical review of the proposed case is relevant at a time like the present, in which the practices of urban planning and design are being reoriented on the basis of the previous definition of interconnected networks of spaces of high social, environmental and cultural value that are now known as green and blue infrastructures.

AB  - This paper provides new evidence on the role of city planning, urban form, and built environment characteristics in health and well-being during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Based on survey and geographic information systems (GIS) data from Oslo and Viken in Norway, the paper investigates changes in health and well-being due to COVID-19 and how the compact city and its characteristics relate to these changes. Findings indicate that self-reported measures of health and well-being worsened due to COVID-19. The most substantial changes were reported for life satisfaction, anxiety, and satisfaction with leisure, personal relationships, and vacations. General health, happiness, and satisfaction with income also declined during COVID-19 in comparison with pre-COVID-19 times. Overall, residents of compact neighborhoods reported lower well-being during COVID-19 compared to residents of lower-density neighborhoods. Important compact city characteristics - higher neighborhood density, reliance on public transport, smaller dwellings, and less green space - were negatively associated with well-being and health outcomes during COVID19. In contrast, another compact city attribute, the presence of numerous local facilities, was positively linked to well-being and health during COVID-19. Based on these findings, the paper presents possible implications for sustainable urban planning and compact cities.

AB  - With the decline of many of the world's fisheries, increased regulation, including marine protected areas (MPA), forms an increasingly important role in promoting sustainable resource use. Here, we present a novel "real-time" genetic monitoring programme used to protect the depleted Norwegian coastal cod stock (NCC) in an MPA during the spawning season, while a fishery targeted at the sustainable Northeast Arctic cod stock (NEAC) operates immediately outside. In the period 2009-2016,> 6800 cod from the fishery were genotyped with the PanI locus that is discriminatory between these two stocks. The estimated fraction of NEAC increased during the study period until 2014; however, it did not exceed 70% for any sustained period. Therefore, the MPA remained closed for commercial harvest. Genetic analysis of eggs revealed a distinctly lower fraction of NEAC than in the catch from the adult stock, both immediately outside and within the MPA itself. We suggest that this discrepancy is likely to reflect differences in spawning areas used by NCC and NEAC. Estimated fractions of NEAC/NCC using PanI, otolith classification, and 39 single nucleotide polymorphisms were similar, thus validating the use of PanI to estimate NEAC/NCC composition.

AB  - Compiling forest policy at national and sub-national levels is a participatory activity that aims to achieve balance between multiple forest-use alternatives. In Finland the effectiveness and acceptability of regional forest programmes has been doubted. The quest for collaboration among stakeholders towards consensus and commitment may be improved via the use of various group learning and multi criteria decision-making methods. This study reports the phases, results and implications of an extensive action research project, applying soft systems methodology, which aims to enhance regional forest programmes by facilitating increased use of collaborative decision support methods. Stakeholder feedback from demonstration meetings suggested that discussing alternative futures and prioritizing action proposals in a multi-stakeholder group through a simple multi-attribute rating technique are the most promising immediate enhancements. An ex-post evaluation of the suggested "ideal process model" showed that the deliberative nature of regional forest programmes had strengthened and that strategic and regional choices had become more prevalent in Finnish processes. The evaluation further underlined the need for simple, easily adoptable qualitative methods, but results remained ambiguous regarding potentials of quantitative, aggregative methods. Methodological developments cannot alone unlock central problems of the programme process, namely weak political capital and propensity toward status-quo, but the programme organisation is to be redefined as well.

AB  - This paper makes contributions to long-established debates about the meaning of home-ownership and to the growing interest in discourse and language in urban and housing research. It outlines a theoretical framework in which analogy and metaphor are crucial devices in the social construction of home-ownership knowledge. The paper draws upon some results from qualitative fieldwork undertaken amongst a small group of home-owner households in Bristol, UK, to illustrate metaphorically structured, common-sense aphorisms as rhetorical techniques in the mobilisation of tenure prejudice. The paper concludes by outlining new directions for research exploring the cultural significance of housing tenure, and makes some more general observations regarding the significance of analogy and metaphor in urban studies.

TI  - The Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility as a best-practice model for biodiversity data infrastructures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
LA  - English
AB  - Biodiversity informatics has advanced rapidly with the maturation of major biodiversity data infrastructures (BDDIs), such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility sharing unprecedented data volumes. Nevertheless, taxonomic, temporal and spatial data coverage remains unsatisfactory. With an increasing data need, the global BDDIs require continuous inflow from local data mobilisation, and national BDDIs are being developed around the world. The global BDDIs are specialised in certain data types or data life cycle stages which, despite possible merits, renders the BDDI landscape fragmented and complex. That this often is repeated at the national level creates counterproductive redundancy, complicates user services, and frustrates funders. Here, we present the Finnish Biodiversity Information Facility (FinBIF) as a model of an all-inclusive BDDI. It integrates relevant data types and phases of the data life cycle, manages them under one IT architecture, and distributes the data through one service portal under one brand. FinBIF has experienced diverse funder engagement and rapid user uptake. Therefore, we suggest the integrated and inclusive approach be adopted in national BDDI development.

AB  - Expanding populations of farmland foraging geese are causing escalating conflict with agriculture. We used questionnaires to investigate farmersA ' perceptions in mid-Norway of spring staging geese and the extent to which they attempt to reduce pasture damage by goose scaring. We predicted farmers' scaring effort (a measure of dissatisfaction) to increase on fields closer to goose roosting sites where goose grazing intensity was highest (measured by dropping counts). Results showed no such relationship, suggesting that farmers' perception of goose use was not linked to actual goose use, but influenced by sociological factors and individual opinion. These results confirm the need to distribute subsidies/compensation to affected farmers based upon quantifiable measures of goose use rather than complaint levels. To avoid further conflict escalation, it is equally important that managers are aware of farmersA ' perceptions and their causes, to effectively target communication about policies and measures to mitigate goose-agriculture problems.

AB  - Ant colony optimization (ACO) is still quite a new technique and seldom used in the field of forest planning compared to other heuristics such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. This work was aimed at evaluating the suitability of ACO for optimizing the clear-cut patterns of a forest landscape when aiming at simultaneously minimizing the risk of wind damage and maintaining sustainable and even flow of periodical harvests. For this purpose, the ACO was first revised and the algorithm was coded using the Visual Basic Application of the ArcGIS software. Thereafter, the performance of the modified ACO was demonstrated in a forest located in central Finland using a 30-year planning period. Its performance was compared to simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm. The revised ACO performed logically since the objective function value was improving and the algorithm was converging during the optimization process. The solutions maintained a quite even periodical harvesting timber while minimizing the risk of wind damage. Implementing the solution would result in smooth landscape in terms of stand height after the 30-year planning period. The algorithm is quite sensitive to the parameters controlling pheromone updating and schedule selecting. It is comparable in solution quality to simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.

AB  - Any risk analysis process leading to the remediation of contaminated land will be affected by individual judgements. Many contaminated land risk assessments in Sweden are reviewed by the County Administrative Board (CAB), a regional government authority. The cost for risk assessments and eventually remediation is funded by whichever operator is legally responsible; however, when the responsible party is unknown, the cost can be met by government grants. A questionnaire was sent to all employees working with contaminated land at each of Sweden's CABs to investigate whether gender, age and work experience, as well as funding source, affect the reviewing of risk assessments, and the employees' perception of knowledge gained from the Sustainable Remediation (Hallbar Sanering) research programme. It was found that gender was the most significant factor, but also age and experience of the employees influenced the respondent's answers. The reviews of risk assessments also varied depending on funding source.

AB  - The pattern for distribution of genetic variation within and between populations is referred to as the genetic population structure of the species. To avoid depletion of genetic resources sustainable management should be based on knowledge of this structure. We discuss key aspects of genetic population structure in the context of identifying biological units for fisheries management, suggesting three basic types of structuring: distinct populations; continuous change; and no differentiation. The type of structure determines how units for genetically sustainable management are to be identified. We also review what is currently known regarding the genetic population structure of fishes exploited in the Swedish part of the Baltic Sea, and conclude that sufficient genetic information is lacking for most of the species. This is a serious problem, particularly considering that populations of several commercially exploited fishes are declining and some exhibit recruitment problems. For six species, Atlantic herring, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, European eel, turbot, and pike, sufficient genetic data are available to provide at least basic information on genetic structure and genetic units for biologically sustainable use. Current management practices do not sufficiently consider these data.

AB  - This study examined visitors' preferences for forest management at five adjacent municipal recreation sites in Finland, using a spatially explicit choice experiment. The study design accounted for changes in scenery and biodiversity indices in the forest environment resulting from forest management practices. Respondents were asked to choose their preferred management option from alternative management regimes for the sites. The options were characterized by different levels of attributes, which included site-specific species richness levels and forest scenery, costs of management, and indicators of species richness levels over the system of recreation sites. Results show that visitors have a strong preference for the preservation of species richness and for scenic beauty. However, when there is a trade-off between these benefits, visitors chose their favourite scenery at their favourite recreation site and prefer management options, which preserve biodiversity at the other sites in the recreation system. The study shows how modelling the sites as independent units of the forest management regime permit policy-relevant conclusions to be drawn regarding the specialisation and zoning of multiple-use objectives.

AB  - This paper describes current practice in road surface and subsurface drainage in Sweden and analyzes the necessity for adaptation of the planning, construction, operation, maintenance and monitoring of road drainage measures to climate change. Based on a survey of professionals working with various aspects of road drainage, the study sought to identify: (1) problems experienced concerning road drainage, focusing on the current Swedish climate; (2) future problems regarding climate change impacts such as flooding and high flows; and (3) suggestions for adaptation measures concerning road drainage systems, taking future climate change into account. Suggested improvements concerning management and planning included clarification of responsibility for drainage issues, better overview of the location and condition of drainage facilities, inclusion of drainage system maintenance in procurement of operation contracts, maintenance plans for drainage facilities, and monitoring and inspection of drainage measures. Suggestions concerning drainage system construction, operation and maintenance included increasing the capacity of drainage facilities, stabilizing ditch slopes and various measures to prevent clogging of culverts.

AB  - Urbanization coupled with climate change is expected to put pressure on the urban stormwater network. To predict and mitigate the effects of these trends, accurate modeling of urban stormwater changes is required at scales and resolutions meaningful to stormwater management. Although numerous studies have analyzed the effect of climate change on urban flooding risk using the event-based approach, none have incorporated the continuous modelling approach to investigate the whole spectrum of changes in an urban catchment. This study analyzes seasonal changes in future urban hydrological behavior using a mini-ensemble of six state-of-the-art climate model projections and a calibrated hydrological-hydraulic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The modelling results show future changes in seasonal and monthly hydrological behavior. The notable winter warming is the major driver in the future snow processes, resulting in considerably less snow days and an increase in the flow events frequency during the winter months. The modelling results also suggest an increase in the annual maximum hourly flow in all seasons, with the clearest trend modelled in winter. Monthly average runoff during the cold period is modelled to increase, while no clear trends are detected for the rest of the year. There is a clear added benefit in using convection-permitting regional climate models throughout the year. Overall, the climate change mitigation and adaption strategies in urban catchments should focus more on the whole spectrum of changes rather than only on urban pluvial flooding risk. These findings call for a transition from traditional to a more advanced stormwater management.

AB  - We monitored population changes and breeding success of Curlews Numenius arquata in a 18 km(2) arable farmland area in southwestern Finland over a four-year period (1995-1998). During this time, the breeding population decreased from 30 to 23 pairs (23% decline). The majority of breeding failures took place during the incubation (57/84, 68%), and further losses occurred during chick rearing period as a result of which only 20% (17/84) of verified breeding attempts produced fledglings. There were 17 pairs (more than half of the breeding population) that failed in their breeding attempts every year. The overall reproductive success was 0.32 fledglings/pair, which was calculated to be too low to maintain a stable population. Nest predation (81%) and nest losses due to agricultural practices (16%) were the most important reasons for failed breeding attempts. We suggest that continual breeding failures (especially due to nest predation) may be the most important reason for the observed decline of Curlew populations in southern Finland.

AB  - The set-aside obligation under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) brought widespread benefits for wild farmland species. Shortly after it was abolished in 2008, the national political process in Finland replaced it with a targeted agri-environment scheme for environmental fallow. Though potentially highly valuable, the value of the current scheme for securing biodiversity is yet to be confirmed. This study evaluates the importance of set-asides established under CAP to all birds of open farmland based on national monitoring data from 2001 to 2006. The set-aside fields supported 25-40% more species and held 60-105% more pairs of birds typical of open farmland in comparison with cereal fields within a similar landscape setting. The estimated effect of set-aside presence in farmland on the studied bird species is large enough to trigger considerable changes in bird populations on the national scale. The relevance of the results to the novel agri-environment scheme is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is continuing to impact the social-ecological systems of polar regions. Climate models project substantial warming above the global average and high rates of environmental change in polar regions, but local impacts remain uncertain. These rapid alterations will affect biophysical, economic, and sociocultural conditions. This research aims to uncover early climate change indicators through climate model projections and individuals' perceptions by focusing on a sample of 39 municipalities north of the Arctic Circle in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and northwestern Russia. The study employs an exploratory sequential approach by combining representations of climate model projections in a geographic information system (GIS) with qualitative analysis from semi-structured interviews with local officials involved in planning decisions for each municipality. And, second, the study combined perceptions of early climate change indicators and their subsequent challenges and opportunities with regional climate projections. Results indicate an overall geographic 'match' between climate model projections and perceptions, but differences between north-to-south, coast-to-interior, and national perspectives are notable. Some of these differences point to the roles of nationally, regionally, and locally embedded geographies, producing a multitude of lived experiences. The implications of this study are relevant to global communities experiencing varying climate change risk perception from coastal-versus-interior regions.

AB  - A major aim of the aquaculture industry in Norway is to develop sustainable farming of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L. A great deal of research, including fanning trials and stock enhancement, has been performed on this species in Norway during the past two decades. The success of domestication of a new species depends on the genetic variability of the wild broodstock and the selection of appropriate genotypes for the fanning environment. Growth experiments under fanned conditions, including genetic analyses, were started as early as 1983 after the breakthrough of cod juvenile production in mesocosm systems. At later stages (1988 and 1992 year classes), more detailed studies were conducted under farmed conditions. Based on individual tagging and genotyping (blood and white muscle biopsy sampling), estimates of growth performance (specific growth rate, SGR) of the various genotypes within six polymorphic protein loci were obtained. In general, the SGR in the two experiments varied through the year as a function of temperature and body size. In the 1988 year-class experiment, only a few statistically significant differences (ANOVA) were detected among genotypes, measured as mean weight and SGR. The 1992 year-class experiment included two different cod stocks, Northeast Arctic (NE) and Norwegian coastal (NC) cod, which were reared for about two years in the same net pen. Further, during this experiment, only a few genotypes exhibited significantly different growth within the NE group. No consistency was found in the variation with regard to protein loci investigated, growth periods studied, and relationship with temperature variation.

AB  - Little is known about the effects of offshore energy installations on the marine environment, and further research could assist in minimizing environmental risks as well as in enhancing potential positive effects on the marine environment. While biofouling on marine energy conversion devices on one hand has the potential to be an engineering concern, these structures can also affect biodiversity by functioning as artificial reefs. The Lysekil Project is a test park for wave power located at the Swedish west coast. Here, buoys acting as point absorbers on the surface are connected to generators anchored on concrete foundations on the seabed. In this study we investigated the colonisation of foundations by invertebrates and fish, as well as fouling assemblages on buoys. We examined the influence of surface orientation of the wave power foundations on epibenthic colonisation, and made observations of habitat use by fish and crustaceans during three years of submergence. We also examined fouling assemblages on buoys and calculated the effects of biofouling on the energy absorption of the wave power buoys. On foundations we demonstrated a succession in colonisation over time with a higher degree of coverage on vertical surfaces. Buoys were dominated by the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. Calculations indicated that biofouling have no significant effect in the energy absorption on a buoy working as a point absorber. This study is the first structured investigation on marine organisms associated with wave power devices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cross-sectorial and cross-disciplinary collaboration, as well as public-private partnerships are necessary to handle the complexity of climate adaptation. The Research Council of Norway has established the Centres for Research-based Innovation (CRI) in which research- and education organizations, public entities and private enterprises join forces in 8-year long collaborations. CRI-Klima 2050 focuses on climate adaptation of buildings and infrastructure and runs several pilot projects to innovate new solutions for building resilience, stormwater- and landslide risk management. Several of the major infrastructure owners in Norway are partners in the centre. Norway is increasingly affected by precipitation triggered landslides. Klima 2050 pilot projects on landslide risk reduction include a web-based toolbox for prioritizing and choosing optimal mitigation measures, including Nature-Based Solutions, improved early warning systems and mitigation measures for slope instability, and improved local warning for hazardous weather systems, all developed in close collaboration between centre partners from different sectors and disciplines. The results of these projects can all be upscaled and are transferable to other infrastructure elements.

AB  - Public focus on the mineral potential of Norway and on the importance of responsible management of its mineral resources has increased dramatically within the last five years. This encompasses both the positive impact of the mining industry within Norway and the role it plays in meeting national and international demand for its products. The key roles of the geoscience community and the mining industry have included intensive communication with decision makers and with the public. The government has presented a national mineral strategy which includes further emphasis on "best practice" in relation to the sustainability of the industry. The industry already has many elements which are directed towards sustainability at different levels of its markets.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to report an investigation of local sustainable production in Australia and Sweden aimed at exploring the factors contributing to survival and competitiveness of manufacturing companies.
   Design/methodology/approach - In Australia, six companies were studied in 2010, with comparisons being made with three of them from earlier projects. In Sweden, eight manufacturing companies were studied on two occasions 30 years apart, in 1980 and 2010. To provide a valid comparative perspective a common format for data collection and analysis was used.
   Findings - There has been a shift in the nature of competition in both Sweden and Australia due to an increasing complexity of the global business environment as well as changes in technology and customer expectations. Despite the differences in country context, the findings suggest that all the manufacturing companies have a good awareness of the elements of the market environment and the relationships with their competitive strategy. However, in general, the Swedish companies have more experience of managing the risks and benefits from operating in the international environment.
   Research limitations/implications - The results of the research are based on a relatively small sample of case companies in a limited number of industrial sectors. There are methodology implications for future research in the area.
   Practical implications - The research results have practical implications for the manufacturing industry, especially for companies operating in a competitive international environment.

AB  - This article describes and evaluates a three-step methodology for measuring walkability at neighbourhood-scale, aimed at also being usable for planning practitioners. The methodology was developed as part of a larger study on whether densification in public transport nodes outside city centres in Norwegian cities is a good strategy for reducing traffic in cities, what can be done to increase the traffic-reducing effects, and how improved walkability can be part of this. We define walkability as to what extent the surroundings are nice to walk in, as well as pleasant and interesting, and inviting walking. Criteria for assessing walkability are divided into three categories: Infrastructure and traffic, Urbanity, and Surroundings and activities, with specified attributes attached. Data were collected from existing data sources, fieldwork, and interviews. We used the data to assess degree of walkability for each node on a scale from highly walkable to not walkable and found that walkability of the four investigated nodes varied from not walkable to walkable. The car-driver shares on travels related to the nodes were rather high, and we argue that they could be lowered by among others reducing car accessibility and improving walkability. We experienced that our methodology worked as intended at the neighbourhood-scale. If used at a larger scale, the approach could be supplemented by GIS tools. Interviews indicate that our perceptions as researchers are not necessarily in accordance of those of users of the streets. Use of Public Participation GIS tools could give a better understanding of these differences, and how this might be dealt with. Making cities more walkable is increasingly understood as a necessary part of sustainable urban development. By sharing experiences from using our methodology, we hope to contribute with relevant input to the ongoing discussions in cities across the world on how to measure walkability and how to develop cities and areas to become more walkable.

AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) load in discharges from cultivated soils may have negative impacts on surface waters. The magnitude of the load may vary according to soil properties or agricultural management practices. This study quantifies the DOC load of cultivated mineral soils and investigates whether the load is affected by agricultural practices. Discharge volumes and concentrations of DOC and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were continually measured at three sites from surface runoff and artificial subsurface drainage or from combined total discharge over a two-year period (2012-2014). Two experimental sites in South-West Finland had clayey soils (with soil carbon contents of 2.7-5.9% in the topmost soil layer), and the third site in West-Central Finland had sandy soil (soil carbon contents of 4.3-6.2%). Permanent grassland, organic manure application, mineral fertilization, and conventional ploughing or no-till activities were studied. Furthermore, the biodegradable DOC pool of surface runoff and subsurface drainage water from no-till and ploughed fields was estimated in a 2-month incubation experiment with natural bacterial communities collected from the Baltic Sea seawater.
   The annual DOC and DON loads were affected by discharge volume and seasonal weather conditions. The loads varied between 25-52 kg ha(-1) and 0.8-3.2 kg ha(-1), respectively, and were comparable to those from boreal forests with similar soil types. The DOC load increased with increasing topsoil carbon content at all sites. There were slightly higher DOC concentrations and DOC load from permanent grassland, but otherwise we could not distinguish any clear management-induced differences in the total DOC loads. While only 6-17% of the DOC in discharge water was biologically degraded during the 2-month incubation, the proportion of biodegradable (labile) DOC in surface runoff appeared to increase when soil was ploughed compared to no-till.

AB  - Coexistence in the same habitat of closely related yet genetically different populations is a phenomenon that challenges our understanding of local population structure and adaptation. Identifying the underlying mechanisms for such coexistence can yield new insight into adaptive evolution, diversification and the potential for organisms to adapt and persist in response to a changing environment. Recent studies have documented cryptic, sympatric populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in coastal areas. We analysed genetic origin of 6,483 individual cod sampled annually over 14 years from 125 locations along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast and document stable coexistence of two genetically divergent Atlantic cod ecotypes throughout the study area and study period. A "fjord" ecotype dominated in numbers deep inside fjords while a "North Sea" ecotype was the only type found in offshore North Sea. Both ecotypes coexisted in similar proportions throughout coastal habitats at all spatial scales. The size-at-age of the North Sea ecotype on average exceeded that of the fjord ecotype by 20% in length and 80% in weight across all habitats. Different growth and size among individuals of the two types might be one of several ecologically significant variables that allow for stable coexistence of closely related populations within the same habitat. Management plans, biodiversity initiatives and other mitigation strategies that do not account for the mixture of species ecotypes are unlikely to meet objectives related to the sustainability of fish and fisheries.

AB  - Aim Global change effects on forest ecosystems are increasingly claimed to be context dependent, indicated by interactions between global and local environmental drivers. Most examples of such context dependencies originate from temperate systems, while limited research comes from the boreal biome. Here we set out to test if interactions between climate warming, nitrogen deposition, land-use change resulting in increasing forest density, and soil pH drive long-term changes in understorey vegetation in boreal forests. Location Sweden. Time period 1953-2012. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We used long-term (50 years) National Forest Inventory data on forest understorey vegetation in Sweden to model the combined effects of climate warming, nitrogen deposition, increase in forest density (tree basal area), and soil pH. Results Our results identify increasing temperature, nitrogen deposition and denser, shadier forest conditions as the main drivers of understorey vegetation changes during this time period. More importantly, we found that these effects varied with local conditions, that is, that the change towards a more nitrophilic understorey vegetation was more pronounced at low than high soil pH. Forest density was an important modulator of nitrogen deposition and temperature increase, with effects generally decreasing with density. Decreased cover of ericaceous dwarf shrubs was driven by both forest density and nitrogen deposition, with a stronger effect at low than at high pH. Main conclusions Our results highlight that to understand forest ecosystems' response to global change, and to make adequate management decisions to mitigate the effects of global change, we need to understand how changes in local environmental factors (forest density and soil pH) interact with global-scale drivers (nitrogen deposition and climate warming). Neglecting such interactions will lead to incorrect estimations of effects. In our case, we would for example, have underestimated the eutrophication effects on acid soils, which constitute a considerable part of the boreal biome.

AB  - This article examines whether the European Commission succeeded in reducing the negative socio-environmental externalities of road transport in Northern, Central and South-eastern Europe by introducing the First Infrastructure Package and Interoperability Directive that opened rail freight markets to competition. Using results from the EC-sponsored REORIENT project, the article searches for causal links between the completeness of legislative adherence and the occurrence of market rivalry. In so doing, it draws on the New Public Management (NPM) theorem which provided conceptual underpinnings for liberalisation policy and the notion of path-dependency warning that effectiveness of any public policy is contingent on the features of its implementation context. The article contrasts the adoption of rail deregulation directives by the old and rich EU-states in the Nordic region with the newly liberated, more recent EU-members in Central and South-eastern Europe in order to expose how the political, economic and cultural features of these countries affected the quality of legislative compliance and market rivalry. This method unearthed a clearly polarised picture of inter-country compliance and competition pattern. Norway, Sweden and Finland exhibit high levels of legal adherence without however, much intra-rail competition. Cut-off from the government subsidies, these countries' state railways compete today with road operators, without however facing much rivalry from truckers. On the other hand, the new EU-members still lag on legislative conformance, but their licensing authorities granted operating permits to quite many private entrants. These carriers compete fiercely with the national incumbents, but the rail service quality they provide does not as yet threaten the dominance of truck in national freight transport. As a result, no inter-modal competition exists there. These findings indicate that liberalisation of rail freight market has not as yet reduced the road-rail imbalance in European freight markets nor curbed the negative socio-environmental externalities associated with motorised transport. Methodologically, this article exposed the analytical shortcoming of the NPM theorem and the strong empirical relevance of the path-dependency hypothesis.

AB  - The Nordic countries pursue ambitious energy transition goals through national energy policies and in the framework of Nordic cooperation. We propose that the transition is realistic only if it involves the public, private, and nongovernmental organization sectors as regulators, innovators, and advocates of relevant policies and solutions representing the multitude of interests involved. We examine these interests through Q methodological experiments, where 43 expert stakeholders' rank-order statements concerning their preferred policy measures vis-a-vis the electric energy system. Factor analysis of these subjectively held views produces three distinct views. The first two enjoy strong inter-Nordic support. The first view prioritizes market and grid development, and the second view prioritizes electric transport, and solar and wind power. The third, "Finnish" view seeks to enhance security of supply, also via microgrids, and prioritizes biofuels over electric transport. Examining the common ground among the three views, we find that enhanced cooperation requires reinforced stakeholder interaction and policy coordination.

AB  - Whilst the extant diversity management literature has provided a comprehensive array of theoretical frameworks and empirical studies on how organizations can and have approached the management of a diverse workforce, the same cannot be said about the literature on diversity in an international setting. Indeed, from a diversity management perspective we know surprisingly little about how multinational firms are responding to the increasing globalization of their workforce. This study seeks to contribute to this under-researched area through an in-depth longitudinal case study of TRANSCO, a well-known European MNC, which has been attempting to integrate diversity management globally throughout its worldwide operations. Adopting a Finnish host-country perspective, the study investigates what TRANSCO has been integrating, how it has tried to facilitate this and the challenges that have arisen throughout the process. The results indicate that TRANSCO has committed a considerable amount of resources to the global diversity management integration process, reflected in the myriad of integration mechanisms utilized. In terms of their integration strategy, it was evident that TRANSCO was able to achieve global consistency at the level of diversity philosophy, but was forced to rely on a more multi-domestic approach to implementing diversity policies and practices. The challenges encountered served to highlight the demographic, cultural and institutional embeddedness of diversity management when transferred into a non-Anglo-Saxon host context.

AB  - Modern pollen assemblages from the major vegetation units (both natural and anthropogenic) on the island of Hailuoto, Finland are studied from 29 surface moss samples. A total of 59 pollen and spore taxa are recorded. The pollen data-set is related by redundancy analysis (RDA) to six external synthetic variables that characterize in general terms the different major ecological situations relevant to the land-use on the island (sand, humus, forest, field, deforested, treeless). Weighted average (WA) optima are calculated to identify which pollen taxa are most indicative of four of these external variables. Two fossil pollen diagrams from Hailuoto are re-interpreted by positioning their samples on the RDA plot of the modern data-set and by classifying the modern and fossil spectra together in a minimum-variance cluster analysis. The RDA plot shows that the strongest features in the modern pollen assemblages are the contrast between spectra from dry sandy soils and those from damper soils with more organic content, and between assemblages from forested and unforested areas. For anthropogenic situations the numerical analyses detect a distinction in the pollen assemblages characterizing fields from those representing farms and trackways but is less successful in separating the latter two. The WA optima indicate that most pollen taxa considered as indicator types primarily represent a mixed field/farm category of land-use. The RDA and minimum-variance cluster analysis confirm that the two fossil sites have had different vegetational histories. In neither is there any phase equivalent to the modern farm situation on Hailuoto. The initial phase in each diagram represents shore meadows and fields but because Poaceae pollen is identifiable only to family level it is not possible to separate these two habitat types.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilisation has positive and negative effects on the environmental impact of crop cultivation. The mechanisms governing these effects are highly site-dependent, a factor often ignored in assessments of the environmental impact of crop cultivation. By assessing outputs of crop rotations using a life cycle approach, this study explored how greenhouse gas emissions and marine eutrophication caused by crop cultivation (including upstream processes such as production of farm inputs) depend on fertiliser rate and the site at which the cultivation occurs. Cereal unit (CU) was used as the functional unit. The calculations were based on data from multi-site long-term field experiments in Sweden and site-dependent data and models for non-measured processes. Cultivation at three N levels was evaluated, where the highest N rate was close to current average practices and the lowest level corresponded to one-third of that. Site characteristics had a stronger influence on both greenhouse gas emissions and marine eutrophication (variations of up to 330% and 490%, respectively, within N levels) than N level (variations of up to 74% and 59%, respectively, within sites). Main sources of variation in greenhouse gas emissions were soil nitrous oxide emissions (58-810g CO2eqCU-1) and soil organic carbon changes (14-720g CO2eqCU-1), while variations in marine eutrophication were mainly explained by field-level waterborne N losses (0.9-8.2g NeqCU-1). The large variation between sites highlights the importance of considering site characteristics when assessing the environmental impact of crop cultivation and evaluating the environmental consequences of crop management practices.

AB  - This study aimed at clarifying whether a notable group of soils of the Jaeren region, SW Norway, with deep humus-rich top soils support a man-made genesis. Four sites were investigated. The soils are characterized by thick top soils of 45, 70, 80, and 90 cm, which are enriched in soil organic matter and often also in artifacts, like fragments of potter's clay, indicating an anthropogenic origin. Soil pH ranges from 5.4 to 6.2 (H2O) and 4.4 to 5.3 (CaCl2), respectively. Soil organic C (SOC) contents range from 6.4 to 51.6 g kg(-1) and N contents vary between 0 and 2.9 g kg(-1). Increased P contents of up to 2,924.3 mg kg(-1) total P (P-t) and 1,166.4 mg kg(-1) citric acid-soluble phosphorus (P-c) in the humus-rich top soils support the assumption of an anthropogenic influence. Although many characteristics indicate an anthropogenic genesis, one soil lacks the required depth of 50 cm of a plaggen horizon and cannot be classified as Plaggic Anthrosol (WRB) and Plagganthrept (US Soil Taxonomy). As the requirement is 40 cm in the German system, all soils can be classified as Plaggenesch. The formation of these soils is related to human activity aiming at increasing soil fertility and overcoming the need of bedding material, the basic aims of the plaggen management in Europe. Highest P contents ever found for this kind of soils and references from the literature indicate that the formation of the soils in Norway started at Viking time, hence, being older than most other Plaggic Anthrosols.

AB  - We describe and analyze a pedagogical experiment that introduced a broad and holistic perspective on complete farming systems, systemic learning tools, and a participatory learning strategy at an early stage in agronomy education. The paper describes the adventure of three students, who came from a conventional agronomy program at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), who were frustrated with the lack of integrated approaches to the study of agricultural systems and a strong focus on molecular-level processes in their first year of education. They encountered a narrow focus in most courses and the overall curricula of agricultural education that is a function of specialization and university organization in unique departments that concentrate on small pieces of the large puzzle, that is the production milieu. In the current educational environment, it is difficult for students to make connections, integrate information and theories, and to create relevance to the challenges they observe in the practical world of farming and food systems. The three students agreed to put on pilots' costumes and climb into an experimental vehicle called experiential learning, one that provides just-in-time education and a very high degree of self-responsibility for the learning process. The paper describes, analyzes, and evaluates the comprehensive and exhausting pedagogical process they followed in one semester in Sweden and Viet Nam, with positive and negative aspects of the program. We provide reflective recommendations from students and advisors for future agronomic education programs with the focus on developing renewable agriculture, selecting students and evaluating performance, and designing practical programs that will motivate highly committed and action-oriented students.

AB  - The influences of different kinds of anthropogenic activities on rainwater chemistry in a tropical area were studied during one uninterrupted year at Piracicaba River Basin (Southeast Brazil). A total of 272 rainwater samples collected continuously from August 1997 to July 1998 at four different sites were analyzed for F-, CH3COO-, HCOO-, MSA, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3-, SO42-, C2O42-, PO43-, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, DOC (dissolved organic carbon), DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon), pH and conductivity. The most abundant ion was H+ and rain acidity was significant at all sampling sites (average pH of 4.4-4.5). The sources of this free acidity differ among sites and appear to be correlated to the different land-uses. The composition of rainwater appeared to be controlled mostly by three sources: soil dust, sugar cane burning and industrial emissions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many countries have included agriculture as one of the sectors where they intend to obtain significant greenhouse gas emission reductions. In Norway, the dairy-beef sector, in particular, has been targeted for considerable emission cuts. Despite publicly expressed interest within the agricultural sector for reducing emissions, significant measures have yet to be implemented. In this paper, we draw on qualitative data from Norway when examining the extent the wider agri-food network around farmers promotes or restrains the transition toward low-emission agricultural production. A qualitative analysis based on interviews with key stakeholders from various parts of the agri-food network of dairy-beef indicates that, if it is up to the dairy-beef system itself, it will develop in the direction of continued increased production volumes and increased efficiency in production, combined with moderate measures to reduce emissions. There is an obvious reluctance to stimulate the consumer demand toward other products or meat products with reduced emissions because such a solution would complicate full exploitation of existing agricultural resources and hence could bring considerable negative economic consequences. Another factor limiting the scope and drive towards a low-carbon production is that the effects of various potential climate measures do not appear as unambiguous. Our study indicates that the dairy-beef sector will likely not reach the goal of reduced emissions from its own initiatives. Rather, significant changes would probably require both push and pull support from forces outside the agricultural system.

AB  - Today total environmental impacts of power production arc a subject of emerging interest. Operation of power plants presents direct and indirect impacts to the environment, Direct impacts consist of instant emissions due to the operation of power plants and indirect impacts arc originated from the production and transportation of fuels and waste handling, The direct emissions arc monitored with Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) but indirect Life Cycle Impacts (LCI) are typically assessed only once during the design phase of process properties such as applied combustion technology and fuels. This paper introduces a procedure for a real time monitoring of total environmental impacts of power plants. The monitoring system aggregates direct and indirect impacts as a total environmental efficiency of the power plant. The procedure can be used e.g. for designing the environmentally friendly operation strategy for the power plant and sustainable purchasing of fuels.

AB  - Transportation of evidence-based programs (EBPs) to a new cultural setting is often preferred over the comprehensive process of developing a new program. Intervention fidelity has been suggested as a predictor of successful transportation. The present study examined whether fidelity and parent behavior improved when implementing the U.S.-developed Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention in Norwegian child welfare services (CWS). 11 child welfare workers received training and supervision to become ABC parent coaches. Fidelity was assessed through video-recordings of parent coaches' in vivo feedback at each home-visit session. Parent sensitive behavior was assessed using video-recordings of parent-child interactions, recorded before each ABC session. Mixed effects modeling showed that ABC fidelity increased over the course of training and supervision. Furthermore, parent behavior improved over the course of families' exposure to the intervention. These demonstrate that an EBP transported to a novel cultural setting can obtain promising levels of fidelity and intervention outcomes.

AB  - Nearly one and a half centuries ago, far-sighted Central European forest scientists established a network of long-term observational plots, many of them being under observation up to the present day. Especially the untreated plots reveal significant anthropogenic impacts on the structure and dynamics of forest ecosystems. Based on 14 observational plots, this study shows that tree size and stand parameters of oak (sessile oak, Quercus petraea (MATT.) LIEBL. and pedunculate oak, Quercus robur L) presently develop much faster than in the past, which is highly relevant for forestry in Central Europe. Thus, certain threshold sizes are reached decades earlier compared with the past. Due to the accelerated stand development, stem numbers per unit area are presently lower than at the same stand age in the past, while at the same time, stand density is higher. As we can show, also the level of the tree growth rate vs. tree size allometry increased significantly. These changes have major consequences for forest ecology and management, forest modeling, and eco-monitoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Anthropogenic mineral residues are characterized by their material complexity and heterogeneity, which pose challenges to the chemical analysis of multiple elements. However, creating an urban mine knowledge database requires data using affordable and simple chemical analysis methods, providing accurate and valid results. In this study, we assess the applicability of simplified multi-element chemical analysis methods for two anthropogenic mineral waste matrices: (1) lithium-ion battery ash that was obtained from thermal pre-treatment and (2) rare earth elements (REE)-bearing iron-apatite ore from a Swedish tailing dam. For both samples, simplified methods comprising 'in-house' wet-chemical analysis and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometry were compared to the results of the developed matrix-specific validated methods. Simplified wet-chemical analyses showed significant differences when compared to the validated method, despite proven internal quality assurance, such as verification of sample homogeneity, precision, and accuracy. Matrix-specific problems, such as incomplete digestion and overlapping spectra due to similar spectral lines (ICP-OES) or element masses (ICP-MS), can result in quadruple overestimations or underestimation by half when compared to the reference value. ED-XRF analysis proved to be applicable as semi-quantitative analysis for elements with mass fractions higher than 1000 ppm and an atomic number between Z 12 and Z 50. For elements with low mass fractions, ED-XRF analysis performed poorly and showed deviations of up to 90 times the validated value. Concerning all the results, we conclude that the characterization of anthropogenic mineral residues is prone to matrix-specific interferences, which have to be addressed with additional quality assurance measures.

AB  - The aim of this special issue is to address a conceptual and empirical gap in the existing literature on sustainable cities. Uniquely, it brings together questions about the "what" (in this case, the content and representation of urban policy) of research on urban sustainability with "how" (the social organisation of knowledge and action) through the results of collaborative and comparative work. The special issue contains curated contributions that draw upon the findings of a comparative international project funded by Mistra (Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research) through the Mistra Urban Futures Centre, based in Gothenburg. The project sought to bring together two questions that are usually treated as separate in existing research approaches. They are the "what" and "how" of sustainable cities' debates. By working in partnership with local policy-makers, practitioners and universities, each local area entered into a process of collaborative design in order to examine assumptions, expectations, processes and the outcomes of knowledge co-production. This paper introduces the conceptual ideas behind this initiative and so provides a frame for the reader to situate the contributions. It then outlines those articles to draw connections between them and concludes with a short summary of what research and societal lessons can be learnt from the project.

AB  - Increased nutrient and soil losses from agricultural areas into water bodies constitute a global problem. Phosphorus is one of the main nutrients causing eutrophication in surface waters. In arable land, phosphorus losses are closely linked to sediment losses. Therefore, a better understanding of the sediment-runoff processes in agricultural areas is a key to reduce the eutrophication impacts and to implement mitigation measures. The objectives of this study were to identify dominant sediment runoff processes in cultivated grain-dominated catchments in a cold climate. We assessed continuous high-resolution turbidity data, temporal and spatial catchment properties and agricultural management data to describe and get a better understanding of the causerelationship of sediment transfer in two small agricultural dominated catchments in southern Norway. The concentration-discharge pattern, index of connectivity and agricultural activities were considered with the wider aim to establish a link between field and catchment scale. The results showed that the dominant concentrationdischarge pattern was a clockwise concentration-discharge (c-q) hysteresis in both catchments indicating that areas close to or in the stream gave the highest contribution to turbidity. The main driver for turbidity was discharge, though soil water storage capacity, rain intensity and former discharge events also played a role. Intensity of soil tillage and index of connectivity (likelihood of water and particles to be transported to the stream) impacted the c-q hysteresis index. Little vegetation cover and high intensity of soil tillage led to a high hysteresis index, which indicates a quick increase in turbidity following increased discharge. Other links between agricultural management and in stream data were difficult to interpret. The findings of this study provide information about discharge, field operations and vegetational status as drivers for turbidity and about the spatial distribution of sediment sources in two agricultural catchments in a cold climate. The understanding of sediment runoff processes is important, when implementing management actions to combat agricultural emissions to water most efficiently.

KW  - CURRICULUM
AB  - Introduction: In 2011, Umea University in Sweden was facing its first attempt to transform the existing medical program into a regionalized medical program (RMP), supported by the use of digital technologies. The Swedish RMP means that students are distributed in geographically separated groups while doing their five clinical clerkship semesters. To provide medical students with ways of undertaking their theoretical studies when geographically distributed, digital technologies are used for educational and administrative purposes. In this article, the Swedish RMP will be described and related to previous international research on educating medical students in rural settings. The aim of this article was, from a management perspective, to understand if and how contradictions arise during the implementation process of the Swedish RMP, supported by digital technologies. Based on this analysis, a further aim was to discuss, from a management perspective, the possibilities and challenges for improvement of this medical educational practice, as well as to provide implications for other similar changes in medical programs internationally.
   Method: To identify possible contradictions during the implementation process, ethnographically inspired observations were made during management work meetings, before and during the first regionalized semester. In addition, in-depth follow-up interviews were held in May and June 2011 with six management executives of the Swedish RMP, concerning their expectations and experiences of the implementation process. The qualitative and activity theory (AT)-inspired analysis resulted in the emergence of two main themes and seven sub-themes.
   Results: The analysis suggests that a number of contradictions arose during the implementation process of the Swedish RMP. For instance, a contradiction constituted as a conflict between the university management and some teachers concerning how digital technologies and technology enhanced learning (TEL) could and should be used when educating medical students. In addition, due to the use of digital technologies the implementation process helped to reveal existing problems and tensions in educational practice, not previously visible to management. These included contradictions such as a lack of alignment in how course goals, teaching practices, and examinations should be carried out. Further, obsolete course content and overlap between courses and subjects were identified, leading to an overhaul of all semesters, not only those regionalized.
   Conclusion: This study showed how contradictions in educational practice arose when the Swedish RMP, supported by digital technologies, was implemented. These contradictions involve both possibilities and challenges for management to improve how and with what quality the Swedish RMP is conducted. A challenge for management is to find the most effective way to enhance up-take and use of the more interactive and innovative TEL-solutions. However, a possibility is that the regionalization process and implemented improvements may also influence non-regionalized semesters, with the potential to eventually increase the quality of the entire program.

AB  - The aim of this article is to perform an environmental impact assessment of the air pollution emissions from the mining and quarrying sectors of European countries by applying the life cycle assessment technique. The mining and quarrying sectors of 12 European countries were assessed. The sectors include hard coal and lignite mining, crude petroleum and natural gas extraction, mining of metal ores, and other service activities in the mining sector. Environmental analyses consider particulate and gas emissions, including emissions of CO2, CO, NOx, SOx, FM2.5, FM10, CH4, NMVOCs and NH3. Based on two life cycle impact assessment methods, ReCiPe and IPCC, the mining and quarrying sectors were assessed in the following impact and damage categories: greenhouse gases emission, terrestrial acidification, photochemical smog and particulate matter formation, damage to human health and ecosystem quality. The analyses were made with data for 2012. They showed that the highest particulate and gas emission occurs in Great Britain's mining and quarrying sector, and the lowest occurs in Bulgaria's. The environmental indices in all of the impact and damage categories in the mining and quarrying sectors were the highest in Great Britain, Poland, Norway and Germany. It was found that greenhouse gas emissions are quite different in this sector in each country for the time horizons of 20, 100 and 500 years, which is justified by the GWP factor for methane emission.

AB  - Background: Virtually all horses are infected with helminth parasites. For some decades, the control of parasites of Swedish horses has been based on routine treatments with anthelmintics, often several times per year. Since anthelmintic resistance is becoming an increasing problem it is essential to develop more sustainable control strategies, which are adapted to different types of horse management. The aim of this study was to obtain information on practices used by Swedish horse owners for the control of endoparasites.
   Methods: A questionnaire with 26 questions about management practices and parasite control routines was posted to 627 randomly selected horse establishments covering most types of horse management in Sweden.
   Results: The response rate was good in all categories of respondents (66-78%). A total of 444 questionnaires were used in the analyses. It was found that virtually all horses had access to grazing areas, usually permanent. Generally, pasture hygiene was infrequently practiced. Thirty-six percent of the respondents clipped or chain harrowed their pastures, whereas weekly removal of faeces from the grazing areas was performed by 6% of the respondents, and mixed or rotational grazing with other livestock by 10%. The number of anthelmintic treatments per year varied from 1-8 with an average of 3.2. Thirty-eight percent considered late autumn (Oct-Dec) to be the most important time for deworming. This finding, and an increased use of macrocyclic lactones in the autumn, suggests a concern about bot flies, Gasterophilus intestinalis. Only 1% of the respondents stated that faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed on a regular basis. The relatively high cost of FEC analyses compared to purchase of anthelmintics was thought to contribute to the preference of deworming without a previous FEC. From the study it was evident that all categories of horse owners took advice mainly from veterinarians.
   Conclusion: The results show that routines for endoparasite control can be improved in many horse establishments. To increase the knowledge of equine endoparasite control and follow the recommendations for how to reduce the spread of anthelmintic resistance, a closer collaboration between parasitologists and veterinary practitioners is desirable.

AB  - Chironomids have been used extensively for reconstructing past temperatures from the late glacial chronozone but far less work has focused on their use as temperature proxies throughout the Holocene, and little work has been undertaken within the UK. Northern England does have many detailed palaeoclimate records, although the majority of these are reconstructions from ombrotrophic peat bogs, which yield a combined temperature and precipitation proxy record. A lake sediment core from Talkin Tarn, dating back 6000 years, was therefore analysed for chironomid remains in an attempt to produce a Holocene temperature reconstruction. Although chironomids have been shown to respond to air temperature by many modern training sets, it is also known that they can respond to other environmental factors. Pollen and loss-on-ignition analyses were therefore undertaken to ascertain whether the lake had been subjected to major environmental changes. Some anthropogenic changes in land use were detected, which may have affected the lake water chemistry and sediments, but they seem to have had little direct impact on the chironomid fauna for the majority of the record. Part of the geology of the catchment is limestone, which suggests that the lake may be buffered against any changes in pH. A chironomid-inferred mean July temperature transfer function from a Norwegian training set was applied to the chironomid data and produced a reconstruction with significant fluctuations throughout the later Holocene, which were associated with cold and warm stenotherms within the assemblages. The uppermost chironomid sample from the lake core (less than 100 years old) has a reconstructed temperature of 14.6 degreesC (+/- sample-specific error of 1.18 degreesC), which compares well with the contemporary mean July average of 14.8 degreesC. It is therefore concluded that chironomids can be used to reconstruct Holocene temperature, provided the site is well-buffered in relation to pH changes and can be shown not to have been influenced to any great extent by anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - There are growing concerns about the effects of wind turbines on wildlife. Additional mortality due to collisions with wind turbines has long been recognized as a direct negative effect, but less obvious effects such as changes in behaviour or displacement of disturbance sensitive wildlife are increasingly moving into focus. We combined systematic mapping of habitat structure and species presence before and after turbine-construction at 6 study areas in Germany, Austria and Sweden to study the effects of wind turbine presence on a large forest grouse species: the capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). We studied effects of wind turbines on the observation density (percent of sampling plots with capercaillie presence per year and study area) and habitat selection. We did not find a significant difference in overall observation densities between turbine and control areas after turbine construction. At the sampling-plot scale, however, selection of habitats affected by wind turbines was reduced, indicating a form of habitat deterioration. This was detectable up to 650 m distance to the turbines, present across all study areas and independent of the structural habitat suitability at the respective site. Our results show that a disturbance-sensitive forest bird species is affected by wind energy development, and that critical-distances should be taken into account when planning wind energy development in grouse habitats.

AB  - This article analyses youths' commentary on the contemporary urban vernacular Forortssvenska in an inner-city senior high school in Sweden. Combining a linguistic landscape approach with analytical tools from linguistic anthropology, this paper explores how political discourse are articulated in imagery and texts in the high school and refracted in meta-linguistic commentary among the students. The analysis show how the students draw on US-activist discourse as they insert the notion of 'cultural appropriation' into discussions on the use, and policing, of Forortssvenska at the high school. This everyday regimentation of urban vernacular is entangled with negotiations of identity, multiculturalism and space. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Swedish Royal Library is the national library of the country and one of its most important cultural and research institutions Originally planned for 200,000 books and ten employees, the Royal Library today employs 250 people and stores 3 million books and prints. The building, completed in 1877, is surrounded by buildings of high architectural and cultural value, and is located in one of Stockholm's most beloved parks. Responding to the need of the library and to the environmental restrictions, all future book storage will be in true large caverns excavated in the hard bedrock below the library building A system of elevators and staircases will connect the storage caverns with the building Inside the cavern, a five-story concrete structure is being erected to house the books. All works will be completed in 1996-with no interruptions in library service. The location of the caverns called for extreme rock engineering control, particularly of blasting vibrations and groundwater inflow. The paper describes the reconstruction process, the layout, reek mechanical design and excavation of the caverns, as well as the monitoring program for groundwater. Of special concern was the use of appropriate grouting techniques to minimize inflow of groundwater. Active research carried out during the rock excavation works, in this field and in other areas, is briefly outlined.

AB  - This paper introduces a process for supporting strategic decision-making and policy planning in systemic transitions related to grand challenges such as climate change. The process uses the multi-level perspective (MLP)(1) as an underlying theoretical framework and combines various methods and tools from the fields of foresight, impact assessment, simulation modelling and societal embedding. Decision-makers such as public sector authorities and politicians are the main target group, accompanied by other stakeholders and interest groups whose involvement throughout the process is stressed.
   The process is presented as a stepwise methodological working process and demonstrated by a theoretical case study. The demonstration explores the vision of 'emission-free transport in cities by 2050' in the context of motorised passenger transport in the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. The case study serves as an example of how to implement the process and how to make case-specific selections from the methods and tools from suggested fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Resource preservation and increased waste recycling are important for sustainability in Europe. Thus, it is essential to achieve environmentally safe and sound management of quarry waste (QW) at European and national level. Rock materials recycling practice has therefore been studied in Norway and Italy. At present, recycling levels vary and systematic recovery is not common in European countries. Furthermore, QW is often landfilled owing to unclear legislation and a general lack of technical data. It was found that 80 - 90% and 30 - 80% of the quarrying volumes end up as QW in Norway and Italy, respectively. Furthermore, the fine fraction constitutes around 40% of the total production of dimension stone and natural aggregate in Norway. However, continuing project initiatives over the past 5 - 10 years have shown that QW can be used to produce aggregate. In addition, positive economic and environmental effects are likely to be achieved by systematic recycling of QW planned by industries and public authorities. However, no significant incentives for recycling or systematic approaches for local aggregate exploitation exist in Italy and Norway. These need to be developed and implemented to change current practice in a major way.

AB  - Fears appeals are widely used by marketers to change consumer attitudes and behavior across different categories. The effectiveness of fear appeals may vary across different cultures and product categories. This research undertakes how culture influences consumer response to fear appeals of high-involvement products such as an automobile between Pakistani and Finnish Consumers. Educating people on road safety and car manufacturers using fear-based messages to elicit efficacy and fear among individuals is important. This research paper examines the effects of fear-based messages on consumers' product attitude, Ad attitude, and buying intentions in the automobile industry across Finland and Pakistan. Both countries vary significantly in cultural orientation-Feminism vs Masculinity. The study uses a 2x2-independent group's factorial design showing two levels of fear- Low-High. A total of 120 participants were recruited from both countries, 60 from each country diving into four sub-groups. Two-way ANOVA findings reveal a significant difference between the two groups regarding their feelings/emotions towards the fear-based message. However, empirical results indicate a non-significant impact of fear-based appeals on the two groups' brand attitude, Ad attitude, and information-seeking and purchase intentions. The study has important implications for marketing professionals using fear-based messages under different cultural orientations a significant difference between the two groups.

TI  - How to find the rare trees in the forest -: New inventory strategies for culturally modified trees in boreal Sweden
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - LAND-USE
AB  - Culturally modified trees (CMTs) in northern forests are rare traces of past human activity that provide unique information on past land use and the relationship between people and forests throughout history. There is an apparent need to provide probability sampling methods for these traces. This article describes the simulation and evaluation of circular plot sampling and strip surveying for estimating the density of culturally modified trees in 25 ha of a forest reserve in northern Sweden. CMTs were surveyed, documented, and prepared for use in simulator software and the bias, precision, and cost of different inventory strategies were calculated. For a given level of precision circular plot sampling was found to be more efficient than strip surveying for estimating the abundance frequencies of all CMTs. For smaller subpopulations of scarce CMT types, the strip-surveying method was superior. Probability sampling would be an important tool for examining larger areas and gaining more CMT information at a lower cost. The results are important for studies of cultural history in sparsely populated forested regions in northwestern North America, northern Scandinavia, and northern Russia, but there are also implications for finding other rare objects in forest ecosystems.

AB  - In deregulated forest management systems, social norms, knowledge dissemination and communication are pivotal for guiding forest owners' actions. This presents a challenge to national forest agencies charged with the task of translating forest policy into practice. Drawing on interviews with forest consultants employed by the Swedish Forest Agency, this paper discusses the challenges present in everyday advisory practice, how they are dealt with, and possible implications for forest policy. Four main challenges are identified: climate change; the heterogeneity of forest owners; resource constraints and funding cutbacks; and competing and conflicting advice. The analysis finds that the forest consultants have developed the following professional capacities to meet these challenges: articulating uncertainties, advocating risk diversification, and using historical references to handle the long-term risk associated with climate change; contextualizing the advice to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of forest owners; and organizational decoupling, whereby consultants prioritize advisory activities at the expense of other tasks. The study concludes by discussing the implications of these strategies for the forest consultants and forest policy but also what can be learned from the Swedish experience. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Fishery-induced changes in sex ratios can have negative effects on reproductive rates and affect sexual selection and evolutionary trajectories. Here, we investigate sex-and size-selectivity of the fishery for corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops) in Western Norway. The males that build and guard nests (nesting males) grow faster than females and sneaker males. Corkwing wrasse were tagged (n = 1057) during (May-June) and after (July) the spawning period in 2014 within a no-take site and in a nearby site open for fishing. We monitored the fishery within and nearby the tagging sites from June to October and sampled recaptures on all commercial fishing trips. Fishing mortality was higher for nesting males than for females (open site; tagged during spawning: 36% vs. 29%; after spawning: 49% vs. 36%) and was found to be caused by nesting males having higher capture probabilities than females, independently of body size. The fishing mortality of sneaker males did not differ from nesting males, but the sample of sneaker males in the study was small. The probability of being retained by fishers once captured depended on size, but not on sex. The small no-take site reduced fishing mortality, and the sex-and size-selectivity was similar to the open site. By demonstrating the capture process to be male-selective in a commercial fishery, our study highlights the importance of assessing sex-selectivity in similar fisheries. If detected, management measures protecting the sexes more equally should be implemented, such as slot-size limits and marine-protected areas large enough to account for sexual differences in spatial behaviour.

AB  - Forest stand structure is an important element for biodiversity and, from a sustainable forest management perspective, uneven-sized stands should be managed in order to maintain the structural diversity over the landscape. The first objective of this study is to develop a statistical tool to characterize stand structure that can be used in forest management planning. The second objective is to classify the stand structure of two regions to illustrate a possible use for the tool. The statistical tool for characterizing stand structure has been developed from forest inventory data gathered by the ministere des Ressources naturelles du Quebec, using discriminant analysis. The analysis makes it possible to classify the stands into three types of structure, even-sized, uneven-sized and inverse J-shaped, with an error rate estimated at only 7%. Proportions of different structure types in Quebec's eastern black spruce forest region have been compared with those found in the western black spruce forest region. Nearly 90% of the western black spruce forest region is composed of pure black spruce stands, contrary to the eastern black spruce region, where there are more pure fir and mixed spruce-fir stands. Most of the western black spruce forest stands are even-sized (62%), while almost 70% of the eastern black spruce forest stands are uneven-sized or inverse J-shaped. Pure black spruce stands are more even-sized than pure fir stands, but regional differences are also found within pure black spruce stands. Our results show that it is possible to develop a robust tool that makes it possible to classify thousands of stands rapidly. Such tools are required if we want to consider stand structure for appropriate management prescriptions in the boreal forest.

AB  - Intensive hunting activities such as commercial fishing and trophy hunting can have profound influences on natural populations. However, less intensive recreational hunting can also have subtle effects on animal behaviour, habitat use and movement, with implications for population persistence. Lekking species such as the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix) may be especially prone to hunting as leks are temporally and spatially predictable, making them easy targets. Furthermore, inbreeding in black grouse is mainly avoided through female-biased dispersal, so any disruptions to dispersal caused by hunting could lead to changes in gene flow, increasing the risk of inbreeding. We therefore investigated the impact of hunting on genetic diversity, inbreeding and dispersal on a metapopulation of black grouse in Central Finland. We genotyped 1065 adult males and 813 adult females from twelve lekking sites (six hunted, six unhunted) and 200 unrelated chicks from seven sites (two hunted, five unhunted) at up to thirteen microsatellite loci. Our initial confirmatory analysis of sex-specific fine-scale population structure revealed little genetic structure in the metapopulation. Levels of inbreeding did not differ significantly between hunted and unhunted sites in neither adults nor chicks. However, immigration rates into hunted sites were significantly higher among adults compared to immigration into unhunted sites. We conclude that the influx of migrants into hunted sites may compensate for the loss of harvested individuals, thereby increasing gene flow and mitigating inbreeding. Given the absence of any obvious barriers to gene flow in Central Finland, a spatially heterogeneous matrix of hunted and unhunted regions may be crucial to ensure sustainable harvests into the future.

AB  - Results from an assessment of greenhouse gas emissions during the life-cycle of the carrots and tomatoes consumed in Sweden are presented and discussed. The life-cycle was divided into storage, transportation from producer to retailer, farm production, and the production and transportation of fertilizers. Emissions from carrots were lowest when produced within or close to Sweden, whilst contrary results were obtained for tomatoes. For carrots, emissions during storage and transportation dominated. In the lifecycle of tomatoes, emissions were dominated by those from the combustion of the fuel required for heating greenhouses. The total emissions of greenhouse gases from present consumption patterns for fresh vegetables, in Sweden, were estimated and compared to an assumed Permissible Environmental Space for food consumption. The conclusion drawn is that present patterns of consumption and production for fresh vegetables are unlikely to be sustainable.

AB  - Continuous cover forestry is often considered a management alternative to age-class forestry, in closer compliance with economic as well as societal demands. It is further thought to provide forest stands of high stability and resilience under conditions of climate change. The guiding principle for the stand structure of continuous cover forestry systems is to create managed forest stands that are multi-layered and hence of high structural diversity. Past studies of both these characteristics have been mostly qualitative. Here we used data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to quantify differences in stand structure between forests managed for decades according to the continuous cover concept and forests managed otherwise. We found that the vertical distribution of plant material in the continuous cover stands was relatively homogeneous and similar to the vertical distribution found in primary European beech forests. We also found that the structural complexity of continuous cover forests was significantly higher than that of even-aged monocultures of Scots pine and Norway spruce. Based on these findings, a scaled index was developed that quantifies structural attributes of TLS point clouds and can significantly distinguish continuous cover forests from even-aged forests. This index may be a useful tool to quantify the difference in structure of a given continuous cover forest stand from a "target structure", meaning the theoretical structure describing an ideal continuous cover forest.

AB  - Animals that colonize soil show specific adaptations to soil. Compared to closely related species living on the surface, the limbs of soil-dwelling animals are often shortened, reduced, or absent to allow a less restricted passage through cavities between soil particles. This pattern of limb reduction has also been observed in tardigrades, where multiple lineages that colonized the below-ground habitat show independent reduction and/or loss of legs and claws. In the tardigrade superfamily Macrobiotoidea, leg and claw reductions are a common trait found in the Macrobiotus pseudohufelandi complex. This rarely found species complex currently contains four nominal taxa. Here we describe, with the use of integrative taxonomy, Macrobiotus naginae sp. nov., a new species in the Macrobiotus pseudohufelandi complex from inland sand dunes in Finland. We also provide a dichotomous key to the Macrobiotus pseudohufelandi complex to assist with their identification in future studies.

AB  - The red sea cucumber, Parastichopus tremulus, a cold water species with commercial potential, has recently attracted attention for wild harvest as well as for potential use in integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in Scandinavian countries. Overharvesting has put natural stocks of sea cucumbers at risk in several countries. Our goal was to develop a rearing protocol for P. tremulus to enable sustainable production of this species. This study presents results from spawning and larval rearing conducted in both Norway (NO) and Sweden (SWE) during May-August 2019. We describe spawning induction and behavior, fertilization success, embryonic and auricularia larval development rate for this species under laboratory conditions. The larvae were fed a mixture of three species of live microalgae (SWE) and algal paste (NO). Larval development rate and survival were monitored at four different temperatures (7, 10, 13, and 16 degrees C). Results showed faster development with increasing temperature. Daily food consumption rate was highest at the highest temperature. The combined effects of temperature and food availability on survival were investigated for the same four temperatures and three different feed concentrations. Only food availability affected the mortality rate, with the highest mortality in the low feeding regime of 1,000-2,000 cells ml(-1) day(-1).

AB  - The extraction of residues from the harvesting processes for energy production is common practice particularly in Finland and Sweden. Furthermore, the removal is expected to increase also in Central European and the Baltic countries. The extraction of forest biomass provides an extra source of income for the forest owner and positively affects the economy of the forest operation, scenic values and reduces chances of an insect pest outbreak. At the same time, the harvesting of forest residues affects the ecological state of the forest site both in the long term and short term. For example, nutrient depletion might have a negative effect on the future growth of the stand and additionally may be detrimental for biodiversity. The impact on the stand can be manipulated by either seasoning the residues so that needles are left in the stand or through compensation fertilizing using ash.
   The individual forest owner is faced with a large number of options regarding forest fuel recovery though they have only limited knowledge of the potential impact on the forest ecosystems. Consequently, they will probably have difficulties making a decision. Another aspect is that various forest owners have different preferences regarding economical or ecological factors. A computer-based decision support program is therefore developed to assist the forest owners in making a decision concerning the utilisation of wood for energy. The program deals with a large number of aspects such as revenues from sales, environmental effects and silvicultural benefits. The forest owner provides the program with the basic data of the forest site such as site classification, basal area, mean height and diameter. Thereafter, the forest owner can rank their personal preferences, for instance, how they weigh the importance of net income, nutrient loss, biodiversity, scenic value or the risk of insect pests. The results of various treatment options are then presented to the forest owner, and recommendations for further additional treatment (amount of fertilizer) will also be provided.
   The decision support program is a unique tool to assist the forest owner to make a comprehensive decision on whether they should harvest forest residues on their forest site and, if they decide to do so, what fuel recovery option will be the most beneficial for them. The EnerTree decision support program also provides an excellent opportunity to convey knowledge gained in research to the forest owner by very practical and understandable means.

AB  - 1. This study provides evidence that a heliophilic butterfly, the Glanville fritillary (Melitaea cinxia) has adapted differently to environmental variation across latitudes and elevations. 2. In cool air, basking M. cinxia orient themselves perpendicular to the sun's rays to gain heat and take off. During flight, solar heating is reduced because orientation perpendicular to the sun is no longer possible and convective cooling occurs. Consequently, M. cinxia have been shown to suffer net heat loss in flight, even in full sunshine. When flight duration is restricted in this way, the takeoff temperature becomes an important thermal adaptation. 3. Using a thermal imaging camera, takeoff temperatures were measured in experimental butterflies. Butterflies from the northern range limit in Finland took flight at slightly hotter temperatures than butterflies from the southern limit in Spain, and much hotter than butterflies from the elevational limit (1900-2300 m) in the French Alps. Butterflies from low-elevation populations in southern France also took off much hotter than did the nearby Alpine population. 4. These results suggest that the influence of elevation is different from that of latitude in more respects than ambient temperature. Values of solar irradiance in the butterflies' flight season in each region show that insects from the coolest habitats, Finland and the Alps, experienced similar solar irradiance during basking, but that Finns experienced much lower irradiance in flight. This difference may have favored Finnish butterflies evolving higher takeoff temperatures than Alpine butterflies that also flew in cool air but benefited from more intense radiant energy after takeoff.

AB  - Cover crops (CCs) have aroused a great deal of interest as a multifunctional measure to improve the sustainability of agriculture. Understanding farmers' views are important for future farm-scale implementation. A farmer survey was carried out in Finland in 2021 with the aims to gather farmers' views on agronomic performance of CCs, their environmental impacts and contribution to climate smart agriculture, and understand how farmers' views on CCs differed depending on farm/farmer characteristics. The farmers' sample was conventional and organic farms that had selected CCs as a registered measure in 2020. 6493 farmers were invited to answer a questionnaire with 18 statements (a Likert scale, 5 answer choices), and 1130 responded (17.4%). A Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to measure the strength of the association between ten characteristics of the respondents and 18 statements. Farmers considered CCs to have wide-ranging benefits for soil conditions. Only 21% of farmers agreed that CCs increase the need for nitrogen fertilizer use. 49% of farmers agreed that CCs reduce weed problems. Farmers mostly agreed (ca. 80%) that CCs reduce nutrient leaching and erosion. They were in general more uncertain about CCs' contribution to climate change mitigation (53% agreed), adaptation (51%), and resilience (58%). In agri-environmental schemes subsidies for use of CCs should aim large-scale implementation with two important target groups: younger farmers (<= 50 years) as they were slightly more skeptical than older ones and farmers with less diverse land use as they were more doubtful of benefits provided by CCs.

AB  - The study aims to contribute to tourism literature and the Norwegian hospitality industry by integrating and mapping guests' green hotel experiences. Hence, the study deploys mix-methods to aid in depicting guest preferences and perspectives on Norwegian green hotels. Accordingly, these experiences are represented with 1575 guests' venue-specific generated contents (UGC) found within designated hotel pages of TripAdvisor. Scholars conducted descriptive analysis on guest ratings, machine-learning integrated content analysis to map harmonious and divergent qualities of venue-specific green hotel experiences, and explored users' community profiles to enrich and reveal further similarities with guest demographics. Consequentially, the study unveiled key themes and concepts relevant to guests' satisfaction with nine Norwegian green hotels and attributed qualities. Accordingly, the study revealed ten key themes, namely "hotel", "room", "food", "location", "staff", "stay", "service", "recommend", "value", and "experience". To exemplify, the majority of guests were found to be satisfied with their attributed qualities. Regarding hotel themes, guests were dissatisfied with green practices, booking, check-in, and other aspects of attribution. To contribute, the study offers valuable insights for practitioners and provides theoretical implications. Green hoteliers of Norway should firmly grasp green practices, as improvements and diversification strategies with green practices must be present for both online and embodiments of their venues. In an ever-evolving world of digital presence, practitioners must sustain relevance with UGC content encompassing guest experiences.

AB  - In forestry operations riparian buffer zones have been retained mainly to protect water quality. Because riparian forests are also important for maintaining terrestrial biodiversity, the associated ecotones need to be characterized and defined. Forest characteristics were studied along 50 m lakeshore-upland gradients in semi-natural forests in boreonemoral Sweden. Significant changes in the density of living and dead trees, as well as in their diameters, were recorded. The edge influence was generally discernible 10-30 m from the shoreline and was manifested in the very high density of understorey and midcanopy trees. The species-specific responses reflected the known shade and flooding tolerances of tree species. Most dead trees were standing, or broken from the roots or tree base; relatively few uprooted trees were recorded, suggesting that wind is only a moderate mortality factor. In comparison with the literature, the studied lakeshore forests are distinct from managed and set-aside upland forests in terms of tree species composition and woody debris characteristics; they thus contribute to landscape heterogeneity. If buffer zones along lakes were designed so that they captured the entire riparian ecotone, this would increase their contribution to the conservation of terrestrial biodiversity.

AB  - Ambient air concentrations and source contributions of 71 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including C-2-C-10 nonmethane hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, and carbonyls were studied at urban and residential sites in Finland. On the basis of the emission profile and concentration measurements, the contributions of different sources were estimated using a chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model. It was shown that it is possible to apply CMB in the case of a large number of different compounds with different properties. However, the performance of the model varies significantly for the different compounds. According to the CMB analysis, major sources for these VOCs at the urban site were traffic and distant sources. At the residential site, the contribution due to traffic was minor while distant sources, liquid gasoline, and wood combustion made higher contributions. However, different compound groups or compounds were found to have totally different sources. It was also shown that a biogenic compound, isoprene, also has significant anthropogenic sources and that at some locations wood combustion can be an important source for some VOCs usually considered as traffic-related compounds (e.g., benzene).

TI  - How exposure information can enhance our understanding of child traffic "death leagues''
T2  - INJURY PREVENTION
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives: To explore whether population-based fatality rates and measures of traffic exposure can be combined to provide a more comprehensive measure of safety. To illustrate how this could be achieved using surveys from a range of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. To discuss why exposure is important.
   Design and setting: Fatality data were obtained from the International Road Traffic and Accident Database and travel data from surveys among government transport administrations in each country.
   Methods: Comparable exposure data were obtained for children aged 10 - 14 years from the UK, the USA, Germany, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand. Fatality rates for children travelling as pedestrians, cyclists and car occupants were calculated based on ( 1) per head of population and ( 2) a combination of rate per head population and per kilometre travelled.
   Results: In this study, exposure-based fatality rates suggest a more polarized distribution rather than a graduated league. The USA and the UK were at the lower end of the table for child pedestrian safety; Germany for car-occupant safety, Sweden and New Zealand performed less well. For cycling, the inclusion of exposure data considerably changes positions within the table. Countries with higher cycling levels like The Netherlands perform better than those with low levels like the UK and New Zealand.
   Conclusions: Exposure-based fatality rates can help us to understand whether policies reduce exposure or whether they increase safety, given a similar level of exposure. Data need to be harmonized across OECD countries for a better understanding of the risks and links between health and sustainable travel.

AB  - Thanks to recent restoration of permanent study plots founded in the 1930s we could repeat the soil scientific investigations and compare the outcomes of soil analysis. Due to precise geodetical positionmg, the identical soil pits were sampled and new chemical survey with the same old analytical methods was conducted. Our research includes two natural habitats - pure deciduous forest stand of European beech and mixed forest of with dominating Norway spruce. Both of them are situated in western part of the Ukraine Republic in Carpathian Biosphere National Reserve as relics of last truly virgin forest ecosystem without any direct human impact. Moreover no local sources of air pollution are located in the area. Analysis of seven soil properties were redone: loss on ignition, total nitrogen content, actual and potential soil reaction, base cation content, cation exchange capacity and base saturation. The general trends over time were shown and internal dynamics of forest ecosystem per habitat and growth stage was evaluated. The key role of acidification and its natural and anthropogeneous causes was discussed. The data show significant decreasing of pH-values in all cases. At the same time, an internal dynamics within ecosystem during the forest stand developing was presented.

AB  - Anthropogenic metal contamination can cause increased stress in exposed organisms, but it can be difficult to disentangle the anthropogenic influence from natural variation in environmental conditions. In the proximity of a closed lead (Pb)/zinc (Zn) mine in northern Sweden, the health effects of Pb exposure, essential element (calcium [Ca] and Zn) uptake, and prey availability and composition were estimated on pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) nestlings, using hemoglobin (Hb) level as a proxy for health. Pb concentration in nestling blood range between 0.00034 and 2.21 mu g/g (ww) and nestlings close to the mine had higher Pb concentrations and lower Hb, but contrary to our hypothesis, Hb was not directly related to Pb accumulation. Proportions of flying terrestrial and aquatic insects in available prey and availability of flying terrestrial insects were positively associated with nestling Hb, whereas the proportion of terrestrial ground living prey, the most common prey type, showed a negative association. This suggests that positive influence of certain prey, which does not have to be the most common in the surroundings, can counteract the negative effects from Pb contamination on bird health. Nestlings inhabiting sites adjacent to lakes had an advantage in terms of prey composition and availability of preferred prey, which resulted in higher Hb. As such, our results show that during moderate exposure to metals, variation in natural conditions, such as prey availability, can have great impact on organism health compared to Pb exposure.

AB  - Technologies such as electrification, informatization, and intelligence will reshape the energy form of cities in the future. Energy will become a key link in sustainable development and be integrated into sustainable urban development. Starting from the key elements of the energy system for sustainable urban development, considering urban resource endowment and energy demand, combining future urban forms and technological development, from the perspective of prosumer, a smart energy network ecosystem created by global partners and stakeholders is proposed. The features of the proposed ecosystem are: (1) the wisdom of various participants, the consideration of the renewable energy resources available in urban, and the waste heat and wastewater available in urban are integrated; (2) the integrated integration of smart grid and energy storage applications; considering the integration of big data, artificial intelligence and other technical means are considered; (3) focusing on the energy supply and consumption needs of the prosumers, we will jointly customize the smart energy network ecosystem, realize the complementary use of multiple clean energy sources and the coordinated response of the source, network, and storage to provide fair and diversified comprehensive energy services for urban users. This paper demonstrates the ecosystem's modelling ideas, principles, methods and logical framework. Based on the case of the Smart Otaniemi project in Espoo, Finland, it analyses the implementation plan of the smart energy network's ecosystem to provide support for the sustainable development of urban.

AB  - Concentrations of nitrogen (N) in surface waters reflect the export of different organic and inorganic forms from terrestrial environments and the modification of these resources within aquatic habitats. We evaluated the relative influence of terrestrial ecosystem state factors, anthropogenic gradients, and aquatic habitat variables on patterns of N concentration in streams and rivers across Sweden. We analyzed data from 115 national monitoring stations distributed along a 1,300 km latitudinal gradient, draining catchments that differed by more than 10 A degrees C in mean annual temperature (MAT), and more than five orders of magnitude in area. Regional trends in total organic nitrogen (TON) and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) were closely linked to broad-scale gradients in state factors (e.g., MAT), reflecting the importance of long-term ecosystem development on terrestrial organic matter accrual and export. In contrast, trends in nitrate (NO3 (-)), the dominant form of inorganic N, were largely unrelated to state factors, but instead were closely connected to gradients related to anthropogenic inputs (e.g., agricultural cover). Despite large differences in drainage size and cover by lakes and wetlands among sites, these descriptors of the aquatic environment had little influence on spatial patterns of N chemistry. The temporal variability in N concentrations also differed between forms: inorganic N was strongly seasonal, with peaks during dormant periods that underscore biotic control over terrestrial losses of limiting resources. Organic N showed comparatively weaker seasonality, but summertime increases suggest temperature-driven patterns of soil TON production and export-temporal signals which were modified by variables that govern water residence time within catchments. Unique combinations of regional predictors reflect basic differences in the cycling of organic versus inorganic N and highlight variation in the sensitivity of these different N forms to environmental changes that directly alter inputs of resources, or indirectly modify terrestrial ecosystems through shifts in species composition, rates of forest productivity, soil development, and hydrologic routing.

AB  - Wild living marine resources are a common pool resource in Norway, and successful development of marine angling tourism (MAT) - a form of consumptive wildlife tourism is dependent on healthy fish stocks. This article examines foreign tourists' non-compliance with Norway's 15 kg export quota, and the effects of the non-compliance on community wellbeing. Analyses of 528 responses to a 63-question questionnaire compare tourists' pro-environmental behavior at home, with behavior on holiday, and opinions on more stringent management regulations. No statistically significant correlations were found between pro-environmental behavior at home and support for more stringent regulations. Strengthening regulations would likely have a negative impact on both willingness to return and recommend. Findings suggest that the majority of tourists do not view fish as a resource that should be more tightly controlled, if their holiday fishing experience would be negatively affected. Results are compared against studies investigating management strategies for non-consumptive forms of wildlife tourism. Management solutions are identified which might mitigate non-compliance, positively influence environmentally responsible behavior, and address community wellbeing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Marine Ventures project seeks to increase our understanding of the early relations between humans and the sea, especially subsistence and maritime voyaging. Through comparative analysis, we are interested in how hunter-gatherer societies have adapted to environmental, material, and social surroundings in two different, yet similar settings: the archipelagos of Scandinavia and Patagonia. The similarities and differences in the natural and cultural settings of the two regions are a valuable source for comparison that shed light on the general dynamics of human environmental interactions and regional landscape and social histories. Marine Ventures addresses these problems in four interrelated components: 1) colonizing seascapes and the dynamics of the development of marine foraging; 2) interactions between logistics (boats) and settlements; 3) dwelling types and settlement structure; and 4) legislation and heritage management. The Norway/Tierra del Fuego comparisons include a variety of distinct methodological, theoretical, and cultural heritage management approaches. The broad comparative framework of the Marine Ventures project is an approach that should be useful for archaeologists working in island and coastal settings around the world.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) have become a key component of conservation and fisheries management to alleviate anthropogenic pressures. For MPA networks to efficiently promote persistence and recovery of populations, ecological connectivity, i.e. dispersal and movement of organisms and material across ecosystems, needs to be taken into account. To improve the ecological coherence of MPA networks, there is hence a need to evaluate the connectivity of species spreading through active migration and passive dispersal. We reviewed knowledge on ecological connectivity in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak in the northeast Atlantic and present available information on species-specific dispersal and migration distances. Studies on genetic connectivity are summarised and discussed in relation to dispersal-based analyses. Threats to ecological connectivity, limiting dispersal of populations and lowering the resilience to environmental change, were examined. Additionally, a review of studies evaluating the ecological coherence of MPA networks in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak was performed, and suggestions for future evaluations to meet management needs are presented.

LA  - English
CP  - 82nd Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board
AB  - The Swedish Vision Zero's goal is to eliminate all fatalities and incapacitating traffic injuries. One step toward Vision Zero is through traffic calming. Code changes are also part of this effort. The Swedish Code concerning car drivers' responsibility to give way to pedestrians was strengthened in 2000. A study was done to evaluate the short-term effects of the change in the code, as well as of the reconstruction of urban intersections to eliminate overtaking and speeding over 30 km/h. The focus of the evaluation was on children and elderly people, as pedestrians and cyclists. Between 1995 and 1999, an average of 7 pedestrians were killed and about 60 seriously injured at unsignalized zebra crossings. In 2001, those numbers were 8 and 70, respectively, despite the fact that some crosswalks were eliminated in connection with the change of the code. The conclusion is that the change of code has not improved safety. Field studies in Malmo in regard to behavior, speed, and conflicts, as well as analysis of crash data, show that the code change has increased mobility for cyclists, whereas motor vehicle speeds did not change significantly. The reconstruction increased mobility further and, at least based on indirect measures, improved safety. Also, safe traffic behavior, expressed as one's looking sideways, increased somewhat at the reconstructed intersections, but stopping at the curb before crossing the street decreased. Children and the elderly did not benefit more than people in other age groups.

AB  - Coastal regions globally have experienced widespread anthropogenic eutrophication in recent decades. Loading of autochthonous carbon to coastal sediments enhances the demand for electron acceptors for microbial remineralization, often leading to rearrangement of the sediment diagenetic zonation and potentially enhancing fluxes of methane and hydrogen sulfide from the seafloor. However, the role of anthropogenic inputs of terrestrial organic matter (OMterr.) in modulating diagenesis in coastal sediments is often overlooked, despite being of potential importance in regions of land-use and industrial change. Here we present a dated 4-m sediment and porewater geochemistry record from a eutrophic coastal location in the northern Baltic Sea, to investigate sources of recent carbon loading and their impact on modern diagenetic processes. Based on an end-member mixing model of sediment N/C ratios, we observe that a significant fraction of the late-20th century carbon loading at this location was contributed by OMterr.. Furthermore, analysis of lignin in this material shows depleted ratios of syringyl/vanillyl (S/V) and cinnamyl/vanillyl (C/V) phenols, indicative of enhanced inputs of woody gymnosperm tissue likely from forest industries. The rapid loading of organic matter from combined terrestrial and autochthonous sources during the late 20th century has stimulated methanogenesis in the sediment column, and shoaled the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) to a depth of 5-20 cm. Optical parameters of colored dissolved organic matter confirm that OMterr. is actively degrading in the methanogenic layer, implying a role for this material in diagenetic processes. Porewater CH4, SO42- delta C-13-DIC, and Sigma S2- data suggest that the modern SMTZ is a broad zone in which organoclastic sulfate reduction, methanogenesis and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) co-occur. However, fluxes of CH4 and SO42- show that rates of these processes are similar to other marine locations with a comparably shallow SMTZ. We suggest that the shallow depth of the modern SMTZ is the principal reason for high observed diffusive and ebullitive methane fluxes from sediments in this area. Our results highlight that anthropogenic activities lead to multiple pathways of carbon loading to coastal sediments, and that forest industry impacts on sedimentation in the northern Baltic Sea may be more widespread than previously acknowledged.

AB  - This article aims to contribute novel data and perspectives into the long-standing debate about economic strategies in the fourth and third millennium in South Norway, by introducing novel results from a Pitted Ware coastal site in Agder County, southern Norway. The analysis of artifactual and faunal assemblages as well as lipid analysis from ceramics indicate a varied subsistence economy with terrestrial hunting, gathering, and specialized marine fishing strategies, targeting Atlantic bluefin tuna and seals. These procurement strategies were maintained throughout the middle and into the late Neolithic period (c. 3300-2200 BCE). No unequivocal evidence of cultivation was documented before the early Bronze Age, around 1700 BCE. This article maintains that exploring and explaining long-time continuity, and the environmental, cultural, and social mechanisms, which underwrite enduring traditions, remains a pertinent issue in Neolithic archeology. To broaden our understanding of the causes underlying cultural persistence, we need to move beyond a view of foraging peoples as either ecologically adapted or as economically optimized and employ a perspective that acknowledges the fundamental importance of human-animal relations in prehistoric lives and worldviews. Drawing on insights from relational anthropology and multi species archaeology, we maintain that an animist ontology endured among the Pitted Ware groups and endorsed the foraging persistency characterizing the third millennium in Southern Norway.

AB  - Sustainable nature management and ecosystem conservation depends critically on scientifically sound and stakeholder-relevant analytical frameworks for monitoring and assessing ecological condition. Several general frameworks are currently being developed internationally, including the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV), and the UN's SEEA EEA Ecosystem Condition Typology (ECT). However, there has so far been few attempts to develop empirical implementations of these general frameworks, or to assess their applicability for environmental decision-making at national or regional scales. In this paper, we aim to fill this implementation gap by demonstrating a practical application of an empirically-based ecological condition assessment framework, the Index-Based Ecological Condition Assessment (IBECA). IBECA defines seven major classes of indicators of ecological condition, representing distinct ecosystem characteristics, and empirically synthesizes indicators for each of these characteristics from various monitoring data. We exemplify and explore the utility and robustness of IBECA using a case study from forest and alpine ecosystems in central Norway, and we investigate how IBECA aligns with the two international frameworks EBV and ECT. In particular, we analyze how the different approaches to categorize indicators into classes affect the assessment of ecological condition, both conceptually and using the case study indicators. We used eleven indicators for each of the two ecosystems and assessed the ecological condition according to IBECA for i) each individual indicator, ii) the seven ecosystem characteristics (indicator classes), and iii) a synthetic ecological condition value for the whole ecosystem. IBECA challenges key concepts of the international frameworks and illustrates practical challenges for national or regional level implementation. We identify three main strengths with the IBECA approach: i) it provides a transparent and management-relevant quantitative approach allowing assessment of spatio-temporal variation in ecological condition across indicators, characteristics and ecosystems, ii) the high degree of flexibility and transparency facilitates updating the ecological condition assessments, also back in time, as improved data and knowledge of indicators emerge, and iii) the quantitative and flexible procedure makes it a cost-effective approach suitable for fast management implementations. More generally, we stress the need for carefully choosing appropriate classification and aggregation approaches in ecological condition assessments, and for transparent and data-driven analytical approaches that can be adjusted as knowledge improves.

AB  - The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector has had only limited success so far. In Sweden, the uptake of highly energy efficient buildings such as passive houses has been very patchy, although some regions perform much better than others. This article investigates the interlinkage of organizational structures of housing companies with techno-material characteristics of such buildings, as one of the factors of this uneven development. Empirically, the paper studies two passive house companies in their regional settings in Sweden. The results show that technological characteristics of passive houses co-develop with organizational changes in housing companies such as new types of economic investment calculations, business models, project planning and energy modelling tools. The organizational re-making of housing companies can be seen as a crucial step in the transition to a sustainable housing sector.

AB  - The beetle Osmoderma eremita has received much attention in the last few years, as it is among those species with the highest priority in the European Union's Habitat Directive. In this paper the species is evaluated as a potential indicator and umbrella species for the endangered beetle fauna in tree hollows. To be useful as an indicator of a species-rich fauna it should be easy to inventory and be strongly correlated with the presence of other species. An umbrella species is a species which is so demanding that the protection of this species will automatically save many others. The species richness of saproxylic beetles and occupancy of O. eremita were surveyed in tree hollows in an area in southeastern Sweden by assessing the presence/absence of living and dead adults (including fragments) and larvae. The species richness was higher when O. eremita was present, both at tree and stand level. Several threatened species were associated with the presence of O. eremita, whereas others did not correlate with the occurrence of O. eremita. As O. eremita is easy to find and identify, it is useful as an indicator of stands with a rich beetle fauna in tree hollows. Osmoderma eremita can be used as an umbrella species, because if measures are taken to conserve O. eremita, many other species in the same habitat are also conserved. However, there are some beetles in tree hollows which seem to be more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than O. eremita, and may go extinct if only O. eremita is taken into consideration.

AB  - Most existing life cycle assessment studies that have compared the sustainability of organic and conventional pork supply chains are environmental assessments. The economic and social sustainability dimensions of pork supply chains are currently under-researched. The study reported here was designed to assess the environmental, economic and social sustainability of conventional and organic pork in Sweden. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment was undertaken using 20 indicators expressed per unit product (1000 kg pork fork weight) and per unit area (10 0 0 ha of farmland) for the four main subsystems in pork supply chains: (1) farm and feed production, (2) slaughter, (3) wholesaling and retailing, and (4) consumption. The organic pork supply chain out-performed the conventional chain in 11 of the 20 indicators expressed per unit product and 18 of the 20 indicators expressed per unit area. It was therefore the more sustainable of the two chains in nearly all the indicators expressed per unit area. However, the organic supply chain was less sustainable in some of the indicators expressed per unit product because, more feed per kg of pork was required in organic pork production. Pig welfare improvement leads to higher production costs and environmental impacts. Assessment of all three sustainability dimensions - environmental, economic and social - helps to identify trade-offs between these three pillars of sustainability. However, the selection of indicators influences results, and obtaining environmental, economic and social data simultaneously is challenging. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a matrix framework to understand the interdependencies of domains and scales of protein transition towards diets based on plants and alternative sources of proteins. Design/methodology/approach The abductive research approach is used in building the framework, and the proposed framework is illustrated using the regional food system in Central Finland as an example. Focus groups and interviews were used to collect qualitative data from 28 respondents. Findings This study provides a framework for protein transition, with five domains and five scale levels. Interactions between public and private governance activities at different scales, domains and governed niche and regime levels are discussed. The study shows how micro-level activities at individual or community levels are linked with broader governance activities. Research limitations/implications Due to the relatively narrowed set of empirical data, further research is required to test the framework in different regional and cultural settings. Practical implications This paper presents a practical illustration of the matrix framework, and considering this, the paper discusses the possible implications of matrix interdependencies for protein transition management. Social implications This study proposes that understanding the coevolution of domains and scales, with the help of accurate policies and business models, can lead to effective protein transition. Originality/value This study fulfils an identified need to study protein transition in a broader frame, which highlights the structural activity interdependencies between different scale levels and domains.

AB  - Purpose The study aims to investigate how tourism actors' methodologies fuel the development of regenerative activities anchored in the reciprocity of nature and humans directed at bringing well-being for all living beings. Design/methodology/approach To shed light on micro-scale regenerative creation processes in tourism, the authors engage in co-creative case study research with the owners of a small value-driven tourism firm in Arctic Norway in their creation of activities that strengthen the human-nature relation. Findings The authors found that the values of the tourism firm's owners constitute the soul creating regenerative activities based on the reciprocity of soil and society. Thus, the authors posit that soil, soul and society are at the core of developing regenerative tourism activities. A key finding identified is that it is challenging for small eco-centric driven firms to co-create regenerative tourism activities within a capitalocentric system. For regenerative activities to become regenerative tourism practices, multiple actors across levels of operations must act as responsible gardeners. Originality/value The study extends current literature on regenerative tourism by providing in-depth insights into the methodology, illustrated through soil, soul and society, guiding one small tourism firm's development of regenerative tourism activities and what drives these processes. The study also contributes knowledge that broadens the use of well-being in tourism to better address current capitalocentric challenges limiting the development of regenerative practices.

AB  - The aim of the article is to explore whether and how local civil society - grounded in bottom-up activities - responds to a top-down initiative with expectations of sustainable transformation. The focus of our research is the possible role of civil society organizations as agents in collaborations aiming for a forest-based bioeconomy. The research was conducted in a local area within the sparsely populated Swedish region of Varmland, characterized by a strong tradition of forestry. The study is explorative and uses qualitative methods: interviews with representatives of local civil society actors, participant observations of local meetings and workshops, and document analyses. Our results suggest that general policy expectations concerning the inclusion of civil society become vague when operationalized in documents at the regional level, and lack clarity concerning the roles expected from civil society. Civil society organizations (CSOs) contribute in a multitude of ways to local social, economic, and environmental sustainability. However, the inclusion of CSOs as full actors in collaborations requires a greater knowledge of the traditions and structure of Swedish civil society, as well as its conditions and challenges in different local contexts.

AB  - A novel food such as plant cell culture (PCC) is an important complementary asset for traditional agriculture to tackle global food insecurity. To evaluate environmental impacts of PCC, a life cycle assessment was applied to tobacco bright yellow-2 and cloudberry PCCs. Global warming potential (GWP), freshwater eutrophication potential (FEUP), marine eutrophication potential, terrestrial acidification potential (TAP), stratospheric ozone depletion, water consumption and land use were assessed. The results showed particularly high contributions (82-93%) of electricity consumption to GWP, FEUP and TAP. Sensitivity analysis indicated that using wind energy instead of the average Finnish electricity mix reduced the environmental impacts by 34-81%. Enhancement in the energy efficiency of bioreactor mixing processes and reduction in cultivation time also effectively improved the environmental performance (4-47% reduction of impacts). In comparison with other novel foods, the environmental impacts of the PCC products studied were mostly comparable to those of microalgae products but higher than those of microbial protein products produced by autotrophic hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria. Assayed fresh PCC products were similar or close to GWP of conventionally grown food products and, with technological advancements, can be highly competitive.

AB  - Human modification of hydrological connectivity of landscapes has had significant consequences on ecosystem functioning. Artificial drainage practices have fundamentally altered northern landscapes, yet these man made channels are rarely considered in ecosystem management. To better understand the effects of drainage ditches, we conducted a landscape-scale analysis across eleven selected study regions in Sweden. We implemented a unique approach by backfilling ditches in the current digital elevation model to recreate the prehistoric landscape, thus quantifying and characterizing the channel networks of prehistoric (natural) and current (drained) landscapes. Our analysis detected that 58% of the prehistoric natural channels had been converted to ditches. Even more striking was that the average channel density increased from 1.33 km km(-2) in the prehistoric landscape to 4.66 km km(-2) in the current landscape, indicating the extent of ditching activities in the northern regions. These results highlight that man-made ditches should be accurately mapped across northern landscapes to enable more informed decisions in ecosystem management.

AB  - The understanding of public debates over mineral exploration and mining largely originates from exceptional situations such as mining accidents of conflicts. Less is known about how mining is portrayed and understood under more conventional settings. What storylines dominate the local day-to-day public debate? This article presents results from a comparative case study focusing on newspaper coverage of mineral exploration and mining in three European countries representing different geological and socio-economic contexts. Newspaper articles from the Geyer-Erzgebirge region in Germany, the Andalusia region in Spain, and Northern Finland are studied. The sample looks into the period between September 2018 and February 2020 and shows that regional newspapers report about mining issues relatively intensively even in the absence of major accidents or other media events causing peaks of attention. The tone of the articles is generally neutral to positive towards mining activities, reflecting the specific local settings, historical experiences, and future expectations. Despite the different contexts of the three countries, there were considerable similarities to the topics highlighted, including common themes of mining revival, mining events and social interaction, history of mining, and damages related to mining. Past, present, and future employment opportunities related directly or indirectly to the mining sector are key storylines. Another recurrent underlying theme is the need to balance environment and safety risks and socio-economic prosperity, typically covered through ordinary disputes among the mining sector, public authorities, regional non-governmental organizations, and local initiatives.

AB  - To address the policy malfunctions of the recent past and present, UK food policy needs to link policy areas that in the past have been dealt with in a disparate manner, and to draw on a new ecological public health approach. This will need a shift within the dominant trade liberalization-national economic competitiveness paradigm that currently informs UK food policy, and the international levels of the EU and the WTO trade rules, and grants the large corporate players in the food system a favoured place at the policy-making tables. The contradictions of the food system have wrought crises that have engendered widespread institutional change at all levels of governance. Recent institutional reforms to UK food policy, such as the FSA and DEFRA, reflect a bounded approach to policy integration. Initiatives seeking a more integrated approach to food policy problems, such as the Social Exclusion Unit's access to shops report, and the Policy Commission on the Future of Food and Farming, can end up confined to a particular policy sector framed by particular interests-a process of "policy confinement". However, the UK can learn from the experience of Norway and Finland who have found their own routes to a more joined up approach to public health and a sustainable food supply by for example, introducing a national food policy council. to provide integrated policy advice. Also, at the local and community levels in the UK, policy alternatives are being advanced in an ad hoc fashion by local food initiatives. More structural-level interventions at the regional and local governance levels are also needed to address the social dimensions of a sustainable food supply.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a study exploring the provision of individualized care in a regional hospital in Finland.
   Individualized care was defined in terms of how patient individuality was taken into account and how patient participation in decision-making was facilitated.
   The data were collected from hospitalized patients (n = 203) using a questionnaire specially developed for this study. The response rate was 89%.
   A strong support to facilitate patient participation in decision-making was reported. Most shortcomings concerning the provision of individualized care related to consideration of the patient's cultural background and the involvement of the patient's family in the planning of care.
   Patients' age and the type of ward were associated with the provision of individualized care: patients aged 65 or over were more satisfied than younger age groups with the way in which their personal life situation had been taken into account. Patients from the gynaecological ward thought, more than patients from the surgical ward, that their situation had been taken into account during hospitalization.

AB  - This paper explores consumer logistics in urban settings by focusing on the evolution of pedestrian transportation. It accounts for how people carry things in the city and how this is related to the frames of the city and other means of transportation. The methodology combines archaeology, observation, and statistics, and rests on systematic coding of photographical archives. It analyses two streets, one in Gothenburg, Sweden and one in Toulouse, France, over four distinctive periods: before World War I, the wars and interwar period, the 1950s-1960s, and the present. Both dramatic and discrete changes are found, such as the simultaneous proliferation in the use of pedestrians' bags and motorised types of transportation. The paper identifies geographical, technical, and cultural differences, while yielding surprising similarities between the two cities. The paper concludes that the neglected issue of consumer logistics need to be brought into the contemporary discourse on sustainable cities.

AB  - The present study investigates the effects of Norway spruce plantations on the structure of breeding bird communities in a former beech dominated forested landscape in submontane to montane elevation in Northern Hesse, Germany. Three plots of 16.5 - 19.8 ha were established in each of the following settings: (i) structurally-rich spruce stands with a mosaic of young and old patches, (ii) homogeneously structured mature spruce stands (,monocultures, and (iii) old-growth beech stands which may resemble the potential natural vegetation of the region. Based on a survey of bird territories in summer 1997, 37 species were identified in total as breeding birds in the 9 plots; 17 species occurred in both spruce and beech forests, 6 species were restricted to spruce stands and 12 to beech stands only. Strucrurally-rich spruce stands showed a substantially higher number of bird species per plot area (19 on average) and a higher density of bird territories (30.4 per 10 ha) than either spruce monocultures (11 species, 23.8 territories per lip ha) or beech stands (17 and 21.2, respectively). The breeding bird community of spruce monocultures showed a low species evenness and lacked species that nest in hollows or near the ground. In general, distinct differences exist in the species composition of spruce and beech stands. A number of apical deciduous forest birds are missing in coniferous stands.
   The pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) mac serve as a good indicator of species-rich bird communities in spruce-dominated landscapes as this species depends on high vertical and horizontal forest heterogeneity. It is concluded that spruce plantations may represent valuable habitats with respect to biodiversity conservation in temperate forests if forest management maintains a small-scale mosaic consisting of patches of different age.

AB  - Through a culture-based approach using sludge from drinking water treatment plants, this study reports on the presence of aminoglycoside resistant bacteria at 23 different geographical locations in Norway. Sludge samples are derived from a large environmental area including drinking water sources and their surrounding catchment areas. Aminoglycoside resistant bacteria were detected at 18 of the sample sites. Only five samples did not show any growth of isolates resistant to the selected aminoglycosides, kanamycin and gentamycin. There was a statistically significant correlation between the numbers of kanamycin and gentamycin resistant bacteria isolated from the 23 samples, perhaps suggesting common determinants of resistance. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing of 223 aminoglycoside resistant isolates, three different genera of Bacteroidetes were found to dominate across samples. These were Flavobacterium, Mucilaginibacter and Pedobacter. Further phenotypic and genotypic analyses showed that efflux pumps, reduced membrane permeability and four assayed genes coding for aminoglycoside modifying enzymes AAC(6')-Ib, AAC(3')-II, APH(3')-II, APH(3')-III, could only explain the resistance of a few of the isolates selected for testing. aph(3')-II was detected in 1.6% of total isolates, aac(6')-Ib and aph(3')-III in 0.8%, while aac(3')-II was not detected in any of the isolates. The isolates, for which potential resistance mechanisms were found, represented 13 different genera suggesting that aminoglycoside resistance is widespread in bacterial genera indigenous to sludge. The present study suggests that aminoglycoside resistant bacteria are present in Norwegian environments with limited anthropogenic exposures. However, the resistance mechanisms remain largely unknown, and further analyses, including culture-independent methods, could be performed to investigate other potential resistance mechanisms. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale nationwide investigation of aminoglycoside resistance in the Norwegian environment.

AB  - For years, some work has been undertaken on the traffic heat issue input in the Town Energy Balance (TEB). It has been the subject of many studies related to the summer period and urban heat islands topic. However, during winter conditions, the traffic energy input was marginally integrated into the modeling of the road surface parameters. This deficiency, may explain the differences between forecast and observations for road surface status (RSS) during winter season. Over the past decade, identification and quantification of traffic effects were undertaken. However, they have been studied independently, and non-numerical model integrates the energy contribution of traffic into the RSS. Based on the (TEB) model (v7.2), recent research provided a detailed integration of the traffic thermal contribution in the TEB. This study showed traffic increases the road surface temperature (R S T) by 2-3 degrees C, and its heat inputs improve significantly the R S T modeling. This study consists in evaluating the thermal contribution of each traffic process to improve the R S T modeling based on field experiments. Secondly, the most significant physical processes of traffic responsible for R S T changes have been identified and their contributions discussed. Finally, we analyzed the effects of weather conditions onto the thermal contribution of traffic processes.

CP  - NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Effects of Air Pollution on Forest Health and Biodiversity in Forests of the Carpathian Mountains
AB  - Norway spruce stands represent one of most important forest ecosystems in Central Europe (SK, PL, CZ) both for economic and ecological reasons. This tree species is a dominant component of mountain forest ecosystems that cover a large area of the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. The vitality and stability of spruce stands is influenced by a complex of negative factors that provoke their instability and often times their destruction. Several species of spruce bark beetles - Ips typographus, Pityogenes chalcographus, Ips amitinus, Polygraphus polygraphus - play an important negative role in the deterioration and demise of spruce ecosystems, Bark beetle outbreaks have been common and massive in Central Europe during the past 20-30 years. The pre-conditional outbreak phase is always very closely related to predisposing factors that provoke the stress of host trees. There are three important groups of stress factors - anthropogenic, abiotic and biotic. The negative consequences of bark beetle outbreaks on spruce forest ecosystems include environmental effects, forest management problems, economic losses, and societal impacts. Because, these outbreaks have had a very serious impact on nature and on human populations in Central Europe, the countries of Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic have focused research on this problem and have developed their own approach to bark beetle population management for two categories of spruce forests - commercial forests and protected forests. At the moment, the systems for management among countries are not fully compatible. For the future, the main goal is to develop a "General plan for the integrated forest protection of spruce stands" that will increase their natural resistance against bark beetle outbreaks. This would be an area-wide management concept that integrates forest protection, silvicultural techniques, forest planning, and ecologically-based harvesting technologies. This approach must be ecologically-based and environmentally friendly.

AB  - Modeling tools are needed to assess (i) the amounts of loading from agricultural sources to water bodies as well as (ii) the alternative management options in varying climatic conditions. These days, the implementation of Water Framework Directive (WFD) has put totally new requirements also for modeling approaches. The physically based models are commonly not operational and thus the usability of these models is restricted for a few selected catchments. But the rewarding feature of these process-based models is an option to study the effect of protection measures on a catchment scale and, up to a certain point, a possibility to upscale the results.
   In this study, the parameterization of the SWAT model was developed in terms of discharge dynamics and nutrient loads, and a sensitivity analysis regarding discharge and sediment concentration was made. The SWAT modeling exercise was carried out for a 2(nd) order catchment (Ylaneenjoki, 233 km(2)) of the Eurajoki river basin in southwestern Finland. The Ylaneenjoki catchment has been intensively monitored during the last 14 years. Hence, there was enough background information available for both parameter setup and calibration. In addition to load estimates, SWAT also offers possibility to assess the effects of various agricultural management actions like fertilization, tillage practices, choice of cultivated plants, buffer strips, sedimentation ponds and constructed wetlands (CWs) on loading. Moreover, information on local agricultural practices and the implemented and planned protective measures were readily available thanks to aware farmers and active authorities. Here, we studied how CWs can reduce the nutrient load at the outlet of the Ylaneenjoki river basin.
   The results suggested that sensitivity analysis and autocalibration tools incorporated in the model are useful by pointing out the most influential parameters, and that flow dynamics and annual loading values can be modeled with reasonable accuracy with SWAT. Sensitivity analysis thus showed the parameters which should be known better in order to result in more realistic parameter values. Moreover, the scenario runs for CWs made with SWAT revealed the high demand of land area for this protective measure to be substantially effective.

AB  - Biocrusts are photosynthetic biotic communities of cryptogams and microbes that aggregate minerals at the soil surface in many ecosystems. Due to their high tolerance to harsh environments, biocrusts are present in a wide range of habitats, but are especially representative ground covers in regions with restricted vegetation growth, such as drylands (hyperarid, arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid regions) where water is a limiting factor, or high latitude or altitude regions where cold is a limiting factor. Since biocrusts fulfill a large range of ecological roles particularly in modifying soil properties and regulating functions, their rehabilitation and management is believed to be a promising measure for combating land degradation. We organized this article collection to further highlight the importance of biocrusts and their fundamental roles in reshaping soil properties and multifunctionality in drylands and other ecosystems, and to elucidate the ways in which global change factors are influencing biocrust-soil systems. The special issue brings together 27 research articles pertinent to soil-biocrust interactions or biocrust response to global change and disturbance from 12 countries worldwide (10 papers from China, 6 papers from the USA, 2 papers from Spain, 2 papers from Australia, in addition to studies from Antarctica, Argentina, Brazil, Iceland, Iran, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden). The discussed topics include biocrust roles in regulating soil hydrology (6 papers), reducing soil erosion (4 papers), affecting soil carbon fixation and respiration (2 papers), and influencing soil microbial biodiversity (5 papers). The responses of biocrusts themselves and their functions to trampling disturbance (2 papers), land use shifts (2 papers), and climate change (5 papers) are also emphasized. On the whole, we highlight the capability of biocrusts in reshaping most properties of surface soil, acting as engineers and architects of surface soil properties, functions, and processes in dryland or other harsh environments, and we recognize the necessity of their protection and consideration as valuable nature-based measures to combat soil and land degradation.

AB  - Following a period of unprecedented building in the 1960s and 1970s, the national government of Sweden decided on a programme to promote renovations, refurbishments and extension of older buildings. The programme (abbreviated R.O.T.) was introduced in 1984 and consisted of loans and subsidies for the modernisation of houses older than 30 years, as well as information to home owners and builders on the benefits of home improvement. The target was to modernise 425,000 homes during the period 1984-1993. The programme stated that 'the energy-saving measures must be intensified' and 'all out-dated and the main part of all inadequate apartments should be rebuilt to modern apartments, or be demolished'. By relating the processes that formed R.O.T. to theories of decision-making, this study contributes to a better understanding of how housing policies may affect historical values in the built environment. The study reveals a conflict of interest between stakeholders. R.O.T. developed ad hoc as discourses shifted between interests. Initially, it was presented as a solution for unemployment in the building sector and a social improvement for the poor and elderly. It was not until the late 1980s that a discussion turned to the consequences for historical values.

AB  - Effective management of rodent pests requires an ecological understanding of how they move through their environment and how those movements influence the invasion, persistence, or reinvasion of problematic colonies. Traditional methodologies used to describe rodent movement patterns, such as mark-recapture, are hindered by their time-consuming nature and limited geographic scope. As such, our understanding of how rodents interact with urban environments remains limited. Population genetic principles and tools have the capacity to greatly increase our understanding of rodent population dynamics, ecological relationships, and movements across space, but this field is often unapproachable to non-scientist pest management professionals (PMPs). In this commentary, we aim to promote collaborative and integrative rodent pest management by introducing relevant population genetic principles, providing examples of their applications in studies of urban brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), and proposing future initiatives that link scientific, private, and government entities. We reinterpret results from a 2018 study of brown rats in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to show how genetic relationships among individual brown rats can be used to understand the geographic distribution of genetic clusters (i.e., colonies), natural barriers to migration, and the spatial scale of dispersal. While the 2018 study originally aimed to describe patterns of population genetic structure to understand the influence of urban landscapes on rats, here we describe how these results can be exploited by PMPs to directly inform the creation of management units and decrease the likelihood of rapid post-treatment reinvasion. Further, we discuss the difficulties inherent in population genetic studies and the potential for high-quality model sites to develop generalizable strategies. Overall, we hope to expand the toolbox of PMPs, foster collaboration, and move toward more informed and sustainable management strategies.

AB  - The seafood sector is facing difficulties to meet the increasing demand for product greenhouse gas emission (GHG) assessments. We quantified GHGs of important seafood products of Norway, the world's second largest seafood exporter. We present results and improvement options for products of farmed salmon and wild-caught shrimp, king crab, cod, and herring, followed to their dominating markets, based on detailed data for 2017. To enable more frequent monitoring, without engaging in a full assessment, we then suggest a simplified approach, focusing on the main drivers of production-related emissions. The simplified approach is used to analyze temporal trends from 2007-2017 for fisheries and 1990-2017 for salmon aquaculture. Finally, the simplified approach was compared to the comprehensive assessment for 2017 to define species-specific upscaling factors. Results show that salmon and crustacean products in 2017 caused higher emissions than cod and herring products, with feed and fuel use being the main emission drivers, whereas airfreighted products had the highest emissions of all products. Large improvement potential from average to best performers within each production system exists. The simplified approach shows that the fuel-use intensity of Norwegian fisheries has increased by almost 50% for shrimp over the past decade whereas it has decreased for fish by 20% for demersal species such as cod and 5-10% for pelagic species such as herring. Feed-related emissions for salmon, on the other hand, have increased by almost 30% during the same period, because of an increasing feed conversion ratio and increased inclusion of emission-intensive feed inputs.

AB  - Despite their relatively small drainage areas, European rivers reflect a wide variety of hydrologic regimes, although with very few exceptions they have been strongly affected by human activity. Scandinavian rivers (particularly those draining Iceland and western Norway) can have high runoff, and, except for those draining Iceland, all have very low suspended and dissolved sediment loads. Northern and western European rivers have somewhat lower runoff, among the lowest suspended sediment yields in the world, and anthropogenically enhanced dissolved solid loads. Annual discharge of many of these rivers appears to vary inversely with the North Atlantic Oscillation index. Rivers discharging from the southern Alps into the Mediterranean Sea have relatively high runoff, high suspended sediment yields (reflecting younger, more easily erodable rocks as well as generally smaller drainage basins), and high dissolved yields, although presumably with somewhat less human influence. European rivers and their estuaries tend to reflect the terrestrial environments of their drainage basins (i.e. climate, landscape geomorphology, geology), but they also display strong anthropogenic signatures. Sediment erosion increased dramatically in the last several millenia in response to deforestation, farming and mining. In the past 50 years, however, increased soil conservation and local reversion of agricultural land to forest, as well as river diversion and dam construction, have decreased the suspended sediment loads of many European rivers. Improved mining and manufacturing techniques, as well as more effective use of fertilizers and improved waste treatment, almost surely will result in lower dissolved solids and nutrient fluxes to the coastal environments, which presently are the highest in the world. The long-range effects of changed land use on estuarine and coastal environments remain to be seen, although decreased sediment loads in the past 20-40 years have already resulted in increased shoreline erosion. Decreased nutrient fluxes almost certainly will affect water quality in European coastal waters, and decreased silicate delivery by some dammed rivers may result in proliferation of new (and perhaps harmful) estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Everything points to further changes as European rivers and their drainage basins continue to change in the coming years.

AB  - Safety culture refers to the way patient safety is regarded and implemented within an organization and the structures and procedures in place to support this. The aim of this study was to evaluate patient safety culture, identify areas for improvement, and establish a baseline for improving state hospitals in Finland. Cross-sectional design data were collected from two state-run forensic hospitals in Finland using an anonymous, Web-based survey targeted to hospital staff based on the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture questionnaire. The response rate was 43% (n = 283). The overall patient safety level was rated as excellent or very good by 58% of respondents. The highest positive grade was for "teamwork within units" (72%). The lowest rating was for "nonpunitive response to errors" (26% positive). Good opportunities for supplementary education had a statistically significant (p <= 0.05) effect on 9 of 12 Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture dimensions. Statistically significant (p <= 0.05) differences in patient safety culture were also found in the staff's educational background, manager status, and between the two hospitals. These findings suggest there are a number of patient safety problems related to cultural dimensions. Supplementary education was shown to be a highly significant factor in transforming patient safety culture and should therefore be taken into account alongside sufficient resources.

AB  - A third of the final energy demand and almost a fifth of total emissions in the European Union is caused by road transportation. Advanced biofuels and larger and heavier vehicles have been seen in the literature as one potential logistics solution with which to improve the energy efficiency of the forest industry. The Finnish government aims to create a 100% carbon-neutral energy base by the year 2045, emphasizing the country's renewable forests as a source for energy and biofuel cycles. The purpose of this paper is to discuss how the local biofuel cycling through larger and heavier vehicles may affect the sustainability of wood procurement in the industrial ecosystem by focusing on transport efficiency, cost-efficiency and energy efficiency. The paper presents a quantitative energy-performance analysis from the optimization of results of the multi-objective dynamic biofuel cycle model. Goal programming enables the energy management solution for three biofuel scenarios of larger and heavier vehicles in the 100% carbon-neutral wood procurement of decentralized energy production. Since the basic scenario in 2013, there has been an upward trend in the average payload weight and a transition in 7- to 9-axle vehicle combinations. While the increase in energy efficiency is significant, it is less than half of the government's maximum scenario estimated prior to the regulations. The novelty of this study is in providing the impacts of the local biofuel cycles (5%, 15% and 30%) on the energy efficiency of road freight transportation to create a 100% carbon-neutral energy base for Finland. Furthermore, the results also provide decision support to the ongoing policy debate towards the 100% sustainable wood supply and/or wood procurement of the industrial ecosystems in Europe.

AB  - Pursuit of the Bioeconomy (BE) and the Circular Economy (CE) is high on the political agendas of many countries. Application of the concepts is intended to ameliorate a number of sustainability challenges, such as raw material constraint concerns and global warming. The concepts of BE and CE are increasingly combined to describe a 'circular bioeconomy' (CBE), which emphasises value retention for renewable resources and increased circularity in material cycles. Embedding these CE principes is anticipated to ameliorate sustainability weaknesses associated with the BE. Biorefineries, the focal point for this discussion, are perceived as essential infrastructure items within such concepts. The work focuses on the forest industries, a leading bioeconomy sector. This study draws upon a review of extant literature on the BE, CE and biorefinery concepts to summarise a set of working principles aligned with high levels of socio-economic and environmental performance. These are deemed to operationalize these concepts as parts of the concept of the circular bioeconomy. Analysis is then performed to compare a set of 22 forest biorefinery initiatives in Finland and Sweden to the working principles, and assess how the expectations are met in practice.
   Overall, the study finds that expectations of increased value added of the products and increased sustainability through closing the material loops are rarely met. That is, very few characteristics compliant with visions for the circular bioeconomy were found.
   We conclude that while a CBE framing offers insights that can help a bioeconomy sector such as forestry become more sustainable, there is a lack of consistency and coherence in the manner in which CE and BE concepts are communicated and applied. Further, it is suggested that biorefinery proponents may benefit from clearer framing and promotion of their endeavours. While scholarly works suggest this may have potential to defray trust and undermine perceptions of reliability among potential supporters or partners, we deem that further work is needed to assess whether, or how this is so. Areas of relevance for research include assessment of the actual function, and likely impacts of inconsistent use of the concepts upon the societal, industrial, and political support.

TI  - MAKING HEADWAY TOWARDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SERVICE FREQUENCY VALUATIONS: A STUDY OF HOW THE RELATIVE VALUATION OF TRAIN SERVICE FREQUENCY AND IN-VEHICLE TIME VARY WITH TRAVELLER CHARACTERISTICS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS
LA  - English
KW  - TRANSPORT
AB  - On-going urbanization has led to greater distances between homes and workplaces and more long-distance commuting, increasing the need for efficient inter-urban transport infrastructure. For sustainability, trains are preferred to private cars.
   Two key variables affecting door-to-door train travel time are in-vehicle time (IVT) and headway; however, there is often a trade-off between speed and frequency in a system.
   If different categories of travellers value IVT and headway differently, their proportions on a route should affect traffic planning. Optimal system design might differ between routes carrying many commuters and routes carrying mainly passengers on single private or business trips. Knowledge of differences in relative valuations of headway versus IVT should therefore affect railway system design.
   We investigate whether the relative values of headway versus IVT differ between inter-urban commuting by train and single inter-urban trips by train, whilst also examining differences between socioeconomic groups. Stated choice (SC) data from 580 Swedish respondents are used in estimation. Individuals actually commuting and individuals not commuting but imagining that they are when answering the SC questions are asked about their preferences for headway versus IVT.
   Commuters are estimated to value increased headway 19 percentage points more than do non-commuters. Young people (under age 21 years) value headway more than do older people while people with children value headway less than do the childless.

AB  - This study focuses on the assessment of forest cover and disturbance changes in the heavily polluted Ore Mountains (Czechia, Central Europe) during the second half of the 20th century and onward. It analyzes the driving forces of forest changes with reference to environmental, societal and political development in the region. Anthropogenic air pollution, prevalently SO2 from adjacent coal-burning industry, caused extensive forest decline, especially between the 1970s and 1980s. The most affected tree species was the main economical timber species, Norway spruce, which proved to be remarkably pollution-sensitive. Weused Landsat time series, and a combination of an integrated forest Z-score and Disturbance Index (DI), to analyze the forest cover change and disturbance development during 1985-2016. In 1994, the forest cover reached its minimum there. The breakdown of communism in the 1990s implied fulfilling EU pollution standards via air protection regulations, investment in power plant desulphurization, and forest management measures, which were the main drivers of the forest recovery. The forest recovery continued till about 2005; however, fluctuations in forest cover and DI have continued during the last decade. Apparently, forests weakened by old loads are prone to new stress factors. Landsat time series represent a powerful data source to monitor the impact of these drivers on forests on a regional scale. Originally, the severely damaged eastern part with heavier acidic load and large forest decline recovered faster after remarkable lowering of air pollution loads compared to the western part, with lower loads and less damaged forests. However, the interactions of persisting driving forces (soil acidification, adverse meteorological events, climate change factors, air pollution, tree species composition and physiological state, pest outbreaks) still threaten the forests there, which remain moderately damaged in both parts of the Ore Mountains. This may lead to unpredictable forest development independently of societal and political driving forces.

AB  - Environmental and political debate concerning the role of agriculture in sustainability has long been on the agenda. However, owing to climate change, an analysis of the transition to a low-carbon society must also be considered from the perspective of justice. Dairy farming, in particular, faces pressure in this context, when contemplating changing consumer behaviors and reduction in the carbon footprint of dairy products. Accordingly, many dairy farmers are struggling with the profitability and high production costs of farming. This study examines the experiences and perceptions of dairy farmers in Finland. The theoretical background is predicated upon the "just transition" literature. Additionally, recent literature regarding farmers' attitudes and agency, related to climate and environmental change, is utilized. A collaborative, empirical study of the Finnish dairy coop Valio Ltd.'s carbon-neutral milk chain program was conducted. The authors interviewed 18 dairy farmers and examined their motivations and barriers to carbon-neutral practices. Their experiences and perceptions of justice, in the context of a carbon-neutral milk chain, were studied. This study elucidates how to shift to carbon-neutral agriculture in such a way that dairy farmers perceive this systemic change as justified and acceptable. The results indicate that from the farmers' perspective, three key justice issues need consideration: 1) profitability of farming, 2) blaming of farmers, and 3) use of agricultural peatlands.

AB  - River regulation alters flow and sediment regime, habitat availability, and ultimately the ecological functioning of rivers. Various restoration and mitigation measures have been developed to improve ecological function, and among them is the addition of gravel to enhance the reproduction of gravel bed spawning fishes. However, information on long-term efficiency, costs, and maintenance needs of gravel additions are scarce. Here, we study the functioning of gravel additions at eight sites in three rivers in western Norway for up to 18 years. Gravel was added between 2002 and 2010 to enhance spawning of Atlantic salmon and anadromous Brown trout. We monitored changes in the size of the gravel-covered areas, sediment composition, interstitial oxygen, egg survival, and juvenile fish densities. Additionally, we report monetary costs, identify potential maintenance needs, and calculate a cost-benefit ratio. Juvenile densities of Atlantic salmon and Brown trout increased significantly after the gravel augmentations. After 10-18 years, the median egg survival was still high (> 90%) and sediment conditions were still suitable for salmonid fish reproduction. The areas were, however, shrinking across time (median area reduction 26%), mostly caused by scouring of gravel in the steep, supply-limited, and partly regulated rivers. The average construction costs of spawning gravel augmentations were 11.2 NOK (1.12 euro) m(-2) year(-1). Compared to similar measures elsewhere, the measures have had a long life span (up to 18 years) at relatively low costs. Gravel augmentation was concluded to be a successful management measure that contributed to significantly increased Atlantic salmon and Brown trout reproduction.

AB  - Woody debris is found in all habitats of the land-sea continuum. While isolated experimental studies of wood degradation exist, few programs have observed the dynamics of wood degradation, in situ across this gradient. Since 2014, we have been conducting a series of long-tenn observations of wood decay in three characteristic areas of a Mediterranean Sea coastal watershed: forest leaf litter ('Forest'), river bed ('River') and the near-shore marine environment ('Sea'). The study sites are within the Massane River watershed (France) whose headwaters are in a protected beech tree (Fagus sylvatica) dominated forest. Branch sections from a recently fallen beech tree and standardized blocks of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were installed in all three environments. The proportion of remaining mass and volumetric mass of the individual wood samples were determined periodically over 4.2 years. Regardless of wood type, there were marked differences in the decay dynamics. Mass losses at the Forest and River sites were well-described by continuous negative exponential models. At the Sea site, there was a short latency period followed by rapid degradation for the wood fraction exploited by shipworms; in this case, a Weibull-type function was fitted to the data. Integrated mass loss rates at the coastal location were 6 to 20 times faster than in the other two environments. Our study suggests that the early dynamics of wood degradation in a land-sea meta-ecosystem are dominated by the marine invertebrate community. 'this means woody debris, once it reaches the sea, is likely to break down rapidly within near shore coastal habitats. These results highlight the need to quantify the mass transport dynamics between local ecosystems.

AB  - The Finnish Civil War in 1918 left the newly independent country (1917) scarred for decades. In this paper, we assess the difficult public memory, national narrative and memorialization of the war. We take as our starting point a public crowdsourcing organized by the State-broadcasting company about the material traces of conflicts in Finland. Themes raised by the public in the crowdsourcing are used as foundation to map heritage perspectives. Special attention is paid to the memorial landscapes of the war. In the past century, the remembrance of the war has gone through several stages, from the complete denial of memorializing the defeated side and the associated clandestine remembrance practices based on folk religion, to today's situation where the war is largely seen as a shared national tragedy. We outline the current status and importance of Civil War heritage based on public perceptions and stake out some directions for future research.

AB  - The concentrations and vertical distribution of Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb and As were studied in four different ombrotrophic peat bogs with varying heavy metal loads at Hietajarvi, Outokumpu, Harjavalta and Alkkia in Finland. At each site a peat sample (15 cm x 15 cm x 100 cm) was taken using a Titanium Wardenaar corer, and the samples were cut into 5 cm slices. Dried and milled samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The mean concentrations of the elements were at their highest at Harjavalta ( the most polluted area), apart from Cu which had the highest value at the Cu-treated site at Alkkia. Cu concentrations were above 'the lowest effective limit' (LOEL) on all the plots except for the background plot at Hietajarvi. The maximum Cu values were reached in the topmost 20 cm layer, indicating the effects of mining and smelting activities. The highest Zn and Ni concentrations occurred in the 0-40 cm layer. At all sites, the maximum Pb concentrations were located between 10 and 50 cm. However, the Pb concentrations were higher at Alkkia and Harjavalta than at Outokumpu and Hietajarvi, indicating anthropogenic sources of Pb at the former sites. The As concentration was also the highest in the uppermost peat layers. The mean concentrations were markedly lower in the deeper layers (40-80 cm) than in the upper layers.

AB  - The commercial development that threatens the biodiversity of coastal habitats is particularly severe along the sandy shores of subtropical Florida. The objective of our study was to test the applicability of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography to Cayo-Costa Island, the largest protected barrier island remaining in peninsular Florida. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no change in the number and composition of native vascular plant species on Cayo-Costa 15 years after the first inventory of the island's flora. Our reinventory documents a total of 230 native species in 1990-92 compared to 255 native species in 1975-77. Immigrants were represented by twenty-eight new species, while extinctions totalled fifty-three species. These results indicate a turnover rate of approximately 2.7 species yr(-1) with an extinction rate of 3.5 species yr(-1) and an immigration rate of 1.9 species yr(-1). The net loss of 1.6 species yr(-1) suggests a non-equilibrium condition that is not readily explained by changes in habitat diversity associated with the documented patterns of shoreline erosion and deposition. Cayo-Costa's net loss of twenty-five native species (including one tree species and four shrub species) was localized mainly in those habitats where there had been a significant increase in the relative abundance of the naturalized weedy exotic species Schinus terebinthifolius and Casuarina equisetifolia. We conclude that the spread of naturalized weedy species limits the applicability of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography to species-rich subtropical barrier islands, even in cases where the islands are protected from human disturbance.

AB  - Many boreal waters are currently becoming browner with effects on biodiversity, fish production, biogeochemical processes and drinking water quality. The question arises whether and at which speed this browning will continue under future climate change. To answer the question we predicted the absorbance (a(420)) in 6347 lakes and streams of the boreal region under future climate change. For the prediction we modified a numerical model for a(420) spatial variation which we tested on a temporal scale by simulating a(420) inter-annual variation in 48 out of the 6347 Swedish waters. We observed that inter-annual a(420) variation is strongly driven by precipitation that controls the water flushing through the landscape. Using the predicted worst case climate scenario for Sweden until 2030, i.e., a 32 % precipitation increase, and assuming a 10 % increase in imports of colored substances into headwaters but no change in land-cover, we predict that a(420) in the 6347 lakes and streams will, in the worst case, increase by factors between 1.1 and 7.6 with a median of 1.3. This increase implies that a(420) will rise from the present 0.1-86 m(-1) (median: 7.3 m(-1)) in the 6347 waters to 0.1-154 m(-1) (median: 10.1 m(-1)), which can cause problems for the preparation of drinking water in a variety of waters. Our model approach clearly demonstrates that a homogenous precipitation increase results in very heterogeneous a(420) changes, where lakes with a long-term mean landscape water retention time between 1 and 3 years are particularly vulnerable to climate change induced browning. Since these lake types are quite often used as drinking water resources, preparedness is needed for such waters.

AB  - Many successful invasions have taken place in systems where harmful disturbance has changed habitat conditions. However, less attention has been paid to the role of habitat restoration, which modifies habitats and thus also has the potential to facilitate invasions. We examined whether in-stream habitat restorations have the potential to either facilitate or resist invasion by two widely introduced non-native stream salmonids, Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill and Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, in Finland. A physical habitat simulation system was used to calculate whether the habitat area for the target species increased or decreased following the restorations. For comparison, we also reported results for four native stream fish species. The simulations showed that the restored streams provided the highest amount of usable habitat area for the native species, particularly for Salmo salar L. and Gottus gobio L. However, it was interesting to note that the restorations significantly increased habitat quality for the two non-native species, especially at low flows. Nevertheless, the non-native species had the lowest amount of usable habitat area overall. The modeling results indicated that not only habitat destruction but also habitat restoration could contribute to the spread of non-native species. Fisheries and wildlife managers should be aware of the possibility, when restoring habitats in order to preserve native ecosystems, that non-native species could manage to gain a foothold in restored habitats and use them as population sources for further spread. Knowing the widespread negative effect of non-native species, this risk should not be underestimated.

AB  - In Sweden, waste incineration has played a major role in sustainable waste management, as well as generating combined heat and electricity for many years. Incineration of combustible waste produces residues such as fly ash and bottom ash. The chemical composition of both ashes shows that they consist of bulk metals and scarce metals in significant quantity, in elemental form as well as in small metal pieces, which remain unsorted from the incinerated residues. This shows the potential for metal extraction from the ashes, which are deposited in Swedish landfills. Thus with the aim of quantifying selected metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Zn, Sb, Sn, Ni, Co, Mo, Ti and V), and assessing their flows and stocks in different deposits, this study has been carried out. Approximately 50% of grate plants and 30% of fluidized bed plant in Sweden were sampled for the study. The data collected from the sampled plants were the basis for the calculation of flow of ashes and metals through all the plants. First of all, annual metal flows for 19852010 were estimated, based on which accumulated stocks at different deposits were calculated.

AB  - The Baltic Sea is one of the most severely polluted water bodies on earth, with stressors resulting from anthropogenic pressures of 85 million inhabitants in nine coastal countries. All are members of the European Union (EU) with the exception of Russia. This exception poses challenges for governing the Sea, as Russia is excluded as a member country from EU Baltic Sea governing policies, such as the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR). This added complexity has led to the emergence of new forms of cooperation to include Russia in the governing process. One such initiative is the Turku process, an initiative by the cities of Turku (Finland), Hamburg (Germany), and St. Petersburg (Russia) to promote cooperation, especially with Russian partners. Since its emergence in 2010, there has been no study of it in the literature. This study aims to bridge this gap by analyzing the history and evolution of the Turku process under the lens of experimentalist governance. It aims to illustrate the experimentalist governance perspective through the Turku process and to present the theoretical foundations of the concept. It does the former through key informant interviews with main actors in the Turku Process and the latter with the help of the literature on experimentalist governance. This study adds to the dialogue on governance in an especially challenging time when the Ukraine crisis has negatively impacted EU-Russia relations.

AB  - Transportation is a major contributor to anthropogenic climate change driven primarily by private automobility and for nearly a century, cities have used a suite of policies and regulations that reinforce high rates of car ownership. One such regulation is minimum parking requirements, enacted to ensure that private properties can accommodate the storage of private vehicles. In recent years, cities have begun to reevaluate these parking requirements, with some municipalities reducing them, others providing opportunities for flexible parking, and some even removing parking requirements in part or all of the city. This article explores the relationship between parking requirements and car ownership by analyzing a survey of 56 municipalities across Sweden. In this paper, we develop two methods for comparing different parking metrics that municipalities use (parking spaces per apartment and parking spaces per building area). Our analysis examines variation between different sizes and classifications of municipalities. We find that across all municipalities, there is a positive relationship between minimum parking requirements and car ownership, meaning that higher minimum parking requirements are associated with higher rates of car ownership. City size is an important factor in rates of car ownership, but our analysis shows that even among similarly sized municipalities, minimum parking requirements tend to be associated with higher rates of car ownership. These findings show that reducing parking minimums can be an effective policy to reduce car ownership, but it is important to consider that these changes only impact new development and repurposing parking areas in existing housing areas may be an equally effective policy to curb car ownership.

ISSN 0029-1951.The purpose of this special issue is to demonstrate the relevance of political ecology for the study of Nordic environmental governance. As political ecology has gained a leading position in international environmental geography, Nordic geographers have increasingly been attracted to this approach. Although many have carried out political ecology research in the Global South, there has been little Nordic political ecology research at home'. The contributions to this special issue demonstrate that the themes emerging in Nordic political ecology are familiar from research in developing countries, whether discussing tensions between rural or indigenous people and the state, contested environmental knowledge and how the state relates to such contestations, or prevailing discourses of sustainable land use. The Nordic context also represents a unique potential for political ecology scholarship, for at least two reasons. First, the Nordic landscape tradition suggests a potentially useful bridge between political ecology and land change science. Second, the emergence of the Arctic as a resource frontier and a geopolitical target area represents a potential comparative advantage of Nordic political ecology. This frontier is just as dynamic, environmentally and politically, as any other frontier of resource exploitation.

AB  - Through the case of St Olav Ways, the aim of this article is to shed light on the ways in which the contemporary pilgrimage phenomenon in Norway is developed through a combination of interpretations of local religious history and inspiration from international pilgrimage developments, the Camino de Santiago in particular. Pilgrimage is increasingly becoming visible as a contemporary phenomenon in Norway, as in several other European countries where pilgrimage was long discredited as a religious practice. From the 1990s, pilgrimage routes leading to historical shrines have been developed, initiated by agents ranging from grassroot enthusiasts to governmental ministries. This is analysed as the heritagisation of religion and Caminoisation. In a broader perspective, this pertains to how interfaces between the spheres of religion, politics and cultural heritage management are central to the development of contemporary pilgrimage landscapes. A further aim of this article is to demonstrate the importance of taking administrative and political processes into account for pilgrimage studies. The study is based on ethnographic fieldwork and document analysis.

AB  - Since pre-industrial times, anthropogenic emissions of Hg have at least doubled global atmospheric Hg deposition rates. In order to minimize environmental and human health effects, efforts have been made to reduce Hg emissions from industries and power plants, while less attention has been paid to Hg mining. This paper is a compilation of available data on primary Hg production and associated emissions with regional and annual resolution since colonial times. Globally, approximately one million tons of metallic Hg has been extracted from cinnabar and other ores during the past five centuries, half already before 1925. Roughly half has been used for mining of gold and silver, but the annual Hg production peaked during a short period of recent industrial uses. Comparison with total historic Hg deposition from global anthropogenic emissions (0.1-0.2 Mtons) suggests that only a few percent of all mined Hg have escaped to the atmosphere thus far. While production of primary Hg has changed dramatically over time and among mines, the global production has always been dominant in the region of the mercuriferous belt between the western Mediterranean and central Asia, but appears to be shifting to the east. Roughly half of the registered Hg has been extracted in Europe, where Spanish mines alone have contributed one third of the world's mined Hg. Approximately one fourth has been mined in the Americas, and most of the remaining registered Hg in Asia. However, the Asian figures may be largely underestimated. Presently, the dominant Hg mines are in Almaden in Spain (236 t of Hg produced in 2000), Khaydarkan in Kyrgyzstan (550 t), Algeria (estimated 240 t) and China (ca. 200 t). Mercury by-production from mining of other metals (e.g. copper, zinc, gold, silver) in 2000 includes 48 t from Peru, 45 t from Finland and at least 15 t from the USA. Since 1970, the recorded production of primary Hg has been reduced by almost an order of magnitude to approximately 2000 t in the year 2000. Mining is thus still of similar magnitude as all current anthropogenic Hg emissions to the atmosphere, and mined Hg may account for more than one third of these emissions. Also before use, mercury is emitted from Hg mines locally during the mining and refining processes and from mining waste. Global direct emissions to the atmosphere amount to 10-30 t per year currently (up to 10 at Almaden alone), and probably exceed 10 000 t historically. Termination of Hg mining will reduce associated local emissions to the atmosphere and biosphere. Since several economically viable Hg-free alternatives exist for practically all applications of Hg, the production and use of Hg can be further reduced and all primary production of Hg other than by-production terminated.

AB  - There is growing interest in the use of introduced (i.e. non-native) tree species as part of intensified forestry. This study aimed to evaluate the local-scale effects of the use of introduced tree species on animal and plant assemblages in a boreal setting. Capitalizing on a large-scale experiment involving the plantation of the North American lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and native Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in Sweden, we compared assemblages of epigaeic (i.e. ground-dwelling) beetles (Coleoptera) and understory vegetation between middle-aged stands of the two pine species. Total abundance of epigaeic beetles in lodgepole pine stands was approximately one-half of that in Scots pine stands. Lodgepole pine stands had lower beetle species richness than Scots pine but only in the event of past thinning. Such negative effects were apparent for beetles linked to most substrate types, but there was more variation in the response of different beetle families. Multivariate analyses revealed differences in the structure of beetle assemblages and understory vegetation between stands of the two pines. Many common beetles, including the superabundant Zyras humeralis (Staphylinidae), had lower abundance under lodgepole pine compared to Scots pine, whereas few displayed an opposite pattern. Several abundant understory vascular plants had lower cover at the expense of mosses in lodgepole pine stands. Our results show that many native epigaeic beetle species and the most common understory plants do occur in middle-aged stands of the introduced lodgepole pine in Sweden. Yet, the observed differences suggest that - in spite of the phylogenetic relatedness of the two tree species - the use of lodgepole pine as an alternative to Scots pine in Fennoscandian forestry is likely to affect the structure of epigaeic beetle and understory vegetation assemblages within stands. Further research will be needed to quantify the effects of different landscape-scale proportions and configurations of forest dominated by lodgepole pine and other introduced tree species on boreal biodiversity.

AB  - The steady increase in production volume of salmon aquaculture has sharpened concerns about its sustainability. In particular the production of salmon feed is a reason for concern given its reliance on scarce natural resources, such as wild fish captures. Multi-scale integrated analysis is put forward as a tool to anticipate the environmental and socio-economic impacts of large-scale implementation of alternative salmon feeds, considering both plant and insect sources as potential replacements of fish meal and fish oil. The proposed accounting framework, based on relational analysis across hierarchical levels, describes the patterns of required inputs using biophysical and economic variables. It also considers the inputs used by external systems for the production of imported feed, thus providing a coherent assessment of the sustainability of the production system in terms of feasibility, viability, and desirability. The analytical tool-kit is illustrated in conceptual terms and then applied to the Norwegian salmon aquaculture, both in diagnostic (describing the actual situation) and anticipatory mode (examining feed scenarios). Results are used in an exercise of quantitative story-telling to check the quality of the narratives currently shaping policy discussions on aquaculture. Quantitative story-telling is a heuristic approach aimed at checking the robustness of knowledge claims in face of uncertainty. It is concluded that rearing insects in the salmon feed production chain enlarges the option space of feed sources by opening up the possibility of using locally-produced seaweed and organic waste, but also raises the level of uncertainty with regard to the possible insurgence of negative side effects.

AB  - Background The movement extent of mammals is influenced by human-modified areas, which can affect population demographics. Understanding how human infrastructure influences movement at different life stages is important for wildlife management. This is true especially for large carnivores, due to their substantial space requirements and potential for conflict with humans. Methods We investigated human impact on movement and habitat selection by GPS-collared male brown bears (Ursus arctos) in two life stages (residents and dispersers) in central Sweden. We identified dispersers visually based on their GPS locations and used hidden Markov models to delineate dispersal events. We used integrated step selection analysis (iSSA) to infer movement and habitat selection at a local scale (availability defined by hourly relocations), and resource selection functions (RSFs) to infer habitat selection at a landscape scale (availability defined by the study area extent). Results Movement of residents on a local scale was facilitated by small forestry roads as they moved faster and selected areas closer to forestry roads, and they avoided areas closer to larger public roads and buildings on both scales. Dispersers were more ambivalent in their response to human infrastructure. Dispersers increased their speed closer to small forestry roads and larger public roads, did not exhibit selection for or against any road class, and avoided areas closer to buildings only at local scale. Dispersers did not select for any features on the landscape, which is likely explained by the novelty of the landscape or their naivety towards it. Conclusion Our results show that movement in male brown bears is life stage-dependent and indicate that connectivity maps derived from movement data of dispersing animals may provide more numerous and more realistic pathways than those derived from resident animal data alone. This suggests that data from dispersing animals provide more realistic models for reconnecting populations and maintaining connectivity than if data were derived from resident animals alone.

AB  - The pilgrimage routes to St. Olav's crypt offered new cultural landscape experiences. Primary attention to Christian dogma and art as discursive text leaves a ritual transformation from a Viking landscape unexplored. Pilgrim mental maps and belief may have been structured by land surveyed patterns of churches on the route. This article will map points of one route, osterdalsleden. Among the six churches on today's recreational route, four are replaced with the earliest in the community. A complex pattern of alignments integrating all six church locations are compared to patterns created by substituting random points within community test areas. The existing pattern does not randomly reproduce in 10 000 sets of eleven total route points, leaving the high probability that these churches were organised as a cultural concept of pilgrimage landscape.

AB  - We present the major results from studies of fire history over the last 11000 years (Holocene) in southern Sweden, on the basis of palaeoecological analyses of peat sequences from three small peat bogs. The main objective is to emphasize the value of multiple, continuous sedimentary records of macroscopic charcoal (macro-C) for the reconstruction of local to regional past changes in fire regimes, the importance of multi-proxy studies, and the advantage of model-based estimates of plant cover from pollen data to assess the role of tree composition and human impact in fire history. The chronologies at the three study sites are based on a large number of C-14 dates from terrestrial plant remains and age-depth models are achieved using Bayesian statistics. Fire history is inferred from continuous records of macro-C and microscopic charcoal counts on pollen slides. The Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) for pollen-based quantitative reconstruction of local vegetation cover is applied on the three pollen records for plant cover reconstruction over the entire Holocene. The results are as follows: (1) the long-term trends in fire regimes are similar between sites, i.e., frequent fires during the early Holocene until ca. 9 ka BP, low fire frequency during the mid-Holocene, and higher fire frequency from ca. 2.5 ka BP; (2) this broad trend agrees with the overall fire history of northwestern and western Europe north of the Mediterranean area, and is due to climate forcing in the early and mid-Holocene, and to anthropogenic land-use in the late Holocene; (3) the LRA estimates of plant cover at the three sites demonstrate that the relative abundance of pine played a primordial role in the early and mid-Holocene fire history; and (4) the between-site differences in the charcoal records and inferred fire history are due to local factors (i.e., relative abundance of pine, geomorphological setting, and anthropogenic land-use) and taphonomy of charcoal deposition in the small peat bogs. It is shown that continuous macro-C records are most useful to disentangle local from regional-subcontinental fire history, and climate-induced from human-induced fire regimes, and that pollen-based LRA estimates of local plant cover are more adequate than pollen percentages for the assessment of the role of plant composition on fire history.

AB  - Understanding the demography and function of biotope-forming seaweed species is of great importance for the conservation of the target species itself, as well as its associated organisms. The brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum is fundamental for the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems in the North Atlantic. In this study, we use a data-based size-classified matrix model to investigate the temporal and spatial variability in demography, and the environment-specific stochastic sensitivity and elasticity, of two A. nodosum populations, one in western Sweden and one on the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. A significant difference between the two populations was that the Swedish population had comparably low and more variable stochastic population growth rate (lambda (s)). This pattern was partly explained by the relatively high and varying mortality rates during extreme ice-years in Sweden, and by the lower survival of small individuals during all years. There were also fewer large individuals in Sweden due to lower transitions to the larger size-classes and higher probability of shrinkage. Sensitivities were analogous in the two populations, and showed a high selection pressure for increased individual growth. Elasticities were also similar, with the exception that survival of the smallest individuals (i.e., transition a (1,1)), had a higher elasticity on the Isle of Man. Overall, the stochastic growth rate (lambda (s)) was most sensitive to proportional changes in loop- (i.e., survival within size-class) and, to some extent, growth-transitions in both study areas. These results show that structurally and demographically diverging A. nodosum populations may be similarly sensitive to changes in vital rates. This, in turn, indicates a plastic life history of A. nodosum that may cope with large environmental variability. The results further suggest that environmental change affecting the survival or growth of the larger, reproductive A. nodosum individuals could have severe and regional effects on the abundance and biomass of this species, with potential negative effects on the biodiversity of the associated communities.

AB  - Coarse woody debris ( CWD) is a key habitat for many species in forest ecosystems. To ensure the long-term survival of such species, forest management regimes must include measures that promote dead wood dynamics similar to those of natural forests. Thus, information on CWD dynamics under natural conditions is required, including data pertaining to the underlying agents of disturbance. This study examines modes of mortality, decay rates, and temporal patterns in the availability of Picea abies logs in a Swedish old-growth forest affected by internal, small- scale disturbance. All 684 logs in a 6.6- ha plot were mapped and classified into one of six decay classes. Logs in the early stages of decay were examined for the presence of heart-rot fungi. Six years later all logs were re-inventoried, including newly formed logs.
   Matrix models based on the transition rates between decay classes showed that it took about 60 years for 90% of the logs to decay beyond class 6 ( a deformed trunk with soft wood). Large logs ( >= 26 cm) decayed 40% more slowly than small logs ( <= 25 cm). The initial volume of logs was 37.6 m(3)/ ha but increased to 44.8 m(3)/ ha after six years. In addition, there was a large shift in the decay- class distribution. The volume of logs in early and late decay classes increased by 71% and 45%, respectively, while the volume of logs in the intermediate decay classes decreased by 32%. The. uctuations appear to result from pulses in mortality, driven by a combination of strong winds and the heart- rot fungus, Phellinus chrysoloma, which was present in more than 30% of all logs at an early stage of decay. These results show that large temporal. uctuations in dead wood also occur in the absence of large- scale disturbance, and that heart- rot fungi are important factors driving the overall dynamics of dead wood. Since many wood- inhabiting species are naturally rare and have very specific substrate demands, such temporal variability in dead wood availability may have effects on biodiversity and should be taken into account when designing small, protected forest areas.

AB  - Characterization of land cover change in the past is fundamental to understand the evolution and present state of the Earth system, the amount of carbon and nutrient stocks in terrestrial ecosystems, and the role played by land-atmosphere interactions in influencing climate. The estimation of land cover changes using palynology is a mature field, as thousands of sites in Europe have been investigated over the last century. Nonetheless, a quantitative land cover reconstruction at a continental scale has been largely missing. Here, we present a series of maps detailing the evolution of European forest cover during last 12,000 years. Our reconstructions are based on the Modern Analog Technique (MAT): a calibration dataset is built by coupling modern pollen samples with the corresponding satellite-based forest-cover data. Fossil reconstructions are then performed by assigning to every fossil sample the average forest cover of its closest modern analogs. The occurrence of fossil pollen assemblages with no counterparts in modern vegetation represents a known limit of analog-based methods. To lessen the influence of no-analog situations, pollen taxa were converted into plant functional types prior to running the MAT algorithm. We then interpolate site-specific reconstructions for each timeslice using a four-dimensional gridding procedure to create continuous gridded maps at a continental scale. The performance of the MAT is compared against methodologically independent forest-cover reconstructions produced using the REVEALS method. MAT and REVEALS estimates are most of the time in good agreement at a trend level, yet MAT regularly underestimates the occurrence of densely forested situations, requiring the application of a bias correction procedure. The calibrated MAT-based maps draw a coherent picture of the establishment of forests in Europe in the Early Holocene with the greatest forest-cover fractions reconstructed between similar to 8,500 and 6,000 calibrated years BP. This forest maximum is followed by a general decline in all parts of the continent, likely as a result of anthropogenic deforestation. The continuous spatial and temporal nature of our reconstruction, its continental coverage, and gridded format make it suitable for climate, hydrological, and biogeochemical modeling, among other uses.

AB  - The results from a survey of Swedish commercial fishers on regulation compliance and attitudes to control and restrictions are reported. According to the responding fishers, 90% of all Swedish catches are reported, in spite of limited control efforts. From an economic perspective we would expect substantially lower levels of compliance. The results also show that the majority of Swedish fishers are in favour of co-management on a regional basis. However, on this and other management issues opinions divert significantly between large vessel operators and small vessel operators, which reveals conflicting interests for such and similar changes in Swedish management of fisheries.

AB  - This article addresses strategies of secrecy and deception in hunters' and fishers' appropriation of land- and seascape-based resources in northern Norway. We argue that in their management of relevant environmental knowledge and information, hunters and fishers often seek to avoid competitors and free riders by hiding their trails, and are particularly careful about who they share their knowledge with. Strategies of secrecy are also integral to individual hunter's and fisher's social reputation. Reputation is achieved not only by successful trips and sharing of spoils, but also through role enactments that become the subject of evaluating commentaries and information exchange guided by socially sanctioned rules of appropriate deference. In some important ways structural and economic changes in the social environment also change the generic properties of the practices investigated, while secrecy as practice shows a strong cultural continuity in spite of such changes.

AB  - Background Health campaigns are an important aspect of preventive health work. They can aim to improve health literacy in rural areas where residents lack access to health information and knowledge, and to improve both local and global health through cross-cultural collaboration. In Tanga District, Tanzania, exchange students and local youths participate together with Tanga International Competence Centre (TICC) to plan and accomplish health campaigns in local communities. The aim of this study was to explore the participants' experiences with the cross-cultural collaboration in the planning and delivery of TICC's health campaigns. Methods This study used a focused ethnographic approach. Five weeks of fieldwork included four observations of health campaigns and nine interviews: three individual interviews with employees at TICC (all Tanzanians), two group interviews with nine Norwegian nursing students, two group interviews with five local youths enrolled in TICC's Youth Program, one interview with a local village leader, and one interview with a local primary school teacher. The interview material was analyzed using systematic text condensation. Results All participants experienced the cross-cultural collaboration as successful. Having enough time, adapting to local conditions, and understanding the needs of the target groups were perceived as essential to the campaigns' success. Music and role-play, which are dominant within Tanzanian culture but not common among the Norwegian students, created excitement and motivation among the audiences. The interviewees identified changes in people's health behavior in the aftermath of the campaigns. Conclusion All participants in this study identified positive outcomes from the cross-cultural collaboration within TICC's health campaigns. The health campaigns were considered beneficial because of the poor access to health information among residents in the local communities.

AB  - Communication is an important tool in maintaining legitimacy and acceptability of forest sector operations and activities, and expectations by the general public on the forest sector conduct in Europe are in general very high. Despite this, there is scarce research in cross-national contexts on how forest sector sustainability is communicated to the general public and what development areas can be identified in terms of communication content. This study applies a qualitative content analysis in four forestry-rich European countries (Austria, Finland, Germany, and Slovenia). The state of online communication of 61 companies and 19 industry associations was qualitatively analyzed in 2014 with a focus on eight core sustainability topics of interest that were identified via an international forest sector stakeholder feedback process. Our results show some great similarities, but also some interesting differences in terms of communication frequency and weight of hot topics across countries. The most frequently communicated area was economic contribution of forests (in Finland and Austria), followed by debate over forest conservation versus production (Germany) and the concept-added value of wood (in Slovenia). With the exception of Slovenia, the role of forests in combating global warming was emphasized more frequently within industry associations than among individual forest industry companies. Characteristically, current content of sustainability communication focuses on supplying factual information. Thus, there is a need for developing more targeted and bidirectional forms of stakeholder communication in the future, emphasizing also more active use of social media channels and empowering organizations to promote interactive communication and collaborative learning.

AB  - Dating back to medieval times, fruit cultivation in Hardanger in western Norway is rooted in what is portrayed as a perfect microclimate naturally yielding the best apples in the world. However, the viability of the comparatively minute Norwegian fruit trade is continuously threatened by competition from outside, spurring all kinds of initiatives and policies to make it sustainable. The Norwegian fruit landscape, in other words, is both the natural and perfect home of world class fruit and a site for continuous, often state-driven inter ventions to make it so; indeed, the perfection of the place accentuates the need to do what it takes to make it thrive. The necessary means to accomplish such viability, however, make up a complex terrain, as the resourcefulness of the Norwegian fruit landscape is 'measured' according to very different units.

AB  - The sustainability argument that more peat grows in Finland than is used does not hold. On designated peatlands, growth is about 85 times slower than peat use; growth elsewhere in Finland does not add to available resources. Claiming undisturbed peatlands as carbon sinks for sustainable peat use is also misleading as anthropogenic carbon sources require additional sinks, not natural ones. Undisturbed peatlands usually emit significant quantities of methane. About 57 000 km(2) of forestry drained peatlands now have effectively stopped emitting methane, and temporarily accumulate more carbon annually than earlier. These greenhouse reducing aspects are only modestly compensated or 'used' by emissions from peat used for energy. However, as forests mature and the peat underneath continues to oxidise, the new carbon sink will eventually turn into a carbon source. Multiple claims of this very same anthropogenic carbon sink (perhaps by the peat, paper and timber industry), i.e. double counting, may be avoided by certifying these sinks. After peat harvesting (liberating in the order of 375 kg atmospheric carbon per m(2)), wood in a production/harvest cycle may be grown (at 0.1 kgC/m(2) per a) on the now available area, as a renewable energy source. These numbers indicate the slow rate at which these cycles, that are in principle carbon neutral in themselves, help compensate for the carbon emissions from the earlier use of peat by avoiding the emissions of fossil fuels otherwise used.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) has become a leading model of urban planning worldwide that promises to meet a broad range of local and regional objectives: improving mobility, expanding ridership, attracting investment, reducing urban poverty, improving quality of life, making affordable housing and fostering urban integration. At the same time, the implementation of TOD in many cities has raised concerns about gentrification, displacement, re-segregation, and more polarization. This article aims to shed light on these issues by bringing together previously disparate literature that mentions these contradictions and discusses policymakers' hopes and critics' concern for the implementation of a newly started TOD project in a universal housing system in Rosengard-a segregated, low-income neighborhood in Malmo, Sweden. Although policy advocates view the project as a significant development strategy for a more sustainable Malmo, there are also real concerns about gentrification and the potential displacement of low-income residents. Furthermore, the mixed-methods study showes how integration might be achieved, but concerns have arisen about the possible exclusion of the current low-income residents, which brings up issues of inequality, representation of poverty, and marginalization.

AB  - One aim of the ARGONA project is to study how good risk communication can be built taking cultural aspects and different arenas into account. The ARGONA partners have the goal to develop guidance for the application of novel approaches that will enhance real progress in nuclear waste management programmes. We therefore combine research methods in social psychology with more technical approaches in such programmes. Overall, the project will define and analyse the three arenas of transparency (as provided by the RISCOM Model), deliberation (which draws on a notion of procedural legitimacy), and representative democracy. We investigate how the approaches of transparency and deliberation relate to each other and study how they relate to the political system in which decisions, e.g. on the final disposal of nuclear waste, are ultimately taken. The role played by mediators, who facilitate public engagement with nuclear waste management issues is of interest, as well as the conduct of public consultations, i.e. the communication of models used for deliberation and transparency.
   Efforts will be made to test and apply approaches to transparency and participation by making explicit what the use of the RISCOM model and other communication approaches within different cultural and organizational settings would imply, e.g. in Sweden, the Czech Republic, Great Britain, etc. Semi-structured interviews as well as focus group discussions will be used for data collections involving individuals and representatives of authorities, implementers, local communities, and people living in neighbouring areas to planned facilities for nuclear waste. The central themes involve information standards, uncertainties, safety issues, and expectations of future developments. Participants repeatedly provide feedback across groups on results that deal with such perspectives and expectancies. The processed information will be fed into an analysis that eventually includes several groups in the participating countries.
   The end result involves a compilation of facts, statements, value judgements and evaluations related to the management of nuclear wastes and aims at achieving better defined demarcations between basic values and evaluations. On this basis the work attempts to delineate good risk communication techniques and strategies across national border, as well as to specify the circumstances that require more unique national or group considerations. The resulting final report will focus on such common and unique components of risk communication based on actual experiences from different cultural settings in relation to nuclear wastes issues.

AB  - The authors develop a methodology to create databases that can be used to add micro-level geographic context to longitudinal historical demographic analyses. The method transforms geographic objects as snapshots (digitized from historical maps) into temporal representations of longitudinal object lifelines and links individuals to these geographic objects. The methodology is evaluated via a case study using historical data from the Scanian Economic Demographic Database. The authors link approximately 53,000 individuals in five parishes for the period 1813-1914 to the property units in which they had lived. The results of this study are a unique contribution in terms of linking individuals to micro-level longitudinal geographic data over such long periods. Thus, these data may provide new knowledge for historical demographic research.

AB  - In the European Union, forests and other wooded areas cover a total of 177.8 million hectares, which represents approximately 40% of the EU total area and an area similar to that used for agricultural purposes (183.9 million hectares). Germany, Spain, France, Finland and Sweden make up over three-fifths of the area covered by forests in the EU. Our paper shows the distribution of forested areas in the EU and their importance in comparison with the agricultural area of each Member State.
   In 2014, the EU represents about 12 % of global timber volume harvested timber from forests and woodlands on its surfaces rising to 392.9 million m(3). Forestry, logging and related services covering timber production and extraction and harvesting of forest products that grow in the wild. In addition to industrial round wood, forests produce firewood, too. In some regions, non-timber forest products are also an important source of local income. In the research approach, we considered necessary and appropriate to perform a comparative analysis of the situation of Romanian forest similar to that of the main European Union countries, to identify measures that some of them have tried, and even managed to increase a rational exploitation of afforested areas forest resources. The results conducted to a comparative analysis of the National Forest and the main EU countries' Systems, to identify possible starting points for grounding new sustainable development strategies, given their similar experience.

AB  - The two main goals of this study are: (i) to examine the range shifts of a currently northwards expanding species, the map butterfly (Araschnia levana), in relation to annual variation in weather, and (ii) to test the capability of a bioclimatic envelope model, based on broad-scale European distribution data, to predict recent distributional changes (2000-2004) of the species in Finland. A significant relationship between annual maximum dispersal distance of the species and late summer temperature was detected. This suggests that the map butterfly has dispersed more actively in warmer rather than cooler summers, the most notable dispersal events being promoted by periods of exceptionally warm weather and southerly winds. The accuracy of the broad-scale bioclimatic model built for the species with European data using Generalized Additive Models (GAM) was good based on split-sample evaluation for a single period. However, the model's performance was poor when applied to predict range shifts in Finland. Among the many potential explanations for the poor success of the transferred bioclimatic model, is the fact that bioclimatic envelope models do not generally account for species dispersal. This and other uncertainties support the view that bioclimatic models should be applied with caution when they are used to project future range shifts of species.

AB  - A hydrological-based model (HBV-NP) was applied to a catchment (1900 km(2)) in the southern part of Sweden. Careful characterization of the present load situation and the potential for improved treatment or reduced soil leaching were analyzed. Several scenarios were modeled to find strategies to reach the Swedish environmental goals of reducing anthropogenic nitrogen load by 30% and phosphorus load by 20%. It was stated that the goals could be reached by different approaches that would affect different polluters and social sectors. However, no single measure was enough by itself. Instead, a combination of measures was necessary to achieve the goals. The nitrogen goal was the most difficult to attain. In order to be cost-effective, these measures should be applied to areas contributing the most to the net loading of the sea. This strategy could reduce the costs by 70%-80% when compared with implementing the measures in the entire catchment. Integrated catchment models may thus be helpful tools for reducing costs in environmental control programs.

AB  - This article explores the subtle yet far-reaching ways that cultural environments shape the uses of the evening hours among business professionals in three countries. Drawing on interviews with professional men and women living and working in Paris, Oslo, and San Francisco from a spectrum of professional fields and employers, the article explores their evening routines. Three contrasting patterns are identified. Where the early evening hours between 17:00 and 21:00 are concerned, French, Norwegian, and American professionals traverse different cultural terrains. The French professionals and their employers treat this temporal zone as a status-conferring period. Adhering to a transorganizational cultural convention defining the early evening as work time, they use these hours to distinguish themselves as committed practioners of their m,tier equipped with status and authority. In Norway, comparable professionals approach this period as nonwork time off limits to their employer. Early departures from the office are encouraged and facilitated in the Norwegian workplace. Among the American professionals far less uniformity prevails among the evening routines of respondents working in different organizations and occupations. This variability is explained by the absence of the higher-level temporal conventions present in the two European contexts. In the American setting two deciding factors come into play: the temporal expectations of the professional's employer and the bargaining power wielded by the individual professional vis-A -vis this employer. These differences between the evening routines of the three groups reflect important cultural differences across countries with broadly similar postindustrial landscapes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a major landscape shock that is having pervasive effects across socio-technical systems. Due to its recentness, sustainability scientists and other researchers have only started to investigate the implications of this crisis. The COVID-19 outbreak presents a unique opportunity to analyze in real time the effects of a protracted landscape-scale perturbation on the trajectories of sustainability transitions. In this perspective, we explore the ramifications for sustainability transition research on electricity and mobility, drawing from selected examples in Finland and Sweden. The long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to trigger more permanent changes connected to the digitalization of work and other daily activities, thus reducing mobility needs and overall fossil-energy consumption. The crisis may encourage governance systems to be better prepared for different types of shocks in the future, while it also contains a threat of increasingly populist or undemocratic political responses and increased securitization. These developments can guide research by addressing the reproduction of new practices arising from the COVID-19 outbreak to accelerate sustainability transitions, enhancing understanding of the role of governance in transitions, and bringing to attention the ethical and political implications of landscape shocks.

AB  - Quantitative models of transitions, such as energy systems models and integrated assessment models, do not usually represent social processes, institutions and politics. Their view of societal transitions, along with the governance required to drive them, is therefore limited. Socio-technical systems approaches, in contrast, represent the social side but lack a quantitative view of the future system. This paper addresses this by bridging an energy systems model with socio-technical systems analysis and a local action study, analysing the future transition of the residential heating system in Sweden. The paper focuses on demand-side shifts that would drive a transition to a highly efficient, low-carbon heating system until 2050. A conceptual framework for bridging three approaches is introduced and applied. For example, niche-innovations identified in the socio-technical study are implemented as scenario options in the model. Landscape signals are external drivers of the scenario, and the regime study identifies barriers and governance requirements. The local action study provides insights into community attitudes affecting niches and regime change. Our results indicate that the linking of approaches is meaningful, in that it provides an enriched understanding of future systems change in many dimensions. Further research is required using a variety of models on a variety of domains or sectors to draw more generalizable lessons about bridging modelling and social science-based approaches for transition studies.

AB  - Question: How do habitat edges and trampling affect mesic (Myrtillus type) understorey vegetation in fragmented urban forests, and what are the relative strengths and spatial extent of these effects?
   Location: The city of Helsinki, southern Finland.
   Methods: Vegetation sample plots were placed at different distances from the forest edge. At each distance we selected plots on, next to and away from paths of different levels of wear, and the covers and frequencies of plant species were sampled. We used generalized linear mixed models and ordination techniques to test our hypotheses.
   Results: The effect of the edge penetrated up to 50 m into the forest interior. Only light effects of trampling were found in seemingly untrampled areas, in addition to the direct effects of trampling on the paths. Both trampling and edge effects changed the forest understorey species composition. Trampling changed plant species composition locally on paths, and provided opportunities for new species to establish in previously unbroken forest vegetation. Urban forest edges were characterised by species better adapted to sunny, warm and dry conditions. These species, such as grasses, replaced more sensitive forest species, such as dwarf shrubs and mosses. We observed a large number of light demanding deciduous trees at the edges, which may be one of the factors increasing soil fertility and consequently promoting the high abundance of fast growing species, such as grasses and herbs related to more fertile site types.
   Conclusions: We recommend that urban forest fragments left within urban development should be at least 2-3 ha in size and that the shape of the patch and the number of potential recreational users should be taken into account when preserving true forest understorey vegetation from the effects of edges and trampling.

AB  - Norway's claim to exclusive rights over the continental shelf surrounding the former terra nullius Arctic archipelago of Svalbard is controversial, with the unclear scope of the Svalbard Treaty recognized as "a main challenge" by Norway's parliament. This article explores the nature of this challenge by: ( 1) giving an account of the legal basis of the conflict; ( 2) analyzing its political context, and ( 3) discussing the contemporary judicial and political processes which may or may not resolve the conflict. This article concludes that the issue seems to escape judicial settlement, rendering the controversy a matter of international politics. With the world's eyes increasingly on the petroleum resources of the Arctic, a clarification over the legal status of the Svalbard shelf is not in sight.

AB  - Restorative landscapes provide people with the opportunity to experience nature. This pilot study aimed to determine whether cultural differences affect psychological and physiological responses to restorative landscapes. Two populations, one in Taiwan and one in Sweden, were experimentally compared by showing them photos of restorative landscapes from each country. The results showed that restorativeness was affected more by photos of the restorative landscape in Sweden than in Taiwan. The results showed that restorativeness in terms of psychological and physiological responses was affected. A significant variation in heart rate was observed between the populations: Taiwanese participants experienced higher heart rates when viewing unfamiliar and novel scenery when compared to Swedish participants. No significant differences between the populations were observed regarding attention capacity, working memory, and muscle tension. The psychological and physiological responses to the two countries' distinctive restorative landscapes may have implications for designing such landscapes in urban green spaces.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze the Norwegian inner-city car restriction policy, to identify its motives, understand its operation and measure its efficiency. It is based on a cross-analysis of the Norwegian legislative developments in the beginning of the 1990s on the one hand and the results on the other hand, apprehended through the study of the modal split of the car. It appears that the significant decrease of car use in Norwegian cities is the outcome of a vertical convergence; that is to say a national policy imposed on local governments. This decrease is evidence of the capacity of the national level to adopt a systemic approach on urban mobility, which succeeds in considering the competitive nature of the various transport modes and in implementing strong measures to restrict car traffic. However, the effectiveness of this national car restriction policy varied from one urban space to another, a sign of hybridization with the local policies and contexts, which were more or less receptive to this summons. Finally, this comparative detour allows taking a decentered look at the situation in France where, against a backdrop of juxtaposition and superposition of urban mobility competencies, and in the absence of a strong national injunction, policies in this field have remained bottom-up and sector-specific. The consequence is that, in comparison, car use is greater in French cities than in Norwegian ones while the Nordic country has experienced a late and brutal urban transition, favorable to low urban density and significant car use.

AB  - Purpose Carp is a traditional aquaculture fish with decreasing relevance in European markets. Despite this, it is a protein source which could contribute to the worldwide protein supply. Traditional carp ponds are part of human cultural heritage with high relevance for biodiversity. But, market shares of carp are small compared to other seafood market, mainly due to low consumer demand. The aim of this research was to contribute to the discussion on how to increase demand for carp by testing the acceptance of selected preprocessed carp products. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative online survey was conducted in Germany and Poland with the aim of identifying consumers' attitudes towards carp and carp products. On this basis recommendations on how to best market carp products are developed. Findings Carp is perceived to be a fish eaten primarily at Christmas and New Year's Eve and to be difficult to prepare. The analyses reveal that a potential for novel carp products does exist in Germany and in Poland. The wider introduction of a bonecut filet to the market, a better availability of carp products, and the avoidance of off-flavors are important prerequisites for higher market relevance of carp. Research limitations/implications In this research consumer preferences were elicited "theoretically" by showing pictures of carp products and asking them for their preferences. In this regard, the results presented here state a general consumer interest and a potential for new carp products. Further research, integrating product tastings might give additional information on the likely success of new types of carp products. Practical implications In order to let people know about the new products and at the same time to combat the sometimes existent bad image of carp, product tastings, also in combination with information regarding local origin and environmental/cultural impact, should be offered at the point of sale. Originality/value Carp is a highly sustainable fish and offers a valuable protein source for human consumption. But, in its common ways of market presentation it is not highly appreciated by consumers. This paper demonstrates options of overcoming this situation.

AB  - Swedish hunters sometimes appeal to an inviolate 'right to exist' for wolves, apparently rejecting NIMBY. Nevertheless, the conditions existence hunters impose on wolves in practice fundamentally contradict their use of right to exist language. Hunters appeal to this language hoping to gain uptake in a conservation and management discourse demanding appropriately objective ecological language. However, their contradictory use of 'right to exist' opens them up to the charge that they are being deceptive - indeed, right to exist is a 'disguised NIMBY!' We address this situation by distinguishing hunters' criticisms of wolves from the procedures for reaching objective policy decisions.

AB  - SFastAB holds approx. 25 000 hectares of forest land in 26 forest estates, scattered all over Sweden. These forests are managed by approx. 15 foresters, as geographically scattered as the forests. Here, a forest management problem occurs when the foresters make decisions considering not only his/her estate(s), but also considering all other estates in the forest holding. The decision support system Heureka PlanWise was used to derive a strategic management plan, economically optimal with sustainable harvest levels, for the entire holding. The average harvest level, for a planning horizon of 100 years, was 5.3 m(3)sk/ha, yr. For a forest owner with a large holding but without any industries, even-flow constraints regarding harvest levels are still of importance. Nevertheless, an uneven flow can be accepted at the estate level as long as this is beneficial for the entire holding. This means that a forester of a certain estate is ready to increase or decrease the harvest level, allowing for increasing or decreasing harvest levels at the other estates. The aim of this study was to rank the estates according to their relative need of harvest. In order to prioritize harvests among the estates, a harvest priority value was derived as the harvest level (m(3) sk/ha, yr) divided by the current estates average net growth (m(3)sk/ha, yr). The most prioritized estate showed a relative harvest of 2.2 in the first five-year period, i.e. suggesting more than twice the growth to be harvested (alas, dropping to 0.3 in the second five- year period). Several estates showed a low priority with relative harvests between 0.06 and 0.12 in the first five-year period. In practice, the acquired results lead to a minor increase in suggested harvests at the holding level, by approx. 5%. For some of the estates though, major changes in the harvest levels were outlined, for some as much as three times the supposed harvests (before any analyses).

AB  - In critical evaluations of what is commonly termed 'Scandinavian Gothic', the geographic landscape figures prominently, and it is often claimed to almost act as a living presence. Taking this notion as a point of departure, this paper analyses the portrayal of the Arctic wilderness - with its vast and icy sceneries - in Tommy Wirkola's Dead Snow (2009). In a regionalised twist on a now common Gothic horror narrative, the film focuses on a group of friends who decide to take a skiing holiday in a snow cabin in Norway, only to be attacked by a group of zombie Nazi soldiers, who lurk in the icy corners of the landscape. My analysis centres on the evaluation of Arctic wilderness as a point of focalisation, where notions of space, haunting, and characterisation mix with Gothicised interpretations of collective memory, Norwegian folklore, and the cultural hauntings of history. As snow mixes with blood - at times, quite literally - intermediated understandings of past and present blend, as do representations of uncanny experiences of deconstructed identities through time. Ultimately, I aim to provide a critical evaluation of 'Arctic Gothic', a cinematic and critical space where cultural practices, bodily horror, spectral memories, and the vastness of the Arctic landscape collide, blend, and merge.

AB  - Increased amount of edge habitat is one of several important consequences of forest fragmentation. Consequently, we must understand the responses of plants and animals to edges to formulate adequate recommendations for conservation of biodiversity Epiphytic lichens are a well-suited subject for a study of abiotic edge effects because they gain nutrients and water directly from the atmosphere. We present a temporal model of edge effects on lichens based on empirical data for the pendulous fruticose species Alectoria sarmentosa Ten high-contrast edges of different age between mature Picea abies forest and large clearcuts (10-260 ha) were studied in northwestern Sweden. Abundance of A. sarmentosa (mass on I-m branch sections and maximum thallus length per tree) was estimated in the lower canopy in four 10 x 50-m(2) plots located 5-100 nz into the forest. The abundance of A. sarmentosa was markedly lower at the edge compared to the interior at 9 of 10 study sites. Lichen mass constituted 22% of that in the interior at young edges (0.5-2.5 years) and 55% at old edges (8-16 years). The length of A. sarmentosa was significantly affected by both distance from the edge and site location. Maximum edge effects extended 25-50 m into the forest at moderately exposed sites. The major factor reducing lichen abundance was physical damage by strong wind. Large, pendulous lichens such as A. sarmentosa are prone to thallus fragmentation. At older edges lichen abundance had recovered inside the edge (20-30 m), probably due to increased growth in response to increased irradiance. Our analysis supports the view that edge effects may be strongly dynamic over time and caused by the inter action of several factors. We conclude that epiphytic lichens have large potential as indicators of forest edge effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Wind power can contribute to a necessary reduction in CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. However, wind farm construction and infrastructure might cause other problems, for example, reducing biodiversity. In parts of their distribution area, eagle owls are scarce and declining, and not much is known about their tolerance for different kind of disturbances. Here, we investigated the presence-absence of Eurasian eagle owls (Bubo bubo) in 48 territories in the central part of Norway before the construction of eight wind farms and power lines started, and shortly after the construction period. Eagle owls living within 4-5 km away from the disturbance left their territories to a higher extent than eagle owls living even further away. Wind power is useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the construction and operation might have negative effects on biodiversity. The purpose of this study was to investigate any effects of wind farm and power line construction on territory occupancy in the vulnerable Eurasian eagle owl. We investigated 48 eagle owl territories before and after the whole construction period and a short operation period with the use of sound meters. We found that territorial eagle owls within 4-5 km from the wind farm and power line construction disturbance left their territories to a significantly higher extent (41% reduction in the number of territories with eagle owls) compared with the eagle owls in territories further away (23% reduction). The distance from the nest site to the disturbance was significantly shorter for those territories that were abandoned compared with territories where the birds stayed. Possible reasons for this decline might be a higher mortality caused by collisions, desertion and avoidance of wind power areas caused by the noise and disturbance from their construction. In addition, there are possible indirect effects, for example reductions in prey species may force eagle owls to abandon their territories. The construction period lasted much longer than the period with active wind turbines and power lines in this investigation, but we cannot separate the effects of the two because the investigations were only possible in the eagle owl breeding season, and the wind turbines were activated shortly after the construction period. Our results imply that careful investigations are needed to detect the possible occurrence of eagle owls near any type of construction work. Studies of these territories should strongly influence how and when the construction work can be carried out, but more investigations are needed to find details about the influence of distance.

AB  - This paper focuses on different variations of pluriactivity in small-scale fishermen's households and how these are connected to the life-mode and survival strategies of the fishermen. Special attention is given to the diversification of household economy, fishermen's attitudes towards their work and the support from other stakeholder groups. The empirical material comprises of personal interviews conducted with fishermen in the Archipelago Sea Region, SW Finland. Throughout the centuries fishing, shipping, and agriculture have been combined and interlinked in the region. The pluriactivity nature of the livelihoods is still important, but the combinations have changed. New forms of pluriactivity have provided a basis for adaptation of commercial fishing in the changing conditions of existence. In spite of the common economic adaptation through wage-work, the cultural dimensions of the fisherman-peasant life-mode still hold a strong position.

AB  - In this article, we draw from qualitative interviews with political parties' representatives and a content analysis of party programs to identify how political parties frame animal welfare policies in Norway. In analyzing the framing of animal welfare and its significance for understanding agricultural post-exceptionalism, we found that though they frame animal welfare issues in conflicting ways, most see Norwegian animal welfare as reasonably good but perceive potential for improvement. They also generally understand societal claims as lacking or having an unclear factual basis, which has legitimized their nonaction as political parties. Even so, because of active new actors such as animal welfare organizations and retailers, the parties do not believe that public pressure will wane. Although introducing new farm animal welfare policies can represent a move towards post-exceptionalism in Europe's agri-food sector, the discourse on animal welfare policies amongst political parties implies that such is not the case in Norway.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) technology could be utilised to assist pedestrians in navigating safely through traffic. However, whether potential users would understand and use such AR solutions is currently unknown. Nine novel AR interfaces for pedestrian-vehicle communication, previously developed using an experience-based design method, were evaluated through an online questionnaire study completed by 992 respondents in Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The AR indicated whether it was safe to cross the road in front of an approaching automated vehicle. Each interface was rated for its intuitiveness and convincingness, aesthetics, and usefulness. Moreover, comments were collected for qualitative analysis. The results indicated that interfaces that employed traditional design elements from existing traffic, and head-up displays, received the highest ratings overall. Statistical results also showed that there were no significant effects of country, age, and gender on interface acceptance. Thematic analysis of the textual comments offered detail on each interface design's stronger and weaker points, and revealed unintended effects of certain designs. In particular, some of the interfaces were commented on as being dangerous or scary, or were criticised that they could be misinterpreted in that they signal that something is wrong with the vehicle, or that they could occlude the view of the vehicle. The current findings highlight the limitations of experience-based design, and the importance of applying legacy design principles and involving target users in design and evaluation. Future research should be conducted in scenarios in which pedestrians actually interact with approaching vehicles.

AB  - The growing focus on environmental responsibility from the community, investors and regulators presents immense challenges and opportunities to mining companies. Titanium and zirconium minerals are vital, unrecyclable, and often irreplaceable components of modern infrastructure and technology. The companies which supply these minerals often have a long-history of sustainability reporting. Such reports have been used here to analyse energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions and water usage from mining and processing these minerals. Mining operations and titanium-slag producers in Australia, Canada, China, Mozambique, Madagascar, Norway, and South Africa were analysed. This paper presents both site-specific data as well as data generalized to heavy mineral sand (HMS) deposits vs igneous hard-rock style deposits, as well as those products which have undergone beneficiation. In terms of averages, energy use was higher for HMS (yearly average of between 0.90 - 2.95 GJ/t valuable heavy mineral (VHM)) compared to ilmenite-dominant hard-rock mining (yearly average of between 0.21 - 0.49 GJ/t ilmenite) and Ti-slag production required between-similar to 10 - 14 GJ/t of saleable product (including titanium slag and pig-iron). Emissions from ilmenite-dominant hard rock mining produced similar to 0.01 t CO2e/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS mining produced 0.07-0.38 t CO2e/t of VHM; emissions from beneficiating ilmenite into Ti-slag add significantly to this (0.62-1.21 t CO2e/t of saleable product, weighted by value). Overall, hard-rock mining operations consumed <5 kL/t ilmenite concentrate while HMS consumed 10-26 kL/t VHM. On the other hand, beneficiating hard-rock ilmenite into slag increases water-use by similar to 220 kL/t of saleable product. Finally, in terms of land use, it was determined that an average of 4.3 ha per 1 Mt of ore was disturbed in HMS operations (no data was available for hard-rock operations). While average results comparing HMS, hard-rock and beneficiated products were broadly comparable to existing LCA literature, data used in LCA literature is not consistent with specific sites and using generalized data to infer site-specific data will often lead to erroneous estimates. These observations taken together are particularly important to downstream purchasers, as well as the investment community who do not fund entire industries, but fund and back specific projects; the decision made on which site or company to invest in is increasingly determined by environmental, social and governance (ESG) related factors. This paper not only provides quantitative indications of these factors for Ti/Zr production, but also guidance for improving sustainability reporting in the industry. An improvement in the quality, quantity and consistency in this data, as this paper explains, will allow for greater information to guide investment and ESG outcomes for Ti/Zr industries.

AB  - Barium (Ba) in recent marine sediments can originate from natural and anthropogenic sources including dis-charges from the oil and gas industry. In this study, we use data from the Norwegian and Barents Seas to assess whether Ba in recent marine sediments has increased due to these discharges. To account for Ba in detrital material, we normalise all samples with respect to aluminosilicate by calculating an enrichment factor. We use statistical modelling to control for parameters related to sedimentation. We present results that suggest increased Ba levels in recent sediments that coincide with the timing of hydrocarbon drilling and production. This is supported by geographical differences on a large scale that relate to proximity to hydrocarbon drilling and production. Among 243 sampling stations, we identify 73 locations exhibiting enrichment of Ba in the upper 6 of sediment. At these locations, Ba is 1.55 to 3.55 times higher than the levels that can be expected from the shale average when Ba in detrital matter is accounted for. Excess Ba is reported in sediment surface samples in areas important to fisheries like the Lofoten area and the western Barents Sea.

AB  - Butterfly distribution and abundance is known to be influenced by temperature and rainfall. What is not clear, however, is how life history and flight morphological traits are affected by changes in local weather conditions. During the period 1989-1999, we explored the effects of ambient temperature and rainfall during larval development on adult phenotypic traits (body mass, forewing loading, forewing surface area and forewing length) in a Swedish population of the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria. As different seasonal cohorts correspond to different developmental pathways (larval hibernating, pupal hibernating and directly developing), we analysed these morphological time series relative to developmental pathway. Phenotypic variation in response to the temperature and rainfall levels experienced during larval development differed in both magnitude and direction depending on the developmental pathway, and hence seasonal cohort, examined (i.e. there was a pathway-specific response). We suggest that through its developmental flexibility P. aegeria may be able to adjust to variation in weather conditions over time. Other less flexible species, however, may not be so fortunately buffered. To truly estimate the impact of climate change on biodiversity more fine-scale, local studies are required that examine the mechanisms underlying the response of species to climate change.

KW  - sustainability
AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) and green urbanism have gained attention as development models for charting a more sustainable urban future. These two built forms, however, are often dealt with separately, as distinct topics. This paper explores synergies that are created when neighbourhoods are designed as both green and transit-oriented and how 'Green TOD' can reduce a project's environmental footprint more than each strategy can achieve individually. Experiences with Green TODs are reviewed for urban regeneration projects in Sweden, Germany and Australia. These projects optimally combine sustainable building, energy and waste practices with high-quality transit access. 'Green' transit-based urbanism can substantially shrink the environmental footprint associated with car-oriented suburban development. We estimate that carbon emissions and energy consumption of Green TOD can be nearly 30% less than that of conventional development. Synergies that are created by combining TOD and green urbanism include increased densities, which promote transit usage, conserve heating/cooling expense and enable waste reuse techniques contingent on high volumes; mixed land uses, which promote non-motorised transportation and match the differing heat and energy needs of commercial and residential uses to enable maximum reuse of waste heat; reduced impervious parking surfaces replaced by increased open space and community gardens; opportunities for generating solar power for use in buildings from photovoltaics (PVs) atop rail-stop canopies and remote parking structures; and using renewable energy/fuels produced from the built environment to power transit vehicles.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the identity signs of the culture of the indigenous peoples Satere-Mawe (Amazonas-Brazil) and Sarni (Tromso-Norway), as possible contributions to the ethnic tourism, starting from the complex cultural relationship arising from each people. Taking into consideration the symbolic traits of these two cultures, the study proposes a methodological and theoretical perspective of a descriptive and exploratory nature, based on the dialogic suggested by Edgar Morin (2007), which allowed us to weave a network of conversation with another knowledge of ethnographic approach, based on case studies. The data collection took place in two phases. At first, a bibliographic research was carried out on the Ebsco host and Scielo database platforms to support the theoretical basis. The second phase was carried out locally, where the research is conducted, with 30 participants aged between 18 and 80 years, divided into groups from the Satere-Mawe and Sarni peoples. Such peoples are concentrated in the metropolitan area of the city of Manaus and in Tromso, Norway, respectively. The narratives collected in this period were interpreted from the theoretical framework adopted, in which we used Content Analysis (Bardin, 2016). Thus, we conclude that the signs used in rituals, crafts, graphics, drinks and food are driving forces of ethnic tourism with a focus on sustainable development. This arises from indigenous cosmology anchored in the natural environment of the forest as a means of survival. In this direction, we point to the need to safeguard the material and the intangible heritage of the indigenous people of the regions under study.

AB  - Regionally, there has been a lot of focus on the advancement of sustainable arctic industry and circular economy activities within process industry in the Finnish Lapland. In this study, collaboration between university and industry was established facilitated by regional development actors to develop and pilot test a sustainability assessment approach taking into account previous work in this field. The industry partners in this study were a biorefinery investment in the first case and a slag processing service in the second case. As a result of the joint efforts, novel sets of environmental and economic sustainability assessment indicators and associated sub-indicators were developed and the existing set of social indicators was updated. Moreover, environmental and social sustainability assessments were implemented in the biorefinery case accompanied by a separate evaluation of regional economic impacts. In the slag processing case, environmental, economic and social sustainability were assessed. The results of the sustainability assessments indicated very good level of overall performance in both cases. However, specific elements that contributed to lower level of performance included lack of specific sustainability management and reporting approaches and need for better performance in supply chain sustainability, monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions, life cycle thinking and circular economy training. The expected effects of the planned investment on the regional economy were very positive based on the results of the evaluation.

AB  - The degree to which different taxonomic groups show congruence in diversity patterns has attracted increased attention, yet such studies on stream biota are lacking. We examined environmental correlates of and congruence in the species richness patterns of bryophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish in 101 boreal streams in Finland. Congruence in species richness among the taxonomic groups was generally low, mainly because of their differing responses to major environmental gradients. Bryophytes and macroinvertebrates showed the strongest degree of congruence, but even this relationship had a relatively weak predictive power. Bryophyte diversity showed the strongest relationship with water colour, followed by habitat stability, and stream size. Macroinvertebrate diversity increased with stream size, and further variation was accounted for by water colour and acidity. Fish species richness showed a weak and complex relationship with geographical location, stream size, and in-stream habitat characteristics. The regression models explained 23, 45, and 26% of the variation in species richness of bryophytes, macroinvertebrates, and fish, respectively. Our results suggest that indicator taxa may be of limited value in stream biodiversity inventories. Habitat-based approaches are suggested as an alternative surrogate measure in the conservation evaluation of lotic biodiversity.

AB  - Structural diversity of forests is important for biodiversity. In managed forests, structural diversity can be maintained by retaining living and dead trees, and by creating dead wood during logging operations. In Sweden, a small percentage of the trees is currently retained on each clear-cut. Since retention decreases revenues from forest harvesting, it is important to understand the consequences of retention for both forestry economy and biodiversity conservation. Thus, in this study we compared effects of retaining percentages ranging from 5% to 50% of the initial number of trees in 12 Scots pine-dominated stands in central Sweden. The retained trees in each stand consisted of equal proportions of green living trees, felled trees, high-cut trees and girdled trees. We estimated costs associated with tree retention and, as indicators of biodiversity conservation values, dead wood volumes, number of dead wood types, and dead wood diversity. We also estimated the damage caused by the logging operations on old dead wood. Revenue declined with increases in retention level, due mainly to associated reductions in harvested volumes, but partly to increases in logging costs. Both harvester and forwarder performance were lower at high than at low retention levels. The volume of dead wood increased with increases in retention level, since the number of retained trees killed per stand was proportional to the retention level. The number of dead wood types and dead wood diversity increased continuously up to the highest retention level of almost 50%. Moreover, old dead wood that was deemed particularly valuable for biodiversity was not destroyed at retention levels above 30%. In conclusion, dead wood destruction decreased with increasing retention level and costs increased proportionally to the retained volume. There were no signs of saturation of dead wood diversity as retention level increased. Therefore, mainly economic restrains will determine the retention level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We studied the effects of extending the rotation period (long-rotation) and related ecological variables on the biodiversity of six beetle families in larch (Larix kaempferi) plantations. Beetle diversity in the forest understory and the canopy of long-rotation and middle-aged plantations was compared. The relationships between the species richness of each beetle family and 24 ecological variables were identified. We found that beetle diversity tended to increase with long-rotation and responded differently to the ecological variables in two woodland strata (understory and canopy); e.g., an increase in phytophagies occurred in the canopy. Among the 24 measured ecological variables, the species richness of naturally regenerated mature trees, their abundance, and the quality and quantity of coarse woody material (CWM) had the strongest influences on beetle diversity. The former two variables increased with long-rotation; however, most variables related to CWM did not increase because thinned trees were left in middle-aged plantations as fallen logs. Therefore, the occurrence of naturally regenerated native trees that had grown sufficiently tall to reach canopy height in long-rotation plantations underpinned the improved biodiversity in larch plantations, contributing to native beetle species richness in these woodlands. Long-rotation makes plantations more heterogeneous, particularly in the canopy, and promotes greater native beetle diversity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study integrates and develops methods, namely low impact development (LID) selection method and an LID spatial planning model, to enable decision-making to minimize pluvial flooding for a community. The objective is to minimize the flood risk under the worst case of the design storm within the budget constraints. Design storms in current and future climate scenarios are analyzed as input to the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Then, LID practices are selected based on the proposed procedure and a spatial planning model is built to identify the optimal LID layouts using the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The lower and upper bounds of the generated rainfall intensities of a five-year 1-h duration design storms for the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 for the atmosphere and oceans (HadGEM2-AO), the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1-ME), and the CSIRO-Mk3.6.0 Atmosphere-Ocean GCM (CSIRO-Mk3.6.0) during 2021-2040 are derived. The LID selection helps efficiently identify appropriate LID. Results show that nearly no flood occurs under the optimal LID layouts found by the LID spatial planning model. Moreover, it is more optimal to invest in LID in the lower sub-catchments in LID planning when the budget is limited. These methods are generally applicable for a community using LIDs as adaptation measures against pluvial flooding.

AB  - Measures to improve N-use efficiency and thus reduce N-pollution are scrutinized in beef production based on suckle-cows. Measures in feed production, animal feed conversion and the use of animal manure are included and their economic opportunities are analysed. The results suggest that production based on non-N-fertilized grass gives very low losses of NO3, NH3 and N2O per ha. Production based on pastures and leys given 100 kg N ha(-1) results in considerably higher losses, especially per ha but also per kg of produced beef. Beef production without input of mineral fertilizers might be profitable in regions abundant in land with low opportunity cost, especially if environmental support is provided. Clover-based beef production gives relatively high N losses both per ha and per kg of beef. The reason is unnecessarily high N-content in the clover, resulting in high N-level in excreta and increased losses from manure and pastures. A change from a deep straw bed manure system to slurry spread only in spring and immediately incorporated can reduce N-losses considerably but is unprofitable in suckle-cow-production. Beef production has lower N-losses than pork production per ha but higher per kg of produced meat.

AB  - Decaying wood is one of the most important elements for species richness in boreal forests. We tested how well reserve selection based on the amount and quality of decaying wood results in a representation of four ecologically different taxa (beetles, birds, wood-inhabiting fungi, and vascular plants). We also compared the cost-efficiency of the use of dead-wood indicators with comprehensive species inventory. Our database included 32 seminatural old forest stands located in northern Finland. Decaying wood was a relatively good indicator of saproxylic species but not overall species richness. Even though dead wood did not reflect accurately overall species richness, our results indicated that the use of decaying wood as an indicator in site selection was more cost-efficient than using information from large-scale species inventories. Thus, decaying wood is a valuable surrogate for species richness, but other cost-efficient indicators that reflect the requirements of those species which are not dependent on decaying wood should be identified.

AB  - The flow of deep water from the Norwegian Sea to the North Atlantic via the Faroe-Shetland Channel is one of the critical bottlenecks in the meridional overturn circulation. It is also a flow that potentially carries with it a large number of the overwintering copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, a regionally important secondary producer. Using a high resolution hydrodynamic model, MIKE 3 FM, we simulate the overflow of deep water and estimate the associated loss rate of C. finmarchicus as a function of the water depth strata within which they reside. We estimate a net advective loss from the Norwegian Sea population of 80 +/- 10 kt carbon bound in lipids of C finmarchicus biomass per year, a number that constitutes about 50% of the total overwintering population. Estimates of water mass characteristics and particle tracking suggest that the fate of individuals transported in the overflowing water is to be entrained into warmer waters of the North Atlantic Basin, a habitat that appears to be unsuitable for successful overwintering.

AB  - 1. Climate change is impacting different species at different rates, leading to alterations in biological interactions with ramifications for wider ecosystem functioning. Understanding these alterations can help improve predictive capacity and inform management efforts designed to mitigate against negative impacts.
   2. We investigated how the movement and space use patterns of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in coastal areas in Svalbard, Norway, have been altered by a sudden decline in sea ice that occurred in 2006. We also investigated whether the spatial overlap between polar bears and their traditionally most important prey, ringed seals (Pusa hispida), has been affected by the sea-ice decline, as polar bears are dependent on a sea-ice platform for hunting seals.
   3. We attached biotelemetry devices to ringed seals (n = 60, both sexes) and polar bears (n = 67, all females) before (2002-2004) and after (2010-2013) a sudden decline in sea ice in Svalbard. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the association of these species to environmental features and an approach based on time spent in area to investigate changes in spatial overlap between the two species.
   4. Following the sea-ice reduction, polar bears spent the same amount of time close to tidal glacier fronts in the spring but less time in these areas during the summer and autumn. However, ringed seals did not alter their association with glacier fronts during summer, leading to a major decrease in spatial overlap values between these species in Svalbard's coastal areas. Polar bears now move greater distances daily and spend more time close to ground-nesting bird colonies, where bear predation can have substantial local effects.
   5. Our results indicate that sea-ice declines have impacted the degree of spatial overlap and hence the strength of the predator-prey relationship between polar bears and ringed seals, with consequences for the wider Arctic marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Shifts in ecological interactions are likely to become more widespread in many ecosystems as both predators and prey respond to changing environmental conditions induced by global warming, highlighting the importance of multi-species studies.

AB  - Based on a review of the environmental and archaeological records for Jaeren, southwest Norway, it is proposed that a transition to an agro-pastoral economy and society took place around the Middle to Late Neolithic transition (2400-2350 BC), and this led to a rapid definition of the cultural landscapes. This mode of society evolved in the following decades and centuries. One of the characteristic features found in the landscape at this time is that the whole territory was drawn into social and ritual life, locally leading to a zonation of the landscape, with distinct differences in the economic, social and cultural expressions in the resulting zones. Monumental and ritual manifestations are located in the open, grass-and heath-dominated coastal zone, whilst zones of variably intensive grain cultivation are located on suitable Quaternary deposits. The zones evolved in response to a sustained economic practice involving continuously expanding grazing, intensification of cereal production and access to channels of communication. Variations in exploitation pressure, production and economic strategy reflect a suite of environmental parameters. Thus, activity zones largely correlate with physical landscape properties, apparently reflecting both an adaptive aspect in the economy and patterns of comprehensive resource exploitation across the zones, e.g. combining cereal production, transhumant pastoralism, hunting and access to maritime bottlenecks. A proposed model of the social and economic organisation and interaction in the Jaeren region is based on the distributions of several categories of archaeological finds. It defines a number of interdependent zones within a unified, but composite economy, with crosscutting activities and mobility patterns. This approach is an alternative to existing models of hierarchy within limited territories. The landscape zonation in Jaeren is similar to the general situation in the western Scandinavian region, including Jutland, Denmark, and thus the introduction of the agro-pastoral farm to Jaeren was dependent on externally supplied impulses.

AB  - Uncertainties about future states of wildlife populations make it difficult to pre-adapt to possible threats and ensure sustainability of resources and harvesting over the long term. This uncertainty is partly due to the unknown impact and future states of many factors that explain population sizes and variation. In this paper, the effect of local game management activities on the uncertainty of future population sizes of groups of Finnish wildlife species (ungulates, forest grouse, large predators, small predators and mountain hare) was analysed using expert knowledge and the Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) modelling techniques. As a result, the current knowledge and agreement of the relationships between wildlife population sizes and the game management activities explaining their variation as well as trends are evaluated. Information given to hunters and the number of hunters were seen as the most effective factors for the management of game populations. However, there were great uncertainties in the expectations regarding future trends in the management activities, especially in feeding, and there was disagreement in the direction of the trend in the length of the hunting season. The trends in the size of forest grouse populations were viewed as the most uncertain trend among species groups. At the same time, forest grouse were seen as the most regulated species group by local game management. Among interest variables, experts were very uncertain and they disagreed about the direction of the trend in the recreational value of hunting.

AB  - The strategy to mitigate phosphorus ( P) losses in areas of arable cropping in Norway has focused on measures to reduce erosion. Risk assessment of erosion has formed the basis for implementation of the measures. The soil P content has increased during recent decades, motivating an evaluation of its effect on P transfer in the landscape. The present study describes the spatial variability of runoff P concentrations from an agricultural dominated catchment (4.5 km(2)), representative for agriculture in south-eastern Norway. The concentrations of suspended sediments ( SS), total P (TP) and dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff from 22 subcatchments (0.3 - 263 ha) during one year ( monthly and during runoff-events) were evaluated. Contributions from point sources were 38 kg TP yr(-1) compared to a total P loss of 685 kg yr(-1) from the whole catchment. During low flow, mean diffuse TP concentration in runoff from subcatchments varied from 28 to 382 mu g l(-1). The mean low flow TP concentration was 39 mu g l(-1) from the housing area ( only diffuse runoff) and 33 mu g l(-1) from the forested area. During high flow the highest diffuse TP concentration was measured in an area with high erosion risk and high soil P status. At the subcatchment level the transfer of SS varied from 25 to 175% of the whole catchment SS transfer. Correspondingly for TP, the transfer varied from 50 to 260% of the whole catchment TP transfer. For each of five agricultural subcatchments the slope of the relationship between TP and SS concentrations reflected the mean soil P status of the subcatchment. Erosion risk estimates were closely related to the SS concentration (R(2) = 0.83). The study illustrates that soil P status in addition to soil erosion is an important factor for P transfer.

AB  - CSR practice may draw inspiration not only from academic inquiries, but also from social debates, goals articulated by political leaders and the experiences of other economic entities that carry out their own social responsibility programmes. This article discusses an issue that has fundamental significance both for the economy's prospects and in its practical usefulness, as the art of managing in contemporary conditions. The research addresses issues related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in enterprises operating in the Pomerania Euroregion (The Pomerania Euroregion is a border region of particular significance. It connects German and Polish territory, and since February 1998, Swedish communities as well. In light of its location, the Pomerania Euroregion is a link connecting Central Europe with Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. From the point of view of further European integration, the east-west and north-south connections formed throughout history on the territory of Pomerania are growing in relevance today, making it possible to gradually achieve the EU's dream of harmonisation of living conditions in the member countries of the Pomerania Euroregion) (Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany and Poland's Zachodniopomorskie Province). Entities operating in the tourism sector, offering accommodation, are analysed in this publication. The purpose of the article is to present the results of research concerning the implementation of CSR principles in the area of investment in employee development by Polish and German micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the Pomerania Euroregion and to indicate cultural differences in this sphere and their influence on the employer-employee relationship. Taking as the paper's starting point the problem's relationship to investment in employee development, the following research hypothesis was formulated: Inspiring employees to develop their skills and to engage in long-term career planning contributes to the intensification of cooperation in regional relations.

AB  - We studied wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) to determine whether a wild ungulate can sufficiently increase its grazing time to compensate for loss of ingestion and rumination caused by insect harassment. We also tested the effect that insect harassment may have on autumn carcass weights. During summer 1997 and 1998, we recorded 24-hr activity budgets and frequency of change in activity bouts for wild reindeer. Following diurnal periods' insect harassment and decreased grazing, animals did not compensate by increasing grazing time or intensity during the night when insect harassment was low. Adult females and calves weighed significantly less in autumn 1997 following a summer of diurnal insect harassment, compared to autumn 1998 following a summer of little insect harassment. This indicates that the effect of daily insect harassment on activity budgets and grazing intensity had a negative effect on the body weights of adult females and calves. For reindeer, as for most wild ungulates, reduced body weight indicates poor condition and can jeopardize survival, reproduction, and calf recruitment.

AB  - This article explores whether women can become the change agents for a sustainable transport sector and how such a change can be accomplished through transport policy. Based on the Swedish case, women still on average have transportation behavior with lower environmental impact than men have; women also tend to have stronger preferences for improving sustainability in the sector. The results imply that there are interesting behavior and attitude characteristics expressed by women that ought to be recognized and applied, e.g., through contesting prevailing norms and methods, in order to achieve sustainability goals for the sector. Altogether this suggests that women, beyond democracy reasons, should become more active as change agents to challenge the dominant male norms. Policy implications of these findings include measures to improve gender equal participation that would, e.g., make it possible to take advantage of these differences by (1) putting more emphasis on the relationships among travel patterns, sustainability, and gendering on all levels in transportation planning as a measure for improved sustainability; (2) implementing new ways of framing the problems to be solved, challenging existing norms working against gender equity and raising consciousness of sustainability issues; and (3) using gender mainstreaming to monitor policy impacts on different groups of men and women. However, today there is a lack of incentives to apply these tools. Since there is a tremendous complexity in the relationships on all levels, more research is needed together with improved dissemination of knowledge for the competence to increase within the transport sector.

AB  - Identifying how physical and biotic factors shape genetic connectivity among populations in time and space is essential to our understanding of the evolutionary trajectory as well as the management of marine species. Atlantic cod is a widespread and commercially important marine species displaying several ecotypes with different life history strategies. Using three sets of SNPs: neutral, informative, and genome-inversion linked, we studied population genetic structure of similar to 2500 coastal Atlantic cod (CC) from 40 locations along Norway's 2500 km coastline, including nine fjords. We observed: (1) a genetic cline, suggesting a mechanism of isolation by distance, characterized by a declining F-ST between CC and North East Arctic Cod (NEAC-genetically distinct migratory ecotype) with increasing latitude, (2) that in the north, samples of CC from outer-fjord areas were genetically more similar to NEAC than were samples of CC from their corresponding inner-fjord areas, (3) greater population genetic differentiation among CC sampled from outer-fjord areas along the coast, than among CC sampled from their corresponding inner-fjord areas, (4) genetic differentiation among samples of CC from both within and among fjords. Collectively, these results permit us to draw two main conclusions. First, that differences in the relative presence of the genetically highly distinct, migratory ecotype NEAC, declining from north to south and from outer to inner fjord, plays the major role in driving population genetic structure of the Norwegian CC. Second, that there is limited connectivity between CC from different fjords. These results suggest that the current management units implemented for this species in Norway should be divided into smaller entities. Furthermore, the situation where introgression from one ecotype drives population genetic structure of another, as is the case here, may exist in other species and geographical regions, thus creating additional challenges for sustainable fisheries management.

AB  - In the face of an increasing world population and a subsequent need for an increase in sustainable and healthy food production, low trophic species, such as oysters, emerge as a promising alternative. However, regional variations in oyster production techniques, market dynamics, and consumption patterns create challenges for both the global and local industry's growth. In this study, a descriptive qualitative analysis of oyster markets across seven Atlantic regions was carried out. The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was found to be farmed in most Atlantic regions except the US but is classified as invasive in Sweden and potentially invasive in South Africa. Other farmed and/or harvested species include native species (C. gasar and C. rhizophorae) in Brazil, the American cupped oyster (C. virginica) in the US, and the European flat oyster (Ostrea edulis) in France, Sweden, and the US. In Irish farms, Pacific oysters are primarily for export to European markets. The marine aquaculture sectors of Sweden, South Africa, and Namibia, as well as Brazil's farming for C. gasar, were found to be underdeveloped. This study also observed a variation in licensing, property rights, and regulatory frameworks. Financial challenges for small businesses, ecological implications of seed production techniques, biosecurity risks, and public health considerations are emphasized as critical areas for attention. This study offers valuable insights into the selected markets and can serve as a useful resource for policymakers, aquaculture practitioners, and stakeholders in optimizing global shellfish industry strategies.

AB  - Waste-to-Energy (WtE) has gradually constituted one of the most important options to achieve energy recovery from municipal solid waste (MSW). However, the environmental sustainability of a specific WtE system varies with used technologies and geographic differences. As a result, three representative WtE systems are compared using life cycle assessment (LCA): a gasification-based WtE plant in Finland, mechanical-grate incineration in France, and circulating fluidized bed incineration in China. Results show that the overall environmental performance of the gasification system is better than incineration. The use of gasification technology, attributed to an intermediate syngas purification step, can provide benefits of both reducing the stack emissions and increasing the energy efficiency. Regional waste management, especially related to MSW caloric value and emission regulation, are determining factors for a preferable performance of the incineration in France over that in China. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses further address key variations such as choice of MSW composition, basis of displaced electricity, energy recovery mode, and application of "best-available technology" dedicated to incineration. It is found that the most sensitive parameters influencing the LCA results are: electricity recovery, CO2 emission, and NOx emission. In the future, use of the source-separated high caloric waste combined with a more stringent emission standard can efficiently improve MSW incineration in China. Bottom ash recycling for metals and materials is highly applicable regarding incineration in France. This presented study can overall contribute to the development of specific WtE technology and local waste management plan for decisio-makers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Although wolf recolonization can be considered a success in terms of population increase and geographical dispersal, the return of grey wolves Canis lupus to rural central Sweden has caused frustration and discontent among local stakeholders. Farmers and hunters living in - or adjacent to - wolf territories perceive the political decision to support wolf recovery as intruding on local lives and restricting opportunities for small-scale farming and hunting. They feel that decision-makers have left the consequences of wolf recovery policies unaddressed. To overcome the failure of previous policies and increase local consensus, in October 2009 the Swedish parliament passed a resolution concerning the introduction of licensed hunting on wolves as a measure expected to promote local acceptance and facilitate dialogue among different parties. In doing so, the Parliament delegated to the regional authorities the responsibility to organize, coordinate and implement licensed hunting in the administrative counties concerned.
   According to Swedish wolf hunting regulations, the regional authorities are to be involved not only in the achievement of primary policy goals, but are also expected to overcome antagonism and conflict through collaboration. Questioning the normative idea which suggests that public managers are expected simply to implement national legislation at the local level, this paper argues that managers create practices and establish routines that enable them to cope with problems related to the realization of collaborative management. Th rough a combination of participant observations and semi-structured interviews conducted with authorities and field-staff in four administrative counties during the implementation of licensed hunting, this paper concludes that in order to understand how collaborative management of natural resources works, greater attention has to be directed to the way public managers organize their activities, how they cope with their mandate and how they themselves relate to networks of actors.

AB  - Two approaches to greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories are common, namely the stock-change approach and the gain-loss approach. With the stock-change approach, mean annual emissions are estimated as the ratio of the difference in stock estimates at two points in time and the number of intervening years. The stock-change approach is fairly easy to implement for countries with well-established forest sampling programs. However, countries without established forest sampling programs more commonly use the gain-loss approach. With this approach, emissions are estimated as the product of the areas of classes of land use change, characterized as activity data, and the responses of carbon stocks for those classes, characterized as emission factors. Regardless of the approach, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) good practice guidelines specify that GHG inventories produce neither over-nor under-estimates and reduce uncertainties to the degree possible. For a study area in southeastern Norway, the objectives of the study were to compare the stock-change and gain-loss approaches with respect to estimates of carbon emissions for the aboveground biomass pool and to illustrate statistically rigorous methods for complying with the two IPCC good practice guidelines for both approaches. The primary conclusions were that the two approaches produced comparable estimates of mean annual emissions, but that the stock-change approach produced considerably smaller estimates of uncertainty.

AB  - We studied nest predation pressure on birds along an urban gradient in urban parks in three Finnish towns. Artificial ground nests with Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonicus) eggs were depredated more in the urban area than in the adjacent forest area. Within each town, the nest predation rate was higher in the town center than in the less urbanized area of detached houses. Predation rates did not vary from year to year or between study towns. Abundances of generalist avian predators were higher in the town center than in the area of detached houses and in the surrounding forest area. Most of the nests in the town center were destroyed by avian predators. Predation rate of artificial nests in each of the town areas was higher in managed parks than in unmanaged parks, presumably due to the less dense vegetation in the managed than the unmanaged parks. A test involving covering nests revealed that artificial nests covered by adjacent vegetation survived better than nests with less cover. In our study, artificial nest loss reflected the distribution of avian nest predators. Ground nesters were present at lower abundances in areas where concealing vegetation was missing and avian nest predation was high. Apparently, nest predation is one of the several possible mechanism affecting urban bird assemblages.

AB  - Safeguarding biodiversity has been one of the most important issues in environmental and forest policies since the 1990s. In Southern Finland, decisions concerning further actions for the preservation of forest biodiversity will be made in the coming years. To support policy making, we present a multi-regional model that is applicable in determining the economically optimal regional allocation of conservation sites. Three habitat quality models are evaluated to calculate habitat quality indices used as a surrogate for a biodiversity value in a forest sector model. The scenarios presented provide information about the economic impacts of conservation choices on the forest sector. The overall economic impacts of conservation depend on its scale and regional allocation. Conserving land with high biodiversity value can have less adverse impact on the forest sector than conservation of typical commercial forest sites. When optimizing conservation set-asides, we found that set-asides targeted to certain regions possessing higher/lower than average relative share of ecologically valuable land, caused lower/higher adverse economic impacts on the forest sector. Because it is expensive to search land suitable for conservation, these regions could be respectively favoured/avoided when asking forest owners to offer their land for the new conservation program in Southern Finland, which will be based on voluntariness.

AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems in the Arctic are extremely vulnerable to human activities associated with oil and gas exploration, transportation and processing, and with industrial and urban development. The effects of complex pollutant mixtures interact with environmental factors. Here we assessed the effects of two anthropogenic and one natural factor on the reproduction, development and adult shell shape of the intertidal ovoviviparous gastropod Littorina saxatilis at 12 sites in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. The stressors studied were toxicity equivalency (TEQ) of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), the proximity of the site to urban/industrial locations as a proxy for urban pollution, and salinity. Total fecundity of the snails decreased at sites with low salinity but was not affected by PAH pollution. Allometric relationships of L. saxatilis shell shape varied between sites depending on the proximity of urban/industrial locations; the intrapopulation morphological disparity increased near urban sites. The frequency of abnormal embryos per brood and the incidence of females with abnormal embryos in the brood pouch increased at urban sites, especially under conditions of low salinity, but was unrelated to PAH pollution. Monte Carlo simulation showed that the registered embryotoxic effect of the proximity to urban/industrial locations was unlikely to result in a significant reduction of the population recruitment of L. saxatilis due to the high fecundity of these snails. Elucidation of the mechanisms of low sensitivity of L. saxatilis to PAHs in concentrations registered in our study and identification of the cause of embryotoxic effects associated with the proximity of urban/industrial locations are promising directions of further studies. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple stressors when assessing anthropogenic impacts on coastal systems. We show that L. saxatilis can be an informative indicator of coastal urban pollution across its wide distribution range.

AB  - The paper reports from a multiple case study investigating three music festivals located in the Barents region, namely the Festspel i Pite Alvdal (Pitea, Sweden), the Festspillene i Nord-Norge (Harstad, Norway) and the Jutajaiset Folklorefestivaali (Rovaniemi, Finland). The aim of the reported study was to investigate how these festivals cooperated with actors in their surroundings. Furthermore, the purpose was to explore the study's data through the perspectives of network and stakeholder theory. The data consisted of field notes from observations of 58 festival events; 10 in-depth interviews with festival administrators and official representatives of the festivals' host municipalities; and documentation. The data was analysed using meaning condensation and structuring displays. Through the theory-related exploration of the study's data, three themes emerged: first, the festivals cooperated with multiple stakeholders, who assumed multiple roles; second, the festivals and their stakeholders would sometimes enter into a state of symbiosis; and third, the festivals were seen to engage in long-stretched, "loose" and glocal networks. The three themes appeared as interrelated and could all be understood as strategies, which the festivals employed in order to increase their sustainability. The findings could also be connected to a typology of festivals in the context of institutionalization.

AB  - The uranium (U) concentrations and isotopic composition of waters and sediment cores were used to investigate the transport and accumulation of U in a water system (tailings pond, two lakes, and the Kalix River) receiving mine waters from the Kiruna mine. Concentrations of dissolved U decrease two orders of magnitude between the inflow of mine waters and in the Kalix River, while the concentration of the element bound to particulate matter increases, most likely due to sorption on iron-manganese hydroxides and organic matter. The vertical distribution of U in the water column differs between two polluted lakes with a potential indication of dissolved U supply from sediment's pore waters at anoxic conditions. Since the beginning of exposure in the 1950s, U concentrations in lake sediments have increased >20-fold, reaching concentrations above 50 mu g g-1. The distribution of anthropogenic U between the lakes does not follow the distribution of other mine water contaminants, with a higher relative proportion of U accumulating in the sediments of the second lake. Concentrations of redox-sensitive elements in the sediment core as well as Fe isotopic composition were used to re-construct past redox-conditions potentially controlling early diagenesis of U in surface sediments. Two analytical techniques (ICP-SFMS and MC-ICP-MS) were used for the determination of U isotopic composition, providing an extra dimension in the understanding of processes in the system. The (234 U)/(238 U) activity ratio (AR) is rather uniform in the tailings pond but varies considerably in water and lake sediments providing a potential tracer for U transport from the Kiruna mine through the water system, and U immobilization in sediments. The U mass balance in the Rakkurijoki system as well as the amount of anthropogenic U accumulated in lake sediments were evaluated, indicating the immobilization in the two lakes of 170 kg and 285 kg U, respectively.

AB  - Policies to reduce adverse health impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) require information on costs of abatement and associated costs. This paper explores the potential for cost-efficient control of anthropogenic primary PM2.5 emissions in Finland. Based on a Kyoto-compliant energy projection, two emission control scenarios for 2020 were developed. 'Baseline' assumes implementation of PM controls in compliance with existing legislation. 'Reduction' assumes ambitious further reductions. Emissions for 2020 were estimated at 26 and 18.6 Gg a(-1) for 'Baseline' and 'Reduction', respectively. The largest abatement potential, 3.0 Gg a(-1), was calculated for power plants and industrial combustion. The largest potential with marginal costs below 5000 (sic) Mg(PM2.5)(-1) was for domestic wood combustion, 1.7 Gg a(-1). For traffic the potential was estimated at 1.0 Gg a(-1), but was associated with high costs. The results from this paper are used in the policy-driven national integrated assessment modeling that explores cost-efficient reductions of the health impacts of PM.

AB  - We simulated pollen assemblages for 11 sites on the Swiss Plateau (Schweizer Mittelland) based on a low resolution land cover map and pollen productivity estimates (PPE) from this region. A comparison between observed and simulated pollen data demonstrated that the majority of the simulated pollen proportions were within a range of 5% of over- or underestimation, and that at eight of the 11 sites the dominant taxon was correctly estimated. The modelled sum of arboreal pollen was correct within +/- 11% at nine sites. Our results indicate that the PPE established for the Swiss Plateau can be used to simulate pollen assemblages with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, our results justify the use of the POLLSCAPE simulation using the Prentice-Sugita model and its variations of pollen dispersal and deposition in more complex topographic landscapes than those to which they have hitherto been applied.

AB  - The aim of the article is to evaluate the development of plantations of differently performing parts of the mountain spruce population in the area with high nitrogen deposition. The high nitrogen compounds load threats the stability of the forest stands and consequently affects the forest functions on mountainous sites over long time. An important measure to reduce the sensitivity of forest ecosystems is also the support of a high level of biodiversity. This means a maintenance of intraspecies variability within populations. The first results of the experiment were in accordance with previous experience with other mountain spruce populations as the initially slower-growing seedlings showed the best growth and health after being planted in mountain conditions. On the basis of these results it is still possible to hypothesize that one of the options to reduce the negative impact of nitrogen in mountain climates lies in that artificial restoration strategy that does not eliminate the category of initially slowly-growing spruces.

AB  - Due to their high mobility, large terrestrial predators are potentially capable of maintaining high connectivity, and therefore low genetic differentiation among populations. However, previous molecular studies have provided contradictory findings in relation to this. To elucidate patterns of genetic structure in large carnivores, we studied the genetic variability of the Eurasian lynx, Lynx lynx throughout north-eastern Europe using microsatellite, mitochondrial DNA control region and Y chromosome-linked markers. Using SAMOVA we found analogous patterns of genetic structure based on both mtDNA and microsatellites, which coincided with a relatively little evidence for male-biased dispersal. No polymorphism for the cytochrome b and ATP6 mtDNA genes and Y chromosomelinked markers were found. Lynx inhabiting a large area encompassing Finland, the Baltic countries and western Russia formed a single genetic unit, while some marginal populations were clearly divergent from others. The existence of a migration corridor was suggested to correspond with distribution of continuous forest cover. The lowest variability (in both markers) was found in lynx from Norway and Bialowieza Primeval Forest (BPF), which coincided with a recent demographic bottleneck (Norway) or high habitat fragmentation (BPF). The Carpathian population, being monomorphic for the control region, showed relatively high microsatellite diversity, suggesting the effect of a past bottleneck (e.g. during Last Glacial Maximum) on its present genetic composition. Genetic structuring for the mtDNA control region was best explained by latitude and snow cover depth. Microsatellite structuring correlated with the lynx's main prey, especially the proportion of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in its diet. Eurasian lynx are capable of maintaining panmictic populations across eastern Europe unless they are severely limited by habitat continuity or a reduction in numbers. Different correlations of mtDNA and microsatellite population divergence patterns with climatic and ecological factors may suggest separate selective pressures acting on males and females in this solitary carnivore.

AB  - Populations of tree species with a wide geographic range, such as silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), show genetic specialization to native environments, while maintaining high phenotypical plasticity. Accordingly, assessment of local specialization is essential for adaptive management. The aim of the study was to detect geographic patterns of local adaptation of growth and stem quality based on two open-pollinated progeny trials in Latvia testing local material. Two provenance regions differing by continentality were distinguished, which also differed in genetic control of growth traits, likely originating from the post-glacial recolonization of vegetation and subsequent natural adaptation. Heritability of the traits was estimated for each of the distinguished regions, indicating differing patterns of genetic adaptation and potential for future selection. Trees from the more continental inland showed superior growth and possessed higher heritability. The coastal provenance region showed slower growth and intermediate heritability of the respective traits. Moderate to high heritability for stem quality traits was estimated irrespectively of region. Overall, better growth and higher heritability suggests that anthropogenic selection within the best inland provenances may constitute better performing and adaptable breeding population compared to the coastal one. Still, overlapping phenotypical variation and heritability of quality traits implies improved stemwood quality for plywood regardless of the provenance region. High adaptive capacity of silver birch genotypes suggests ability to cope with climatic changes, highlighting its potential for climate-smart forestry.

AB  - Bed-sites of radio-collared adult roe deer Capreolus capreolus were identified during summer 1994 in the Lier valley, southern Norway. Site characteristics were measured at the bed-site and at a randomly chosen site 50 m away. Roe deer preferred to bed down below dense canopy cover, but showed no preference for bedding close to tree trunks. The availability of herbs was higher at bed-sites than at random sites, and higher at bed-sites used by females than at bed-sites used by males. On warm days the abundance of herbs at bed-sites was lower than on cold days, indicating movement away from feeding sites. During warm days roe deer selected bed-sites with humid substrates, probably to increase heat loss by conduction. Bed-sites were well concealed.

Research has suggested that one of the main aspects that might contribute to this is the fact that RET are represented as industrial and urban, and thus, as having a different essence from rural landscapes, where they are usually deployed and which are represented as natural and unspoilt. However, this 'hypothesis' of landscape essentialisation shaping people's responses to RET has not been explicitly examined. By drawing upon research from Social Psychology and Human Geography on essentialisation, we will examine if and how landscape (de-)essentialisation plays a role in people's responses to RET. Namely, by examining it as a rhetorical construction that can be strategically used to negotiate and legitimize given relations with place and associated responses to RET.
   Focus groups were conducted in the UK and Norway with members of local communities to be affected by the construction of HVPLs that will connect to new low carbon energy technologies. Analyses show that participants present British and Norwegian rural landscapes in general and HVPL as having two different essences, which justifies opposition to those infrastructures. However, analyses also show that essentialisation of the countryside is strategically used. Namely, participants also present the countryside in the place where they live as having more of the essence of the British or Norwegian countryside than other areas of the UK and Norway. In turn, this allows them to legitimize claims that whereas HVPL are 'out of place' in the countryside in general, they are more so in the place where they live.
   The implications of these results for the definition of acceptable locations for RET and for research on people place relations and responses to place change, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The importance ascribed to knowledge externalities for understanding the spatial organization of industries (i.e. clustering) is increasingly being exposed to critical theoretical and empirical scrutiny. This research has not yet spilled over into studies of creative industries. This paper is concerned with reducing this omission by making an empirically based assessment of the importance of respectively knowledge internalities and externalities for the spatial organization of the news industry. The paper documents how the identified spatial organization can complement the existing literature on the importance of knowledge externalities for clustering of creative industries.

AB  - Strong relationships exist between reef fishes and their habitat, anthropogenic habitat alterations may lead variations in the associated fish. Knowledge of fish species distribution over coastal areas heavily impacted by tourism over the Mexican Central Pacific is scarce. This work aims to identify the reef fish species on different coastal habitats (sand, rock, mud) present in Puerto Marques Bay. The fish community was characterized in terms of species richness, abundance, feeding behavior and was further assessed using similarity analysis. The number of species and the relative abundance of fish species recorded varied significantly among the habitats (ANOSIM test: R = 0.676, P < 0.01, 999 permutations). In rocky areas, the highest value of richness, exclusive species and the number of organisms were recorded. In comparison with soft bottoms, the complexity of hard substrates plays a significant role in reducing prey abundances and providing nesting sites and different food resources such as invertebrates and macroalgae. Mugil cephalus was the only species recorded with muddy habitat affinity, where it feeds on detritus. Predatory species like Caranx caballus, Lutjanus jordani and Lutjanus peru, generally associated with complex rocky substrates were recorded exclusively in sandy areas near to the tourist marina. Although our data do not allow to conclude the anthropogenic outcomes in the reef fish community structure, they suggest that fish assemblage from sandy bottoms could be affected by the presence of artificial structures.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION

CP  - 4th Japanese/Swedish Noise Symposium on Medical Effects
AB  - To investigate cross-cultural differences in the community response to road traffic noise, social surveys were conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Kumamoto and Sapporo, Japan, using the same questionnaire and noise measurement method. Typical residential areas with detached houses and apartments were selected as the target areas in each city. The questionnaire comprised 40 questions relating to environmental, housing and personal factors. The key questions concerned annoyance caused by road traffic noise. The total numbers of respondents were 1142 in Gothenburg, 837 in Kumamoto and 780 in Sapporo. The response rates were 68.8, 69.3 and 57.5% respectively. After the questionnaires were completed, noise measurements were made in each area. Community responses were compared on the basis of the dose-response relationships. There were no systematic differences between community responses in Sapporo and Kumamoto, which have the same culture. People living in detached houses in Gothenburg were more annoyed by the same road traffic noise than the people living in Japanese cities. There were no systematic differences among the three cities with regard to activity disturbances indoors, but significant disturbance of activities and resting in gardens or on balconies was noted in Gothenburg. The difference in activity disturbance was due to the differences between lifestyles in the two countries. People living in detached houses were more annoyed by the house vibration caused by road traffic than those living in apartments and people were annoyed by the exhaust from road traffic to the same extent as noise.

AB  - Due to a northward shift in oil and gas activities, there is an increasing need to understand the potential anthropogenic impacts of oil-related compounds on sub-Arctic and Arctic organisms, particularly those in coastal habitats. Capelin (Mallotus villosus), a key fish species in the Barents Sea ecosystem, undertakes aggregated spawning at both intertidal and subtidal coastal localities in northern Norway. To investigate the sensitivity of capelin embryos to oil compounds, newly fertilized capelin eggs were collected from a spawning beach and exposed until hatch (32 days) to either the water soluble fraction of crude oil or the single PAH compound, pyrene. Threshold levels for egg mortality, development and hatching success were determined. Concentrations of 40 mu g/L crude oil (Sigma 26 PAHs) and 55 mu g/L pyrene significantly increased embryonic mortality rates and decreased hatching success, compared with controls, indicating that a potential oil spill in the vicinity of capelin spawning grounds may cause significant impacts. No significant incidence of adverse effects such as yolk sac oedema, pericardia oedema, haemorrhages, craniofacial abnormalities, premature hatch or inhibited growth was observed. Histological studies of hatched larvae did not reveal specific sublethal effects in tissues and organs. Developmental delays and subsequent embryo death were noticed at the period of eye pigmentation in affected groups. Early life-history stages of capelin are sensitive indicators of PAH impacts, but the mechanisms responsible for the toxic effects require further investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Veteran trees are keystone structures currently in decline worldwide. In Europe, veteran oaks (Quercus spp.) are important habitat trees for wood-living beetles. Still, we have limited knowledge of the drivers determining the composition of these communities and the relevant spatial and temporal scales for these drivers. We collected beetles from 32 hollow oaks in two regions in Southern Norway along a coast-inland gradient paralleling historical onset of oak harvesting. We focused on species with different host-association to oak and identified the relative importance of processes working on different spatial scales, ranging from tree-scale to region-scale, as well as effects of the coast-inland gradient. We found all the spatial scales to influence the species composition, with a response to the coast-inland gradient and differences between the regions for all beetle groups. The tree scale was the most important scale for species mainly associated with oak, generalist species and the overall species composition-with bryophyte cover on the stem, depth of bark crevices and amount of wood mould as the most important variables. The close surroundings and forest variables on the landscape scale was most important for the beetle species restricted to broadleaf trees. Our study confirmed established knowledge, but also revealed new relationships between oak-associated beetles and relevant drivers on the tree and regional scale. As important responses of species mainly associated with oak or broadleaf trees were concealed when analyzing the total community, care should be taken not to base management recommendations on such overall, general patterns.

AB  - The article discusses the importance of services as agents of internationalisation. Services are seen as dynamic agents of change, and services and commodities are considered composite in production processes. Modes of entering the global scene such as trade in services, foreign direct investment, forming of alliances, franchising and intrafirm trade are focused on, and limits to globalisation are highlighted. Some services, particularly advanced business services, more easily fall prey to institutional and cultural constraints than others. Empirically, Norway is analysed as an arena of international services against the background of its historical tradition particularly in shipping and affiliated activities. Recently, however, manufacturing has gained in importance, mainly in exports and to a lesser extent in imports, due to the petroleum economy. This appears to indicate that export of services has lost momentum over time. The development profile in shipping is highly negative. The negative picture changes somewhat when not only the trade balance, but also investment abroad is considered. In this respect, services have grown in relative importance, notably in the financial sector and in telecommunications. When juxtaposing outgoing and incoming investments, petroleum-related services have gained an increased export and investment surplus in recent years, from a balance in the mid-1990s.

KW  - IMPACT ASSESSMENT
KW  - BIODIVERSITY
AB  - The EU Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC requires impact assessments called Appropriate Assessments (AA) for plans and projects probably having adverse effects on the sites of European ecological importance, Natura 2000 sites. Seventy-three Appropriate Assessment reports and seventy official opinions given on them by regional environmental authorities from 1997 to 2005 were reviewed. The findings of the study demonstrate typical shortcomings of ecological impact assessment: a weak information basis for assessment outcomes and lack of proper cumulative impact assessment with respect to ecological structures and processes. The quality of reporting has improved over time with respect to direct impacts on individual habitat types and species and detailed mitigation measures. Regional environment centres considered one fifth of the AA reports to be inadequate because of lacking data. In most cases the regional environment centres demanded a change of plan or project, added mitigation measures, choice of only one alternative for further planning or a new completed assessment with additional information in order to be able to evaluate the significance of the effects. The study underlines the need for iterative planning practices in which the preparation of a plan or project with alternative options goes hand in hand with the impact assessment equipped with sufficient data.

AB  - During the last 140 years, the trajectories of Finnish bear and wolf populations have twice diverged. The first such divergence occurred during 1875-1915; wolf abundance plummeted within a decade, while bears decreased steadily over 40 years. The second divergence began in the 1990s, coinciding with the introduction of total protection of both species. Within 20 years, the bear population grew fourfold, while the wolf remained low. These patterns can be accounted for in terms of both historical and contemporary stakeholder attitudes. Data from periodicals published during 1881-1923 show a significant difference in that respect: the scenario of the extinction of the bear was seen as entirely unacceptable, while that of the wolf was clearly an objective worth pursuing. Nationwide studies carried out during the second divergence show that attitudes toward the bear are significantly more positive than those toward the wolf. Increased bear numbers re-opened sustainable harvesting of this valued game. The wolf, in contrast, has been treated rather as a pest than as a valuable quarry, and in spite of total protection, the illegal killing has kept its population low. Recent wolf population changes synchronize with policy adjustments suggesting that legal harvest might reduce the urge to undertake unlawful acts, but regulated hunting has probably been allowed in too short and erratic periods to test its real conservation potential. Rural people and hunters are salient wildlife management stakeholders in circumstances where they have to share their territory with conflict-prone species. These groups have the intrinsic power to implement forms of grassroots-level management that can sometimes override official top-down policy decisions.

AB  - Landscape is an important public interest with social, cultural, ecological, and environmental dimensions. It is central to the formation of local cultures and contributes to human well-being. Some areas are protected by supranational agreements that have significant international value. The European Landscape Convention (ELC) calls for integrating landscape considerations into other policy areas such as motorway planning that may directly or indirectly impact the landscape. The key challenge is the integration of existing institutional backgrounds and governing traditions. This paper compares how two qualitative case studies managed landscape protection while planning motorways. Specifically, we examine two internationally protected areas - one in Hungary that focuses on nature and one in Sweden the focuses on culture - to consider how these areas were assessed during the planning of the new motorways. Analysing the cases through the theoretical lens of institutional interplay, we found that the main differences between the two cases can be attributed to the different governing traditions and interpretations of landscape.

AB  - During the 2010s, a number of projects have been initiated with the aim of "developing" city districts that have been classified as "vulnerable" or "particularly vulnerable". With a focus on Angered in Gothenburg, this article analyzes the governance strategies that have been dominant, what kind of conflicts they have generated, which strategies residents in the neighborhoods have developed to resist the "development" and the outcome of the conflicts. Based on critical urban research and governmentality theory, we distinguish three forms of shifting responsibilization: 1) from macro-to meso-level when municipal housing companies are given the responsibility of leading partnerships with private actors and non-profit organizations in a way that involves these actors in tasks that were previously the responsibility of the state, 2 ) from the meso-to the micro-level when municipal housing companies shift the responsibility for renovations and development of local environments to individual tenants, 3) from the micro-level back to the meso-and macro-level when residents of million program areas resist responsibilization and demand a re-responsibilization of the municipality and the central state.

AB  - Fire is not an integral part of terrestrial ecosystems in temperate Europe, nevertheless prescribed burning is proposed to be an alternative to traditional management applied to grasslands. Thus, anthropogenic fire represents a serious challenge to plant species, and there is no information on how the recruitment of species responds to tire, The aim of our study was to assess the effect of fire on seed germination of 16 herbaceous grassland and ruderal species belonging to four common families. We first assessed the fuel load in open habitats in early spring and measured soil temperatures during experimental fires. After that we performed a controlled pot experiment involving heal treatments and experimental tire applied to seeds and followed their germination. Our measurements showed that maximum temperatures are between 73 degrees C and 264 degrees C on the ground surface and fire passage is fast, with short residence times of high temperatures. In deeper soil layers (1 cm and 5 cm.), temperature increase is negligible. Seed germination of half of the species was decreased by the passage of fire, and a heat shock of 100 degrees C for 5 min had an even stronger adverse effect. Seeds of three Fabaceae species were stimulated by heat or fire, while negative effects prevailed among species belonging to other families. Anthropogenic fire in grasslands of temperate Europe might reduce recruitment by seed, particularly in species of the Asteraceae and Poaceae, two very important families with a large representation in temperate grasslands. Our results indicate that prescribed burning should be carefully applied in order not to endanger the local persistence of grassland species whose seedling emergence is negatively affected by fire.

AB  - Wood from the boreal forest represents an important resource for paper production and sawmill processing. Due to poor infrastructure and high transportation costs on land, timbers are often transported over long distances along large river systems. Industrial river rafting activities started at the end of the 19th century and were intensified in western Russia and central Siberia from the 1920s to the 1980s. After initial single stem rafting, timber is today mostly floated in ship-guided rafts. Lost wood can be transported further to the Arctic Ocean, where it may drift within sea ice over several years and thousands of kilometers before being deposited along (sub-)Arctic coastlines. Here, we introduce dendro-dated tree-ring width series of 383 driftwood samples from logged timber that were collected along different driftwood-recipient coastlines in Greenland, Iceland and Svalbard. The majority of driftwood is Pinus sylvestris from the southern Yenisei region in central Siberia, whereas Larix sp. and Picea sp. from western Russia and eastern Siberia are rare. Although our results are based on a small sample collection, they clearly show the importance of timber rafting on species, age and origin of Arctic driftwood and indicate the immense loss of material during wood industrial river floating.

AB  - Many consumers are willing to move to a more plant-based diet, as is apparent from the increasing demand for plant-based protein sources on many markets. There is scientific evidence that such diets are associated with lower environmental impacts, especially climate impact, land use, and energy use. However, all food production affects the environment, and there is scope for more sustainable food choices even among plant-based foods. We present a method for environmental multi-criteria evaluation of plant-based products to enable communication through a consumer guide, which was developed in cooperation with World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Sweden and involves a real-life case of implementation. The guide included 90 products, divided into five product groups. Four environmental impact categories were evaluated (climate impact, biodiversity impact, water use, pesticide use), to give a fuller, more complex picture of potential environmental impacts of plant-based products than when evaluating only one impact category, such as climate impact. Available environmental footprint data and LCA data adapted for the specific consumer market (Sweden) were used. A method for calculating absolute sustainability thresholds for single products was developed, based on newly published global sustainability boundaries for the food system (Willett et al., 2019). To account for the different dietary functions of food, different thresholds for evaluating different food groups were applied, thus accounting for the role, and to some extent the nutrient content, of different food products. This enabled evaluation of foods based on the same grounds, i.e., using the global sustainability boundaries and the same functional unit for all food products (1 kg of food at a store in Sweden), while visualizing differences in environmental impacts of products within a certain food group. This revealed the best choice of protein sources, vegetables, etc. The method provides a way to use large amounts of data of varying quality, and reduces the complexity in evaluating the environmental impacts of food. It therefore hopefully facilitates sustainable plant-based food choices, for more environmentally sustainable food consumption. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The transition towards a 100% renewable energy system may be an opportunity to resolve the water energy nexus. However, deployment of some technologies might impose additional strain on water ecosystems. An energy-system-wide analysis of water demand in Europe was performed for the period 2015e2050 using the LUT Energy System Transition model for two scenarios: Area (with electricity interconnections) and Regions (without). For fossil-fuelled power plants, the water footprint in 20 European regions may decrease considerably until 2050, by 28.3% in the 'Area scenario' and 24.2% in the 'Regions scenario'. However, total water demand in the Area scenario increases in 5 regions on average by 14%, from 7% (Balkan-West countries) to 24% (Sweden). Further, Turkey, Norway and Sweden may have the largest water demands in Europe due to the commissioning of new hydropower plants. Results indicate discussions on the sustainability of energy transition scenarios should be expanded to include water footprint. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A holistic approach to the management of water, energy, food, and the environment is required to both meet the socioeconomic demands of the future as well as sustainable development of these limited resources. The Urmia Lake Basin has faced environmental, social, and economic challenges in recent years, and this situation is likely to worsen under the impacts of climate change. For this study, an adaptability analysis of this region is proposed for the 2040 horizon year. Two models, the water evaluation and planning (WEAP (Stockholm Environmental Institute, Stockholm, Sweden)) and the low emissions analysis platform (LEAP (Stockholm Environmental Institute, Boston, MA, USA)), are integrated to simulate changes in water, energy, food, and the environment over these 20 years. Two climate scenarios and nine policy scenarios are combined to assess sustainable development using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. Results show that, through pursuing challenging goals in agricultural, potable water, energy, and industrial sectors, sustainable development will be achieved. In this scenario, the Lake Urmia water level will reach its ecological water level in 2040. However, social, technical, and political challenges are considered obstacles to implementing the goals of this scenario. In addition, industry growth and industry structure adjustment have the most impact on sustainable development achievement.

AB  - Waste generation is continuously increasing, like the global population and urbanization. This is accompanied by emissions and externalities, making municipal solid waste management (MSWM) a central subject for sustainable urban development. Therefore, a novel logistics concept of a water-based MSWM system was piloted in Stock-holm (Sweden). A recycling barge was used to collect waste, reuse items, and provide reuse items for citizens to take home. A hybrid simulation model based on real-world data from the pilot study is developed in this paper. This combined agent-based and discrete-event model simulates the customers' and workers' behavior, including loading operations on the recycling barge, filling a methodological gap in MSWM. The research focuses on elaborating the system boundaries and optimizing the operational processes to evaluate the sustainability and accessibility of the system. The computations with 58 different experimental settings identify capacity limits and determine optimal operational conditions. Further, modifying processes could reduce the number of transports up to 55%. Another added value of the model is the extension beyond the pilot study and its flexible application to procedural changes. Based on the presented findings, implementation in other cities can be enforced and thus increase recycling rates, reduce land use, and save transport kilometers.

AB  - The TV oak (Television Oak) conflict concerned felling an old tree in a wealthy area of Stockholm. The case received great public attention in different media formats with different scopes (e.g., newspapers, television, internet). The TV Oak issue involved actors with different, partly conflicting perceptions. Assuming that the relevance of urban tree management issues in particular leads to increased interest among the local audience, this paper compared differences in reporting on the TV Oak case in local and national newspapers. The comparison comprised the actors "speaking" in the newspapers, the interest roles attributed to different actors and the frames used. The empirical materials used were articles concerning the TV Oak published between October 2011 and June 2012 in one local and two national Swedish newspapers. Quantitative analysis of statements in these articles showed that the geographical scope of the newspaper was not the major driving force framing the TV Oak conflict and that variety of framings, ranging from a humanised perception of the oak to a more analytical hazard perception, were used. Differences between the interest roles allocated to different actors (e.g., in terms of victim, causer, and helper in the oak conflict) showed that the framing of conflicts very much depended on single actors, in particular a high profile journalist in the national newspapers and private individuals writing letters to the editor in the local newspaper.

AB  - Society's increased interest in renewable energy and materials put pressure on forest biomass production. Intensive fertilization of young Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest has a considerable potential to increase the production of tree biomass, but there are concerns about negative side-effects on forest ecosystem structure and function. Fertilization of young forest has a strong negative impact on light availability below the tree canopy and reduces the abundance of the forest floor vegetation. The silvicultural practice of thinning has been shown to affect composition and diversity of forest floor vegetation, and it has been proposed, but rarely tested, that the effects of fertilization are interdependent on the type of thinning performed. Here we present responses on the forest floor vegetation following 25 years of fertilization and eighth years after thinning (removing 30% or 60% of the tree basal area) in a Norway spruce forest in northern Sweden. Fertilization without thinning led to a considerable reduction in abundance of most forest floor plants. It did not affect species richness but resulted in an increased evenness. Thinning reduced the fertilization effects so that the total abundance of the vegetation was comparable to the unfertilized control plots. A considerable change in species composition had, however, taken place. Thinning favored early-successional species and pteridophytes on the account of dwarf-shrubs. Thinning also increased species richness and functional richness, while none, or negative effects were seen on evenness and functional evenness, respectively. A comparison with data from the National Forest Inventory revealed that the type of vegetation generated by fertilization, without or in combination with thinning, is a type of vegetation very uncommon in Swedish boreal forests. First, we conclude that the effects of fertilization on forest floor vegetation in young stands of Norway spruce are largely dependent on thinning regime. Secondly, fertilization will, independently of thinning, lead to considerable changes in the vegetation, including a functional shift from dwarf-shrubs with ericoid mycorrhiza to ferns and grasses with arbuscular mycorrhiza, resulting in a functional type of vegetation that is rare in this part of the boreal forest biome. Finally, in contrast to what previously has been suggested for unfertilized forests, thinning of fertilized forests may not promote late-successional species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Finland aims to be a carbon-neutral society by the year 2050. We are interested to know on a general level how sustainable living materializes among Finnish people, what is the structure of a sustainable lifestyle in Finland and how do people reason about their everyday behavior choices in the context of sustainability in order to combat climate change. The data (n = 2052) were collected by questionnaire in April 2017. They were corrected by sex, age and residential area to be representative of the population of Finland (18-79 years old). We applied mixed methods. A principal axis factoring was conducted on the 32 variables with orthogonal rotation (varimax). Six factors explained 65.2% of the variance. The respondents were also able to write why they considered the specific variable to be important for them. We classified 2811 reasonings. According to our results, Finns have become conscious of climate change, but carbon reduction has not become mainstream in their everyday life. Circulation and preventing loss of materials show a promising start to a Finn's sustainable way of living. Recycling has been automated so that it is part of a Finn's everyday routine and habits. Finns also favor domestic food and products. They are interested in the origin of materials. Essential reasons for that are supporting the local economy and ensuring a good employment rate for the state. Smart, carbon-free mobility is a challenge. Finns seem to estimate that their personal car use is already at the proper level. On the other hand, even one fifth reported consideration of environmental effects when planning holidays.

AB  - Residential construction and land use planning are changing in many countries around the world. There is a clear need for comprehensive, energy-efficient, cost-effective and CO2-neutral concepts meeting the latest energy and climate policy goals. This opens up new opportunities for the industry. Northern Finland has strong expertise in the field of wooden architecture and wood construction industry. By combining the existing high-tech expertise of enterprises, and strengthening the cooperation between SMEs, new value networks with significant international business potential can be created. This paper presents the Life City-concept, a holistic approach for smart and sustainable built environment, which is being created in the ongoing Life City-project. The concept consists of energy-efficient and modern wooden buildings in CO2-neutral neighborhoods and includes decentralized energy infrastructure with multiple renewable energy sources and smart networks. Life City-concept is a comprehensive export concept that adapts to the local climate conditions, but also considers the social needs of different communities. Other targets of the Life City-project include enhancing the export business knowledge and technical prerequisites of the collaborating SME companies. In cooperation with the companies, the project aims to develop new design, manufacturing and construction methods that enable improving the cost-effectiveness, environmental impact, energy-economy, microclimate and other living comfort issues of wooden buildings in different climate zones, taking also the climate change and resiliency issues into account. Preliminary project results show that the wood construction industry in Finland is not quite ready for exporting holistic concepts such as the Life City-concept, as more product development, knowledge and resources for export are needed. This finding applies especially to SME companies in the industry.

AB  - We analyze and compare simulations and controlling processes of the past 60 years and possible future short-and long-term development of phosphorus and nitrogen loading from the Swedish Norrstrom drainage basin to the Baltic Sea under different inland source management scenarios. Results indicate that both point and agricultural source inputs may need to be decreased by at least 40% in order to reach a long-term sustainable 30% reduction of anthropogenic coastal nitrogen loading, as required by national environmental goals. A corresponding 20% anthropogenic phosphorus load reduction goal may be reached in the short term by analogous combined 40% source input reduction, but appears impossible to maintain as a long-term achievement by inland source abatement only. In general, realistic quantification of the slow subsurface nutrient transport and accumulation-release dynamics may be essential for accurately predicting and managing nutrient loading to surface and coastal waters.

AB  - Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio), a sedentary non-native species is colonizing the Barents Sea continental shelf and may reach a yearly landed value of NOK 7.5 billion. However, Norway has not yet established a management regime as the new stock poses several challenges, of which three are treated here. The first challenge is that non-native species threaten global biodiversity and are regulated by international law. The second challenge is that the stock spreads across a continental shelf shared between Norway and Russia, harvested outside economic zones and has the status as sedentary. The third challenge is that a large part of the future fishery is expected to take place around Svalbard, an area of highly disputed resource rights. For now no hazardous ecosystem effects have been detected and as the species is not considered to be introduced by people, the coastal states are not obliged to control it by UNCLOS or CBD. There is an agreement between the coastal states on the Loophole snow crab fishery, but as Norway has not yet established a management regime, it seems as the country is reluctant to consolidate the sovereignty the country claims to the continental shelf surrounding Svalbard.

TI  - The efficiency of Swedish regional policy
T2  - ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, I evaluate the efficiency of Swedish regional policy. I analyze the government's regional policy goals and means as presented in Government Bills 1997/1998:62 and 2001/2002:4. In the light of the literature on where growth occurs as well as the results of the regional policy so far, the realism of the government's goal of "sustainable economic growth in the whole country" could be questioned. Subsidies to companies in problematic regions have uncertain or even negative effects. The government could therefore eliminate these subsidies and replace them with venture capital loans. It could also stop its subsidies to municipal housing companies for shutting down apartments. The positive effects of the government's tax and subsidy system for the municipalities, motivated by its distribution goal, come at the price of negative effects on incentives for a high national rate of growth. The government could replace this system with extended general subsidies. Investments in transportation projects that do not show a net benefit, such as the large Bothnia Railway in northern Sweden should be reconsidered. However, I find significant and systematic evidence that the government's investments in regional colleges, particularly in research, have been successful.

AB  - Mean risk magnitude judgments expressed by French students on 90 hazardous activities are reported and compared with findings on American, Hungarian, and Norwegian samples. In many respects, rating of perceived risk in the French sample is highly comparable to rating in American subjects. American and French people tend to share the same preoccupations to the same extent. The only major differences concern hallucinatory drugs and oral contraceptives. The Norwegians and French ratings differ much more. Norwegians and French people generally have the same preoccupations (which make Norwegian ratings the best predictor of French ratings) but not to the same extent. The French are much more concerned with a whole series of activities connected to violence, the implementation of high technology or agricultural technology. However, like the Norwegians, the French are extremely concerned about the spread of hallucinogenic drugs. The Hungarian and French ratings differ on practically all instances, except on basic activities or substances in all industrialized nations (caffeine, motorcycles, ...). Differences were observed within the French sample itself. Women more than men consider that home appliances in general and large-scale public transportation are potentially dangerous. Science students more than art students tend to fear a certain number of medical techniques and a certain number of toxic substances (e.g., smoking).

AB  - The success of habitat enhancements is typically assessed by subsequent monitoring of the focal taxonomic group. However, enhancement actions are likely to affect other, non-targeted species. On a south-facing slope in the Swiss Jura mountains, a mixed-forest stand was thinned out by irregular removal cuttings to improve the habitat conditions for reptiles. We used this enhancement action as a case study to monitor changes in the macrofungal community that came along with it. During 3 years before and after forest thinning, the site was visited between six and twelve times per year. Thereby, all apparent fungal species were recorded along a ringlike transect, split into 32 transect sections. We used site-occupancy models to estimate fungal species richness and abundance. These models allow to separately estimate occurrence probability and detection probability of species, and to account for differences in detection probability, depending on habitat and season. After the forest thinning, the occurrence probabilities of ectomycorrhizal and saprobic fungi were significantly higher than before. As a result, we estimated a mean increase in overall species richness by 4.4% (median 4.3%, CI 2.1-6.8%) and an increase in abundance by 20.0% (median 19.9%, CI 14.8-25.7%). The two major habitat changes associated with forest thinning, the decrease in living wood and the increase in dead wood on most transect sections, could not explain the whole extent of the estimated increase in species richness and abundance. We believe that forest thinning may have fostered fungal species richness by creating a larger density and diversity of suitable microhabitats. With some caution, we conclude that the small-scale habitat enhancement for reptiles at the Bolberg, creating islands of open forest, did not negatively affect species richness and abundance of macrofungi, a non-targeted species group.

AB  - Globally, wind power is growing fast and in Sweden alone more than 3000 turbines have been installed since the mid-1990s. Although the number of decommissioned turbines so far is few, the high installation rate suggests that a similarly high decommissioning rate can be expected at some point in the future. If the waste material from these turbines is not handled sustainably the whole concept of wind power as a clean energy alternative is challenged. This study presents a generally applicable method and quantification based on statistics of the waste amounts from wind turbines in Sweden. The expected annual mean growth is 12% until 2026, followed by a mean increase of 41% until 2034. By then, annual waste amounts are estimated to 240,000 tonnes steel and iron (16% of currently recycled materials), 2300 tonnes aluminium (4%), 3300 tonnes copper (5%), 340 tonnes electronics (<1%) and 28,000 tonnes blade materials (barely recycled today). Three studied scenarios suggest that a well-functioning market for re-use may postpone the effects of these waste amounts until improved recycling systems are in place.

AB  - The trend towards higher speed, more frequent traffic and many traffic operators requires new strategies and solutions for efficient train traffic control and utilization of track capacity. Operative control is today focused on controlling the infrastructure. In earlier research we have shifted the control paradigm from today's technology oriented into a more traffic oriented one. This is done by real-time re-planning. The continuously updated traffic plan is normally executed by automated systems. After tests and evaluation in a simulated laboratory environment, the Swedish Rail Administration (Banverket) decided to develop and deploy an operative system to be installed at a traffic control centre. This system, called STEG, implements the main research results. Features of the new system are a dynamic planning view in form of a time-distance graph, decision support that helps the controller to identify disturbances and conflicts and automatic systems for execution of the traffic plan. The traffic controller can re-plan traffic (time aspects, track usage) via direct manipulation of the graph lines in the interface. Track maintenance and other activities can also be planned. The system automatically calculates all consequences of the changes and shows the effects on all trains within the actual time-distance space. A very careful process has been used to go from research results and prototypes to a fully operational system. The process has been very user centred and numerous iterations have been performed. Through this elaborate work, we have been able to ensure that the intentions of the prototypes have been correctly implemented in the final product.

AB  - Deterioration of unfarmed habitats resulted in a considerable decrease of biological diversity in agricultural landscapes. The most important elements of cultural landscapes determining a high level of biological diversity are woodlots and the trees themselves. This paper presents the results of a study carried out in 2000-2001 on the distribution and number of champion (heritage) trees on the area of 5480 ha of intensively managed agricultural land (Lower Silesia, south-western Poland). The fieldwork consisted in localizing and measuring all champion tree specimens on the area of 5480 ha of an agricultural fragment of Wroclaw Plain (Lower Silesia Province, SW Poland). Champion trees were found in 116 (50.1%) of all 228 surveyed sites. The overall number of champion trees in the study area was 493, belonging to 34 species. The most numerous were native species (276 specimens). The four species of cultivated trees amounted to 40% of all champion trees. The largest percentage of habitats with at least one champion tree specimen was characteristic for manor parks (100%), the lowest-for village areas (27.8%) and mid-field clumps (39.2%). A high, statistically significant correlation was found between the size of a mid-field clump and the number of champion trees it contained. The highest number of champion trees was found in water-edge hedgerows. The current occurrence of champion trees in the agricultural landscape is the result of many centuries of rural areas management. Apart from a number of exotic species of trees, introduced mainly for aesthetic reasons to the inhabited areas (villages, parks, cemeteries), many champion specimens of native trees have survived in mid-field woodlots, planted and managed in the past due to their high economic value (Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Minus laevis). The pattern of occurrence of native champion trees indicates that some of them may arrived here as a result of natural processes, such as dispersion (e.g. Crataegus monogyna and Rhamnus cathartica that occurred in mid-field clumps).

AB  - Young forest stands and clearcuts in the boreal forest created by modern forestry practices along with meadows of abandoned summer farms may contribute as feeding areas for beef cattle. The patchy distribution and varying quality and diversity of forage on such unimproved lands may affect cattle productivity. Weight gain of 336 beef cows and 270 calves free-ranging during three summer grazing seasons was monitored in boreal forests of south-eastern Norway, stocked at either high (0.16 cows ha(-1)) and low (0.04 cows ha(-1)) stocking densities. We used linear mixed effect models for assessing intrinsic correlates of weight gain in cows and calves in the two areas. Habitat use and home range size of a subsample of 53 cows were monitored by using GPS collars programmed to log locations at 5 min. intervals during the grazing season. Additional extrinsic correlates of weight gain for the subsampled cows using a linear mixed model were also tested.
   Average weight gain of beef cows grazing at the low stocking density was positive among cows of early maturing breeds (represented by Hereford) gaining 24 +/- 2.8 kg (+/- SE), while cows of late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais) had an average weight loss of 9 +/- 8.4 kg. The average weight gain was negative for beef cows of both early (Herefords) and late maturing breeds (mainly represented by Charolais but also Limousin and Simmental) at the high stocking density. Within both breed groups, there was a negative relationship between breed-specific average weight of cows at turnout and weight gain during the grazing period, while a prolonged grazing period was slightly positively related to weight gain. There was no relationship between weight gain and home range size and proportion of grazing habitat for the 53 cows fitted with GPS collars.
   Higher weight gains in calves of the low compared to the high stocking density area was found. However, there was no breed effect of weight gain in calves. Across study areas, spring-born suckler calves gained more weight than autumn-born calves (92 +/- 1.7 kg vs. 65 +/- 4.4 kg). Also, there were higher weight gains for spring-born bull-calves than spring-born heifers (100 +/- 2.4 kg vs. 94 +/- 2.2 kg).
   Overall, the results indicate that it is possible to achieve acceptable weight gains for cattle grazing coniferous forest by finding breeds suitable for these extensive areas and stocking at moderate densities.

AB  - Popular concepts in urban planning, like the 15-minute city, suggest that everyday services should be accessible to everyone within "walking distance". However, walking distance is usually considered from the perspective of the average person, and little effort is made to understand the temporal (daily and seasonal) variation in walking accessibility. If our aim is to create inclusive cities, we also need to address the realities of vulnerable population groups. In this study, we analysed how walking accessibility landscapes vary temporally and between population groups particularly focusing on the diverse realities of older people. We hypothesised that the temporal variation, especially seasonal, disproportionately influences their range of mobility options. To test this, we first recorded walking speeds in Finland's Helsinki Metropolitan Area during dry and winter season. We then created and compared accessibility landscapes between groups with different walking characteristics by integrating data on seasonal walking speeds, diurnal activity opening hours, and the (residential) locations of people. We showed that the diurnal variation has the largest effect on walking accessibility in the study area over seasonal and age-related variation when these variables are considered separately. Combined, these variations can explain reductions in accessibility that, in the worst-case scenario result in only 34% of the older population having 15-minute walking access to the closest grocery shop, compared to a baseline of 93%. However, the intragroup variation between population groups and road conditions remains large. The study highlights the importance of considering the variation in people's walking abilities, road conditions and service network when modelling walking accessibility. This is particularly important for vulnerable population groups, such as older people, who often rely on running errands on foot and may have impaired mobility. The results support spatial planners to mitigate social and spatial inequalities and help them to promote environmentally sustainable transport.

AB  - A continuous discussion of which perspectives to include and which to exclude characterises the definition of cultural heritage. After Norway's new Prison Act had been introduced in 1857, the foremost architects in the country were engaged when the decision was made to build a series of regional prisons. Today some of these former bastions of justice need to be accorded new functions. The discussion here is based on an examination of two former prisons that have been turned into cultural institutions. It is a contemporary study primarily based on observations and photographic documentation, supplemented by information from local historical literature and informal conversations (interviews). The research questions are: What processes are put into effect if buildings erected to ensure punishment are regarded as cultural heritage, and what processes of selection of relevant stories take place? Focus is put on how and why certain aspects of the past are highlighted and others are silenced, and several factors are involved here. Ignoring certain elements can be a way to protect individuals from exposure and recognition on purely ethical grounds, but it can also be a way of excluding historical events that do not correspond very well with the new cultural profile.

AB  - In the wake of global warming and ever-increasing conflicts and instabilities for controlling resources and interests hampering agricultural development, food security has been the main priority of nations. Besides, food wastage is a global issue that has become more serious. For example, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations reports that it aims to reduce global food wastage in production, retail, and supply chain. In Sweden, roughly 100,000 tons of food is wasted every year due to the date of expiry in grocery stores, according to a government report published in 2020. On the other hand, Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can streamline the control of the expiring date of food, leading to less foodwastage. Besides, disruptive technologies such as RPA are predicted to have an economic impact of nearly 6.7 trillion dollars by 2025. However, research on RPA or automation tomanage food wastage still needs to be conducted as more needs to be done. Besides, research on the benefits and challenges needs to be done, and food wastage in Sweden is a serious issue that calls for stakeholders' action. This research investigates the opportunities and challenges associated with using Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to reduce food wastage in Swedish grocery stores. Thus, we collected data from seven Swedish grocery store employees using semi-structured interviews. We applied thematic analysis to the collected data. The result shows several opportunities associated with using RPA in organizations for food wastage management in grocery stores. On the other hand, respondents fear losing jobs if RPA is implemented to manage food wastage.

AB  - The native bee fauna provides an important ecosystem function, but a large proportion of this fauna in Europe is threatened as a result of habitat loss and fragmentation. The solitary bee Andrena hattorfiana is specialised on collecting pollen from the plant-family Dipsacaceae. In northern Europe the major pollen resource is the insect-pollinated herb Knautia arvensis. We quantified the available K. arvensis resource, measured habitat characteristics and performed a flower-visitor survey in 57 well-defined K. arvensis populations in southern Sweden. There was a strong relationship between bee and plant population sizes. In populations with A. hattorfiana present (N=26), the female bees utilised on average 39% (12-80%) of the total available pollen resource. The nest architecture and nesting biology of A. hattorfiana is described for the first time. By excavating nests, we found that the provisioning for one average bee nest (containing 6 cells) required ca. 72 inflorescences or 11 plant individuals. The results suggest a certain minimum pollen amount needed to host an A. hattorfiana population. For example, for a population of ten reproducing A. hattorfiona female with the average degree of utilisation, the critical resource was predicted as 156 +/- 16 individuals (+/- SE) of the plant K. arvensis, which corresponds to 780 inflorescences or 36,731,978 pollen grains. These findings suggest that calculations via a 'pollen budget' can predict critical resources for a given size of specialised bee population, and thereby provide a tool in conservation.

AB  - The increase in length and severity of drought events predicted for South-Eastern Europe are expected to engender important changes to remaining native forests. To make informed management decisions promoting their conservation, it is important to better understand their responses to climate and environmental disturbances.
   In this study, we analyze growth responses over a network of 15 sites of Serbian spruce (Picea omorika), an endemic relict conifer species of the Balkan region - with a natural range restricted to the canyon of the Drina river at the border between Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina - that has already shown signs of decline and dieback likely induced by increasing temperature and drought.
   Tree-ring analyses spanning the common period from 1974 to 2016 have shown a strong growth reduction and highlighted an increasing negative growth response to summer drought over the last 30-40 years. The strength of the response differed among individuals and sites, where younger trees and those growing at lower altitude suffered more from drought.
   Management practices oriented at reducing drought impact, such as thinning to reduce competition for water resources and enhance survival of seedlings, together with assisted natural regeneration and migration to more suitable habitats, are recommended for the conservation of this relict species. The measures are even more necessary considering that this species is more vulnerable than others due to its weak capacity to naturally regenerate and compete.

AB  - Research has demonstrated an unwillingness among travelers to reduce their holiday flying. Recently, however, a movement with people avoiding and problematizing flying has emerged in Sweden and spread internationally. This paper explores how the rising problematization of flying changes the meanings of holiday air travel in a carbon-constrained world. Using travel magazines and digital media sources, we trace changing discourses (overarching ideas and traditions shaping social practices) of holiday air travel in Sweden from 1950-2019. The paper identifies the emergence of a new discourse (Staying on the ground) and shows how it works through moralization (flying is ethically wrong) and persuasion (emphasizing alternatives) to challenge dominant meanings of holiday air travel as desirable and necessary. While Staying on the ground is far from a dominant discourse, there are signs that it has begun to destabilize contemporary cultures of aeromobility. The Staying on the ground discourse exemplifies how meanings attached to ingrained high-carbon practices, and the policies that sustain them, are currently being contested and rearticulated. Acknowledging that low-carbon transformations are fundamentally forms of social and cultural change, the paper illustrates why practices of carbon lock-in are so entrenched, but also how they might be resisted and open up for change.

AB  - The sale of live non-native animals has become a social norm and is of global concern. The pet trade industry has become one of the main pathways where non-native small mammals are introduced worldwide. We conducted a questionnaire survey in South African pet shops from September 2018 to September 2019 to gain insights into non-native small mammalian species trade in South Africa. We also investigated whether the pet shop owners were aware of the South African National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act (NEM: BA; No. 10 of 2004), which regulates and provides management and conservation of the country's biodiversity. A total of 111 pet shop owners/managers responded to the survey, with 26.6% of the owners reporting the sale of birds, 25.1% of fish and 22.5% of mammals. A total of 16 non-native small mammalian species were reported sold, with European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), Norwegian rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice (Mus musculus) being the most commonly sold pets. We found that breeders, animal rescues and pet shops were the major suppliers of small mammal pets, and in terms of the regulation, most respondents (67.8%) were aware of NEM: BA. However, despite the knowledge of the regulations, some of the traded species pose a serious invasion threat. As a result, we recommend increased regulation, monitoring and public awareness to prevent the potential negative impacts associated with non-native mammal species in South Africa.

AB  - Habitat use of the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus in the Northeast Atlantic is poorly understood. This study aimed to identify locally utilised habitat features and create predictions of northern bottlenose whale habitat use over a wider area around the island of Jan Mayen, Norway. Bottlenose whales were sighted regularly near Jan Mayen in June 2014-2016 at higher rates than over a wider study region reported in other studies, indicating that the Jan Mayen habitat may be a hotspot of bottlenose whale presence in early boreal summer. Habitat models were created by fitting generalised additive models of selected environmental variables to sighting occurrence and additional whale sightings given a first encounter (total number of sightings - 1) recorded in June 2014-2016. Higher occurrence was estimated at steeper topography and April-average chlorophyll concentration below 0.4 mg m-3. Additional whale sightings given a first encounter were predicted to be higher at water depths (<1000 m) with steep topography, and deeper water (depths between 1300 and 2000 m) with a gentle seafloor slope. Spatial predictions largely corresponded with field observations that indicated high usage around the submarine canyon regions in the east and southeast of Jan Mayen Island. This study highlights the likely importance of steep and deep bathymetric features in shaping patterns of habitat use of this deep-diving species. Predictions of habitat use over a wider area not covered by the analysed surveys require validation; however, these data could inform conservation and management efforts to minimise spatial overlap between potential high-use areas and potentially disruptive anthropogenic activities.

AB  - While climate change and biodiversity loss have exposed humanity to major systemic risks, policymakers in more than 40 countries have proposed the transition from a fossil-based to a bio-based economy as a solution to curb the risks. In the boreal region, forests have a prominent role in contributing to bioeconomy development; however, forest-based bioeconomy transition pathways towards sustainability and the required actions have not yet been identified. Participatory backcasting was employed in this study to 'negotiate' such pathways among Finnish stakeholders by 2060 in three forest-based value networks: forest biorefineries, fibre-based packaging and wooden multistorey construction. There are many alternative pathways, ranging from incremental to more radical, to a forest-based bioeconomy within a framework of ambitious climate and biodiversity targets. Path dependence can support incremental development on bioeconomy transition pathways, and this should be considered when planning transition towards sustainability. Orchestration of the more radical changes requires actions from legislators, raw material producers, consumers and researchers, because the possibilities for business development vary between different companies and value networks. The envisioned actions between the pathways in and across the networks, such as forest diversification and diverse wood utilisation, can offer cobenefits in climate change mitigation and biodiversity protection.

AB  - A big amount of communal waste is a problem that occurs in many urban areas of the European Union. In its solution dynamic technological development in utilization and reuse of waste is a propitious factor. To make this actions fully successful - and coherent with sustainable development principle - it must be associated with increase of environmental awareness which leads to involvement of local communities in segregation and correct waste management. The article presents examples of ecological education and waste management in selected European countries: Germany, Finland, Belgium, Great Britain and Poland.

AB  - In this study, a model for measuring impacts of a tourist event from sustainability perspectives and in a common monetary metric is developed. The aim is to achieve commensurability. The proposed model is tested on a three-day music festival and the results demonstrate a possibility to produce a sustainability impact analysis in a uniform metric. Measured in monetary terms, socio-cultural impacts carry weight just as economic impacts do whereas environmental impacts have little importance for the total assessment. This illustrates how the low market value of emission rights make environmental concerns negligible from an economic perspective. Finally, issues related to scope of the assessment, commensurability and opportunity cost are discussed and possibilities for future studies are suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi form complex communities in the root systems of most plant species and are thought to be important in terrestrial ecosystem sustainability. We have reviewed the literature relating to the influence of the major forms of anthropogenic pollution on the structure and dynamics of mycorrhizal fungal communities. All forms of pollution have been reported to alter the structure of below-ground communities of mycorrhizal fungi to some degree, although the extent to which such changes will be sustained in the longer term is at present not clear. The major limitation to predicting the consequences of pollution-mediated changes in mycorrhizal fungal communities to terrestrial habitats is our limited understanding of the functional significance of mycorrhizal fungal diversity. While this is identified as a priority area for future research, it is suggested that, in the absence of such data, an understanding of pollution-mediated changes in mycorrhizal mycelial systems in soil may provide useful indicators for sustainability of mycorrhizal systems.

AB  - For many Nordic winter destinations attracting customers in the summer is a challenge. Angling is one of the summer activities that can help develop year-round tourism at a destination. Knowing which factors influence angling destination loyalty and how to manage these factors for different market segments is therefore important. We investigated how destination image, place attachment and satisfaction influenced anglers' destination loyalty through a structural equation model. Data are from a survey of 379 tourist anglers at the popular winter destination Trysil in southeast Norway. Our results show that increasing loyalty to an angling destination managers and tourism development actors can foremost influence the image and satisfaction level of anglers. This could be done through information campaigns to anglers combined with improving angling quality. On a larger area like in Trysil one should manage for diversity in regulations to avoid marginalizing certain angler groups and create conflicts.

AB  - Long-term perspectives on climate- and human-induced shifts in plant communities and tree line in mountains are often inferred from fossil pollen records. However, various factors, such as complex patterns of orographic wind fields and abundant insect-pollinated plants in higher altitudes, make pollen-based reconstruction in mountain regions difficult.
   Over the last decade the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm (LRA) - a model-based approach in reconstruction of vegetation - has been successfully applied in various parts of the globe. However, evaluation of its effectiveness in mountain ranges is still limited. The present study assesses the extent to which the LRA approach helps quantify the local changes in vegetation cover at Vicdessos valley in northern French Pyrenees as a case study. In the study area well-dated sediment cores are available from eight bogs and ponds, 6-113 m in radius, located above the current tree line. We first use a simple simulation experiment to evaluate the way how pollen records from "landscape islands" (mountain tops and plateaus) would represent local vegetation and to clarify important factors affecting the LRA-based reconstruction in a mountainous region. This study then uses pollen records from these sites and vegetation and land-cover data both within a 50-km radius around the Vicdessos valley and within a 2-km radius from each site for evaluation of the REVEALS- and LOVE-based reconstruction of the regional and local plant cover, respectively, in the LRA approach. The land-cover data are complied for coniferous trees, broadleaved trees and non-forested areas from the CORINE and historical maps in three time windows: 1960-1970, 1990-2000 and 2000-2013.
   Major findings are as follows. (1) Accuracy of the regional vegetation estimates affects the reliability of the LRA-based reconstruction of vegetation within a 2-km radius; use of the CORINE data as input to the LOVE model improves reliability of the results over the use of the REVEALS-based estimates of regional vegetation. This implies that a systematic selection of pollen data only from sites above the tree line is problematic for estimating regional vegetation, and thus the entire LRA process. (2) Selection of the dispersal models for pollen transport (i.e. the Langrangian Stochastic Model vs. Gaussian Plume Model) does not affect significantly the LRA-based estimates at both the regional and local scales in the study area. (3) The LRA approach improves the pollen-based reconstruction of local vegetation compared to pollen percentage alone in northern Pyrenees. Although further empirical and simulation studies are necessary, our results emphasize the importance of site selection for the LRA-based reconstruction of vegetation in mountain regions.

AB  - In the agricultural sector, the Law of Jante-a Scandinavian form of cultural intolerance towards standing out, being different and overachieving (akin to the Tall Poppy Syndrome and The nail that sticks out gets hammered down culture found in other countries)-may play an important role by influencing when entrepreneurship is an acceptable strategic choice to adversity. Based on a three group, between-subjects experiment of 122 Swedish university students studying agricultural and rural management, we tested whether the advice our participants gave to a fictitious farmer to pursue entrepreneurial activity depended on information regarding the farmer's motivation to pursue entrepreneurship (experimental treatments included motivation scenarios based on necessity vs. opportunity driven vs. control). Moreover, we test whether entrepreneurial advice is moderated by the participants own "Jante-ness". Unexpectedly, we found that our participants did not adapt the entrepreneurship advice they give to the situational context, nor does Jante play a moderating role; instead we found that Jante had a significant and negative main effect on the entrepreneurial advice given. This finding suggests that Jante is still very much alive and may play an important role in explaining relatively low rates of innovation and entrepreneurship in (Swedish) agriculture.

AB  - Forest social values has been put forward as an umbrella term for a new and less material relationship between people and the forested landscape, a relationship that more recently has become a policy issue. In this case study we explore how forest-related values are conceptualised in the case of Dalasjo, in Vilhelmina, Sweden, where a recent process involving determining protection for social values took place in relation to, and simultaneous with, governmental considerations regarding the application of a social values concept. By means of focus group and key informant interviews, the study demonstrates that forest social values are not only about forest per se, or even the physical and user values per se. Further, the diverse but still general understanding of forest social values on a policy level is demonstrated. This stands in contrast to the specific and place-based understanding of the local community, emanating from both individual and collective experiences. Thus, it is concluded that a policy use of social values terms, which may be difficult to identify from the outside, makes the definition of values in specific land use conflicts more complex rather than offering a possibility to immediately provide clear basis for planning tools.

AB  - A growing number of countries are putting transboundary climate risks on their national adaptation policy agenda. The designation of subnational governments as key actors in climate change adaptation policy appears to be appropriate when the risks associated with climate change are defined as "local." In this study we have investigated whether local authorities can plausibly play an equally central role when it comes to transboundary climate risks. Three cases have been studied: Paris in France and the topic of migration and integration, Klepp in Norway and the topic of agriculture and livestock production, and the river harbors in the Upper Rhine region of France and the topic of freight transportation and river regulation. Even if the sub-national actors involved in the three cases showed strong interest in analyzing and addressing transboundary climate risks, it remains an open question whether such authorities can and should play an equally central role in addressing transboundary climate risks as they do in the case of local climate risks. On the other hand, assigning responsibility for managing transboundary climate risks exclusively to national authorities may increase the risk of conflicts between measures to reduce local climate risks (frequently developed and implemented by sub-national authorities) and transboundary climate risks. The authors of this paper therefore advocate a strong partnership between the different levels of governance, and between public and private-sector stakeholders, in adaptation to transboundary climate risk. It is therefore crucial that national governments explicitly account for transboundary climate risks in their national adaptation agendas and, as part of their process in determining "ownership" of such risks, decide on the role sub-national authorities should play. This choice will also affect the role of local authorities in managing local climate risks due to the interlinkages between them.

AB  - This paper examines how anthropogenic threats, such as disturbance, pollution and climate change, are linked to polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population biology in the Svalbard and Barents Sea area, with the aim to increase our understanding of how human activity may impact the population. Over-harvesting drastically reduced the population of polar bears in the Barents Sea region from about 1870 to 1970. After harvesting was stopped-in 1956 in Russia and 1973 in Norway-the population grew to an estimated 2650 individuals (95% confidence interval 1900-3600) in 2004, and maternity denning in the Svalbard Archipelago became more widely distributed. During recent decades, the population has faced challenges from a variety of new anthropogenic impacts: a range of pollutants, an increasing level of human presence and activity as well as changes in ice conditions. Contaminants bioaccumulate up through the marine food web, culminating in this top predator that consumes ringed, bearded and harp seals. Females with small cubs use land-fast sea ice for hunting and are therefore vulnerable to disturbance by snowmobile drivers. Sea-ice diminution, associated with climate change, reduces polar bears' access to denning areas and could negatively affect the survival of cubs. There are clear linkages between population biology and current anthropogenic threats, and we suggest that future research and management should focus on and take into consideration the combined effects of several stressors on polar bears.

AB  - An increase in train traffic is a politically welcomed trend, which on the other hand has led to too high capacity utilisation at times and a railway network sensitive to disturbances. Delays are easily spread, causing high cost. A mean of controlling the secondary delays is to use efficient operational prioritisation rules for trains in conflict. This paper presents an evaluation of the current Swedish prioritisation rule. For two frequent conflict situations the associated cost related to applying the rule is calculated. The result indicates a poor economic efficiency and show that significant savings can be achieved by changing strategy. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CP  - 3rd World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering, Architecture, Urban Planning Symposium (WMCAUS)
AB  - The first attempts to create eco-neighbourhoods date back to 1960's. First they were developed in northern Europe - Denmark and Sweden, but the concept was gradually spreading to other countries including Holland, England, Germany, France, etc... The French National program of eco-neighbourhood certification EcoQuartier was initiated in 2012. So far over fifty projects were awarded the certificate and many more are already engaged in the program. Although, there is some criticism, the program is regarded as a real-life laboratory which tests new sustainable solutions and offers additional educational value. The concept of eco-neighbourhoods is relatively new in Poland. New neighbourhoods are being constructed without officially using the term of eco-neighbourhoods. It is an interesting question to compare the new neighbourhoods build in Poland with eco-neighbourhoods in France, certified as EcoQuartier's, and determine the challenges and obstacles for Polish neighbourhoods to become eco-neighbourhoods. The Assessment list and guidelines developed by French Government and used to evaluate and certify the projects in EcoQuartier program will be used as a reference. The challenges identified include: universal accessibility, access to public green space, mixed-use development, sustainable management of water and soil, energy saving, urban design and cultural environment, architectural quality, economic environment, social capital (e.g. different age groups), risk management, climate change adaptation and protection of biodiversity. Some of the challenges can be overcome with help from the local government. This study, in author's opinion, may be used to start a discussion about implementation of standardized national certification program for eco-neighbourhoods in Poland and maybe in other Eastern European Countries.

AB  - In recent years, ideas related to digitalization have gained significance on the contemporary transport policy agenda. Based on discourse analysis of the digitalization agenda in Swedish transport policy, this paper investigates the ongoing formative phase of the emerging policy and planning area of digitalization and smart mobility. It examines and critically discusses the current discursive framing of digitalization in current transport policy and planning, and considers perspectives and meanings related to "smart" mobility and accessibility that are being established in strategic plans and policies for the Swedish transport sector. The empirical focus is on transport strategies and official reports developed at national level. The main findings indicate that digitalization is being framed as a rapid, unstoppable transformation process, which will lead to a range of positive outcomes such as reduced climate emissions, less congestion, improved accessibility, and a smoother and more resource-efficient transport system. According to the ideas and assumptions promoted in the current discourse, this transformation can only occur through stronger involvement of business enterprises. This governing strategy, or lack of governing strategy, makes it unclear how transport policy objectives are balanced against market and innovation interests. It also risks delegating the transition to sustainable mobility to less formalized and less transparent policy arenas that operate in parallel to, and partly outside, established planning and strategy-making processes.

AB  - Today, roughly 25 per cent of the Swedish population have their immediate roots in a foreign country. In the largest metropolitan area of Sweden, Greater Stockholm, the figure is 33 per cent, and it is even larger in the two other major cities, Gothenburg (35%) and Malmo (44%). This remarkable demographic shift is necessarily influencing the religious landscape. While one major part of the immigration to Sweden is Muslim, the greater number of the immigrants are of a Christian background. Among these, Orthodox and Catholic immigrants from the Middle East have attracted greater attention, while immigrants with a Pentecostal Charismatic affiliation have often been overlooked. This is unwarranted, because the Pentecostal-Charismatic migrants churches are growing rapidly, both in number and in adherents. This is especially the case in Greater Stockholm. Based on original surveys by the author, this article explores migrant Pentecostal churches in Greater Stockholm, presenting their numerical growth, discussing their ethnic and cultural backgrounds as well as their theological orientation, and presenting an analysis of their sociological character in relation to their geographical location. This survey calls into question the stereotypes of Sweden as the epitome of secularization and of its urban centres being "tombs for religion".

T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Partnership relations have become more important in promotion of urban economic development. Efforts have been made to create such networks by which to strive for new markets or political arenas and so to extend the resource base of the urban region. The objective in the creation of networks is the most efficient mobilization possible of the know-how and resources in the urban region and external to it. These observations inevitably prompt the following questions: How can the quality of cooperative processes be improved and how can networks and various development projects be managed? It seems evident that information and its conscious management play a crucial role in seeking answers to these questions. Simultaneously such questions emerge as to how network management can respond to the increasing amount of information and the demands for rapid learning. How can the vast flood of information and knowledge in the networks be managed, how can essential features be extracted, i.e. how can a sustainable basis for perceptions be created? One possible answer, among others, to these questions is information systems utilizing modern information technology. This paper focuses on urban development networks and especially at how their efficiency can be promoted by network management and by modern information systems. The case described and tentatively analysed is the information system CityWeb of Tampere urban region, Finland.

To support the sector's green transition, it is critical to bridge existing green skills gaps. Therefore, this qualitative research identifies the relevant and up-to-date green skills necessary when working in the tourism sector for the sector to become committed to a more sustainable world. The main data consisted of both secondary and primary (individual interviews, n=11 and a group interview) data sources. Five themes describing the green skills emerged from the data: (1) environmental management, (2) resource-efficiency, (3) carbon management, (4) green product and service development, and (5) sustainability communication. The findings have important practical implications for tourism education and training providers and tourism employers.

AB  - Formation of professional identity is a process where individuals attempt to bring together the social expectations set for them as professionals and their own interests and values. The cultural landscape of engineering is masculine in various ways, which can be challenging especially for female engineers who need to match the cultural expectations with their personal identities. So far, few studies have compared the professional identities of early-career men and women engineers. This study aims to understand the professional identities of newly graduated Finnish male and female engineers by analysing their perceptions of the importance and development of professional engineering skills. An analysis of cross-sectional survey data of more than 4000 early-career engineers suggests some gender differences related to professional identities and indicates that the observed differences in values and perceived skills can put women at a greater risk of dropping out of an engineering career.

AB  - The influence of nutrient availability on the spread of the European ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in predominantly oak forests (Quercus petraea, Quercus robur) have been evaluated in forests of Cesky kras, Ceske stredohori (both in the Czech Republic), southern Sweden and southwestern Slovenia. Ash has dispersed in ecosystems with lower availability of P as well as in ecosystem with lower availability of N. Decomposition of organic material formed in the forest ecosystem (and formerly removed by human forest management-coppicing, grazing, litter raking, etc.) constitutes a much more important source of enrichment of the ecosystem in N compared with anthropogenic deposition. Furthermore, the greater availability of N and P in soils that are well supplied with exchangeable cations does not provide an adequate explanation for the spread of ashes. On the other hand, stage of succession is an important factor. Therefore, the spread of ash in ageing oak-dominated forests appears to be a natural process. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study sheds light on a new generation of Swedish food producers, market gardeners, who are attracting attention in terms of food system sustainability, prompted by increasing consumer awareness about the value of healthy and locally produced food. Market gardening is part of a global agroecological movement opposed to industrialized agriculture and its negative impacts on the environment and rural communities. These food producers challenge the incumbent agri-food regime through the building of alternative food networks. This case-based study involving 14 young vegetable producers showed that young people who engage in market gardening are strongly motivated by dual incentives, namely entrepreneurship and transformation to sustainability. Six main competences were identified as important for market gardeners: practical skills related to growing vegetables, business management, innovation and continuous learning, systems thinking, pioneering, and networking. Individuals develop their skills through continuous experiential learning and gain knowledge through peer-to-peer learning using social media.

AB  - The research investigates the problems and maps the solutions to the serious threat that plastics pose to the oceans, food safety, and human health, with more than eight million tons of plastic debris dumped in the sea every year. The aim of this study is to explore how to better improve the regulatory process of ocean plastics by integrating scientific results, regulatory strategies and action plans so as to limit the impact of plastics at sea. Adopting a problem-solving approach and identifying four areas of intervention enable the establishment of a regulatory framework from a multi-actor, multi-issue, and multi-level perspective. The research methodology consists of a two-pronged approach: 1. An analysis of the state-of-the-art definition of plastics, micro-, and nanoplastics (respectively, MPs and NPs), and 2. The identification and discussion of loopholes in the current regulation, suggesting key actions to be taken at a global, regional and national level. In particular, the study proposes a systemic integration of scientific and regulatory advancements towards the construction of an interconnected multi-tiered (MT) plastic governance framework. The milestones reached by the project SECURE at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway provide evidence of the strength of the theory of integration and rights-based approaches. The suggested model holds substantial significance for the fields of environmental protection, food security, food safety, and human health. This proposed MT plastic governance framework allows for the holistic and effective organization of complex information and scenarios concerning plastics regulation. Containing a clear definition of plastics, grounded on the precautionary principle, the MT plastic framework should provide detailed mitigation measures, with a clear indication of rights and duties, and in coordination with an effective reparatory justice system.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for analyzing the effect of policies focused at reducing pollution from agriculture. Such a methodology must take into account that agricultural pollution is an effect of a large set of interacting processes, covers many different substances, and may vary substantially due to shifts in natural and economic conditions. Thus, the methodology must both cover the specificities of the different processes/disciplines involved and foster integration across these in a consistent way. The basic challenge is to cover the non-linear fine-scale variations at different levels of land-based production systems. Our methodology is founded on the idea of partitioning. It implies structuring and simplifying existing variation in space and time into partitions that are considered homogeneous. These partitions are organized in a hierarchy, and the different processes involved are modeled at the relevant level. We have concluded that analyses with fairly high level of resolution are preferable. This way it is also possible to combine a systems perspective with disciplinary integrity. A modeling structure - ECECNIOD (2.0) - based on the developed principles is documented. The paper also shows the ability of this structure to simulate choice of farming practices and emissions that are well in accordance with observations from four Norwegian regions with very different agricultural and natural conditions.

AB  - Due to strict protection through the last decades, wolves have returned to many areas from which they have been absent for a long time. This is a conservation success story, but the wolves also cause conflicts wherever they arrive. We have studied the situation in southeastern Norway and in the French Alps, where the conflict patterns are similar. Diverging interpretations of the situation are supported by narratives, and two varieties have become increasingly significant in both countries. Rumors about the secret reintroduction of wolves are common among wolf adversaries. Another narrative, important to the pro-wolf camp, is based on the notion that particular sheep husbandry practices (unattended rough grazing) are unique to either Norway or France-whereas there are in fact more similarities than differences. Yet, while the reintroduction-conspiracy rumors are ridiculed, the notion of unique national conflict patterns has achieved a status almost of official truth. Furthermore, the story about natural wolf recovery is itself a value-laden narrative, and not only "scientific fact." The different status of these narratives tell us something about power relations: Given their different social basis, it seems relevant to consider the national uniqueness image and the natural recovery theory as tightly inter-woven with symbolic power and the reintroduction conspiracy rumors as similarly inter-woven with patterns of cultural resistance.

AB  - The sustainable use of resources requires that management practices and institutions take into account the dynamics of the ecosystem. In this paper, we explore the role of local ecological knowledge and show how it is used in management practices by a local fishing association in a contemporary rural Swedish community. We focus on the local management of crapfish, a common-pool resource, and also address the way crapfish management is linked to institutions at different levels of Swedish society, Methods from the social sciences were used for information gathering, and the results were analyzed within the framework of esosystem management. We found that the practices of local fishing association resemble an ecosystem approach to crayfish management. Our results indicate that local users have substantial knowledge of resource and ecosystem dynamics from the level of the individual crayfish to that of the watershed, as reflected in a variety of interrelated management practices embedded in and influenced by institutions at several levels. We propose that this policy of monitoring at several levels simultaneously, together with the interpretation of a bundle of indicators and associated management responses, enhances the possibility of building ecological resilience into the watershed. Furthermore, we found that flexibility and adaptation are required to avoid command-and-control pathways of resource management. We were able to trace the development of the local fishing association as a response to crisis, followed by the creation of an opportunity for reorganization and the recognition of slow ecosystem structuring variables, and also to define the role of knowledgeable individuals in the whole process. We discuss the key roles of adaptive capacity, institutional learning, and institutional memory for successful ecosystem management and conclude that scientific adaptive management could benefit from a more explicit collaboration with flexible community-based systems of resource management for the implementation of policies as experiments.

AB  - The practice of large phosphorus (P) additions to agricultural land has resulted in an increased depletion of limited mineable rock phosphate resources, P accumulation in soils with an increased risk for P losses, and intensified eutrophication and deterioration of water quality in recipient water bodies. A number of measures have been used to reach balance between P inputs and outputs in agricultural systems, with the goal of achieving improved P use efficiency, sustained high crop yields and reduced P losses. This paper discusses how this goal may be achieved. Results from a Swedish long-term fertility experiment combined with results of a P leaching study using a selection of soils from the fertility experiment are used to evaluate the effects of a balanced P system on yields, soil P levels and P leaching. Three P fertilizer application strategies are compared (zero P, replacement P, and a treatment where surplus P fertilization was used to achieve a rapid increase in the soil P status). The replacement P strategy appeared to be the most sustainable system but P fixation in this system must be accounted for. When surplus P rates were applied, increased crop yields were counterbalanced by poorer use efficiency and P accumulation in soil. Topsoil P content was a poor predictor of P leaching. Instead, balancing P inputs and outputs represents a first step in the management of P losses, but additional, site-specific measures are required to counteract site-specific factors responsible for P losses.

AB  - I investigate the field of tension between the national and the local level in spatial planning from a decision-making perspective. In doing so, I analyse the legal regulation for a large-scale 3G mobile infrastructure development in Sweden with a focus on how participation is expressed both in terms of the 'law in books' as well as empirically, 'in action'. Theoretically, a model of decision making is elaborated, based on two axes: one concerning the decision level on a central or national to local scale, and one concerning what type of knowledge is regarded as the most legitimate in terms of a calculating approach versus a communicative approach. These two issues or approaches to decision making-who decides and based on what knowledge-are of direct importance for understanding the frameworks as well as the practical outcomes of public participation. The case of 3G in Sweden demonstrates how different types of knowledge are perceived as legitimate at different levels in the planning system. For example, appeals against building permits rarely change the outcome of permits issued, and appeals based on fear of electromagnetic radiation are always rejected. The juridification of a given mast conflict meant a development from a deliberative approach, where any concern is heard, to a calculating and expert-based one, where the general stance on a particular topic (such as whether or not the electromagnetic radiation from mobile masts is hazardous) is applied. This means that what knowledge is legitimate depends on where in the permit process it is presented.

AB  - The paper examines the relationship between culture and safety on offshore supply vessels in the Norwegian petroleum industry, relying on both qualitative and quantitative data. The analysis makes a general description of cultural traits of the vessels studied, epitomized through the notion of 'good seamanship', and discusses the way these traits influence on safety. The results show a great deal of friction between aspects of culture and aspects of structure. In particular, there appear to be incompatibilities between the occupational culture on the vessels and the rule-based safety management approaches of the petroleum industry. Also, the results highlight the role of inter-group asymmetries in power and status in the definition of what constitutes safe working conditions. Finally, whether culture can (and should) be changed is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conservation and sustainable management of aquatic ecosystems is a priority in environmental programs worldwide. However, these aims are highly dependent on the efficiency, accuracy and cost of existent methods for the detection of keystone species and monitoring of biological communities. Rapid advances in eDNA, barcoding and metabarcoding promoted by high-throughput sequencing technologies are generating millions of sequences in a fast way, with a promising cost reduction, and overcoming some difficulties of the traditional taxonomic approaches. This paper provides an updated broad perspective of the current developments in this dynamic field presented in the special session (SS) "The use of molecular tools in ecological and biodiversity assessment of aquatic ecosystems" of the XIX Congress of the Iberian Association of Limnology (AIL2018), held in Coimbra, Portugal.
   Developments presented are mainly focused on the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal and Spain, including Atlantic Macaronesian islands) but include studies in France, Germany, Finland, Russia (Siberia) and South America. The networks within which these researchers are involved are yet even broader, profiting from existing molecular facilities, and traditional taxonomic expertise, which can be viewed as a characteristic of this new research area. It was evident in the SS that the use of molecular tools is widespread, being used to study a diversity of aquatic systems, from rivers' headwaters to estuaries and coastal lagoons, and volcanic, mountain and frozen lakes to hot springs. The organisms targeted are likewise varied and include fish, macroinvertebrates, meiofauna, microalgae such as diatoms and dinoflagellates, other protists, fungi, and bacteria (cyanobacteria and other). Some studies address the whole biodiversity (i.e., all species present independently of the taxonomic group) from environmental samples of water, biofilms and preservative solution from field samples (e.g., ethanol from macroinvertebrate samples). Great advances were acknowledged in the special session, namely in the use of metabarcoding for detecting hidden biodiversity, juvenile stages, low-abundance species, non-indigenous species and toxicity potential, and ultimately for ecological monitoring of diatoms and invertebrates. Yet, several drawbacks were highlighted and need further work, which include: taxonomic gaps in the reference databases (including gaps at species level and on intraspecific variability) or absence of public databases (e.g. for meiofauna), still high sequencing costs, the need of a substantial bioinformatics effort, difficulties in establishing the amount of environmental sample necessary for a good DNA extraction and the need for testing different genetic markers to obtain accurate results.

AB  - Since Finland joined the European Union (EU) in 1995, the European Commission has shown growing impatience with how EU rules with respect to protection of wolves and other large carnivores have been enforced within Finland. In 2005 the Commission referred the matter to the European Court of Justice, which subsequently found Finland deficient in the strict protection of wolves. We investigate the reasons underlying the court case. We identify two problems in the realm of 'reason giving'. The first problem arises from the lack of a causal model linking decentralized actions on the part of the subjects of administrative rules with the desired outcomes imagined by the centralized entities issuing the new administrative rulings. The second problem arises from the authoritarian tendencies of the EU that fail to understand the context of wolves for rural livelihoods in Finland. Both of these problems give rise to surprising practical effects emerging from the 'harmonization game'. We introduce the concept of 'instrumentality' with respect to the goal of sustainable wolf populations. We also introduce the concept of 'inverse high-grading' of wolves under the umbrella of biodiversity protection. The EU and the people of rural Finland will continue to struggle over wolves until a more coherent policy goal, and a more defensible administrative rule structure, can be formulated.

AB  - During my doctoral defense at the University of Eastern Finland on January 27(th), 2023, I introduced my doctoral research with the present lectio praecursoria. This lectio delves into the plurality of experiences, values and knowledge interwoven in the development of community forestry in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca, Mexico. In the last 40 years, Mexico has promoted community forestry as an alternative to forest management directed by the central government or private companies. As an alternative, community forestry is based on social justice and environmental sustainability principles, aiming for communities to use forests for social and economic development while conserving them. The research examines how forest communities have created their paths to achieve these objectives, like creating community forestry companies for wood and non-wood forest products. Based on ethnographic methods and documental analysis in the Sierra Sur of Oaxaca state, the research investigated the challenges, paradoxes and changes forest dwellers face when managing and working in their community forestry companies while conserving their forests. Furthermore, this study contributes to understanding how different environmental governing rationalities intersect when 1) socio-territorial conflicts arise, 2) women's access to productive labor is encouraged, and 3) the plural values of the forest are adapted. The lecture addresses one of the critical inquiries of this research: how various environmental governing rationalities intertwine in community forestry to shape and regulate people's behavior and interactions with forests.

AB  - Extended-exergy analysis (EEA) for Chinese society was carried out in this paper to present a benchmarking case for future comparative studies in social systems ecology based on exergetic biophysics. For the EEA as an extension of labor theory of value and a possible sustainability metric, exergetic values were assigned to the production factors including labor, capital and environmental remediation costs. Also, the conversion coefficient of households sector was evaluated with the consideration of working g hours, which significantly supplements the traditional energy and exergy accounting. The Chinese societal system was classified into seven sectors including the extraction, conversion, agriculture, industry, transportation, tertiary and households. The calculations of capital exergy and labor exergy were modified according to the special social-economic situation of China. A detailed accounting for the total societal extended-exergy use of China 2005 was conducted. Meanwhile, comparison of the net input exergy resources, extended-exergy capital, and labor of the total Chinese society during 2000-2005 was made to reveal the temporal changes using EEA. Finally, the EEA performances of China were compared with those of Norway, UK, Italy and the province of Siena to present solid foundation for energy strategy and identification of sustainable development mode.

AB  - Payment tariffs for logging truck transport in Nordic countries are typically based on the loaded transport distance. Local tariffs often provide a good representation of the mean cost, however, as variation in topography and the transport environment increases; loaded distance alone represents the actual cost poorly. In addition, routes with increasing curvature also constitute more frequent braking and acceleration cycles. Moreover, driving in such topographical environments during the winter raises additional safety and operator stress issues. This study examines the situation in Norway where logging truck routes often start in mountainous regions. It tests the applicability of a route-generation system developed in Sweden and determines if it can be adopted in Norway. The case study is based on 30 detailed routes from each country, reported and analyzed by their respective transport managers. Based on typical local tariffs, the results show the route-specific variation in costs and profit margins associated with the varying transport environments. A framework for classifying transport environments is proposed as a basis for tariff agreements that better represent the actual transport cost. This increases fairness and supports economic sustainability for transporters.
   Study Implications: The proposed route-specific cost computation approach can be used by managers to develop more equitable tariff systems between transporters and transport service buyers. In addition, it can be used to provide route selections that are more easily handled in fully automated systems. This has been done in Sweden and has now been tested in Norway. This provides a first step for other countries and regions to follow suit. Lastly, the proposed approach enables a more equitable service payment for all parties, providing transporters with a better balance between revenues and costs.

AB  - Climate warming is expected to induce soil organic carbon losses in mountain soils that result, in turn, in reduced soil fertility, reduced water storage capacity and positive feedback on climate change. Here we combine two independent sets of measurements of soil organic carbon from forest soils in the German Alps-repeated measurements from 1976 to 2010 and from 1987 to 2011-to show that warming has caused a 14% decline in topsoil organic carbon stocks. The decreases in soil carbon occurred over a period of significant increases in six-month summer temperatures, with the most substantial decreases occurring at sites with large changes in mean annual temperature. Organic carbon stock decreases were largest-on average 32%-in forest soils with initial topsoil organic carbon stocks greater than 8 kg Cm 2, which can be found predominantly on calcareous bedrock. However, organic carbon stocks of forest soils with lower initial carbon stocks, as well as soils under pasture or at elevations above 1,150 m, have not changed significantly. We conclude that warming is the most likely reason for the observed losses of soil organic carbon, but that site, land use and elevation may ameliorate the effects of climate change.

AB  - The isotopic composition of Pb was determined in Finnish peat bogs and their porewaters from Harjavalta (HAR, near a Cu-Ni smelter), Outokumpu (OUT, near a Cu-Ni mine), and Hietajarvi (HIJ, a background site). At HIJ and OUT, the porewaters yielded similar concentrations (0.1-0.7 mu g/L) and isotopic composition (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.154-1.164). In contrast, the peat profile from HAR yielded greater concentrations of Pb in the porewaters (average 2.4 mu g/L), and the Pb is less radiogenic (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.121-1.149). Acidification of the bog surface waters to pH 3.5 by SO2 emitted from smelting (compared to pH 4.0 at the control site) apparently promotes the dissolution of Pb-bearing aerosols, as well as desorption of metals from the surfaces of these particles and from the peat matrix. Despite this, the chronology of anthropogenic, atmospheric deposition for the past millenium recorded by the isotopic composition of Pb in all three peat bogs is remarkably similar. While the immobility of Pb in the peat cores may appear inconsistent with the elevated porewater Pb concentrations, Pb concentrations in the aqueous phase never amount to more than 0.01% of the total Pb at any given depth so that the potential for migration remains small. The low rates of vertical water movement in bogs generally combined with the size of the metal-containing particles in solution may be additional factors limiting Pb mobilization.

AB  - This article explores how the multiplication of labour migration categories relies upon strategic territorialisations of borders to differentiate between workers' nationalities, worksites, and skills in Finland. We argue that for certain categories of workers, migration policies encourage workers to become mobile in ways that make them more precarious. We analyse worksites that show the different ways that labour is made mobile: the internationalization of higher education; Finnair's labour outsourcing and offshoring practices; and the recruitment of forest berry-pickers from Thailand. We first trace contentious migration politics in Finland, revealing conflicts over labour protections, universal labour rights, the state's obligations to create employment, economic competitiveness, national identity, and the precarisation of work. We show how practices of legal, procedural, and spatial differentiation particularise the conditions of work and argue that, even for skilled workers, the strategic territorialisation of borders works to differentiate between workers and work sites. This differentiation works to make labour mobile in multiple ways and, due to the selective territorialisation of labour protections, the political geographies of migration in Finland tend towards the precarisation of labour for skilled and unskilled workers alike.

AB  - The local development and forest history have been studied based on pollen, plant macrofossil, stomata and charcoal analysis from a small forest hollow situated within an old-growth, closed Picea abies forest, rich in epiphytic lichens and wood-decaying fungi in southeastern Norway. The main aims of this study are to identify the natural development, the disturbance history and the role of human impact of this forest stand during the last 9650 years. Forest trees have always been dominant in the landscape around the forest hollow. The forest was first dominated by Betula and Pinus sylvestris, and later these were co-dominant with thermophilous deciduous trees such as Corylus, Fagus, Fraxinus excelsior, Quercus, Tilia cordata and Ulmus. During the last 1000 years, Picea abies (spruce) has become the dominant tree in this area, but its presence can be traced back about 9300 years. The establishment of spruce caused a major shift in the ecosystem. Human impact and fire seem to have been the driving factors to create openings for spruce to establish. Based on estimates of palynological richness, the most diverse pollen assemblages are found in periods with intermediate levels of disturbance.

AB  - Urban areas are often seen as central sites for sustainability transformations, and in many parts of the world, cities are striving to be recognised for their sustainability initiatives. An example of a new urban district with a sustainability profile is Rosendal, in Uppsala, Sweden. Based on semi-structured interviews supported by participant-generated photographs, I let the everyday practices residents of this district associate with sustainability be the starting point for studying the different ways in which they understand and enact (un)sustainability. My analysis builds upon a practice theoretical framework, viewing practice as mundane, routinised behaviour shaped by 'materials', 'competences' and 'meanings'. By focussing on a set of practices brought forth by the interview participants, namely, growing vegetables, showering and cycling, I pay specific attention to the different roles of materials and how these are co-constitutive of the sociomaterial practices of which they form part. Based on the analysis, I contend that the sociomaterial urban assemblage enables and restricts what comes to count as sustainable, as well as which (un)sustainable practices are performed in everyday life. Further, the ability to think of alternative ways of enacting sustainability in everyday life is both enabled and restricted by present practices due to the situated nature of imagination. If urban districts are to play a central role in sustainability transformations, I argue that living environments should be planned in ways so that new ideas and practices for enacting sustainability may emerge.

AB  - Research projects combining different disciplines are increasingly common and sought after by funding agencies looking for ways to achieve environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Creating and running a truly integrated research project that combines very different disciplines is, however, no easy task. Large-scale efforts to create interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary research efforts have reported on their experiences in trying to achieve this goal. This article shares the methods, challenges and achievements experienced by a smaller group of researchers who have developed an interdisciplinary approach based on former results of Norwegian and Chilean experiments. The project A Cross-disciplinary Integrated Eco-system Eutrophication Research and Management Approach (CINTERA), funded by the Research Council of Norway (RCN, project 216607), brings together the fields of political science, economics, marine biology/oceanography and marine bio-geo-chemistry to improve the understanding of marine eutrophication and its possible socio-economic impacts. CINTERA is a multidisciplinary project that evolved into an interdisciplinary project and in so doing, transformed the attitudes of participants. The transformative process was generated particularly by the need to work closely together in making the CINTERA project useful for policy-makers.

AB  - Urban Living Labs (ULL) are considered spaces to facilitate experimentation about sustainability solutions. ULL represent sites that allow different urban actors to design, test and learn from socio-technical innovations. However, despite their recent proliferation in the European policy sphere, the underlying processes through which ULL might be able to generate and diffuse new socio-technical configurations beyond their immediate boundaries have been largely disregarded and it remains to be examined how they contribute to urban sustainability transitions. With this study, we contribute to a better understanding of the diffusion mechanisms and strategies through which ULL (seek to) create a wider impact using the conceptual lens of transition studies. The mechanisms of diffusion are investigated in four distinct ULL in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and Malmo, Sweden. The empirical results indicate six specific strategies that aim to support the diffusion of innovations and know-how developed within ULL to a broader context: transformative place-making, activating network partners, replication of lab structure, education and training, stimulating entrepreneurial growth and narratives of impact.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the concept of social acceleration by examining how cities are trying to speed up, maintain or slow down the pace of societal change. Through studies of cycle logistics policies and actions in cities in Denmark, Norway, the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany, we show how these balance between acting as pace-makers and pace-takers, as well as what the consequences of this balancing act are for enacting cycle logistics. By using acceleration as an overall theoretical concept, we show how transport planners, mobility policy advisors, and digitalization and innovation strategists understand and position themselves when setting the pace for cycle logistics as part of a broader transition toward sustainable transport. We conclude by discussing the implications of this for the general understanding of acceleration in transformations to urban sustainability.

AB  - The unsustainable settlement and high industrialization around the catchment of the Baltic Sea has left records of anthropogenic heavy metal contamination in Baltic Sea sediments. Here, we show that sediments record post-industrial and anthropogenic loads of Cd, Zn, and Pb over a large spatial scale in the Baltic Sea. We also demonstrate that there is a control on the accumulation of these metals in relation to oxic/anoxic conditions of bottom waters. The total concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb were obtained with the near-total digestion method in thirteen cores collected from the Bothnian Bay, the Bothnian Sea, and the west and central Baltic Proper. The lowest average concentrations of Cd, Zn, and Pb were observed in Bothnian Bay (0.4, 125, 40.2 mg kg(-1)DW, respectively). In contrast, the highest concentrations were observed in the west Baltic Proper (5.5, 435, and 56.6 mg kg(-1)DW, respectively). The results indicate an increasing trend for Cd, Zn, and Pb from the early nineteenth century until the 1970s, followed by a decrease until 2000-2008. However, surface sediments still have concentrations above the pre-industrial values suggested by the Swedish EPA (Cd is 0.2, Zn is 85, and Pb is 31 mg kg(-1)DW). The results also show that the pre-industrial Cd, Zn, and Pb concentrations obtained from 3 cores with ages < 1500 B.C. were 1.8, 1.7, and 1.2 times higher, respectively, than the pre-industrial values suggested by the Swedish EPA. To conclude, accumulations of metals in the Baltic Sea are governed by anthropogenic load and the redox conditions of the environment. The significance of correct environmental governance (measures) can be illustrated with the reduction in the pollution of Pb, Zn, and Cd within the Baltic Sea since the 1980s.

AB  - This paper outlines a unique case of the development of strategies to reduce ventilation and heating costs in Konsuln iron ore mine in northern Sweden. The mine, located just south of Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag's Kiruna iron ore mine, was developed as a test mine 2018-2020 for the Sustainable Underground Mining (SUM) project. Besides functioning as a test mine, Konsuln also contributes ore production. The existing mine ventilation system was designed for the current production rate of 0.8 million tons per annum (Mtpa). There is a plan to increase this rate to between 1.8 and 3 Mtpa in the future, and this requires the primary fans to be upgraded. Therefore, a study was carried out to determine whether using ventilation on demand (VOD) could avoid this fan upgrade and reduce Konsuln's ventilation and heating power costs in the future. The study also investigated whether using battery electric vehicles (BEVs) along with VOD or as a standalone strategy could further reduce these power costs. In addition, the study analyzed the suitability of heating power reduction strategies presently or previously used in the Nordic countries and Canada to investigate potential additional strategies to reduce the heating power cost, the largest portion of Konsuln's ventilation and heating power costs. The study found using VOD can avoid the expensive upgrading of the existing primary fans and reduce Konsuln's ventilation and heating power costs in the future. Using BEVs can further reduce these costs. Finally, none of the Nordic and Canadian heating power reduction strategies is suitable for Konsuln because they require unique conditions that do not exist in Konsuln.

AB  - Anthropogenic warming is caused mainly by emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, with agriculture as a main contributor for the latter 2 gases. Other parts of the food system contribute carbon dioxide emissions that emanate from the use of fossil fuels in transportation, processing, retailing, storage, and preparation. Food items differ substantially when GHG emissions are calculated from farm to table. A recent study of approximate to 20 items sold in Sweden showed a span of 0.4 to 30 kg CO(2) equivalents/kg edible product. For protein-rich food, such as legumes, meat, fish, cheese, and eggs, the difference is a factor of 30 with the lowest emissions per kilogram for legumes, poultry, and eggs and the highest for beef, cheese, and pork. Large emissions for ruminants are explained mainly by methane emissions from enteric fermentation. For vegetables and fruits, emissions usually are <= 2.5 kg CO(2) equivalents/kg product, even if there is a high degree of processing and substantial transportation. Products transported by plane are an exception because emissions may be as large as for certain meats. Emissions from foods rich in carbohydrates, such as potatoes, pasta, and wheat, are <1.1 kg/kg edible food. We suggest that changes in the diet toward more plant-based foods, toward meat from animals with little enteric fermentation, and toward foods processed in an energy-efficient manner offer an interesting and little explored area for mitigating climate change.

AB  - The rain gardens at Bryggen in Bergen, Western Norway, is designed to collect, retain, and infiltrate surface rainfall runoff water, recharge the groundwater, and replenish soil moisture. The hydraulic infiltration capacity of the Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS), here rain gardens, has been tested with small-scale and full-scale infiltration tests. Results show that infiltration capacity meets the requirement and is more than sufficient for infiltration in a cold climate. The results from small-scale test, 245-404 mm/h, shows lower infiltration rates than the full-scale infiltration test, with 510-1600 mm/h. As predicted, an immediate response of the full-scale infiltration test is shown on the groundwater monitoring in the wells located closest to the infiltration point (<30 m), with a ca. 2 days delayed response in the wells further away (75-100 m). Results show that there is sufficient capacity for a larger drainage area to be connected to the infiltration systems. This study contributes to the understanding of the dynamics of infiltration systems such as how a rain garden interacts with local, urban water cycle, both in the hydrological and hydrogeological aspects. The results from this study show that infiltration systems help to protect and preserve the organic rich cultural layers below, as well as help with testing and evaluating of the efficiency, i.e., SuDS may have multiple functions, not only storm water retention. The functionality is tested with water volumes of 40 m(3) (600 L/min for 2 h and 10 min), comparable to a flash flood, which give an evaluation of the infiltration capacity of the system.

AB  - Weathering rates are of considerable importance in estimating the acidification sensitivity and recovery capacity of soil and are thus important in the assessment of the sustainability of forestry in a time of changing climate and growing demands for forestry products. In this study, we modelled rates of weathering in mineral soil at two forested sites in southern Sweden included in a monitoring network, using two models. The aims were to determine whether the dynamic model ForSAFE gives comparable weathering rates to the steady-state model PROFILE and whether the ForSAFE model provided believable and useful extra information on the response of weathering to changes in acidification load, climate change and land use.
   The average weathering rates calculated with ForSAFE were very similar to those calculated with PROFILE for the two modelled sites. The differences between the models regarding the weathering of certain soil layers seemed to be due mainly to differences in calculated soil moisture. The weathering rates provided by ForSAFE vary seasonally with temperature and soil moisture, as well as on longer timescales, depending on environmental changes. Long-term variations due to environmental changes can be seen in the ForSAFE results, for example, the weathering of silicate minerals is suppressed under acidified conditions due to elevated aluminium concentration in the soil, whereas the weathering of apatite is accelerated by acidification. The weathering of both silicates and apatite is predicted to be enhanced by increasing temperature during the 21st century. In this part of southern Sweden, yearly precipitation is assumed to be similar to today's level during the next forest rotation, but with more precipitation in winter and spring and less in summer, which leads to somewhat drier soils in summer but still with increased weathering. In parts of Sweden with a bigger projected decrease in soil moisture, weathering might not increase despite increasing temperature.
   These results show that the dynamic ForSAFE model can be used for weathering rate calculations and that it gives average results comparable to those from the PROFILE model. However, dynamic modelling provides extra information on the variation in weathering rates with time and offers much better possibilities for scenario modelling.

AB  - Uneven-aged forest management has attained increasing popularity. It may benefit biodiversity, buffer against pests and abiotic damages, decrease runoff from clearcuts and improve recreational values. We studied how gap cuttings and single-tree selection cuttings influence browsing damage in spruce-dominated forests in south-central Finland. Overall, browsing damage was especially frequent in aspen and rowan, but also in birch. The larger the basal area left in harvesting, the lower the browsing pressure on birch and rowan; neither the harvesting method nor the seedling density had an independent effect on browsing damage. Although larger tree retention levels may reduce browsing damage, the regeneration and recruitment of shade-intolerant broadleaved trees may be compromised.

KW  - bycatch

AB  - A basic tenet of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management is that harvesting is conducted with minimal impact on juvenile fish, non-target species, and marine habitats. A, range of technical modifications of fishing gears aimed at improving their selective properties is available to help achieve these goals, but their effectiveness varies. Through three case studies, we describe how management controls influence fishing behaviour and the adoption of more selective gear, and demonstrate how conservation goals can be discouraged or encouraged by the strategy. in Norway, limits set on the maximum quantity of sublegal fish that may be retained on board, in combination with a ban on discarding, resulted in substantial area closures in the Barents Sea. Therefore, to gain access, fishers developed technical modifications to enhance gear selectivity. in both shrimp and demersal trawl fisheries, the modifications are now being used by virtually the whole fleet. To reduce cod mortality in the North Sea, mesh sizes were increased and effort restrictions introduced, but the measures also affected other fleets, notably those targeting Nephrops: fishers for that species reduced their mesh size to prevent loss of target species and to avoid effort restrictions. Although management measures may have resulted in reduced fishing mortality on cod, they placed additional pressure on other stocks by encouraging vessels to switch gears, and it is likely that discard rates have increased. in the eastern Bering Sea fishery for walleye pollock, the adoption of more-selective fishing gears was encouraged by regulations requiring fisheries to be curtailed when bycatch rates of prohibited species are exceeded, leading to underutilization of the target species through premature closures. Fishers now act cooperatively by providing real-time data on bycatch hot spots, allowing tactical fishing decisions to be taken to avoid such areas.

AB  - Energy efficiency is identified as a vital area for addressing sustainability challenges of our time. Governments throughout the world invest vast amounts of resources in research, for advancing knowledge on energy efficiency, and for fostering innovations that can support a transition towards a more sustainable energy system. Evaluation can be an important component in transition processes, for setting directions, assessing outcomes, and enhancing learning. In Sweden, evaluations are undertaken to assess the contribution of energy research to national goals and are also regularly undertaken for individual research programmes and institutions to assess processes and effects. Thus, in a context where evaluations are conducted at different levels and with different objectives, the connectivity between them becomes complex and often unclear. This study focuses on how research is evaluated and how individual evaluations frame and relate the evaluand to an energy transition. By reviewing 20 Swedish evaluations of research for energy efficiency in buildings, we seek to provide insights on the operationalization, analysis, and assessment of the evaluations. The results reveal that evaluations often deploy a systems perspective that frames the initiatives in a larger societal perspective, crucial for supporting a transition. They also highlight a heterogeneity within the undertaking of the evaluation: from a generally wide operationalization-to a more narrow analysis focusing on programme level outcomes-to a wider assessment of impacts and relevance for society and different actors. In all, the full potential of individual research evaluations is still to be harnessed through deliberate evaluation approaches.

AB  - River basin specific pollutants (RBSPs) are supposedly a key tool to fulfil the EU's Water Framework Directive (WFD) goal of good ecological status in all European waterbodies. The RBSPs provide a tool to manage chemical pollution identified as a national priority. An important question is if the costly management related to RBSPs leads to reduced emissions, an issue we investigated here using Sweden as a case. Swedish measures implemented under the WFD mainly rely on environmental permitting and supervision. We, therefore, specifically assessed how RBSPs have influenced permit proceedings in the Land and Environment Court of Appeal, where precedents for judgements in lower courts and authorities is established, during the 2010s. Despite permit-review being an important measure highlighted in the WFD and in Swedish programs of measures, all cases appealed to higher court were initiated by the operators/permit holders. The permissibility of environmentally hazardous activities was not impacted by RBSPs in any instance. Permit conditions addressing RBSPs were discussed in ?1% of all environmental cases, mainly resulting in conditions demanding further inquiries regarding emissions and concentrations of a limited number of RBSPs (i.e., metals and nitrogen in the forms of nitrate and ammonia). Open-ended conditions and delegation allowing for updating permit conditions if additional RBSPs are identified were suggested but rejected by court as these conflict with fundamental principles of precision and predictability of permit conditions stated in Swedish and European law. We conclude that RBSPs as management tool has little impact on emissions from activities requiring environmental permits and thereby water quality.

AB  - Seaweed aquaculture is receiving increasing attention for food and non-food applications in Europe, where it is still an emerging industry. The cultivation of seaweeds in the sea is attractive as it does not compete with agricultural crops for land and freshwater, whilst generating high yearly biomass yield. The selection of suitable cultivation sites in coastal waters is essential for the sustainable establishment and further development of seaweed aquaculture in Europe. Here, we investigate the effects of wave exposure and geographic location on growth and biofouling of kelp (Saccharina latissima), using a transplantation experiment along the Swedish west coast. Biofouling of kelp decreased with increased wave exposure, from 10 and 6% coverage at sheltered and moderately exposed locations, respectively, to 3% at exposed locations. Growth, measured as blade surface area, generally increased with decreased wave exposure, with approximately 40% less growth at exposed locations compared to sheltered or moderately exposed location. We identified that there is large spatial variation in growth and fouling of the seaweed biomass at the selected farm sites, with significant differences from the km-scale to the m-scale. In addition, exposure level affected the tissue composition, with a high carbon, but low nitrogen and water content at exposed locations compared to moderate and sheltered sites. Isotope signatures (i.e. delta C-13 and delta N-15) also differed between exposure levels. Together, these results indicate that wave exposure is an important factor to consider in site selection for both yield as well as quality of the seaweed biomass for future kelp farms.

AB  - In today's tourism industry, merely offering tourists a variety of cultural events is not enough. Fully understanding their desire for an experience is the key. The attraction value increases if tourists can become personally involved and be affected by the narratives involved in place-making. This article examines the connections and cooperation among museums in a region where an important heritage trail is operating. When the old Telemark Canal was active (1892-1990), this enabled important products to be shipped from the upper mountainous areas to the coastal urban region in Telemark County, Norway. Shortly after being closed, the canal was transformed into a heritage trail and tourist attraction through renovation initiatives. Based on a closer examination of two of the attraction clusters along the heritage trail of the canal, we ask whether there is a key narrative that can link the local museums and cultural centres in the canal region. The discussion will consider how the widespread use of the internet has created new options for museums and cultural centres to benefit from neighbouring tourist attractions such as heritage trails.

AB  - Any new policy measure aiming to mitigate climate change and support adaptation in agriculture is implemented at the farm scale. This makes a farmer the key actor. This study aimed to understand farmers' climate change views and reveal how farmers see their role, responsibilities and possibilities to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, this study aimed to assess how various background variables and values associate with farmers' views in order to have novel and comprehensive on farmers' perspectives on climate change. Short-term changes in views were studied with a longitudinal framework. In total, 4401 farmers in Finland answered a standardized e-mail survey in spring 2018. A total of 2000 of them responded again in spring 2020. The respondents differed in gender, age, education, farming system, farm type, farm organization, farm size, revenue and region. The farmers were not a uniform group of citizens, and their views on climate change varied widely. For a Nordic, boreal zone country like Finland, climate change will bring not only challenges but also opportunities that may even strengthen the agricultural production. Such a "two-sided coin" causes confusion for farmers as indicated by this study. Climate change-induced risks often dominate the public dialogue with farmers. This study emphasizes the need for better balance between risks and opportunities not only in the dialogue with farmers but also with policy makers and all public discussion. Acknowledging farmers' views in planning the future climate policies for agricultural sector is elemental to ensure success in farm-scale implementation.

AB  - This paper assesses the potential changes in the demand for forest-based biomass for various energy purposes in Sweden in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The assessment is based on a review of scenarios and predictions of how the Swedish energy system may develop, taking into account techno-economical conditions. It includes potential changes in district heating, electricity production in combined heat and power plants, industrial process energy, and production of biofuel for road transportation. In addition, the potential demand for forest-based feedstock in the chemical and petrochemical sector, replacing current use of fossil feedstock, is analysed. The assessment suggests that Sweden may see an additional demand for forest fuels at about 30 TW h in 2030 and 35-40 TW h in 2050. This can be compared with the current use of biomass for energy in Sweden at 130 TW h per year, and the estimated potential increase of sustainable harvest of logging residues (slash and stumps) at some additional 20 TW h per year, based on current conditions. If also potential demand for forest-based feedstock in the chemical and petrochemical industry is included, another 10-15 and 25-30 TW h of biomass per year may be needed in 2030 and 2050, respectively. The future demand is sensitive to the pace and magnitude of energy efficiency improvements and electrification in the various sectors. If far-reaching energy efficiency improvements and electrification are realised, the total additional demand for biomass as energy and industry feedstock may be about 20 and 30 TW h per year in 2030 and 2050, respectively, thus roughly corresponding to the sustainable harvests of logging residues. If, however, efficiency improvements and electrification are only marginal, then the additional demand for biomass as industry and energy feedstock may reach 70 Tw h and 100 TW h per year in 2030 and 2050, respectively. In these cases, the use of logging residues will not suffice and additional biomass would be needed. A combination of regulations and incentives is recommended to accelerate the fuel and feedstock switch, especially in the transportation and industrial sectors, and incentives promoting a substantial improvement in energy efficiency and electrification in all sectors.

AB  - 1. Due to globalisation, trade and transport, the spread of alien species is increasing dramatically. Some alien species become ecologically harmful by threatening native biota. This can lead to irreversible changes in local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and, ultimately, to biotic homogenisation. 2. We risk-assessed all alien plants, animals, fungi and algae, within certain delimitations, that are known to reproduce in Norway. Mainland Norway and the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard plus Jan Mayen were treated as separate assessment areas. Assessments followed the Generic Ecological Impact Assessment of Alien Species (GEIAA) protocol, which uses a fully quantitative set of criteria. 3. A total of 1,519 species were risk-assessed, of which 1,183 were species reproducing in mainland Norway. Among these, 9% were assessed to have a severe impact, 7% high impact, 7% potentially high impact, and 49% low impact, whereas 29% had no known impact. In Svalbard, 16 alien species were reproducing, one of which with a severe impact. 4. The impact assessments also covered 319 so-called door-knockers, that is, species that are likely to establish in Norway within 50 years, and 12 regionally alien species. Of the door-knockers, 8% and 10% were assessed to have a severe and high impact, respectively. 5. The impact category of most species was driven by negative interactions with native species, transformation of threatened ecosystems, or genetic contamination. The proportion of alien species with high or severe impact varied significantly across the different pathways of introduction, taxonomic groups, time of introduction and the environments colonised, but not across continents of origin. 6. Given the large number of alien species reproducing in Norway and the preponderance of species with low impact, it is neither realistic nor necessary to eradicate all of them. Our results can guide management authorities in two ways. First, the use of quantitative assessment criteria facilitates the prioritisation of management resources across species. Second, the background information collected for each species, such as introduction pathways, area of occupancy and ecosystems affected, helps designing appropriate management measures.

AB  - Salmon is a nutritious and popular food among consumers predominantly in wealthy countries around the world. Since the mid-1990s farmed salmon production has exceeded wild salmon harvest, and is now 80 % of total global salmon supply. The environmental impacts of farmed salmon are frequently discussed and consumers are faced with a multitude of choices even after deciding to have salmon for dinner: species, production method, origin, product form. We present life cycle impacts of fresh and frozen salmon products, originating in purse seine fisheries for pink salmon and gill net fisheries for sockeye salmon in Alaska, when sold on markets in Europe and the United States. Norwegian salmon products are then modelled to the same markets in fresh and frozen form, based on literature data. Impact categories included were greenhouse gas emissions, marine eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and land use. A fish in, fish out ratio is also calculated and differences in content of nutrients and contaminants described. Frozen products from wild sockeye and pink salmon had the lowest emissions in both markets. For consumers in the U.S. and Europe, wild salmon products have 46-86 % and 12-71 % lower greenhouse gas emissions than farmed Norwegian salmon, respectively, depending on species and product form. Farmed salmon also had higher land use, marine ecotoxic and eutrophying emissions and fish in, fish out ratio. Important differences exist in nutritional and contaminant content between the three types of salmon production. Improvement options as well as an optimized supply chain are modelled showing greenhouse gas reduction opportunities of 40-50 % also for the best performing chains. Results can be used as a baseline for improved data collection and emission reductions. Recommendations for consumers, industry and policymakers who can facilitate and even drive development towards more sustainable salmon products are provided.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be described as an ongoing epidemic, although a very protracted one, lasting more than 100 years. Cardiovascular diseasesstill top mortality rates in the world today, accounting for about 30% of all deaths around the globe. But it is in the industrialized world that CVD dominate, although differences are great among various regions. Myocardial infarctions are significantly more common in Sweden than in southern Europe, but less common than in Eastern Europe. The overall question concerns the consequences for health in areas on the road to a post-industrial society. Over the years a clearer link has become visible between lifestyle and health. In Sweden, infectious diseases diminished as result of rising living standards. At the same time cardiovascular diseases were beginning their upward phase, reaching a peak in the 1960s. Deaths due to CVD bring to light significant discrepancies related to socio-economic and cultural factors. A comparison of the Swedish twin cities Linkoping and Norrkoping show considerable differences in death rates in favour of Linkoping, amounting to about 30% fewer in the 1920s with a tendency toward rising differences thereafter. A preliminary investigation of diagnoses has shown that links commonly made between health and socio-economic patterns need revision. The differences in cardiovascular morbidity show another pattern than was expected. It is obvious that the neighbourhood environments themselves have significance, and that the inequalities need additional research based on complementary explanatory models.

AB  - Most of the municipalities in Europe have a population of less than 6000 inhabitants and high energy consumption. In order to reduce consumption, it is necessary to know the energy behaviour of a municipality beforehand. The purpose of this article is to analyse the energy and environmental situation of the municipalities of the province of Badajoz (Spain) and formulates energy efficiency and environmental indicators. The method is based in the analysis of 74 energy audits were carried out between 2012 and 2014 in the corresponding municipalities, and the average final energy consumption was studied in terms of four different variables: area of the municipality, number of inhabitants, cost of energy, and annual CO2 emissions. In addition, a statistical analysis based on variance was carried out. The results obtained show that the average annual energy consumption of a municipality of less than 6000 inhabitants is 300 kWh per inhabitant and 1 kWh per m(2) of surface area. A great variability was observed in the average cost of energy for each municipality, between 0.11 and 0.25 Euro/kWh, with an average of 0.17 Euro/kWh. In addition, by statistical methods it was determined that the energy consumption of a municipality is proportional to the surface area that it occupies and its number of inhabitants, proposing an equation that allows determining the final energy consumption according to both variables. This benchmarking is valid to implement energy saving techniques and to prioritize investments in the renovation of the facilities. There are no precedents of similar research studies with such a large number of municipalities.

AB  - The maritime shipping industry accounts for 3 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and delivers 90 % of globally traded goods. Maritime shipping is heavily reliant on fossil fuels. There is increasing policy pressure to cut emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement and to meet decarbonization targets. This paper aims to analyze sector coupling for decarbonization and sustainable energy transitions in maritime shipping, exploring the interlinkages between the transport, energy, industry, agriculture and forestry sectors. First, this paper analyses the opportunities and barriers for sector coupling between the maritime shipping sector and other industries. Second, this paper adds new knowledge on the wider implications of sustainable energy transitions and decarbonization for the maritime shipping sector, the role of various stakeholders in supporting or impeding sustainable energy transitions, policy issues at the international, regional and national level and the links to sector coupling. This research uses a mixed methods approach, applying both qualitative research including interviews and quantitative energy modeling. The research thereby links theories from sustainability transitions with technoeconomic modeling approaches. Our research finds that the sector couplings between the transport, energy, industry, agriculture and forestry sectors are of growing importance as maritime shipping is transitioning towards decarbonized and renewable marine fuels. At the same time there is competition for scarce natural resources with other sectors, including aviation and road transport. Socio-technical aspects, particularly of financial and political nature, are key factors that determine the speed and direction of the transition, yet they remain under-explored.

AB  - 1. The duck mussel, Anodonta anatina, has been described as abundant and widespread in Europe. However, it is listed as near threatened or threatened in several countries owing to severe declines in abundance and/or spatial distribution.
   2. Despite its potential ecological importance and conservation status almost nothing is known regarding its genetic diversity.
   3. As a preliminary analysis, variation within the cytochrome oxidase 1 mitochondrial gene was determined from European specimens from Portugal in the south west, to Ukraine in the east, and Sweden in the north.
   4. Three major mtDNA clades were retrieved: clade 1 includes all the individuals from Iberia, except those from the Ebro basin; clade 2 includes all the European non-Iberian and non-Italian samples; and clade 3 includes all the individuals from Italy and from the Ebro basin. AMOVA analysis revealed significant genetic differences among the three clades. Within each of the major clades, several geographically related haplogroups were also retrieved, especially in Iberia, where four genetically distinct groups (North-West, South-Central, South-West and Ebro) were revealed.
   5. Given the evidence of regional declines of A. anatina in Europe, the confirmation of geographically distinct genotypes indicates a need for the development of management strategies directed towards the conservation of localized populations. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In the rapidly progressing world where different sectors become more interconnected, cross-sectoral cooperation in health promotion lacks a specific set of instruments, navigating partners through the cooperation process in project implementation. Cross-sectoral cooperation is an everyday practice in business and has become an integral part of promoting health and wellbeing comprehensively and sustainably. In this paper, we propose a developed Model for cross-sectoral cooperation, which has been designed within the Interreg Baltic Sea Region project "Urban Labs for Better Health for All in the Baltic Sea Region" (Healthy Boost), aiming to boost cross-sectoral cooperation for health and wellbeing in cities and municipalities. The Model is developed based on literature research and self-assessment of cross-sectoral cooperation for health promotion in Healthy Boost partner cities and municipalities in Latvia, Poland, Russia, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Sweden. Composed of five major domains (risk identification, leadership, coordination, communication, and motivation) and four stages of cooperation (mapping, planning, implementation, and assessment), it provides a checklist of helpful questions for identifying solutions effectively and systematically. The Model can be used both as a navigational tool and as an "emergency" tool to manage cross-sectoral cooperation challenges successfully.

AB  - The use of local energy production as a strategy to improve energy safety, control costs and mitigate climate change is reviewed. Local energy is in practice equivalent to renewable energy. There are a large number of different sources of local energy production. Some of them, including solar electricity, energy efficient building and biogas production, are in rapid technical development. The use of local energy is estimated to be around 50 % in Sweden. A number of cases, mostly from Sweden and Europe, where local energy has been a strong and important policy are described. Networks of municipalities which work for local energy autonomy are found all over the world and some of them are reviewed. Typically a strong policy for local energy production creates substantial numbers of job opportunities and thus contributes to the local economy, provides social and environmental benefits, improves energy security, and reduces emissions of greenhouse gases.

AB  - Aim Accurate predictions about transition timing of salmon smolts between freshwater and marine environments are key to effective management. We aimed to use available data on Atlantic salmon smolt migration to predict the emigration timing in rivers throughout Norway.
   Location In this study, we used outmigration timing data of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts from 41 rivers collected from 1984 to 2018 to make a predictive model for the timing of out-migrating salmon smolts along 12 degrees latitude.
   Methods Smolt migration data were collated from rivers where smolts are monitored with traps, video and tagging and matched to river-specific metadata. Using a mixed-effects generalized additive model, we tested for the effects of spatial location, air temperature, river flow and counting methods on the timing of 25% smolt emigration from rivers.
   Results After accounting for spatial effects and repeated measures (across years and among rivers), air temperature and counting method were significant drivers of the estimated timing of smolt emigration. In-sample predictions yielded strong correlation with observed values, as did 10-fold cross-validation. Out-of-sample predictions suggested that the previous national estimates underestimated the migration timing in southern populations (linear model intercept = 39.73 days).
   Conclusion Model-derived estimates of run timing can be used to more accurately predict the timing of outmigration in order to better calibrate environmental flows and regulate management of marine industries such as aquaculture that may affect migration success at this particularly sensitive life stage.

AB  - Certification-and-monitoring programs for paratuberculosis are based on repetitive herd testing to establish a herd's health status. The available tests have poor sensitivity. Infected but undetected herds may remain among certified "paratuberculosis-free" herds. The objective was to determine if truly free herds acquire a certified status and keep it over time when infected but undetected herds remain. The Dutch program was used as a basis to construct a mechanistic deterministic model of the evolution over 25 years of the number of herds per health status. Three health states for herds were defined: not detected as infected in the certification process to obtain a free status; not detected as infected by any of the repetitive tests for monitoring the certified free status; detected as infected. Among undetected herds, two types were defined: truly free versus undetected but infected. Transitions between states were due to the purchase of an infected animal, infection via the environment, clearance via culling or sales, detection of an infected animal, and certification. A sensitivity analysis was carried out. We showed that - for a 100% specific test only - most of the truly free herds at the beginning of the program got a certified free status and kept it over time. Most infected herds were either detected as infected or cleared. The number of certified truly free herds increased with a decrease in the animal-level prevalence or in the risk of purchasing an infected cattle, for example by restricting purchases to cattle from herds at the highest level of certification.

AB  - Secondary Norway spruce forests in the Western Beskids are among the most damaged forests in Europe. Although spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) has been recently causing large-scale damage to these forests, our understanding of I. typographus dynamics in this environment is inadequate for evaluating forest sustainability.
   This study aims to evaluate the patterns of damage caused by I. typographus to spruce forests with compromised ecological stability.
   Forest infestation by I. typographus was inferred from sanitary felling data collected from 1998 to 2004. Stand and site data were obtained from forest management plans. Spatial-dependence analysis, ordinary kriging and neural network-based regression modelling were used to investigate the patterns of infestation and the casual relationships in the studied ecosystem.
   I. typographus long-distance dispersal substantially decreased with outbreak culmination. The spread of infestation was only weakly related to stand and site parameters. Infestations spread isotropically at the stand and patch level but directionally at the regional scale.
   The large-scale spread of infestation can be explained by the uniform age and species composition of the investigated forests and by the ability of populations to overwhelm suboptimal trees. The observations presented here suggest that secondary spruce forests in Europe may be unsustainable due to unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks, which can be further amplified by changing climate.

AB  - Generating electricity from waves is predicted to be a new source of renewable energy conversion expanding significantly, with a global potential in the range of wind and hydropower. Several wave power techniques are on the merge of commercialisation, and thus evoke questions of environmental concern. Conservation matters are to some extent valid independent of technique but we mainly focus on point absorbing linear generators. By giving examples from the Lysekil project, run by Uppsala University and situated on the Swedish west coast, we demonstrate ongoing and future environmental studies to be performed along with technical research and development. We describe general environmental aspects generated by wave power projects; issues also likely to appear in Environmental Impact Assessment studies. Colonisation patterns and biofouling are discussed with particular reference to changes of the seabed and alterations due to new substrates. A purposeful artificial reef design to specially cater for economically important or threatened species is also discussed. Questions related to fish, fishery and marine mammals are other examples of topics where, e.g. no-take zones, marine bioacoustics and electromagnetic fields are important areas. In this review we point out areas in which studies likely will be needed, as ventures out in the oceans also will give ample opportunities for marine environmental research in general and in areas not previously studied. Marine environmental and ecological aspects appear to be unavoidable for application processes and in post-deployment studies concerning renewable energy extraction. Still, all large-scale renewable energy conversion will cause some impact mainly by being area demanding. An early incorporation of multidisciplinary and high quality research might be a key for new ocean-based techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In order to use recreational hunting as a socially acceptable management tool, the practice of this activity should adhere strictly to the ethical standards of animal welfare and the conservation guidelines on sustainable harvest. A key measure in this regard is monitoring the negative side effects of hunting associated with crippling of wild animals. This study introduces "crippling ratio" (the number of individuals crippled for each successfully bagged) as a novel approach to evaluate hunter performance in a way that accounts for differences in population size and harvest pressure, and which therefore can be used to evaluate initiatives launched to reduce wounding of wild game. We demonstrate that crippling ratios of Svalbard-breeding Pink-footed Geese Anser brachyrhynchus has been declining steadily over the last 25 years despite an increasing harvest rate. Hence, for juvenile birds that have not previously experienced a hunting season, and therefore can be used as a direct measure of annual variation in the crippling ratio, the number of geese crippled for each goose bagged dropped from 1.00 in 1992-0.11 in 2016. This corresponds to an 89% reduction in crippling frequency. Among adult birds the ratio dropped from 9.75 in 1992-1.99 in 2016, corresponding to a reduction of 80%. This positive development might be ascribed to effective awareness campaigns, training of hunters and adjustment of hunting techniques in both Denmark and, recently, Norway. It exemplifies that monitoring the outcome of management programmes is an important element in ensuring that measures introduced to manage wildlife are socially defensible.

AB  - Digital platforms and the online services that they provide have become an indispensable and ubiquitous part of modern lifestyles, mediating our jobs, hobbies, patterns of consumption and forms of communication. However, no one is steering this development, or closely looking at the impacts that it may have on remote communities in the Arctic and Nordic region, a hotspot for datacenter development. Moreover, unlike other areas of energy consumption or technology adoption prone to rich, qualitative assessments, such work on datacenters involving local stakeholders and environmental concerns is less common, particularly at a larger scale. In this study, based on novel mixed methods-including corporate data, expert interviews, focus groups, and extensive site visits-across three countries, we offer a geographically and technologically bounded assessment looking at the sustainability impacts of datacenters on local communities. We ask: What impacts are occurring as part of datacenter development or planning proposals in Greenland, Iceland, and Norway? What is the actual and anticipated scale of those impacts on local Arctic communities? Finally, what impacts to datacenter development occur at the "whole systems" level? We examine not only impacts onsite at existing or proposed datacenters, but an entire range of consequences including the manufacturing of equipment, the laying of data cables, the construction of buildings, and issues of the dark web, cryptocurrency mining, hacking, spying, waste and decommissioning. Moreover, we humanize risks and benefits not only across scales, but also categorical types, including local impacts such as boom and bust cycles, the displacement of indigenous groups for land - particularly for power supply - and impacts on employment, especially after datacenters may close.

AB  - There is a need to reduce fuel consumption, and thereby reduce CO2-emissions in all parts of the transport sector. It is also well known that aerodynamic resistance affects the fuel consumption in a major way. By improving the aerodynamics of the vehicles, the fuel consumption will also decrease. A special type of transportation is that of timber, which is performed by specialized trucks with few alternative uses. This paper follows up on earlier papers concerning Swedish timber trucks where aerodynamic improvements for timber trucks were tested. By mapping the entire fleet of timber trucks in Sweden and investigating reduced fuel consumption of 2-10%, financial calculations were performed on how these improvements would affect the transport costs. Certain parameters are investigated, such as investment cost, extra changeover time and weight of installments. By combining these results with the mapping of the fleet, it can be seen under which circumstances these improvements would be sustainable. The results show that it is possible through aerodynamics to lower the transportation costs and make an investment plausible, with changeover time being the most important parameter. They also show that certain criteria for a reduced transportation cost already exist within the vehicle fleet today.

AB  - This article examines how attitudes toward Muslims among native majority adolescents in Norway are associated with the ethno-religious composition of their school environment. The inflow of immigrants has changed the sociodemographic landscape in Norway, introducing new dimensions of urban school segregation. The school context represents a key socializing context outside of the family and structures contact opportunities across ethnic and religious lines. Research on how exposure to peers from different backgrounds influences majority group students' out-group attitudes have produced conflicting findings, and central theories propose different mechanisms influencing the relationship between relative group size and prejudice. Using a unique dataset with both individual-and school-level information from Norway's capital region and controlling for observed characteristics of students and their parents, the results show that levels of negative attitudes toward Muslims decreased with relative out-group size. This finding indicates that multiethnic settings bolster tolerant attitudes toward Muslims in Norwegian schools.

AB  - Climate change is likely to affect the tourism sector, particularly areas, such as snow-based tourism, that are directly dependent on climate and weather conditions. Especially vulnerable are low-lying ski areas. This study identifies the climatic factors that are crucial for economically successful operation of low-lying ski areas in Southern and Middle Finland and contemplates how these factors are seen to change with climate change. The study then analyses the preferences for and perceptions of adaptation strategies of downhill ski operators in terms of the adaptation measures they can implement or are willing to take. The findings indicate that climatic conditions set preconditions for the operation of the ski areas, but short-term operational prospects and inter-annual variability in weather conditions rather than foreseen changes in climatic conditions guide the operational decisions of the ski area operators. A key adaptation strategy to respond to uncertain snow conditions is artificial snowmaking, which lowers the vulnerability of the areas to the impacts of climate change too.

AB  - Objective: to explore experiences with nutrition-related information during routine antenatal care among women of different ethnical backgrounds.
   Design: individual interviews with seventeen participants were conducted twice during pregnancy. Data collection and analysis were inspired by an interpretative phenomenological approach.
   Setting: participants were purposively recruited at eight Mother and Child Health Centres in the area of Oslo, Norway, where they received antenatal care. Participants: participants had either immigrant backgrounds from African and Asian countries (n = 12) or were ethnic Norwegian (n = 5).
   Participants were pregnant with their first child and had a pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index above 25 kg/m(2).
   Findings: participants experienced that they were provided with little nutrition-related information in antenatal care. The information was perceived as presented in very general terms and focused on food safety. Weight management and the long-term prevention of diet-related chronic diseases had hardly been discussed. Participants with immigrant backgrounds appeared to be confused about information given by the midwife which was incongruent with their original food culture. The participants were actively seeking for nutrition-related information and had to navigate between various sources of information.
   Conclusions: the midwife is considered a trustworthy source of nutrition-related information. Therefore, antenatal care may have considerable potential to promote a healthy diet to pregnant women. Findings suggest that nutrition communication in antenatal care should be more tailored towards women's dietary habits and cultural background, nutritional knowledge as well as level of nutrition literacy.

AB  - The comparison of adolescent psychiatric inpatient care in Finland and in the Chicago area, in the United States (US), provides an interesting opportunity to learn from similarities and differences in current treatment practices between the two countries. In this study we have compared the treatment programs in two very differently based service systems. Many similarities could be found, but the diagnostic system, the length of hospital treatment (Finland, mean 20.7 months; US, mean 2.1 months) and the use of medication (Finland, 39%; US, 64%) differed in these two countries. The results seem to reflect differences in the philosophy and management of the units. The service system has an impact on these factors because inpatient treatment is an expensive and limited resource.

AB  - Stress on the environment from a potentially growing energy use is set to rise. Without doubt the energy resources in Arctic regions will be developed. An important goal will be to exploit the resources offered by for instance the Barents Sea as a new European energy province, and to do this in accordance with the principles of sustainable development that have successfully been used e.g. in the North Sea.
   The special edition of MIC on Arctic DP presents a set of articles that summarize to an extent the activities of the research project "Arctic DP: Safe and green dynamic positioning operations of offshore vessels in an Arctic environment". This project was awarded in 2010 by the Research Council of Norway (RCN) as a competence-building project (KMB project) to NTNU and its partners Kongsberg Maritime, DNV GL, and Statoil. The objective was to target some of the challenges related to safe Arctic offshore operations by dynamic positioning. In this first article of the Arctic DP special edition we discuss the background for and establishment of the project, its planning and execution, and project closure. An overview is given for the scientific and engineering research performed in the project, with an account of what we have considered as Effective stationkeeping in ice by dynamic positioning. The corresponding research activities conducted under this main theme is summarized.

AB  - We review stakeholder perceptions in Chile regarding socioeconomic impacts of salmon aquaculture in the Chilean Patagonia. This is one of the fastest growing industries in Chile that developed with very limited regulation, which has resulted in significant effects on the ecosystem and local communities. After the Infectious Salmon Anemia (ISA) virus struck the industry in 2007, aquaculture companies helped to craft new legislation in an effort to create a sustainable industry. Nevertheless, some of the impacts remain and a new and small outbreak of the ISA virus struck in 2013. During this period, we conducted a series of workshops to evaluate stakeholder concerns regarding the impacts generated by aquaculture. Stakeholders from the government, NGOs, local communities, fishermen and aquaculture companies participated in a series of workshops, where they shared their different views about the impacts of the salmon industry in Chile. The analysis of this information provides an overview of the main issues from salmon aquaculture, a guide for regulators and firms about where negative perceptions exist, and recommendations on how the salmon industry can become more sustainable. We found that regulatory institutions and governance are the most important concerns of stakeholders to achieve a sustainable aquaculture industry in Chile. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Finnish arable land is typically located on flat areas, where the fields are mostly drained and sub-drained to control the water tables. These areas are highly susceptible to nutrient loss, which affects the water quality of rivers and lakes. Therefore, it is very important to understand current landscape pattern and processes controlling water quality, not only identifying factors affecting it, but also identifying strategies and restoring areas for mitigation. We studied linkage of 21 years (1990-2011) of water quality (WQ) data from 16 agricultural watersheds, using landscape indices at three functional scales: watershed-wide, saturation-excess zone, and riparian zone (of varying widths). The hydro-biogeochemical functional areas of watershed were obtained by digital terrain analysis. Statistical analyses by generalized linear model and multivariate redundancy analysis indicated that the fraction of watershed in agricultural use was linked to most of the studied water quality variables. The relationships varied across the seasons: they were strongest during high flow periods (spring and autumn) when also highest nutrient losses occur. Total suspended sediment concentrations were linked to critical source areas. Riparian vegetation index was important explaining nitrate concentrations in autumn. Terrain-based mapping of hydro-biogeochemical functional areas provides a rapid identification of potential sites to mitigate diffuse nutrient pollution, particularly in riparian zones.

AB  - As a reaction to the changed political landscape in Scandinavia following the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, the prominent Swedish mathematician Gosta Mittag-Leffler extended a brotherly hand,' calling for Scandinavian colleagues to meet for a congress of mathematicians in Stockholm in 1909. This event became the first in a series of biannual meetings which proved to be an important institution for Scandinavian mathematics. During the first decades after 1909, the congresses would form and consolidate themselves through the construction of a new Scandinavian identity for mathematicians which developed alongside and in relation to both international and national contexts and developments. In this paper, we shall demonstrate that these meetings served a complex set of agendas at the individual, national, and international level. In particular, they reflect a changing conception of cooperation in science for mutual cultural gain combined with a flexible institutionalisation that allowed the Scandinavian mathematicians to use the congresses for various diplomatic ambitions. We base our analyses of the Scandinavian Congresses of Mathematics on the notion of a shared conational' identity developed adjacent to national identities. We then analyse the formation, consolidation, delineation, and reflections of this institution in order to demonstrate how the efforts to unite Scandinavian mathematicians were contingent on and influenced by simultaneous currents of internationalisation and shared history, culture, and language in the Scandinavian region.

AB  - The building of a railway tunnel through the Hallandsas ridge in the southwest of Sweden resulted in sinking groundwater levels and a toxic spill for the local community. As a result, this highly technological project expanded from the addressing of technological and economic issues of rail traffic and tunnel building to include issues of environmental harm and how to assess and manage the geology of the ridge. A central concern for local residents as well as for the developer has been how to view and interpret the resource of groundwater. This article focuses on groundwater as a boundary object, bordering the domains of the technologists and the local community. In this situation, technological understanding and knowledge confronts an experience-based understanding and a symbolic interpretation of the water resource.

AB  - Mine closure is an essential part in the development of eco-efficient, sustainable mining. When mines close they leave behind open spaces (ground workings) and piles of mineral waste materials which may deteriorate the environment in the long-term, if not closed properly. Extensive knowledge on suitable closure technologies and related research methods as well as on site-specific factors affecting selection of proper closure technologies are required for successful closure. To reach the best results, planning of mine closure should be started as early as possible -ideally during the feasibility study phase, before any mining operations begin.
   To provide guidance on mine closure and to reduce negative environmental, societal and economic impacts of closure, Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) and Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT) developed Mine Closure Wiki -a wiki-based technology resource on mine closure. The objective of the Wiki is to promote the selection of technical methods for the closure and to facilitate smoother closure planning and permitting.
   The Mine Closure Wiki includes the best practices and legislation pertinent to closure, systematic evaluations of the key closure methods and technologies, and benchmarked case studies on the performance of closure technologies. The Wiki is an open internet resource intended as an every-day tool for mining operators, authorities, consultants and researchers for planning, permitting, executing, and monitoring of mine closure. The Mine Closure Wiki was published in October 2015.

AB  - Climate change mitigation targets have put pressure to reduce the carbon footprint of cultural heritage buildings. Commonly adopted measures to decrease the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of historical buildings are targeted at improving their energy efficiency through insulating the building envelope, and upgrading their heating, cooling and lighting systems. However, there are complex issues that arise when mitigating climate change in the cultural built heritage sector. For instance, preserving the authenticity of heritage buildings, maintaining their traditional passive behaviours, and choosing adaptive solutions compatible with the characteristics of heritage materials to avoid an acceleration of decay processes. It is thus important to understand what the enablers, or the barriers, are to reduce the carbon footprint of cultural heritage buildings to meet climate change mitigation targets. This paper investigates how climate change mitigation is considered in the management and preservation of the built heritage through semi-structured interviews with cultural heritage experts from the UK, Italy and Norway. Best-practice approaches for the refurbishment of historical buildings with the aim of decreasing their energy consumption are presented, as perceived by the interviewees, as well as the identification of the enablers and barriers in mitigating climate change in the cultural built heritage sector. The findings emphasise that adapting the cultural built heritage to reduce GHG emissions is challenging, but possible if strong and concerted action involving research and government can be undertaken to overcome the barriers identified in this paper.

AB  - This paper characterizes the value of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience by formalizing a stochastic dynamic bioeconomic model of pollinator diversity under climate changes, with an application to oil rapeseed production in the Stockholm region of Sweden. It studies the optimal provision of semi-natural habitat for two different pollinator bee species: bumble bees and solitary wild bees. It is found that, despite being less effective, solitary bees hold considerable resilience value due to the differences in how the two species respond to temperature shocks. The paper also discusses the role of spatial aspects, in particular the reduced pollination effectiveness due to spatially uneven allocation of semi-natural habitats. It is found that spatial unevenness leads to an increase in the habitat provision, with an attendant reduction in the resilience value of solitary bees.

AB  - Landfills are considered as places where the life cycle of products ends thus meaning that resources and materials, which before were valuables, become useless and are disposed forever in places away from the sight. Landfills that were not closed appropriately are of primary importance as the EU legislation demands closure of noncompliant landfills, re-cultivation followed by soil and groundwater remediation. Waste dumps in former times were created without any environmental planning and it causes problems. Planned actions to reduce and prevent impacts to the environment and get extracted valuables from dump sites are proposed in a new approach known as "landfill mining" (LFM). The number of dumpsites which are still not appropriately closed according to the EU Directives has diminished, but not completely. Landfills that are located close to the Baltic Sea and Black Seas could be good candidates for LFM. This research topic has had evolved in many aspects with the interest increase on material recovery, refuse derived fuels (RDF) production, greenhouse gas and leachate emission diminishing. Real-time applied LFM in last decade in Sweden has started and Estonian scientists and entrepreneurs took over the initiative - the project in Saaremaa Island is an example of closing the life cycle of dumpsites by following a more sustainable approach. The rise of raw material and energy costs promotes the process of LFM to be economically feasible, but this approach must be adjusted in regulations (permitting-prohibiting schemes, environmental impact assessment, staff safety, monitoring).

AB  - The vertical behaviour of 44 veteran sea trout Salmo trutta (275-580 mm) in different marine fjord habitats (estuary, pelagic, near shore with and without steep cliffs) was documented during May-February by acoustic telemetry. The swimming depth of S. trutta was influenced by habitat, time of day (day v. night), season, seawater temperature and the body length at the time of tagging. Mean swimming depth during May-September was 17 m (individual means ranged from 04 to 64 m). Hence, S. trutta were generally surface oriented, but performed dives down to 24 m. Mean swimming depth in May-September was deeper in the near-shore habitats with or without steep cliffs (20 m and 25 m, respectively) than in the pelagic areas (12 m). May-September mean swimming depth in all habitats was slightly deeper during day (19 m) than at night (12 m), confirming that S. trutta conducted small-scale diel vertical movements. During summer, S. trutta residing in near-shore habitat progressively moved deeper over the period May (mean 11 m) to August (mean 40 m) and then reoccupied shallower areas (mean 23 m) during September. In winter (November and February), individuals residing in the innermost part of the fjords were found at similar average depths as they occupied during the summer (mean 13 m). The swimming depths of S. trutta coincide with the previously known surface orientation of salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Combined with previous studies on horizontal use of S. trutta, this study illustrates how S. trutta utilize marine water bodies commonly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as aquaculture, harbours and marine constructions, marine renewable energy production or other human activity. This suggests that the marine behaviour of S. trutta and its susceptibility to coastal anthropogenic factors should be considered in marine planning processes.

AB  - In Finland, wind-induced forest damage is expected to increase in the future. Demand exists for timely and precise first-hand information about the main impact area of windstorms. Locating potential damage areas quickly is essential for effective operational planning of salvage loggings, aiming to reduce monetary losses of timber and risk for secondary damage caused by insects. This study presents an approach for mapping the potential damage areas immediately after a windstorm, by using high-resolution forest vulnerability data and information on the spatial distribution of maximum wind gust speed derived from weather station observations using kriging with external drift interpolation. The new method is evaluated by analyzing damage caused by nine major windstorms of the 2010s in Finland. Our results show that including roughness length information as an auxiliary variable in the interpolation improved the results and produced wind maps with more plausible structure and better separation between forested and non-forested land areas. The forest vulnerability data were most strongly linked to damage, whilst wind gust speed had weaker results. However, for future storms with unknown damage areas, we consider maximum wind gust speed still essential for defining the main impact area, whereas forest vulnerability data could then be used for more detailed damage predictions. Further advancements of wind interpolation approaches, preferably towards higher resolution and, if possible, based on a denser and more diverse observation network, is needed to fully exploit the potential of combined wind and forest vulnerability data. Albeit we recognize multiple uncertainties, room for improvements and benefits that additional data sources would bring, our study demonstrates a simple approach for rapid mapping of potential forest wind damage areas, which could be further developed into an operational tool.

AB  - Urban water services are challenged from many perspectives and different stakeholders demand performance improvements along economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. In response, urban water utilities systematically give more attention to criteria such as water safety, climate change adaptation and mitigation, environmental life cycle assessment (LCA), total cost efficiency, and on how to improve their operations within the water-energy-carbon nexus. The authors of this paper collaborated in the development of a 'Dynamic Metabolism Model' (DMM). The model is developed for generic use in the sustainability assessment of urban water services, and it has been initially tested for the city of Oslo, Norway. The purpose has been to adopt a holistic systemic perspective to the analysis of metabolism and environmental impacts of resource flows in urban water and wastewater systems, in order to offer a tool for the examination of future strategies and intervention options in such systems. This paper describes the model and its application to the city of Oslo for the analysis time period 2013-2040. The external factors impacting decision-making and interventions are introduced along with realistic scenarios developed for the testing, after consultation with officials at the Oslo Water and Wastewater Works (Norway). Possible interventions that the utility intends to set in motion are defined and numerically interpreted for incorporation into the model, and changes in the indicator values over the time period are determined. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the DMM, as a decision-support tool for water-wastewater utilities. The scenarios considered and interventions identified do not include all possible scenarios and interventions that can be relevant for water-wastewater utilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pipelines account for the lion's share of the lifetime costs of any typical urban wastewater collection. While the deterioration of pipeline is the obvious "frontline" reason to adopt asset management practices, a more overarching driver is the need to gravitate toward sustainable development and set short- and long-term objectives encompassing economic, social, and environmental goals. Optimizing the expenses and providing the required levels of service to customers are the twin targets of wastewater utilities. Oslo Vann og Avlopsetaten-the water/wastewater utility in the Norwegian capital, considered as case study in this paper, is sprucing up its data bank, rightly realizing that a very effective information management system is the spine of asset management.

AB  - For hydrocarbon exploration and production, the inaccessibility of the deep-sea, the low temperature, the high pressure, and the poorly described, but highly diverse biological communities constitute special environmental challenges. For most marine organisms, there is little or no information available on the toxicity of hydrocarbons or any chemical in the deep-sea. Although technical developments have reduced or removed discharges with hydrocarbons and other potentially damaging chemicals by transport to land or re-injection, accidental leaks and spills may occur. Moreover, we may benefit from knowledge-based options for assessing mitigation alternatives and for considering how much an effluent must be cleaned before it possibly can be discharged. Preliminary studies have indicated that high pressure may alter the partitioning of some hydrocarbons between oil, organisms, and water and hence influence effects in biota. Special adaptations in organisms to deep-sea life may possibly also make them vulnerable to industrial activities. It is thus uncertain to what extent knowledge gained in shallow water can be directly transferred to deep-sea environment for risk assessment and environmental monitoring. Recent environmental law regulations emphasize the importance of biological effects. To meet the management needs of the oil and gas industry for deep-sea exploration and production, we are developing an environmental effect and risk estimation methodology for decision-making, impact assessment, and monitoring organised within the Norwegian Deepwater Programme (NDP).

AB  - Climate change is increasingly affecting forest ecosystems. Modifying the species composition towards species mixtures with a higher potential to mitigate the negative effect of climate change is one of the basic silvicultural measures. Potential economic and production impacts of these actions need to be assessed. This study therefore aims to evaluate the economic and production effect of species composition change as a result of the adaptation of forest ecosystems to climate change. The differences between the value production of Norway spruce (Picea abies /L./Karst.), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziessi/MIRBEL/FRANCO) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) on fresh soils (represented mainly by mesotrophic cambisols), and soils affected by ground water (mainly pseudogley forms of cambisols and pseudogleys) were evaluated. The study was conducted on the area of the forest enterprise of the Czech University of Life Sciences (UFE) situated in the Central Bohemia region. For a model comparison of height and volume growth of Douglas fir and Norway spruce in this area, all stands (pure and mixed) with both species represented were analysed using the data from the current forest management plan and Korf's growth function. The course of current and mean height increments over time is very similar, yet with constantly higher annual increments for Douglas fir. In 100 years, the mean stand height of Douglas fir is 6 m larger than that of Norway spruce. Production and economic potential were also evaluated. At the rotation age, the volume and value production of Douglas fir was 30% to 50% higher than that of Norway spruce. A higher share of Douglas fir in the total forest area would lead to an important value increment of the forests in the study area. Different results were achieved by comparing the yield potential of Norway spruce with European beech, which most often substitutes spruce at middle altitudes. Beech potential yield is only 40-55% of the spruce yield level.

AB  - Connections between environmental and cultural changes are analysed in Estonia during the past c. 4,500 years. Records of cereal-type pollen as (agri)cultural indices are compared with high-resolution palaeohydrological and annual mean temperature reconstructions from a selection of Estonian bogs and lakes (and Lake Igelsjon in Sweden). A broad-scale comparison shows increases in the percentage of cereal-type pollen during a decreasing trend in annual mean temperatures over the past c. 4,300 years, suggesting a certain independence of agrarian activities from environmental conditions at the regional level. The first cereal-type pollen in the region is found from a period with a warm and dry climate. A slow increase in pollen of cultivated land is seen around the beginning of the late Bronze Age, a slight increase at the end of the Roman Iron Age and a significant increase at the beginning of the Middle Ages. In a few cases increases in agricultural pollen percentages occur in the periods of warming. Stagnation and regression occurs in the periods of cooling, but regression at individual sites may also be related to warmer climate episodes. The cooling at c. 400-300 cal b.p., during the 'Little Ice Age' coincides with declines in cereal-type and herb pollen curves. These may not, however, be directly related to the climate change, because they coincide with war activities in the region.

AB  - We investigated how hydro-climatological changes would affect fluvial forces and inundated area during a typical high-flow situation (MHQ, mean high discharge), and how adaptive regulation could attenuate the climate change impacts in a low-relief river of the Southern Boreal climate area. We used hydrologically modeled data as input for 2D hydraulic modeling. Our results show that, even though the MHQ will increase in the future (2050-2079), the erosional power of the flow will decrease on the study area. This can be attributed to the change of timing in floods from spring to autumn and winter, when the sea levels during flood peaks is higher, causing backwater effect. Even though the mean depth will not increase notably (from 1.14 m to 1.25 m) during MHQ, compared to the control period (1985-2014), the inundated area will expand by 15% due to the flat terrain. The increase in flooding may be restrained by adaptive regulations: strategies favoring ecologically sustainable and recreationally desirable lake water levels were modeled. The demands of environment, society, and hydropower are not necessarily contradictory in terms of climate change adaptation, and regulation could provide an adaptive practice in the areas of increased flooding.

AB  - This article focuses on violence(s) in traffic space as a gendered problem. It draws upon qualitative online studies and interviews with cyclists about their experiences of motorists' violent practices, including cyclists' negotiations of anti-cyclist discourses and their coping strategies. It is argued that automobility makes it possible for certain men to perform their right to the road,' including gender-identity-shaping practices, and that this has the negative effect of violating cyclists' bodily integrity. It follows that a shift from cars to more sustainable mobilities also demands related shifts in masculinities and men's practices in the context of transport and traffic.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine predictors of beliefs about urban fringe forests among urban residents in Sweden (n = 586). Based on a cognitive hierarchical model, the study investigated how socio-demographic variables, as well as different values and beliefs, were related to the more specific beliefs urban residents have about urban fringe forests. Results demonstrated that the urban fringe forest was perceived to be essential for personal wellbeing, but preservation and accessibility to the forest were also important. Certain differences between socio-demographic groups were identified; for example, the importance of urban fringe forests for personal wellbeing was emphasized more by women, older people and those with a university degree. However, the importance of socio-demographic variables was modest compared with the influence of people's values and beliefs. More specifically, results showed that urban residents' basic values and ecological worldview, as well as forest values and beliefs (i.e., concerning forest qualities and forest requirements), were important in explaining their beliefs about urban fringe forests. Overall, the study revealed that urban residents are characterized by a heterogeneous set of beliefs concerning urban fringe forests. Recognizing these multiple beliefs in urban fringe forest development processes may help mitigate future conflicts between forest visitors, urban planners, forest owners and forest managers, thus enhancing our way toward good urban living environments.

AB  - In 2015, the Swedish government allocated 130 million SEK to Aga rum ('Taking Place'): a three-year program of arts projects across Sweden to address low voter turnout in certain housing areas, but which, in effect, target the immigrants. We argue-through a short account of Foucault's take on the state, biopolitics, race, and governmentalisation-that this is an example of contemporary state racism, which is best understood as an inextricable part of biopolitical governmentalisation through forms of veridiction. We further analyse a specific governmental program (Aga rum) and a specific project (anonymised) within that program which takes place in two Miljonprogrammet housing areas in Malmo. Although both the program and the project have clear political agendas of empowerment and anti-exclusion, we argue that they nevertheless end up producing racial divisions and what we call a 'racial archipelago.'

AB  - Continuous cover forestry (CCF) is a type of forest management which is based on ecological principles and avoids clearfelling as much as possible. A specialised form of CCF is the selection system which relies on inhomogeneous size structures in mixed-species forests and on the harvesting of individual dominant trees. The selection system was originally invented by upland farmers in Central Europe some 500 years ago and is fairly uncommon in Northern Europe. In our research, we studied two more or less mono-species Picea abies selection forests at Siljansfors in Central Sweden that have a comparatively low final stem diameter of 50 cm. We involved dynamic demographic equilibrium modelling to identify an ideal size structure as a reference that ensures sustainability. We compared this reference with the observed empirical stem-diameter distributions and found that both stands are indeed advancing towards the structure typical of single-tree selection systems. One stand is particularly close to this ideal, sustainable structure whilst the other requires more goal-orientated management in the future. Our research confirmed that selection forests with largely only one conifer species and a fairly small final diameter are possible at this latitude. We could also show that the dynamic demographic model can be converted to a simpler static model that is easier to apply in forest practice. Since selection stands are rare in Fennoscandia, the two stands studied at Siljansfors have been and will continue to be important research and management demonstration sites in the future.

AB  - The management of large carnivores in multiuse landscapes is always controversial, and managers need to balance a wide range of competing interests. Hunter harvest is often used to limit population size and distribution but is proving to be both controversialand technically challenging. Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) are currently managed as a game species in Norway. We describe an adaptive management approach where quota setting is based on an annual census and chart the population development through the period 1996-2008, as management has become significantly more sophisticated and better informed by the increased availability of scientific data. During this period the population has been through a period of high quotas and population decline caused by fragmented management authority and overoptimistic estimates of lynx reproduction, followed by a period of recovery due to quota reductions. The modern management regime is placed in the context of shifting policy during the last 160 years, during which management goals have moved from extermination stimulated by bounties, through a short phase of protection, and now to quota-regulated harvest. Much management authority has also been delegated from central to local levels. We conclude that adaptive management has the potential to keep the population within some bounded limits, although there will inevitably be fluctuation.

AB  - Little is known about needs of grandparents of young children with autism in family and community settings. This study investigated perceived needs of grandparents of preschool-aged children diagnosed with ASD in the cultural context of Sweden. Participants were 120 grandparents of children enrolled into autism intervention programs provided by the public disability services in Stockholm. The Grandparents' Needs Survey and the SDQ Impact supplement were used to collect data. Grandparents expressed most needs in topic areas of information and childcare. No significant relations were found between grandparents' demographics and perceptions of needs; grandparents' needs were predicted by their perceived burden. The findings provide insight into understanding of grandparents' needs essential for planning and provision of quality family-centered early intervention services.

AB  - Bryophytes were inventoried on eight different substrates in plots in the Coast and Cascade Ranges of western Oregon. Tbe relative contribution of each type of substrate towards bryophyte richness was evaluated. Of all substrates, logs in advanced stages of decay had the richest bryophyte flora and supported the greatest percentage of bryophyte landscape-level diversity. Such logs also contributed the greatest number of liverworts unique to a substrate type, while mineral soil contributed the greatest number of unique mosses. Hardwood bases, humus, and rocks also added bryophytes not found on any other substrate type. Habitat heterogeneity increases bryophyte diversity in western Oregon forests. Fostering biological and structural legacies characteristic of old growth in young, managed stands would contribute toward forest management from an ecosystem approach by fostering habitat complexity and biodiversity in the course of harvesting timber.

AB  - Collaborative innovation approaches, such as innovation labs, have the potential to enhance innovation in experience-based sectors. However, they are rare and understudied. This study investigates the facilitation of innovation lab projects in experience-based sectors. The theory of transformational leadership and team learning is explored in the context of four idea-generating lab projects in Norway. This multi-case study involves two cases that focused on meal experiences and two on cultural experiences. The findings show that short-term team learning can be facilitated using the four transformational leadership dimensions. This study contributes to leadership theory by identifying 10 new sub-dimensions within three of the dimensions. These include three new sub-dimensions within the inspirational motivation dimension, two within the intellectual stimulation dimension, and five within the individualized consideration dimension. The findings have practical implications for the facilitation of learning and ideation in tourism innovation labs.

AB  - The global challenges of today are many, and one of the most concerning aspects relates to food production for an increasing global population. The sustainability of doing 'more of the same thing' is being increasingly called into question. Several sustainable business model frameworks have been presented in recent years to address these challenges, but our knowledge is limited about the change processes of the agricultural sector. This paper aims to increase our understanding of how sustainable business models have developed in the agricultural sector in Sweden. It maps eight archetypes of sustainable business models, clustered in three groups, with a focus on the technological, social, and organisational innovation components at agri-food companies. The study takes a quantitative, methodological approach, conducting a telephone survey with owners and managers of 1143 agri-food companies in Sweden, and using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the analysis. The paper provides empirical evidence on the various options for sustainable business models that Swedish agri-food companies use. No major differences were found with respect to technical or social innovation components in the three regions: East, south, and north Sweden. However, significant differences were found between the regions with respect to the organisational innovation component. The organisational innovation component is based on two sustainable business model archetypes, namely, repurpose for society/environment and develop scale up solutions. North Sweden had a higher degree of organisational innovation than both south and east Sweden. The reason for this could be the larger environmental, economic, and organizational challenges in north Sweden compared to the rest of the country, which makes the need for innovation stronger. The paper also suggests new areas for researchers and practical avenues for stakeholders in the agricultural sector (and other industries) to translate social and environmental value creation into economic profit and competitive advantage. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use sustainable business model archetypes in an empirical setting in the agricultural sector.

AB  - The worldwide decline in bees and other pollinating insects is a threat to biodiversity and food security, and urgent action must be taken to stop and then reverse this decline. An established cause of the insect decline is the use of harmful pesticides in agriculture. This case study focuses on the use of pesticides in Norwegian apple production and considers who among farmers, consumers and public authorities is most responsible for protecting bees against harmful pesticides. The extent to which these three different groups consider themselves responsible and the degree to which they are trusted by each of the other groups are also studied. This empirical study involves both qualitative interviews with Norwegian apple farmers, consumers and public authorities and survey data from consumers and farmers. The results show that consumers consider public authorities and farmers equally responsible for protecting bees, while farmers are inclined to consider themselves more responsible. Farmers, consumers and public authorities do not consider consumers significantly responsible for protecting bees, and consumers have a high level of trust in both farmers and public authorities regarding this matter. This study also finds that a low level of consumer trust in farmers or public authorities increases consumers' propensity to purchase organic food, suggesting that those who do not trust that enough action is adopted to protect the environment take on more individual responsibility. This paper adds to the existing literature concerning the allocation of responsibility for environmental outcomes, with empirical evidence focusing specifically on pesticides and bees.

AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels, e.g. coal, is one of the anthropogenic sources of hazardous trace element emissions. This interlaboratory study was arranged to test and improve the quality of trace element analysis of different types of samples from a coal-fired power plant. Samples of coal, fly ash, by-product from flue gas desulphurisation (=FGD product, consisting mainly of CaSO3 and CaSO4), and two different absorption media used for the sampling of vaporous metals and metalloids in flue gases were sent to be analyzed for Al, As, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Tl, V and Zn by different Finnish laboratories using mainly atomic spectroscopic methods. In addition, neutron activation analysis and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were employed. 12 laboratories took part in the analysis of a HNO3 sample, 5 in the analysis of a K2Cr2O7/HNO3 sample, 15 in the analysis of a fly ash sample, 9 in the analysis of a coal sample, and 7 in the analysis of a sample of the by-product from flue gas desulphurisation. The results were evaluated both in terms of interlaboratory agreement and in comparison with different digestion and analytical methods used in the intercomparison. The magnitude of the deviations of the results clearly indicated a need to develop the quality of power plant sample analysis. Considering the methods used, it was concluded that the composition of the acid mixture used for the digestion of solid samples is more decisive than the method of heating during the digestion.

TI  - Ingvar Ambjornsen's nordic noir
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCANDINAVIAN STUDIES
LA  - German
AB  - This article considers links between contemporary Norwegian writer Ingvar Ambjornsen's novel Natten drommer om dagen (2012; The night dreams of the day) and the concept of noir, both in relation to more traditional film noir, to classic hardboiled crime fiction, and to the recent trend in crime fiction and television known popularly as "Nordic noir". The author argues that Ambjornsen reworks key elements of noir aesthetics and thematics, for example relocating the setting from the more typical "urban jungle" to an equally dark and brooding forest landscape. Ambjornsen simultaneously activates and dismantles tropes associated with both Norwegian identity (nature, the vacation cabin) and with noir (the anti-hero, the femme fatale) to create a complex social critique of late modern Norwegian society.

AB  - Semi-natural habitats are key elements between cultivated and natural areas. Ditch boundaries, buffer zones, barn areas and woodland patches were analyzed in Toholampi, Ylane, Nurmijarvi and Liperi localities in Finland over the period 1954-1998 by means of indicators for semi-natural areas, based on calculations of the sum of patch densities (PDsum) and the sum of patch areas (CA(sum)). There were only a few semi-natural habitats left by the late 1990s. The sharpest decrease in PDsum indicator values, by 90%, was found for Ylane, while the corresponding drops in the figures for Nurmijarvi, Toholampi and Liperi were 77, 65 and 59%, respectively. The CA(sum) indicator showed a similar trend. The indicators were tested by calculating the metapopulation capacity of the barn areas. The use of CA(sum) is suggested for semi-natural patches as a quick, cheap and robust monitoring tool and indicator of change in biodiversity value in agricultural landscapes. The indicator PDsum may be important to interpret landscape and habitat changes when attention needs to be paid to the mosaic of landscape elements. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to see how awareness of sustainable development and environmental justice can be increased and operationalized in planning through the use of scenarios. On scrutinizing four long-term urban development strategies for Stockholm, we found that they all intend to depict a sustainable urban development, but the resultant images are very different. This article underlines the importance of combining environmental justice with an understanding of environmental threats and risks. We see that the carrying capacity of nature is limited, but we also see the need to share resources justly and make sure that environmental degradation does not systematically strike certain groups only. The conceptual elements are applied to four scenarios for a future Stockholm, zooming in to some extent on a suburban shopping node just outside the city. The point of focusing on it is that such shopping areas are sometimes seen as symbols of non-sustainable city development, but, since they are already in place, their function in the future city needs to be discussed.

AB  - Climate change is expected to significantly affect forestry in the coming decades. Thus, it is important to raise awareness of climate-related risks - and opportunities - among forest stakeholders, and engage them in adaptation. However, many social barriers have been shown to hinder adaptation, including perceptions of climate change as irrelevant or not urgent, underestimates of adaptive capacity and lack of trust in climate science. This study looks into how science-based learning experiences can help overcome social barriers to adaptation, and how learning in itself may be hindered by those barriers. The study examines the role of learning in engagement with climate change adaptation with the help of the theory of transformative learning. Our analysis is based on follow-up interviews conducted with 24 Swedish forestry stakeholders who had participated in a series of focus group discussions about climate change impacts and adaptation measures. We find that many stakeholders struggled to form an opinion based on what they perceived as uncertain and contested scientific knowledge. The study concludes that engagement with climate change adaptation can be increased if the scientific knowledge addresses the needs, objectives and aspirations of stakeholders and relates to their previous experiences with climate change and extreme weather events.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the environmental consequences of local small-scale versus centralized large-scale bread production and the potential for self-sufficiency in bread in a Swedish island community. Mills and bakeries located on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea were compared with large-scale production systems on the Swedish mainland. The results show that bread production in local bakeries requires more total energy input per kilogram of bread than the industrial bakery, mainly due to inefficient technology. On the other hand, the analysis shows that emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx are smaller from bread produced in the small local bakeries than from big bakeries on the Swedish mainland. This is because the transportation routes are much shorter for bread from the small bakeries and because oil is more frequently used for heating the ovens in large and medium sized bakeries. The present local production of hour on Gotland does not satisfy the local demand, but there is a potential for increased self-sufficiency. Farms on the island produce large amounts of bread grain, but only a small fraction (20%) is used in local flour production, while the rest is exported or used as animal fodder. Thus the region has a large potential to produce enough flour for its local population and thus to become less dependent on imports. However. using more locally produced bread grain to produce flour in local mills, improving energy efficiency in small-scale mills and bakeries, changing consumer behavior and internalizing environmental costs of transportation are crucial measures in achieving this goal.

AB  - The impacts of climate change such as extreme heat waves are exacerbated in cities where most of the world's population live. Quantifying urbanization impacts on ambient air temperatures (Tair) has relevance for human health risk, building energy use efficiency, vector-borne disease control and urban biodiversity. Remote sensing of urban climate has been focused on land surface temperature (LST) due to a scarcity of data on Tair which is usually interpolated at 1 km resolution. We assessed the efficacy of mapping hyperlocal Tair (spatial resolutions of 10-30 m) over Oslo, Norway, by integrating Sentinel, Landsat and LiDAR data with crowd-sourced Tair measurements from 1310 private weather stations during 2018. Using Random Forest regression modelling, we found that annual mean, daily maximum and minimum Tair can be mapped with an average RMSE of 0.52 degrees C (R-2 = 0.5), 1.85 degrees C (R-2 = 0.05) and 1.46 degrees C (R-2 = 0.33), respectively. Mapping accuracy decreased sharply with < 250 weather stations (approx. 1 station km(-2)) and remote sensing data averaged within a 100-500 m buffer zone around each station maximized accuracy. Further, models performed best outside of summer months when the spatial variation in temperatures were low and wind velocities were high. Finally, accuracies were not evenly distributed over space and we found the lowest mapping errors in the local climate zone characterized by compact lowrise buildings which are most relevant to city residents. We conclude that this method is transferable to other cities given there was little difference (0.02 degrees C RMSE) between models trained on open- (satellite and terrain) vs closed-source (LiDAR) remote sensing data. These maps can provide a complement to and validation of traditional urban canopy models and may assist in identifying hyperlocal hotspots and coldspots of relevance to urban planners.

AB  - Snow quality and its variations due to distance from the road were,studied. Also, how the snow quality changes over time during the melting period was discussed. Snow samples were collected at three occasions during the winter of 2004. The samples were taken along a highway in the Lulea region, Sweden, with an average daily traffic load of 9,200 vehicles. Snow samples were taken perpendicular to the road and at different distances. The snow samples were analysed for metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Also, weather parameters such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed and wind direction were measured. The highest total metal and PAH concentrations were found at the sample site closest to the road and at the end of the season. Before the melting period started, 42-57% of the total amount of metals and PAH were found in the first 1 m of the snow pack. This information could be valuable when one is discussing how to achieve sustainable snow-handling management.

AB  - Emulation of natural disturbances is often regarded as a key measure to make forestry biodiversity-oriented. Consequently, extraction of logging residues is assumed to have little negative effect in comparison to extraction of dead wood mainly formed at natural disturbances. This is consistent with the evolutionary species pool hypothesis, which suggests that most species are evolutionary adapted to the naturally most abundant habitats. We tested this hypothesis for dead-wood-dependent macrofungi, lichens, and beetles in a boreal forest landscape in central Sweden, assuming that species are adapted to conditions similar to today's unmanaged forest. No occurrence patterns, for the species groups which we investigated, were consistent with the hypothesis. Overall, stumps and snags had the highest habitat quality (measured as average population density with equal weight given to each species) and fine woody debris the lowest, which was unexpected, since stumps were the rarest dead-wood type in unmanaged forest. We conclude that the evolutionary species pool concept did not explain patterns of species' occurrences, and for two reasons, the concept is not reliable as a general rule of thumb: (1) what constitute habitats harbouring different species communities can only be understood from habitat-specific studies and (2) the suitability of habitats is affected by their biophysical characteristics. Thus, emulation of natural disturbances may promote biodiversity, but empirical studies are needed for each habitat to understand how natural disturbances should be emulated. We also conclude that stump extraction for bioenergy is associated with larger risks for biodiversity than fine woody debris extraction.

AB  - Human-induced fragmentation affects forest continuity, i.e. availability of a suitable habitat for the target species over a time period. The dependence of wood-inhabiting fungi on landscape level continuity has been well demonstrated, but the importance of local continuity has remained controversial. In this study, we explored the effects of local forest continuity (microhabitat and stand level) on the diversity of wood-inhabiting fungi on standing dead trunks of Scots pine (Paws sylvestris L.). We studied species richness and community composition of decomposers and Micarea lichens on 70 trunks in 14 forests in central Finland that differed in their state of continuity. We used dendrochronological methods to assess the detailed history of each study trunk, i.e. the microhabitat continuity. The stand continuity was estimated as dead wood diversity and past management intensity (number of stumps). We recorded 107 species (91 decomposers, 16 Micarea lichens), with a total of 510 occurrences. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found that none of the variables explained decomposer species richness, but that Micarea species richness was positively dependent on the time since tree death. Dead wood diversity was the most important variable determining the composition of decomposer communities. For Micarea lichens, the community composition was best explained by the combined effect of years from death, site and dead wood diversity. However, these effects were rather tentative. The results are in line with those of previous studies suggesting the restricted significance of local forest continuity for wood-inhabiting fungi. However, standing dead pines that have been available continuously over long periods seem to be important for species-rich communities of Micarea lichens. Rare specialists (e.g. on veteran trees) may be more sensitive to local continuity, and should be at the center of future research.

AB  - A changing climate reshapes the range distribution of many organisms, and species with relatively low thermal optima, like many salmonids, are increasingly expected to face local population extinctions at lower latitudes. Understanding where and how fast these changes are happening is of pivotal importance for successful mitigation and conservation efforts.We used an extensive electrofishing database to explore temporal trends of juveniles of brown trout Salmo trutta in 218 locations from 174 Swedish streams, over the last 30 years (1991-2020). We hypothesized that 1) declines in abundance have occurred predominately in the warmer, southern regions, while increases have occurred in the colder, northern regions, 2) larger stream sizes may partly offset negative effects of climate, and 3) migrating and resident populations are affected differently by a warming climate.We found that abundance of brown trout juveniles generally declined in warmer regions especially in smaller streams (<= 6 m wide), while the abundance increased in colder regions. In larger streams, negative effects of higher temperatures were seemingly buffered, as we found lower rates of decline or even positive trends. The rate of change (i.e. the slopes of the trends in abundance) was more pronounced towards the climate extremes, and was on average zero in regions with a normal annual air temperature (average temperature over 30 year period) around 5-6 degrees C. Warmer climate had stronger effects on migrating compared to resident populations, suggesting that climate-induced loss of stream connectivity could be an additional factor that hinders recruitment in anadromous populations in a changing climate.Considering predictions of increasing temperatures and frequency of summer droughts, management of cold-water salmonid populations should focus on conserving and restoring riparian vegetation, wetlands, climate and thermal refugia, and habitat integrity overall. Such measures may, however, not suffice for small streams at lower latitudes, unless hydrological connectivity is maintained.

AB  - Strategies to promote environmentally friendly behavior among consumers require an understanding of how such behaviors are interrelated. We examined 29 different environmentally significant behaviors, using data from surveys in Germany (n = 967) and in Norway (n = 880). A priori models derived from previous research assuming either environmental behavior as a single factor or as organized by behavioral sectors, degrees of constraint, or frequencies of occurrence did not fit the data. In contrast, a model developed via a bottom-up approach with the German data was supported by the independent, Norwegian sample. This model can integrate several theoretical perspectives and suggests three distinct behavioral fields, with little or no correlation: home-based actions, car use, and air travel for vacation. The factor home-based actions encompasses several behaviors and correlates with the New Ecological Paradigm scale but also with a measure of impression management. Implications for understanding and influencing environmentally significant behaviors are discussed.

AB  - This paper investigates the shaping of urban public transport by comparing `alternative leading objects' to the car in the Norwegian cities Trondheim and Bergen. These have chosen different transport technologies, bus and light rail respectively. I draw on the concept of technological frames and illustrate how interpretations and expectations of sustainable urban mobility guide transport planning. The paper contributes to discussions in STS by exploring technological frames as ongoing practices instead of as outcomes, and as performed by what I identify as two framing coalitions. Both coalitions emphasised that Trondheim and Bergen represented different city identities and topographies. The paper demonstrates the importance of making such identities and representations of public transport systems in particular urban contexts in order to replace a car-dominated transport system. The paper draws on an observational study in two transport offices, interviews with transport planners and politicians and document studies.

AB  - Wood stoves emit particulate matter when used for domestic heating. Consequently, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning in Sweden enforced a prohibition of new installations of old wood stoves in 2017 to protect the public health. The prohibition caused a public backlash that organized itself as a "wood stove rising", eventually leading to a cancellation of the new legislation in 2019. We performed comprehensive interviews with 11 signatories of the original appeal to analyze the underlying motives for combating the implementation of this pro-environmental energy policy. We find that domestic heating through fire-making is an age-old human behavior that is deeply connected to several social and emotional human needs, but also to survival in remote areas with cold climate. The likelihood of policy observance and acceptance is higher if the policy is not perceived as being in direct conflict with these needs: basic emotion regulation, sensations of tradition and connection to other people, and means of crisis management for the individual. We also find that the protesters acted out of a sustainability perspective, albeit one where the continued use of functional devices was valued more than the perceived wear-and-tear of replacing outdated technology.

AB  - This paper discusses processes of emotionalisation and commodification at home and work, a theme that has been a focus of Arlie Hochschild's research in the USA over the last four decades. What happens when you look at similar processes within another national frame? The American experience is contrasted to that of two periods of rapid cultural and economic change in Swedish society during the early 1970s and late 1990s. Some similarities and differences in the emotional economies of these two periods are explored. My perspective is ethnological, with a focus on changes in the emotional landscape of everyday life. The main argument is that a historical perspective can capture some of the contradictory and many stranded aspects of both commodification and de-commodification processes.

KW  - AGRICULTURE
AB  - This paper deals with the demographic and socio-economic development in the Archipelago Sea Region in southwestern Finland in recent decades. The most important finding is that the region has fared rather well during recent decades, even during the first half of the 1990s, when the rest of Finland was hit by a severe economic crisis. Two factors seem to have influenced the relatively favourable development in the archipelago. On the one hand, the region has specific cultural, social and economic traditions that have enabled it to adapt to new challenges; and on the other hand, certain welfare, regional and other policies seem to have favoured the region to some extent. A general conclusion from the study is that there is a need for a broader theory of rural development than those theories currently being used. The most important feature of such a theory would be its use in providing general interpretations of regional development, even if each region has completely different economic foundations and its own development logic.

AB  - The article explores the processes designer-makers and communities should engage in before using service design approaches to produce creative tourism experiences. These processes can yield insights into the inner processes and interactions with external environments of creative individuals and communities. Case studies from Finnish Lapland and Namibia show the importance of identity construction, creativity and storytelling for context mapping. The article presents a practical and flexible mapping tool that has been derived from these case studies. This tool can be expanded and applied by designer-makers for practical mapping activities. The findings indicate that creative tourism involving designer-makers can provide new tourism opportunities that not only generate deeply relevant experiences for tourists but also sustainable livelihoods for local designer-makers.

Four scenarios were analyzed, two in Sweden and two in Canada. Resource and energy consumption, and emissions to air, water and soil of conventional and biomass dedicated supply chains were evaluated and compared.
   The Swedish supply chains showed a better environmental profile, on average, per oven dry tonne (0Dt) than the Canadian ones in the regions studied. In terms of climate change potential the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated 48.8 kg CO2-eq, 13%, 30% and 38% lower than Swedish conventional, Canadian biomass dedicated and Canadian conventional supply chains, respectively. Sawlogs from final felling in the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated 34.2 kg CO2-eq, the lowest emissions within the roundwood assortments. Concerning the forest fuel assortments in form of wood chips, pulpwood from final felling in the Swedish conventional supply chains, and stump core and long tops from final felling in the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated the lowest emissions: 48.9 kg CO2-eq, 52.3 Kg CO2-eq and 57.8 kg CO2-eq respectively. Transport from forest to industry, harvesting, extraction, chipping, and crushing were identified as hotspots in the forest supply chains. Forwarding versus skidding, chipping and transportation were the processes that differed the most between countries.
   In both countries, when the supply chains were biomass dedicated the environmental impacts per ODt were lower than in the conventional supply chains. Therefore, integrating forest fuel supply with industrial wood harvesting has the potential to reduce emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interaction between cultural development and the natural environment is generally accepted. Holocene climate change is described as one of the main environmental factors behind a step-wise development of the cultural landscape in Northwest Europe. Seven periods of human impact changes-5900, 5500, 4500, 3800, 3000-2800, 1500 and 1100 cal. BP-are defined and compared with reconstructed climatic scenarios, based on insolation, glacier activity, lake and sea levels, bog growth, tree line, and tree growth. There is a positive correlation between human impact/land-use and climate change, although precise correlations are difficult because of weaknesses in the chronology. Future studies of annually laminated (varved) lake sediments and wiggle-matched radiocarbon sequences are emphasized, as well as a combination of palaeoecology and archaeology. It is hypothesized that agrarian society and the landscape developed step-wise, dependent on the interaction between the technological/social complex and the ecological capacity of a region, highly influenced by climate.

AB  - Deadwood provides key habitats for a variety of forest species. Thereby, not only deadwood quantity, but also its quality (dimensions and decay stages) as well as its spatial distribution is of importance for the presence of specific species, but assessments of these properties are rare. We provide a comprehensive analysis of deadwood characteristics in seven Norway spruce (Picea abies) dominated natural forest reserves in Swiss mountain regions, with a particular focus on lying deadwood.
   On average, the reserves featured lying deadwood volumes of 80 +/- 23 m(3)/ha (range 1-343 m(3)/ha), generally consisting of large dimensions and advanced decomposition stages, two features particularly important for saproxylic species. Standing deadwood volumes averaged 32 +/- 23 m(3)/ha (range 2-124 m(3)/ha). These values of deadwood quantity and quality are comparable to or even higher than in other deciduous and coniferous forest reserves across Europe. With respect to the spatial distribution of deadwood, we found two patterns of tree fall: (1) wind disturbances resulted in uniformly oriented lying deadwood (i.e., logs having similar orientation), and (2) small-scale, stand-internal mortality causing rather randomly oriented logs.
   Traces of former management are still visible in the study plots, and the investigated forest reserves do not feature the characteristics of virgin forests yet. Nevertheless, our results are helpful to elaborate and examine biodiversity strategies with respect to targeted deadwood levels in managed forests.

CP  - Conference on Implementing the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries
AB  - The Bergen Conference was a follow-up to the Reykjavik Conference in 2001 and was organized by the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Governments of Iceland and Norway, with technical support from the FAO. The aims of the Conference were to review concepts and share experiences from implementation, and to identify strategies and best practices that will facilitate further implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). The Conference was organized with four sessions on concepts and strategies, knowledge base, approaches and tools, and experiences from case studies, followed by a fifth session on the way forward.
   Many terms have been used in relation to the ecosystem approach (EA), but we are converging towards a common understanding of the concept. With respect to fisheries, the EA has two dimensions: a vertical dimension of application of the EAF and a horizontal dimension of integration of fisheries with other sectors into a holistic management framework. The EA is a strategy and not a 'blueprint' action plan, and its application needs to be tailored to the specific ecological, social and cultural conditions in each geographical area. Application of the EA may start with present knowledge, but more focused ecosystem research is needed to make it more effective, and limited knowledge requires added precautions. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) may be an important tool to apply in an EAF, as may the use of marine protected areas (MPAs) in combination with other management measures. An EAF can be kept simple and implemented incrementally from existing measures in fisheries management.

AB  - Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is recognized as important to fostering sustainable natural resource development in the Circumpolar North. Governments are playing an increasingly active role in promoting and shaping CSR initiatives, often in collaboration with Indigenous communities and industry. This paper explores the role of CSR in mining for improving socio-economic and environmental management practice. The article argues that government instituted regulations can lead to the development and implementation of CSR practices by mining companies. To examine the relationship between government requirements and CSR, we use two Northern case studies: Cameco Corporation's uranium mining operations located in Saskatchewan, Canada and Northern Iron's iron mining operation located in Troms and Finnmark county, Norway. Through an in-depth review of scholarly literature, document analysis, and semi-structured interviews, our findings suggest that the role of the state in the initiation and implementation of CSR is of much greater importance than is currently acknowledged in the literature. In the case of Cameco, the Mine Surface Lease Agreements agreed to by the corporation and the provincial government provided motivation for the development and implementation of their world-renowned CSR practices, resulting in a community-based environmental monitoring program and benefits for both the company and surrounding communities. With Northern Iron's operations in Kirkenes, working hour requirements instituted by the Norwegian Government allowed for significantly higher levels of local employment. Our findings suggest a greater role exists for government to facilitate the adoption of CSR policies, contributing in turn to improved socio-economic and environmental outcomes for Northern communities.

AB  - "Balanced Harvesting" (BH) has been suggested as a possible strategy to meet the objectives of the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries, ensuring a high sustainable yield while maintaining ecosystem structure and function. BH proposes a moderate fishing mortality in proportion to productivity spread across the widest possible range of species, stocks, and sizes in an ecosystem producing a sustainable and overall non-selective harvest. The Norwegian and Barents Seas have been subjected to moderate fishing pressure on commercial species, and elements of an ecosystem-based approach to management for many years, but not the fishing pattern proposed by BH. By using an Atlantis ecosystem model of the Nordic and Barents Seas, we investigated the effects of applying a BH regime to a region with existing successful fisheries management. This was done by running simulations with combinations of historic fishing pressure and fishing mortality rates proportional to 25% of the productivity of most species and sizes. The simulations were then compared to a control run where the historical fisheries were applied. The model results showed that implementing a BH regime in the Norwegian and Barents Seas would only produce marginal increases in total yields of currently commercially exploited stocks, likely because the Norwegian fisheries are already mostly well-managed. However, expanding the fishery to include species that are not commercially exploited today did produce higher yields, especially on lower trophic levels. This study represents the first attempted examination of implementing BH based on productivity using an Atlantis ecosystem model, as well as the first investigation of BH in the Norwegian and Barents Seas. We use this model as a case study to identify the gains that species-based BH can be expected to give over well-implemented traditional fisheries management rather than simply comparing to an over-exploited system.

AB  - Sustainable transport is one of the key challenges of the UN and EU to ensure to meet society's economic, social and environmental needs whilst minimising undesirable impacts. Sustainability planning may require changing the way we solve transportation problems. From the perspectives of the sustainability, we may assume that the emphasis should move in direction to changing the practice: but exactly what practice and who's practices are to be changed? One way is to investigate gendered mobilities. The main differences in mobility patterns between women and men at a general level, are found in modal choice and travel distance. Women's practices tend to be related to the most sustainable means of transport, while men's practices are related to more unsustainable transport. Relying on studies on transport planning including focus groups, interviews and workshops in Sweden, this paper ties the concepts of gender equality, to contemporary planning and sustainable "smart" mobility, and investigates in what way knowledge about gender equality is elaborated in regional planning practice. It appeared from the interviews that both gender equality and diversity were perceived as difficult in regional transport planning and that more knowledge and experience were needed. It was pointed out that there existed some knowledge but that there were no structures for how it could be incorporated into the planning process. Noticeable are conflicting practices, while policy on gender equality are attached to the planning there are still beliefs that transport planning can be gender neutral and free from social impacts. The smart mobility approach promises improvements of mobility and access opportunities for all.

AB  - Wind power is a renewable source of great value for the sustainable development of society in the context of global environmental changes. This power source features many advantages such as accessibility, inexhaustibility and sustainability, and its harvest and conversion have experienced a rapid growth in both developed and developing countries. The present study aims to geographically analyze the distribution and intensity of onshore wind resources (assessed using the wind power density parameter) globally, continentally and nationally. Using the most recent and detailed global spatial data on wind power density, which were classified after NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) in seven potential classes, our results showed that, globally, there are five major hotspots of abundant wind resources, delimited based on the large-scale presence of the most favourable potential classes, i.e. Excellent (500-600 W/m(2)), Outstanding (600-800 W/m(2)) and Superb (>800 W/m(2)), also called in our paper EOS classes. These hotspots consist of the central-northern region of North America, southern South America, northern/north-western Europe, northern Asia and the central-south-eastern region of the Asian continent. These regions bring together most of the entire global area of EOS classes, which totals similar to 4 mil km(2) or similar to 3% of the world's land area. Continentally, the most extensive EOS areas are found in Asia (similar to 1.5 mil km(2), 3.5% of the continent), followed by North and Central America (similar to 1 mil km(2), 4.3%), South America (similar to 0.7 mil km(2), 4.1%), Europe (similar to 0.5 mil km(2), 5%), Africa (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 0.4%), and Australia and Oceania (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 1.3%). Nationally, it was found there are 8 epicentre-countries for wind potential (with absolute EOS areas that range between 0.1 and almost 1 mil km(2) across the countries), namely China (similar to 0.9 mil km(2), 10% of the country), followed by Canada (similar to 0.6 mil km(2), 6%), the United States (similar to 0.5 mil km(2), 5%), Argentina (similar to 0.4 mil km(2), 14%), Russia (similar to 0.4 mil km(2) in total, in Europe and Asia, 2%), Chile (similar to 0.2 mil km(2), 28%), Norway (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 30%) and Afghanistan (similar to 0.1 mil km(2), 16%). Results show these countries are the most suitable for large-scale wind power installations in the world. Also, our findings not only provide an overall image of wind resources availability worldwide, but they can also be a useful tool for the transition towards a carbon-free global economy, by helping world governments better understand and subsequently use their wind resources at regional or local levels.

AB  - The economic, social and ecological implications of the extraction of mineral resources have been increasingly discussed under the heading of the social licence to operate. In Finland, critical public framings characterized by impressions of failed economic promises, unreliable technology and environmental hazards have dominated the recent mining debate. Operators probing for opportunities to establish new mines have faced critical public reactions. Changes to legislation, natural resource management and corporate responsibility have been demanded in order to effectively address environmental concerns and local social acceptability issues. We studied media representations and planning documents in order to identify the variety of publicly presented concerns related to a planned gold mine and mining company's social licence to operate. Our case study focuses on the planning processes of a gold mine adjacent to an important tourist destination in the Kuusamo municipality in north-east Finland. We highlight the role of public debate on the formation and erosion of legitimacy and the fragility of the social licence to operate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of forest ecology and strategic planning has increased in importance to support the management of mixed-species forests to enhance biodiversity. However, little is known about competitive and facilitative interactions between trees and species in mixed fir-beech-spruce forests, mostly because of a lack of long-term experimental research. In the 1960s, long-term sample plots were established in the Western Carpathians to develop region-specific yield models. Trees in the plots were measured at 5- to 16-year intervals from 1967(69). In 2010, the positions of standing trees in all plots were identified spatially. Stump positions were also identified to record the coordinates of trees that had been removed or had died. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the applicability of widely used competition indices for mature fir-beech-spruce mixed forests and to test whether the tree competition zone changes among species and forest stands of different stocking densities. Results showed that the best competition index was based on the comparison of the basal area of competitors and the subject tree in the radius, which was defined as a function of stand density and species. In addition, beech was found to be a strong self-competitor, which was not the case for silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Results suggest that simpler competition indices are better suited for such diverse forests, as more complex indices do not describe the competition interactions sufficiently well.

AB  - To govern better future landscape planning of high-latitude agricultural systerris, it is necessary to understand fully the drivers that currently determine farmers' land allocation to different crops. The aim of this study was to identify key farm and field characteristics that drive farmers' land allocation, based on substantial datasets, and to benchmark findings for farmer perceptions with interviews. Focus was on characteristics that are easily monitored and facilitate development of a field optimization tool to support future implementation and monitoring processes for land use changes at farm and field scales. Drivers for land allocation to different crops varied between crop production and dairy farms, but less evidently between southern and northern regions. Crop choices differed among regions, being greater for southern than for northern farms, but also for farm types, dairy farms mainly cultivating on-farm feed. Some special crops, such as potato and reed canary grass, represented diversified land use in the northern region, but farmers tended to allocate such crops very strictly to certain types of field and did not diversify crop rotations. Interviewed farmers highlighted the complexity of land allocation and the interactive nature of the drivers. When comparing outcomes of the data analyses and farmers' interviews, field size, distance from farm center and soil type were considered to be primary drivers for land allocation. Field shape, slope and land ownership, but only in the case of long-term contract periods, were hidden drivers, identified using statistical analyses, but were not specifically referred to by farmers. Proximity to waterways was the only field characteristic classified as unimportant. Farmers highlighted logistical advantages as an important driver for land allocation, which was confirmed by data analyses. A farmer's justification process for land allocation is likely to be based on intergenerational transitive knowledge and concepts of operationally critical farm and field characteristics. Valuable, empirical information gained during this study needs to be coupled with the development of policy measures to develop effective future policy instruments that are not only practicable, but are easily implemented and cost-effective, while remaining coherent with other policies.

AB  - The wild boar has, over the past few decades, undergone an expansion in Europe, which may have negatively affected ground-nesting bird populations and particularly those of wading birds. The aim of this study was to evaluate predation on waders' nests by wild boar in Sweden, where this species has been increasing since its reintroduction. This was done by placing artificial nests in seven different study areas. A comparison was then made of predation rates of the nests placed on control plots (areas in which no wild boar were present but other predators were) and plots containing different abundances of wild boar. Contrary to our expectations, the proportion of nests predated was significantly lower in those areas in which wild boar were present, with a predation rate of 54 %, whereas the predation rate was 87.5 % in the others. The wild boar was identified as the second most important nest predator in the plots in which it was present, accounting for 18 % of the predated nests. The main predator on both types of plots was the red fox, which was responsible for 28 and 38.5 % of the predated nests on plots with/without wild boar, respectively. Interestingly, predation by badgers occurred principally in areas in which the wild boar was absent (34.5 % of the predated nests), whereas only one nest was predated by this predator in areas containing wild boar. It is not, however, possible to state whether predation by badgers was lower because of the presence of wild boar or whether this was owing to the fact that badgers do not select those particular patches because of habitat features.

AB  - In Norway, the boreal forest offers a considerable resource base, and emerging technologies may soon make it commercially viable to convert these resources into low-carbon biofuels. Decision makers are required to make informed decisions about the environmental implications of wood biofuels today that will affect the medium-and long-term development of a wood-based biofuels industry in Norway. We first assess the national forest-derived resource base for use in biofuel production. A set of biomass conversion technologies is then chosen and evaluated for scenarios addressing biofuel production and consumption by select industry sectors. We then apply an environmentally extended, mixed-unit, two-region input-output model to quantify the global warming mitigation and fossil fuel displacement potentials of two biofuel production and consumption scenarios in Norway up to 2050. We find that a growing resource base, when used to produce advanced biofuels, results in cumulative global warming mitigation potentials of between 58 and 83 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents avoided (Mt-CO2-eq.-avoided) in Norway, depending on the biofuel scenario. In recent years, however, the domestic pulp and paper industry-due to increasing exposure to international competition, capacity reductions, and increasing production costs-has been in decline. In the face of a declining domestic pulp and paper industry, imported pulp and paper products are required to maintain the demand for these goods and thus the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the exporting region embodied in Norway's pulp and paper imports reduce the systemwide benefit in terms of avoided greenhouse gas emissions by 27%.

AB  - A survey of the patterns of lignicolous fungi to record occurrence of fruitbodies on fallen logs of Picea abies. has been performed. Ninetythree forest stands with different ages, ecology and histories of management in Sor-Trondelag County, Central Norway were investigated. In each stand an investigation plot of 40 m diameter was established, in which five logs were randomly selected. Environmental variables of the logs and plots and geographical positions of the plots were recorded. The numerical methods used include detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   A total of 140 species of Aphyllophorales, Agaricales with eccentrically attached caps, heterobasiodomycetes, and prominent ascomycetes and deuteromycetes were registered. More than one third of the species were only found once. The main gradient in the data set was shown to be related to decay. The second gradient was related to size of the logs and some forest management variables (in addition to decay). Of the variation in composition of the species, 13.8 % can be ascribed to solely environmental variance, 6 % to solely spatial structure, and only 0.8 % to the combination of the environment and spatial component of variation. The results are discussed in the light of wood decay, forest management, and landscape fragmentation.

AB  - 1. Throughout the most recent glacial period (Weichsel), the mountain hare Lepus timidus had a continuous distribution in the tundra habitat south of the ice-rim. When the ice retreated, mountain hares colonized deglaciated land, and spread over northern Europe.
   2. Since the Weichsel, the mountain hare's distribution in Europe has been gradually reduced and at present comprises Ireland and the Scottish Highlands, high altitudes in the Alps, isolated forests in eastern Poland, most of Fennoscandia and from the Baltic countries eastwards through Russia. Declines during the last century have been observed in Sweden and Russia.
   3. This review defines and evaluates causes for this gradual reduction and fragmentation of the mountain hare's distribution, with special focus on interactions with brown hares Lepus europaeus . The relative importance of diseases, predation, cultivation and interactions with other herbivores than brown hares are discussed.
   4. A plausible cause of the possible permanent disappearance of mountain hares in Europe appears to be exclusion by interspecific competition and hybridization with, and/or epidemic diseases mediated by, the congeneric brown hare.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of beneficial externality generated by the World Heritage List (WHL) on residential property values in order to offer new insights into heritage discourses. Design/methodology/approach The study uses the hedonic price model to estimate empirically the difference in prices for residential properties located in the Old Rauma World Heritage. The study uses residential sales transaction data from the City of Rauma from January 2005 to September 2012 drawn from an online database called KVKL Hintaseurantapalvelu managed by the Central Federation of Finnish Real Estate Agencies. Findings The research results indicate a positive, but insignificant, relationship between the property sale prices (euros/sqm) and heritage designation. However, the total sale prices are higher in Old Rauma as the properties are significantly larger in Old Rauma compared to other properties in Rauma. Originality/value Studies in heritage economics have assessed the influence of the property market on heritage listing and designation at either the national level, the local level or a mix of national/local levels. This paper contributes to the literature by analysing the impact of a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) world heritage designation on residential property values. UNESCO is the leading global institution which deals with the protection of heritage sites that transcend national and local boundaries.

AB  - The study involved 121 samples of the common weed, Lactuca serriola L. (prickly lettuce), representing 53 populations from Sweden and Slovenia. The seed materials, originating from different habitats, were regenerated and taxonomically validated at the Department of Botany, Palacky University in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The morphological characterizations of the collected plant materials classified all 121 samples as L. serriola f. serriola; one sample was heterogeneous, and also present was L. serriola f. integrifolia. Differences in the amount and distribution of the genetic variations between the two regions were analyzed using 257 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and 7 microsatellite (SSRs) markers. Bayesian clustering and Neighbor-Network were used for visualization of the differences among the samples by country. Under the Bayesian approach, the best partitioning (according to the most frequent signals) was resolved into three groups. While the absence of an admixture or low admixture was detected in the Slovenian samples, and the majority of the Swedish samples, a significant admixture was detected in the profiles of five Swedish samples collected near Malmo, which bore unique morphological features of their rosette leaves. The Neighbor-Network analysis divided the samples into 6 groups, each consisting of samples coming from a particular country. Reflection of morphology and eco-geographical conditions in genetic variation are also discussed.

AB  - Social and economic characteristics of a fishery are crucial for reaching sustainability and balance in the use of Fish resources. This study focuses on the survival struggle of small-scale commercial Fisheries in an archipelago context. Throughout the centuries, fishing, shipping, and agriculture have been combined and interlinked in the Finnish Archipelago Sea region. Fishermen have coped with the changes in their environment by leaning on the economic flexibility provided from a variety of household income sources. As a tradition the Fishermen have also relied on the support from the local community. The pluriactivity nature of the livelihood is still important, but the combinations have changed. Along with the transformation to a service-oriented welfare society, primary production from sea and land has currently less importance for the households-people are increasingly dependent on wage work especially in the public sector. In spite of this change in economic weight, fishing and fishermen are still-valued among the local communities and the survival of commercial fishing is locally strongly highlighted in the political arena.

AB  - Knowing how species' traits relate to processes that underlie occupancy patterns such as colonisation and population persistence, is important for our understanding of how species survive in fragmented and changing landscapes. We used automatic UV light-traps to sample noctuid moths on two remote islands, and compared traits of island occupants with those of a species pool from mainland southeast Sweden. Widely distributed species, generalist species, species with a long adult activity period and species active late in the summer had higher probability of occupancy on the remote islands. The results were consistent between islands. The traits of host plant specificity and species with an adult activity period during late summer remained robust and were statistically significant after controlling for any possible phylogenetic bias. This indicates that species exhibiting those traits survive better when habitat and climate changes. It is crucial to include our results in; (1) conservation planning, e.g. when devising conservation measures in fragmented landscapes; (2) for predictions of future occupancy patterns; and (3) ecosystem impact assessments, e.g. the importance of moths as pollinators, herbivores and being the functional link between parasitoids, plants, consumers and predators.

AB  - The use of biomass derived from fast-growing trees grown on agricultural land is common practice in parts of Sweden, but not in most other European countries. In the first part of this paper the different conditions for economic use of fast growing trees are analysed in Germany and Sweden. Neither the legal framework nor the natural growing conditions are likely to limit the utilisation of the biomass potential in Germany. Rather, lack of a market for biomass products, poor awareness and little infrastructure for the management of woody biomass plantations are limitations in Germany. The second part offers a possible solution for supporting the market and reducing transaction costs during establishment of the market under German conditions. The proposed solution involves the establishment of 'ecological structures' based on fast-growing trees as a means to compensate for sealed land by roads and buildings. The proposed concept would not only extend the economic potential for producing energy from biomass, but also allow farmers to generate income. The concept can serve both economic and ecological goals. It can reduce municipal budget funding and support the agricultural industry in European countries which need to implement sustainable biomass concepts. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives Analyse mortality differences between self-employed and paid employees with a focus on industrial sector, educational level and gender using Swedish register data.
   Methods A cohort of the total working population (4776135 individuals; 7.2% self-employed; 18-100years of age at baseline 2003) in Sweden with a 5-year follow-up (2004-2008) for all-cause and cause-specific mortality (57743 deaths). Self-employed individuals were categorised as sole proprietors or limited liability company (LLC) owners according to their enterprise's legal form. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to compare mortality rates between sole proprietors, LLC owners and paid employees, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders.
   Results Mortality from cardiovascular diseases was 16% lower and from suicide 26% lower among LLC owners than among paid employees, adjusted for confounders. Within the industrial category, all-cause mortality was 13-15% lower among sole proprietors and LLC owners compared with employees in manufacturing and mining (MM) as well as personal and cultural services (PCS), and 11-20% higher in sole proprietors in trade, transport and communication and the welfare industry (W). A significant three-way interaction indicated 17-23% lower all-cause mortality among male LLC owners in MM and female sole proprietors in PCS, and 50% higher mortality in female sole proprietors in W than in employees in the same industries.
   Conclusions Mortality differences between self-employed individuals and paid employees vary by the legal form of self-employment, across industries, and by gender. Differences in work environment exposures and working conditions, varying market competition across industries and gender segregation in the labour market are potential mechanisms underlying these findings.

AB  - Are current estimates of silicate minerals weathering rates precise enough to predict whether nutrient pools will recover after forest harvesting? Answering this question seems crucial for sustainable forestry practices on silicate dominated soils. In this paper, we synthesize estimated Ca and K weathering rates (derived using seven different approaches) from a forested area in northern Sweden (the Svartberget-Krycklan catchment) to evaluate the precision of weathering rate estimates. The methods were: mass-balance budgets (catchment and pedon-scale); long-term weathering losses inferred from weathered soil profiles (using zirconium as a conservative tracer); strontium isotopes (Sr-86/Sr-85) as proxy for catchment export of geogenic Ca; climate based regressions; a steady-state, process-based weathering model (PROFILE) and a dynamic, conceptual catchment geochemistry model (MAGIC). The different methods predict average weathering rates of 0.67 +/- 0.71 g Ca m(-2) year(-1) (mean +/- stdev) and 0.39 +/- 0.38 g K m(-2) year(-1), suggesting a cumulative weathering release during a forest rotation period of 100 years that is the same magnitude as losses induced by forest harvesting at the end of the period. Clearly, forestry practices have the capacity to significantly alter the long-term nutrient status of the soil and cation concentrations in soil-water runoff. However, the precision in weathering estimates are lower than that needed to distinguish between effects on nutrient pools by different forest practices (complete-tree harvesting versus conventional stem only harvest). Therefore, we argue that nutrient budgets, where weathering rates play a crucial role, cannot be used as basis for resolving whether different harvesting techniques will allow nutrient pools to recover within one rotation period. Clearly, this hampers the prerequisite for sound decision making regarding forestry practices on silicate mineral dominated soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the spatial and temporal distribution of forest fires ignited by lightning in Finland. The study was based on all reported lightning-ignited forest fires in Finland for the years from 1985 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2001. There was a strong decreasing gradient in the density of reported lightning-ignited forest fires from south to north, ranging from ca. 0.1 fires/(year 100 km(2)) on the southern coast to less than 0.01 fires/(year 100 km(2)) in the northern Finland. The mean date of reported ignitions was 10 July. A method was developed to estimate the density of unreported lightning-ignited forest fires. Their proportion varied from 70% of all lightning-ignited forest fires in the most sparsely populated municipalities to 63% in the most densely populated rural municipality. The results about the density of reported and estimation of unreported lightning-ignited forest fires indicate that forests in southern Finland would naturally have notably shorter fire intervals than forests in the northern parts of the country. This variability in natural fire regime characteristics suggests that, different forest management and silvicultural approaches should be applied for the maintenance of natural forest structures, processes and biodiversity in different parts of Finland.

AB  - District heating (DH) and combined heat and power (CHP) are often considered complementary green technologies (DH-CHP) that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They are, however, complex given their operation at the intersection of shifting socio-spatial relations and political power struggles. We investigate the political processes behind the diffusion (and blocked diffusion) of DH and CHP in Sweden from 1945 until 2011, considered through the lens of Jessop, Brenner and Jones' (2008) Territory, Place, Scale and Networks (TPSN) framework. Foregrounding the socio-spatial constitution of policy decisions, we examine Sweden's changing patterns of DH and CHP adoption. First, we present the TPSN framework that considers space as simultaneously a structuring principle, enabling and constraining action, as well as a field of operation in which agency is exercised. Second, we examine the socio-spatial structuration of energy systems. Third, we analyse how the changing socio-spatial constitution of each socio-technical system affects key actors' interests and actions, including the spatial strategies they develop to advance their interests. District heating rapidly diffused across Swedish municipalities in large part because it was considered to be urban infrastructure aligned with the mission of municipalities and was not in direct competition with other actors supplying heat. CHP electricity generation, on the other hand, was initially seen as a benefit to municipal utilities, but was later considered a threat to the interests of large-scale utilities and blocked, only to gain favour again when changing socio-spatial conditions made CHP an asset to large-scale utilities. Our analysis suggests that technological diffusion and blockage is far from a straightforward matter. It requires examination of the dynamics of multi-level governance and overlapping socio-technical systems. Socio-technical regimes are in constant evolution and actors struggle to adapt to new circumstances. Socio-technical systems are not merely material systems, but an expression of dynamic power relations and adaptation strategies.

AB  - Increasing anthropogenic pressures have affected the status of surface freshwater ecosystems. Eutrophication, water browning, acidification, and several other processes may be channelled through the food web. In this study, we evaluate the role of hydrology impacting anthropogenic pressures, flows from urban, farmland and ditched forest areas, and how they explain the physico-chemical quality of lakes and ponds in the boreal biome of Finland. We study the long-term effect around 445 waterfowl survey sites that had physico-chemical measurements (total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, water clarity and colour) produced by Finnish environmental authorities done in years 1986-2020. Furthermore, we investigate whether a long-term national-level citizen science study focusing on rather robust visible habitat structures measured by the volunteers can reveal physicochemical water quality using data from >270 lakes where the waterfowl habitat survey and physico-chemical measurements could be spatio-temporally matched. Farmland occurrence around the lakes was positively associated with pH, colour and nutrient concentrations but negatively associated with water clarity. Furthermore, ditch length was positively associated with nitrogen concentration and water colour, while being negatively associated with pH and water clarity. Overall, the studied lakes showed a negative trend in nutrients and clarity but a positive trend in pH and colour. As expected, nutrient concentration increased and clarity decreased along the gradient from oligotrophic to eutrophic lake habitat classifications, which suggests that the citizen science classification seem to reflect the subsurface physico-chemical status of the lakes. We conclude that farming and forest ditching practices in particular seem to associate with the state of the study lakes and that the ecological impacts of intensified turbidity and brownification in wetland ecosystems should be studied further in the future. Sustainable improvement of water quality rests upon scientific understanding of biogeochemical processes in lake ecosystems and the primary sources of the nutrient and sediment loading.

AB  - Many scholars of industrial ecology have focused on the institutional and organizational challenges of building and maintaining regional industrial symbiosis through the synergistic integration of material and energy flows. Despite the promise that these intellectual developments hold for the future dematerialization of industrial production, they rarely address the actual regulatory obstacles of turning wastes into raw materials. In this article we introduce a potential future industrial symbiosis around the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden, and assess the regulatory bottlenecks related to waste by-product consideration.

AB  - Human land use changes perturb biogeochemical silica (Si) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. This directly affects Si mobilisation and Si storage and influences Si export from the continents, although the magnitude of the impact is unknown. A major reason for our lack of understanding is that very little information exists on how land use affects amorphous silica (ASi) storage in soils. We have quantified and compared total alkali-extracted (PSia) and easily soluble (PSie) Si pools at four sites along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in southern Sweden. Land use clearly affects ASi pools and their distribution. Total PSia and PSie for a continuous forested site at Siggaboda Nature Reserve (66 900 +/- 22 800 kg SiO2 ha(-1) and 952 +/- 16 kg SiO2 ha(-1)) are significantly higher than disturbed land use types from the Rashult Culture Reserve including arable land (28 800 +/- 7200 kg SiO2 ha(-1) and 239 +/- 91 kg SiO2 ha(-1)), pasture sites (27 300 +/- 5980 kg SiO2 ha(-1) and 370 +/- 129 kg SiO2 ha(-1)) and grazed forest (23 600 +/- 6370 kg SiO2 ha(-1) and 346 +/- 123 kg SiO2 ha(-1)). Vertical PSia and PSie profiles show significant (p < 0.05) variation among the sites. These differences in size and distribution are interpreted as the long-term effect of reduced ASi replenishment, as well as changes in ecosystem specific pedogenic processes and increased mobilisation of the PSia in disturbed soils. We have also made a first, though rough, estimate of the magnitude of change in temperate continental ASi pools due to human disturbance. Assuming that our data are representative, we estimate that total ASi storage in soils has declined by ca. 10% since the onset of agricultural development (3000 BCE). Recent agricultural expansion (after 1700 CE) may have resulted in an average additional export of 1.1 +/- 0.8 Tmol Si yr(-1) from the soil reservoir to aquatic ecosystems. This is ca. 20% to the global land-ocean Si flux carried by rivers. It is necessary to update this estimate in future studies, incorporating differences in pedology, geology and climatology over temperate regions, but data are currently not sufficient. Yet, our results emphasize the importance of human activities for Si cycling in soils and for the land-ocean Si flux.

AB  - Fisheries management needs to broaden its perspective to achieve sustainable resource use. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an ISO standardized method to evaluate the environmental impacts of products using a broad and systematic approach. In this study, the outcome of a management regime promoting species-selective trawling in Swedish Nephrops trawl fisheries was studied using LCA methodology by quantifying the impacts per kilogram of landing using two different fishing methods. Demersal trawling has previously been found to be both energy intensive and destructive in terms of seafloor impact and discards. It is demonstrated that species-selective trawling fulfils management objectives, although with tradeoffs in terms of fuel consumption and associated GHG emissions. To prioritize between impacts, one must be aware of and quantify these potential tradeoffs. LCA could be an important tool for defining sustainable seafood production as it can visualize a broad range of impacts and facilitate integrated, transparent decision making in the seafood industry. It is also concluded that, with current LCA methodology, use of total discarded mass could increasingly be distinguished from potential impact by applying two new concepts: primary production requirements and threatened species affected.

AB  - Shipping is the most pervasive source of anthropogenic underwater continuous noise and local intermittent noise. This study focused on the separation of anthropogenic intermittent noise from dynamic background noise in the Gulf of Finland using an adaptive threshold level (ATL) technique. The intermittent noise was validated with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and the background noise with selected environmental factors. Separated components were characterized and compared with a sound exposure level (SEL) in three 1/3 octave bands. Intermittent noise can be separated with ATL in the Baltic Sea, and vessel traffic identified as the primary source. Background noise varies spatially and is partially explained by environmental factors. Intermittent noise has strong persisting influence on the acoustic environment near shipping lanes, elevating the SEL in each of the 1/3 octave bands: by 20-30 dB in the 63 Hz band, by 13-22 dB in the 125 Hz band and by 5-8 dB in the 2000 Hz band. We conclude that strong intermittent noise is characteristic to the underwater acoustic environment in the study area with heavy shipping traffic. By combining ATL with data from AIS, intermittent noise peaks in underwater hydrophone recordings can be associated with passages of individual vessels.

AB  - This paper is about the creation of non-commodified volunteer experiences, for tourists and local volunteers participating in festivals. How is the tourist experience created when most of the traditional tourism demands are not fulfilled? And what are the experiences and how do they relate to different 'regimes of value'? The experience context includes tourists who work together with locals voluntarily in a festival, where the volunteers pay for their own travel, food, overnight stay, and work for free. To gain more knowledge on the volunteers is important because local cultural life becomes more festivalized, most festivals are reliant on the involvement of volunteers, and the festivals gain an important role in an economy where even small places are engaged in branding [Lofgren, O. 2003. The new economy: A cultural history. Global Networks, 3, 239-254]. This paper uses a qualitative approach. Interviews were conducted (n = 23) and participants were observed during four festivals in Finnmark, Norway. Nothing in the experiences was facilitated, and the experience creation occurred in the work tasks together with volunteer colleagues. It was like a holiday experience, without a stream of commodified moments. It was a value creation that could be seen as authentic and real, created in the interaction between the local and visiting volunteers.

AB  - This paper examines the micro-scale ignition of sustainability pathways in multi-actor collaboration in an urban living lab in Tampere, Finland, and aims to capture the reconfigurations that lead to urban sustainability. The conventional model of sustainability focusing on economic, environmental and social pillars does not correspond to the dynamic nature of urban sustainability. Thus, we utilise a sustainability framework that is more sensitive to urban conditions and compatible with a temporal typology of practices carried out by diverse actors in the living lab. The results show, first, that the emerging sustainability pathways are based on the coexistence of diverse actors and resources, develop through interconnected temporal phases of practices and are differently sensitised to place depending on the temporal phase. The sustainability pathways reach permanence when the actions of catalysing and revamping take the mode of routinisation. Second, we locate the generative moments of reconfigurations and address the cumulative nature of sustainability. In conclusion, this helps to recognise the incipient forms of sustainability pathways and their potential for local sustainability transitions.

AB  - Soil is substantive component of biosphere, which is exposed to plethora of pollutants including heavy metals. These are added by natural as well as anthropogenic activities. Upsurge in heavy metal content affects all organisms by biomagnification. So, it becomes vital to create a database of heavy metals concentration in soil. This is relevant in countries where unsustainable intensive agriculture, industrial and urban development is in progress. The present review of the scientific literature from 1991 to 2018 on heavy metals in soils in India shows that Zn and Pb exceeded their limits for Indian natural soil guidelines (Zn 22.1 and Pb 13.1 mu g/g), Canada (Zn 200 mu g/g), Swedish (80 mu g/g) and Poland (Zn 300 mu g/g) soil guidelines. The mean values of As and Cu for all soil types except for roadside soils, exceeded the limits. The average value of Cd for all soil types exceeded their limit. The mean values obtained for soils of India are Fe (23774.84 mu g/g), Mn (872.54 mu g/g), Zn (359.94 mu g/g), Cu (183.67 mu g/g), Cr (161.42 mu g/g), As (148.70 mu g/g), Ni (112.41 mu g/g), Pb (61.87 mu g/g), Co (37.63 mu g/g) and Cd (14.16 mu g/g). Cluster analysis and factor analysis were employed to different soil types and showed multiple sources of these metals. The contamination factor (CF), enrichment factor (EF) and potential contamination index (Cp) showed that Cd and As are the main contaminants. The results of ecological risk index indicated that Cd is the main pollutant in the different soils of India. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Population bottlenecks associated with founder events strongly impact the establishment and genetic makeup of populations. In addition to their genotype, founding individuals also bring along parasites, as well as symbionts that can manipulate the phenotype of their host, affecting the host population establishment, dynamics and evolution. Thus, to understand introduction, invasion, and spread, we should identify the roles played by accompanying symbionts. In 1991, the parasitoid wasp, Hyposoter horticola, and its associated hyperparasitoid were accidentally introduced from the main angstrom land islands, Finland, to an isolated island in the archipelago, along with their host, the Glanville fritillary butterfly. Though the receiving island was unoccupied, the butterfly was present on some of the small islands in the vicinity. The three introduced species have persisted locally ever since. A strain of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia has an intermediate prevalence in the parasitoid H. horticola across the main angstrom land population. The infection increases its susceptibility of to hyperparasitism. We investigated the establishment and spread of the parasitoid, along with patterns of prevalence of its symbiont using 323 specimens collected between 1992 and 2013, from five localities across angstrom land, including the source and introduced populations. Using 14 microsatellites and one mitochondrial marker, we suggest that the relatively diverse founding population and occasional migration between islands might have facilitated the persistence of all isolated populations, despite multiple local population crashes. We also show that where the hyperparasitoid is absent, and thus selection against infected wasp genotypes is relaxed, there is near-fixation of Wolbachia.

AB  - Forest management changes with societal change, and it has been debated if economic development in society places material objectives in a less preferable position: it is assumed this is also the case as regards forest management. The aims of this study were to propose a theoretical model for empirical studies of objectives and motivations within this field and to depict motivations and objectives of small-scale forest owners in Sweden. Comparative literature studies were undertaken and qualitative methodology was used for the empirical studies. Firstly, to depict general trends among forest owners, interviews with professional foresters were conducted. Secondly, forest owners throughout Sweden were interviewed to compare the results of the interviews with the professional foresters on the motivations and objectives of small-scale forest owners. Within the literature, there were no consistent views on the subjective grounds for owning and managing small-scale forest estates. The proposed theoretical model originated from the cultural concept. Sets of interpretive and normative qualities were seen as underlying people's actions, and such sets were related to basic values. The 'objectives' were clustered into groups creating four clusters i.e. 'motivations'. The four motivations depicted were: Conservation; Utilities; Amenities and Economic Efficiency. The empirical results highlighted that the objectives and motivations of forest-owners covered a broad field and a move towards conservation interests was indicated. The theoretical model presented here is suggested a suitable tool for both depicting the motivations and objectives of forest owners and for making future comparisons.

AB  - This longitudinal case study analyses the development of the pioneering waste management (WM) system in the Vaasa region of Western Finland, since the late 1980s to the present. It reflects the general features of the evolving WM from the one-bag system and throwaway culture towards today's circular economy and product service systems. The Vaasa region is an excellent example of how WM has evolved in Finland, which also follows the main direction of travel in Europe. The main features have been: (1) closing of dumping sites, minimizing dumping of waste and concentrating dumping to well-organized and environmentally managed sites; (2) development of comprehensive source separation systems for reuse of materials and energy; (3) building of waste treatment systems, consisting of different technical solutions connected with reuse and energy generation solutions. This evolution has resulted in expanding regional collaboration, where large investments are integrated within larger areas and consortia. The share of reused materials has grown significantly and dumping has decreased to close to zero. The practices of the circular economy are emerging and partly established. In this evolution, praxis does not immediately follow after "a brilliant idea", but only after the societal structuring process, including paradigmatic changes in attitudes, social norms, policies and regulation, customer behaviour, economic structures, and separate and systemic technological solutions and value chains. This research can add value both in terms of knowledge and science, and in being a change agents more practically. In the future, a strategic shift from WM to material management, and from public service to feasible businesses will be the next steps.

AB  - A major part of the European Union's (EU) project Sustainable Intelligent Mining System (SIMS) is investigating the development of diesel-free/carbon-neutral underground mines in order to ensure sustainable underground mining in the future. Replacing diesel machines with electric vehicles in underground hard rock mines has been widely acknowledged by the mining industry worldwide as a critical step to improve working conditions by reducing diesel exhaust-related contaminants, to reduce mine ventilation electrical power cost by reducing mine airflow quantity, and to reduce mine greenhouse gas emissions. All of these are major requirements to achieve sustainable future underground mining practices. A field trial of Epiroc's 2nd generation of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) at Agnico Eagle Finland's Kittila mine was conducted during 2019-2020. Vehicles tested were MT42 mine truck, ST14 Load-Haul-Dump (LHD), and Boomer E2 jumbo drill rig. This paper outlines the improvement of the working conditions observed in the field trial, and the opinions of the mine personnel at Kittila mine on using BEVs instead of diesel machines. Measurements of atmospheric contaminants and air temperatures taken during the field trial clearly demonstrated a significant improvement of working conditions when BEVs were operating as opposed to diesel machines. This field observation was supported by the opinion of the majority of the Kittila mine workers. However, some remaining concerns must be addressed before BEVs can replace diesel machines.

AB  - Forest fragmentation increases the proportion of edge area and this, in turn, induces changes in forest structure, species composition and microclimate. These factors are also strongly determined by the forest management regime. Although the interactive effects of edges and density on forest plant communities have been extensively studied, little is known about the response of the belowground communities. Here we investigated the variation of soil microbiota in 45 deciduous broadleaved forests along a latitudinal gradient from Italy to Norway at a continental scale across Europe. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) were used to map the microbial community in the forest edge and interior across three forest densities (dense, intermediate, open forest). Microbial community composition was only affected by forest edge effects and not by forest density. We did not find any interaction effects between forest density and distance-to-edge. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were significantly more abundant in edges and Gram-negative bacteria more abundant in interiors, respectively. The microbial community composition was closely related to soil pH, soil potassium and nitrogen, texture (percent sand) and soil temperature. Soil pH was positively correlated with the saprotrophic fungi and potassium was positively correlated with Gram-negative bacteria but negatively correlated with Actinobacteria. In sum, we reveal the notable effects of forest edges on the soil AMF abundance. This result indicated that AMF could possess a stronger affinity with species growing in the edges, which may help to improve plant perfor-mance under hostile conditions herein.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to present an analytical framework for studying conflict management processes. The paper draws on discursive approaches to new institutional theory in integrating three inter-related elements of conflict management: collaborative practices; formal and informal institutions; and the ways the policy issues are understood and communicated (framed) by the different actors in contested situations. The Discursive Institutional Conflict Management Analysis framework (DICMA) draws focus to the interaction between these three elements during conflict management efforts. It also helps to identify challenges related to each of the elements when improving conflict management, and contributes to formulating necessary policy reforms.
   A case study looking at the management of old-growth forest conflicts on public land in Finland is used to illustrate the applicability of the approach. The empirical analysis shows that the 'old new institutionalist' analysis is useful in explaining how history shapes the paths of the institutional reforms, how informal norms affect behaviour of natural resource management agencies, and how institutional structures create counterproductive incentive structures for the conflict management practices. However it takes the discursive approach, here applied through frame analysis, to understand the responses and strategies of natural resource management agencies in the face of the institutional challenges. Institutional and frame analyses in combination shed light to the logic behind the state forest agency's seemingly unproductive approaches to the conflicts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The problems discussed in forums such as that within the European Charter for Solar Energy in Architecture and Urban Planning are still up-to-date.(1) The role architecture plays in energy consumption calls for a conceptual reorientation that ensures a responsible design approach to the environment and the use of renewable resources based on local conditions.
   In this sense, the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto (1898-1976) figures as a pioneering precedent of a sustainable architecture. The Nordic climate and the deeply nature-concerned culture within which he lived are factors that derived a conscious design method characterised by the exploration of environmental concepts. The contextual approach was developed since his early career and reached a peak in his own summer house erected in Finland in the year 1953. As Aalto himself comments, this building had the advantage of being the 'experimental game' of the architect, where he could freely work without worrying about the constraints of usual project requirements.(2)
   The biography of Aalto shows that he used to help his father, who was a surveyor, by drawing plans from the Finnish territory.(3) Aalto himself grew up in Jyvaskyla, a town located on the same lake studied here, and worked there in the first years of his professional career. He was familiar with the landscape and knew well in advance the general features of the house's surroundings.
   The Summer House is a well-known building that has drawn attention in the academic context. Aalto published a seminal, brief text when the construction of the main block was finished, where experiments concerning topographical adaptation, material durability, and solar heating passive systems are mentioned.(4) After appearing in the complete work of the architect,(5) the Summer House was briefly mentioned in critical literature,(6) and in recent years has been the subject of numerous studies.(7) This panorama has contributed important information about the site and the house, which were, nevertheless, considered mainly by aesthetical and typological means. The bioclimatic themes seem to have not been systematically explored yet.
   The present essay seeks to identify and explain some design strategies that can illustrate the bioclimatic structure of the building.(8) The textual argumentation is supported by photographs, diagrams, and a physical model. An introduction to the house is given by describing its geographical and programmatic situation. The study is then developed through the following topics: site and program; placement; spatial organization; and exterior-interior relations. As a conclusion, the house is evaluated as a precedent of an environmentally-concerned architecture.

TI  - Constructing Familiarity in Finnish-Russian Karelia: Shifting Uses of History and the Re-Interpretation of Regions
T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - BORDER
KW  - LANDSCAPE
AB  - This paper will present evidence of regionalization processes taking shape in FinnishRussian Karelia based on the construction of familiarity. This region-building strategy harks back to the well-known Euroregion model developed within the context of European integration. However, if Euroregions can be seen as largely public sector projects of place-making the construction of familiarity is a much more socially grounded process. The major shift under consideration is that of transcending the national appropriations of Karelia that have characterized Finnish, Russian and Soviet policies in the past. The focus will be on two aspects: (1) notions of a common regional space in order to promote cross-border co-operation and (2) the re-framing of history and the influence of tourism in developed multifaceted (partly post-national) regional ideas of Karelia. Rather than understand Karelia within the framework of nationalizing historiographies, these contemporary interpretations depict Karelia as a borderlandas a space of cultural and historical ambiguity marked but not dominated by alternating phases of Russification, Finnishization and Sovietization.

AB  - Sustainability of urban transportation and residents' daily mobility is increasingly important for the future of urban regions. In this paper, we present a novel methodology combining mapped survey responses (gathered using public participation GIS) and sophisticated multimodal routing analysis to understand patterns of suburban residents' daily mobility. Our particular focus is on residents' mode choices and their optimality in terms of travel time. We also examine the carbon-intensity of potential mode choice mismatches where a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen for a particular trip. This paper shows how the combination of the two data sources create new possibilities for analysing daily mobility by enabling the comparison of self-reported, geographically referenced mobility patterns and modelled, objectively "optimal" patterns. Our case study results from a rapidly growing metropolitan area, Greater Helsinki in Finland, indicate that people have rather sustainable daily mobility practices. Their daily trips are typically short (median 1.8 km), and non-motorised travel modes are the most popular. Also the share of car travel is significant. While public transport clearly has the lowest modal share, it is frequently used on longer trips to destinations where public transport connections are good (particularly the city centre). In 44% of trips, the respondents choose the fastest travel mode. When a comparatively slower travel mode is chosen, it most often produces less CO2 emissions than the fastest mode. However, particularly on shopping trips the most commonly reported type of trip car driving dominates as the fastest means of transportation. When a slower mode is chosen on a shopping trip, it is typically more carbon-intensive than the fastest mode would have been in that case. The methodology presented here can be used to support local decision making, particularly when daily services and transport infrastructure are planned or reorganised. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - SOME ASPECTS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHORT-ROTATION COPPICE WILLOW FOR BIOMASS IN NORTHERN-IRELAND
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
LA  - English
CP  - SYMP OF THE BOTANICAL SOC OF EDINBURGH ON BRITISH TAXA
AB  - Work on short-rotation coppice willow as an alterative and renewable energy source began in Northern Ireland in the mid-1970s, prompted by the massive rise in oil prices during that period. Although in the short run oil prices have dropped in real terms, interest in short-rotation coppice willow has ben sustained because of the potential role it has in the development of agriculture, particularly in marginal areas. This is particularly relevant in the current situation of over production of a wide range of agricultural commodities within the European Community and the moves to reduce Government support in the form of farm and export subsidies.
   Although Salix cultivars have yielded in excess of 30 tonnes dry matter (DM) ha-1 annually under experimental conditions, it is considered that 10-12 tonnes DM ha-1 is a sustainable commercial yield.
   Melampsora spp. rust has emerged as one of the most important factors limiting the development of short-rotation coppice as a commercial crop. For economic and environmental reasons, the application of fungicide for rust control is not a possibility. Consequently, other disease control strategies have to be established. The main focus of this work is in the selection, for suitability for coppice application, of the widening range of genetic material becoming available from breeding programmes in Canada, Sweden and Finland with a view to their incorporation into mixed stands.
   End product utilisation is considered a priority area for investigation if short-rotation coppice is to make a contribution to land use and the development of agriculture in marginal areas. Currently two potential end uses are being investigated: firstly fractionation - to produce cellulose for paper manufacture, hemi-cellulose for the production of molasses and lignin for further processing into other industrial chemicals, and secondly the simultaneous generation of heat and power using gasification - 'combined heat and power'.

AB  - Avian species respond to ecological variability at a range of spatial scales and according to life history stage. Beaver dams create wetland systems for waterbirds that are utilized throughout different stages of the breeding season. We studied how beaver-induced variability affected mobile pairs and more sedentary broods along with the production of Common Teal Anas crecca at the patch and landscape scale on their breeding grounds. Beavers Castor spp. are ecosystem engineers that enhance waterfowl habitats by impeding water flow and creating temporary flooding. Two landscapes in southern Finland with (Evo) and without (Nuuksio) American Beavers Castor canadensis were used in this study. To investigate the patch-scale effect, pair and brood densities along with brood production were first compared at beaver-occupied lakes and non-beaver lakes in the beaver landscape. Annual pair and brood densities/km shoreline and brood production were compared between beaver and non-beaver landscapes. Facilitative effects of beaver activity were manifest on brood density at both patch and landscape scales: these were over 90% and 60% higher in beaver patches and landscapes, respectively. An effect of beaver presence on pair density was only seen at the landscape level. Pair density did not strongly affect brood production, as shown earlier for relatively mildly density-dependent Teal populations. Because the extent of beaver flooding was a crucial factor affecting annual Teal production in the study area, we infer beaver activity has consequences for the local Teal population. Ecosystem engineering by the beaver could therefore be considered a restoration tool in areas where waterfowl are in need of high-quality habitats.

AB  - Herein I outline the experiences of a pedagogical development project at Laurea University of Applied Sciences in Finland. The idea was to incorporate the concept of a multisensory space into our multicultural studies course which is part of our Social Services Degree Programme.
   The basis of the project is "The Multisensory Space", which means an easily-modified space, where visitors can experience landscape, sounds and objects of a different cultural environment. Landscapes are not authentic; they are mostly suggestive, evoking memories and feelings. The space provides immigrants with an opportunity to "return momentarily" into the familiar home environment as well as to be able to invite others into their "home space". It is during the process of creating and building the multisensory cultural environments together that the Finnish students and immigrants have the opportunity to learn about each other's cultural values.
   Included in this paper are excerpts from the feedback and self assessments of 74 first-year students in Social Services, with comments about their experiences and insights concerning intercultural communication. On the whole, students were happy to participate actively in the project and to have meaningful interaction with immigrants. However, there were also challenges when attempting to coordinate the needs and schedules of the students and the cooperating institutions.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report (AR6) allocates 15% to 43% of global primary energy to biomass in 2050 across multiple mitigation scenarios. The report also emphasizes the importance of electrification. For increased reliance on electricity and on biomass, bioelectricity is expected to play a major role. It is therefore vital to know whether the energy generation potential of biomass electricity can support the removal of its environmental impact, particularly as generation at large scale is expected to rely almost solely on energy crops. This paper evaluates the potential of short-rotation woody crops in generating green electricity. This is performed using the "Green Energy Return on Investment (EROIg)" methodology, which indicates the net energy generated after investing in ecosystem maintenance energy (ESME). This study found that the EROIg of bioelectricity is marginally larger than unity when converted to its primary equivalent form (EROIg-PE). Three design options were proposed to improve bioenergy's EROIg. Among these options, pelletizing wood chips has the largest advantage with an EROIg of 1.11 and an EROIg-PE of 3.17. We conclude with a discussion of the indirect advantages of growing energy crops, and discuss how this technique can be used alongside others to help generate cleaner energy.

AB  - Drained and cultivated organic soils contribute a substantial proportion of estimated anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in Sweden. According to rough estimates, different cropping systems give rise to different subsidence rates and, since some of this subsidence originates from oxidation of organic material, soil respiration may also vary with different crops. This field study investigated the possibility of mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cultivated organic soils by using a specific cropping system. The CO2 emission rates from soils under different crops in similar environmental conditions were measured at 11 field sites in southern Sweden representing different types of organic soils. The variation in emissions between the crops tested was low compared with total CO2 emissions from the soil and differences between crops were not consistent. This shows that growing a particular crop cannot be recommended as a mitigation option for limiting CO2 emissions from cultivated organic soils. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change and natural resource depletion have reinvigorated the relevance of technical advancements in energy efficiency, which has been emphasized by the Paris Climate Accord that includes a framework for carbon neutrality. In that effort, the governments have been allocating a considerable amount of budget shares to research and development relating to energy efficiency and green energy. Thus, this study primarily examines the impact and effectiveness of research and development on energy efficiency and energy sources (renewables and fossil fuels) on CO2 emissions in the European region using a novel Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR). Our data cover annual observations of 9 EU countries, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden, based on the period 1990-2021. Our empirical findings confirm that the U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve occurs across all quantiles at 1% significance levels. The findings reveal that energy consumption increases CO2 emissions across the lower to higher quantiles. We discover that (i) R & D on renewable energy cuts CO2 emissions just at the median and higher quantiles, (ii) R & D on Fossil Fuels decreases CO2 emissions just at the lower quantile, and (iii) R & D on Energy efficiency lowers CO2 emissions at both the median and higher quantiles. Therefore, empirical findings suggest that policymakers should maintain their incentives for energy efficiency R & D and renewable R & D to achieve sustainable development goals.

AB  - Effective pest monitoring programmes are needed for providing reliable advice on when pest populations require active management. We studied whether suction-trap catches of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae during the period 1989-2009 can be used to predict field infestations of this aphid in Swedish winter wheat fields. We found that suction-trap catches of S.avenae until the time of crop heading (GS51) were significantly related to both number of aphids per tiller (R-2=0.69 at GS 59 and R-2=0.27 at GS 69) and proportion of fields with infestations above economic threshold (R-2=0.49 at GS 59 and R-2=0.40 at GS 69). This effect was consistent across Swedish regions and years. This information could be used by advisory services and farmers to decide whether field inspection to estimate the profitability of insecticide treatment at heading is needed. To improve the predictive ability further, suction-trap catches could be combined with weather data and information about biological control potential in different landscapes.

AB  - Local communities in the Gudbrandsdalen region in Norway are increasingly exposed to climate-induced hazards such as floods and landslides. A core question is how community members respond to climate change and what factors contribute to more resilient communities. The authors used a contextual approach to analyze data from semi-structured interviews along five dimensions. In Gaustad Muncipality they found that individuals' motivation to adapt to climate change depended largely on subjective values such as identity, place attachment, cultural values, and social networks among individuals, which means it is crucial that strategic plans for adaptation to climate change at different policy levels are experienced as relevant by community members. While the studied community has experienced heavy floods in river systems and streams, little evidence of adaptation was observed. Instead, they appeared to adopt coping strategies. Landowners may have limited incentives to adapt to climate change due to contraproductive policy measures such as economic compensation for direct losses without requiring improved practices. Effective adaptation to climate change on the local level is likely to require making compensation mechanisms contingent upon landowners showing willingness to change from coping to adaptive practices, as well as a contextualized approach integrating local and scientific forms of knowledge.

AB  - Dieback of common ash is a worrying phenomenon that emerged in the early 1990s. The first symptoms were observed in 1992 in Poland. In 1996 the plague appeared in Lithuania, followed by Germany, Denmark, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden and France (2002-2009), to finally reach the British Isles in 2012. At the beginning it was said about the disease of ash, but a few years later it became the issue of ash dieback. Despite many research and the cause identification, the problem still exists. The aim of article is to show the overall picture and the prior knowledge of the phenomenon on the example of four Northern European countries: Great Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden. Considerations were mainly focused on the UK and Ireland, which because of the insular location are an area of slower spread of the Chalara fraxinea - fungus considered to be the one of the main factors responsible for ash disease. Moreover, the selection is determined by the weather and habitat conditions where the described species have their optimum range. To the contrast, Denmark and Sweden were mentioned also. The described species has a much worse state of health in that countries. In order to describe the current state of the spread of ash dieback, we selected official documents and factsheets available on the government websites. In case of described countries, quick response and proper identification of the cause of ash dieback allowed to take appropriate steps to fight Chalara fraxinea before the disease has spread in the local population. Appropriate government regulation, cooperation with local forest owners, education and action plans at the moment seems to function properly especially in Great Britain and Ireland. Quite other conditions are in the countries of the continental Europe, including Poland, Lithuania, Denmark and Sweden, where the fungus had made quite large losses in stands of common ash long before it was determined the main cause of this phenomenon. Undoubtedly a huge role in the rapid spread of the pathogen has a geographical location and quick response on the disease.

AB  - Data from the Swedish Forest Inventory was used to calculate mass balances for base cations Ca, Mg and K for Swedish forests, Using lysimeter and forest survey soil analyses to estimate present base cation leaching from the root zone reveals that weathering plus base cation deposition is not sufficient to support both, the present base cation leaching rate and the present rate of uptake caused by stem growth. Calculations suggest that 96% of the productive forested area may have higher rates of removal than supply for one or more base cation. Under a best-case scenario, assuming less pollution, the present growth rare and 100% efficiency in uptake of available nutrients, the area with more removal than supply would still be at least 30% of the total area. Forest soils are being depleted at a rate where the exchangeable reservoirs have high risk of being severely depleted in the next few decades in central and southern Sweden. During 1983-1985 the depletion rate is calculated to be, on the average, 0.33 keq ha(-1) year(-1). The weathering rate and present base cation deposition can sustain growth at a level where (80-85) x 10(6)m(3) stemwood year(-1) can be harvested. Any harvested growth beyond this volume must be sustained by artificial means,
   For whole-tree harvesting without base cation return, the calculations indicate that it would significantly increase the base saturation depletion rate to an average of 0.62 keg ha(-1) year(-1), and risk depletion of the soil in less than one-to-two rotation periods almost anywhere in Sweden.
   The calculations stress the importance that sustainable forest management must include the management of nutrient fluxes and reservoirs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Transport infrastructure is often used as an instrument to reach political objectives. One such objective is to promote robust and sustainable regions. A sustainable region is often defined as a region with positive population growth. The implied mechanism between infrastructure and population growth is that infrastructure investments enlarge regions so that the labour markets increase in size. Larger regions provide a better foundation for attractive industries, leading to more jobs, influx of labour and population growth. Alternatively, and closely related, that improved infrastructure gives regions improved accessibility, and that this allow industry to remain in the region even though distance and uncertainties in transport provide pressure to relocate to regions that are more central.
   Our discussion and findings are based on quantitative analyses of Norwegian regions using register data on population, industry, commuting, road infrastructure and access to services of general interests (SGI). We supplement these data with data on commuting from the latest Norwegian travel survey. Our research draws on insights from a project conducted by the authors for the Norwegian National Transport Plan.
   The paper concludes by pointing at critical sizes and distances a typical labour market must reach in order to be sustainable in terms of population growth. We also point at the implications this gives for different kind of infrastructure investments. In particular, we discuss the threshold limit, suggesting that regions with more than 10 000 employees achieve positive population development. We also find that the qualitative improvements in the attractiveness of a region, in terms of variety of services, improves markedly for region sizes between 5 000 and 10 000 employees. This suggests that; if the objective is to maintain the population in a region or to achieve population growth; it is more important to invest in infrastructure, which increases the size of small regions rather than increasing the size of mid-sized and large regions. This results in different priorities from those usually reached by using cost benefit analyses. Which typically give higher priority to infrastructure projects in the largest regions.

AB  - In this research article the sustainability of different practices to collect the metal fraction of household waste in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland is examined. The study is carried out by calculating and comparing the greenhouse gas reduction potential of optional practices for collecting the metal fraction of household waste in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. In order to locate the greenhouse gas reduction potential of the separate collection of the metallic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW) collected from residential sources, a comparative carbon footprint analysis using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on six different waste management scenarios is carried out. The modeled system consisted of a waste collection system, transportation, and different waste management alternatives, including on-site separation, separation at the waste management facility as well as metallurgical recovery of separated scrap. The results show that, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, separate collection and recycling of the metallic fraction of solid MSW at residential properties is the preferable option compared to a scenario with no source sorting and incineration of everything. According to this research scenario where the metal fraction of solid household waste was not source-separated or collected separately have clearly higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to all the other scenarios with separate collection for metals. In addition, metal recycling by regional collection points has considerably lower greenhouse gas emission potential than metal recycling by collection directly from residential properties.

AB  - The upper secondary school dropout rate is a challenge in many western countries, and measures have been taken to prevent dropout. The dropout rate in Norway is stable but is the highest among the northernmost counties. The aim of this study is to explore the strategies employed by upper secondary school teachers and their collaborators to prevent dropout from upper secondary school among Sami youth in northern Norway. This study is based on three focus group interviews with teachers, advisers, nurses, and counsellors in the Sami areas of northern Norway. The thematic analysis identified two main strategies, namely tracking the student and giving the student time. A transparent environments, cultural competence, and interdisciplinary collaboration were identified as prerequisites for successfully implementing the two strategies to prevent dropout from upper secondary school.

AB  - Norway has a political goal to minimize the loss of cultural heritage due to removal, destruction or decay. On behalf of the national Directorate for Cultural Heritage, we have developed methods to monitor Cultural Heritage Environments. The complementary set of methods includes (1) landscape mapping through interpretation of aerial photographs, including field control of the map data, (2) qualitative and quantitative initial and repeat landscape photography, (3) field recording of cultural heritage objects including preparatory analysis of public statistical data, and (4) recording of stakeholder attitudes, perceptions and opinions. We applied these methods for the first time to the historical clustered farm settlement of Havra in Hordaland County, West Norway. The methods are documented in a handbook and can be applied as a toolbox, where different monitoring methods or frequency of repeat recording may be selected, dependent on local situations, e.g., on the landscape character of the area in focus.

AB  - Successful modern cities must combine high levels of accessibility and quality of life. These aims may conflict with each other: increasing accessibility could be detrimental to the urban environment while the improvement of urban air quality might mean restricting the accessibility of the city. The challenge for cities in the 21st century is to maintain economic growth, stay accessible and improve quality of life at the same time. The aim of this paper is to increase understanding of how cities should address their transport policies. Examples from London (UK) and Gothenburg (Sweden) are used to emphasize the character of innovative urban transport policies.

AB  - Modern wildlife management has dual mandates to reduce human-wildlife conflict (HWC) for burgeoning populations of people while supporting conservation of biodiversity and the ecosystem functions it affords. These opposing goals can sometimes be achieved with non-lethal intervention tools that promote coexistence between people and wildlife. One such tool is conditioned taste aversion (CTA), the application of an evolutionary relevant learning paradigm in which an animal associates a transitory illness to the taste, odor or other characteristic of a particular food item, resulting in a long-term change in its perception of palatability. Despite extensive support for the power of CTA in laboratory studies, field studies have exhibited mixed results, which erodes manager confidence in using this tool. Here we review the literature on CTA in the context of wildlife conservation and management and discuss how success could be increased with more use of learning theory related to CTA, particularly selective association, stimulus salience, stimulus generalization, and extinction of behavior. We apply learning theory to the chronological stages of CTA application in the field and illustrate them by synthesizing and reviewing past applications of CTA in HWC situations. Specifically, we discuss (1) when CTA is suitable, (2) how aversion can be most effectively (and safely) established, (3) how generalization of aversion from treated to untreated food can be stimulated and (4) how extinction of aversion can be avoided. For each question, we offer specific implementation suggestions and methods for achieving them, which we summarize in a decision-support table that might be used by managers to guide their use of CTA across a range of contexts. Additionally, we highlight promising ideas that may further improve the effectiveness of CTA field applications in the future. With this review, we aspire to demonstrate the diverse past applications of CTA as a non-lethal tool in wildlife management and conservation and facilitate greater application and efficacy in the future.

AB  - The adoption of pottery in eastern Fennoscandia in the later sixth millennium BC has traditionally been understood in straightforward technological and practical terms, and as a development that did not mark other significant changes in local culture or ways of 10C Recent research in the region, combined with new ideas about Neolithization in Eurasia more generally, nonetheless suggests that the adoption of pottery was associated with more fundamental cultural and environmental transformations than has previously been thought. This article brings together diverse old and new data from northeastern Europe and discusses the character and dynamics of cultural and human -induced environmental change following the adoption of pottery. The aim is to provide a scenario of long-term cultural changes and, in particular, to consider the significance and broader implications of the very practices of clay use and cultivation, as well as their links to wider cultural and environmental phenomena.

AB  - Technology transfer and development is a key requirement for many research funders, yet there is a real paucity of scientifically documented evidence on how this transition is made and how it can be made more effective. The study described here details the experiences of an informal 'community of practice' working across research and commercialisation to set up and run a number of integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems (innovative food systems addressing environmental impacts of traditional aquaculture) across Europe. Interviews were undertaken with seven European aquaculture companies across six countries (Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, Israel, Norway and Scotland), each of which were involved with the IDREEM project (www.idreem.eu) which paired aquaculture businesses and research institutions in strategic partnerships to promote rapid implementation of IMTA. This study revealed three main shared experiences: the lack of an existing process for licensing IMTA sites and the temporal hold this put on obtaining a license; issues due to environmental constraints, including storms; and problems of drying and storing for those working with algae. Furthermore, three key lessons were learnt by those involved: the importance of choosing extractive IMTA species based on what is endemic to the area; identifying the correct system configuration may take a lot of trial and error, but simplicity is crucial; a key process was 'learning by doing' and a range of skills are required. We conclude that the development of a formal 'community of practice', a knowledge-sharing platform where all those engaging in IMTA can work together, would enable further unique insight and innovation in the process.
   Statement of significance: Communities of practice arise from collective learning by individuals or organisations in a shared domain. This paper describes the shared experiences and lessons learnt by one such community, composed of seven aquaculture SMEs implementing integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. In doing so, it provides guidance to those wishing to develop commercial scale IMTA in Europe. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Populations of large grazing birds have increased in Europe during the past five decades, raising conflicts between conservation and farming interests. Managing these conflicts requires knowledge about the currently unknown relationship between population sizes and crop damage levels. We analysed unique data on reported, inspected and compensated crop damage caused by geese, swans and cranes together with data from population surveys in Sweden to investigate how bird abundance is related to damage levels at the national scale between 2000 and 2015. Over the study period, the annual number of damage reports, yield loss and costs for compensation increased. These crop damage levels were positively related to national population indices of common crane, barnacle and greylag goose. The shape of these relationships varied between species and encompassed considerable uncertainty. However, on a year-to-year basis (detrended data) we found no evident association between damage levels and bird numbers. Yield loss and compensation costs per reported damage did not increase with higher population indices of greylag goose, but they did so for barnacle goose. Synthesis and applications. We present a novel study of the relationships between different crop damage level indicators (damage reports, yield loss and compensation costs) and population numbers of large grazing birds. We identified a positive relationship with high uncertainty for all cases. We also identified the need to (a) better synchronize the monitoring of damages and bird numbers in time and space and (b) further study the relationships between damage levels and bird numbers at smaller (local and regional) and larger (flyway) spatial scales to reduce the uncertainty of the relationship and to gain a more holistic understanding of the system.

AB  - A refined version of a conditional phosphorus risk index (PRI) for P losses to waters was developed based on monitoring and analyses of PRI factors from an agricultural catchment in Sweden. The catchment has a hummocky landscape of heavy glacial till overlying moraine and an overall balanced soil P level. Single P source factors and combinations of factors were tested and discussed together with water movement and water management factors important for catchments dominated by drained clay soils. An empirical relationship was established (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.861, p < 0.001) between phosphorus sorption index (PSI-CaCl2), measured in a weak calcium chloride solution, and iron (Fe-AL) aluminium (Al-AL) and phosphorus (P-AL) in soil extract with acid ammonium lactate. Differing relationships were found for a field that had not received any manure in the last 15 years and a field that had received chicken litter very recently. In addition, a general relationship (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.839, p < 0.001) was found between the ratio of phosphorus extracted from fresh soil in water (Pw) to PSI-CaCl2 and the degree of phosphorus saturation in lactate extract (DPS-AL). One exception was a single field, representing 7% of agricultural land in the catchment, that had been treated with glyphosate shortly before soil sampling. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (SHC) in heavy clay in contact with the moraine base (at 1 m depth) was on average 0.06 m day(-1). In clay not in contact with moraine, SHC was significantly lower (mean 0.007 m day(-1)). A reduction in the present tile drain spacing (from 14-16 m to 11 m) is theoretically required to maintain satisfactory water discharge and groundwater level. Up to 10% of the arable land was estimated to be a potential source area for P. based on different indices. Parts of a few fields close to farm buildings (1% of total arable land) were identified as essential P source areas, with high DPS-AL values and low PSI-CaCl2 values throughout the soil profile. A further 2% of arable land was identified as potential important transport areas, based on visible surface water rills or frequent water-ponded conditions. Fields comprising 10% of the total arable land in the catchment should be re-drained in the near future to improve water infiltration and avoid unnecessary channelised water flow. The need for an improved PRI for erosion and water transport is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The number of hotels in the mountains of south-eastern Norway has decreased over the last three decades, with a concurrent increase in the number of modern, privately-owned second homes. The growth of second-home villages and associated commercial activity has produced sustainability issues. The shift in the planning and development process from the local government to private developers has resulted in a piece-by-piece process with the loss of sight of long-term consequences. This short review discusses the causes of uncontrolled or poor planning of mountain regions; in particular, the neoliberal trend in physical planning and the problem of small local communities.

AB  - Heat demand, in buildings is responsible for a large portion of energy loads in Europe, and building renovations represent an important opportunity to achieve sustainability objectives. Efficient district heat (DH) can represent a cost-effective heat source for buildings. Yet, building heat demand reductions will have implications on sustainable DH production and operation. Analysis is therefore needed to identify cost-effective strategies for low-carbon heat solutions in integrated energy systems.
   This paper proposes a methodology to investigate different scenarios to 2050 involving integrated heat supply and building envelope investment choices in Torino, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden. The goal is to provide an overview of opportunities for decision makers in elaborating heat strategies including DH.
   Results show that opportunities exist to achieve consistent energy savings and emissions reduction through strategic combination of DH and building renovation investments.
   A systems approach is essential to avoid unnecessary investments or early retirement of assets: building renovations should be planned carefully as lower DH base loads could lead to increased running costs, and DH investments need to be adapted to long-term building improvements. Reduced peak loads can allow increased use of low-grade heat, higher merit-order power generation and in some instances cost-effective expansion of DH. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since 1990, over 13 000 ha of constructed wetlands (CWs) have been implemented to increase biodiversity and reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads to Swedish waters. Despite the considerable number of CWs and ambitious investments planned for the coming three years, there is limited follow up of cost-efficiency of catchment- and landscape-scale nutrient retention by existing CWs. Such follow up evaluation could provide clear guidance regarding optimal size and location of future CWs. We present a three-step modelling approach to assess cost-efficiency of 233 CWs in two Swedish regions (East, 4321 km2, and West, 916 km2). Modelled nutrient retention in CWs was predominantly low, especially in the East, due to their suboptimal location in catchments, e.g., with inadequate upstream areas (low hydraulic loads) and/or low share of arable land (low nutrient loads). Suboptimal location of CWs generates both higher than necessary costs and low area-specific nutrient retention, leading to low cost-efficiency. Some high cost-efficiency CWs were identified, especially for N retention in the West. To increase their cost-efficiency, continued investments in CWs require clear guidance and instructions. To achieve optimal placement, both CW site and size in relation to incoming hydraulic and nutrient loads must be considered.

AB  - In Sweden, drainage and the construction of water infrastructure have influenced agriculture in the last few centuries both positively and negatively. Recently, a trend has set in where wetlands are constructed to retain water, retain and reduce nutrients and to enhance the biodiversity. This study aimed to use remote sensing techniques to study landscape water retention over time. In this pilot study, water retention structures in Gotland (57 degrees 28'35.0 '' N18 degrees 29' 13.9 '' E) and Kalmar Lan (56 degrees 39'41 '' N16 degrees 21'46 '' E) for 2000/2001 and 2020 were identified and analyzed using Landsat data. In this study, it was found that the number of water retention structures (>0.8 ha) increased from 44 to 101 for Gotland Lan and from 44 to 127 for Kalmar Lan. Most water retention structures were <4 ha and were located in mid- and downstream areas. A comparison of the remote sensed results with the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) database showed a disagreement of the spatial coordinates of the wetlands in the database with the water retention structures. This pilot study has shown that remote sensed data can be used to identify water retention structures, although higher resolution imagery would be highly advisable in these kinds of studies.

AB  - Aim To contribute directly to Norway's national and international commitments to systematic, long-term conservation of crop wild relatives (CWR) by ensuring both the in situ and ex situ protection and availability of a broad range of CWR genetic diversity within the country.
   Location Norway.
   Methods We created a priority list of CWR within Norway based upon four main criteria including economic value from national to global level of associated crops and inclusion in Annex 1 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA). Species presence data were gathered from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and used for predictive species distribution modelling in MaxEnt. CAPFITOGEN software was utilized to create an ecogeographic land characterization (ELC) map and to identify complementary in situ genetic reserves and ex situ collecting priorities which target the full range of ecogeographic diversity of taxa.
   Results An inventory of 204 priority CWR within Norway was compiled. A grid cell complementary network of 19 in situ areas (similar to 10 km(2) ) conserved 201 priority CWR, and a separate analysis identified a protected area complementary network of 23 reserves that conserved 181 priority taxa. For ex situ conservation, 177 taxa did not have ex situ accessions and of the 24 with accessions, 15 had the minimum of five populations conserved throughout their ecogeographic range.
   Main conclusions We present the first comprehensive national recommendations for in situ and ex situ conservation of 204 priority CWR in Norway. Proposals target the conservation of the ecogeographic diversity of the priority CWR and hence their genetic diversity. Both the priority taxa and the methodology used are applicable at regional and global scales with the recommendations not only helping Norway to meet its international obligations for conservation of genetic diversity of CWR but also ensuring this genetic diversity is available for use in tackling global food security.

AB  - Replacing some meat with grain legumes would benefit human health, the environment and agriculture. This study analysed legume and meat consumption practices by investigating consumer perceptions and competences relating to lightly processed grain legumes (LPL), legume-based meat substitutes (LBMS) and meat in Sweden, and how these (and demographic variables) influenced stated intention to change consumption. Major differences in consumer perceptions of LPL and LBMS compared with meat related to product attractiveness and status, with meat seen as more fun, popular, suitable in diets and for festive occasions, and tastier. Most consumers knew of the environmental impact of meat and health benefits of LPL. Country of origin, i.e. Swedish origin, was important for many consumers (especially for meat and women). Preferences relating to health and environmental impact were important for intention to decrease meat consumption. Perceived environmental impact was important for intention to change consumption of LPL, but taste, healthiness, weight control, ease of preparation and suitability in the diet were equally or more important. Leveraging stated consumer willingness and intention to eat more LPL by making LPL more accessible to consumers could increase their consumption. For LBMS, there are still important barriers in terms of taste, familiarity and overall attractiveness of these products that need to be overcome to increase their consumption in Sweden.

AB  - Arctic freshwaters are facing multiple environmental pressures, including rapid climate change and increasing land-use activities. Freshwater plankton assemblages are expected to reflect the effects of these stressors through shifts in species distributions and changes to biodiversity. These changes may occur rapidly due to the short generation times and high dispersal capabilities of both phyto- and zooplankton. Spatial patterns and contemporary trends in plankton diversity throughout the circumpolar region were assessed using data from more than 300 lakes in the U.S.A. (Alaska), Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. The main objectives of this study were: (1) to assess spatial patterns of plankton diversity focusing on pelagic communities; (2) to assess dominant component of beta diversity (turnover or nestedness); (3) to identify which environmental factors best explain diversity; and (4) to provide recommendations for future monitoring and assessment of freshwater plankton communities across the Arctic region. Phytoplankton and crustacean zooplankton diversity varied substantially across the Arctic and was positively related to summer air temperature. However, for zooplankton, the positive correlation between summer temperature and species numbers decreased with increasing latitude. Taxonomic richness was lower in the high Arctic compared to the sub- and low Arctic for zooplankton but this pattern was less clear for phytoplankton. Fennoscandia and inland regions of Russia represented hotspots for, respectively, phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity, whereas isolated regions had lower taxonomic richness. Ecoregions with high alpha diversity generally also had high beta diversity, and turnover was the most important component of beta diversity in all ecoregions. For both phytoplankton and zooplankton, climatic variables were the most important environmental factors influencing diversity patterns, consistent with previous studies that examined shorter temperature gradients. However, barriers to dispersal may have also played a role in limiting diversity on islands. A better understanding of how diversity patterns are determined by colonisation history, environmental variables, and biotic interactions requires more monitoring data with locations dispersed evenly across the circumpolar Arctic. Furthermore, the importance of turnover in regional diversity patterns indicates that more extensive sampling is required to fully characterise the species pool of Arctic lakes.

AB  - Socio-economic development has shaped fisheries social-ecological systems (SES) worldwide across different scales. No work has yet undertaken how this development led to novel, not experienced before, systems structure in marine SES. Here, we quantify socio-economic novelty as the degree of dissimilarity relative to a specific spatiotemporal baseline in the Baltic Sea fisheries SES between 1975 and 2015. We used catch by "gears," catch by "commercial groups" and trade ("import" and "export") as respective indicators of novelty at national, regional and international governance levels. We found that socio-economic novelty increased over time nonlinearly in relation to the 1975-1979 baseline. The contribution to total novelty shifted from the dominance of "gears" and "commercial groups" in the late 1990s and early 2000s to "import" and "export" after the mid-2000s, i.e. from national and regional levels to the international level. The fastest increase in novelty occurred with the trade dominance shift, primarily related to monetary value rather than quantity. Spatially, novelty emerged with a large difference across countries, and a major contribution by Sweden, Denmark and Poland. We identified the influence of different management interventions and governance actions on the emergence of novelty in the Baltic SES. The decreasing socio-economic novelty at national and regional levels could indicate reduced variability due to management intervention in recent years which might decrease SES resilience to shocks. Calculating socio-economic novelty and studying its drivers at different scales could provide a better understanding of SES complexity and inform urgently needed adaptation and transformation towards sustainable future pathways.

AB  - In coastal areas different views, strategies, policies, practices and technologies about digital spatial data need to be viewed comprehensively. We propose a structured approach to enhance the use of geographical information in coastal applications in three different levels. The building of a Coastal Geographic Information System involves a clear determination of the specific information needs and user groups that correspond to the coastal area in question, and furthermore their evaluation prior to the actual implementation of the system. Second, primary coastal data can be effectively converted into coastal knowledge through enhanced conceptualisation, data combinations and spatial modelling, gaining better spatial data contents to facilitate research, administration and management. Third, Coastal Spatial Data Infrastructures should be promoted to facilitate inter-institutional collaboration and information sharing. The structured approach is presented using the case of the southwest Finnish archipelago coast as an example area. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We compiled regional and continental data on inorganic nitrogen (N) in seepage and surface water from temperate forests. Currently, N concentrations in forest waters are usually well below water quality standards. But elevated concentrations are frequently found in regions with chronic N input from deposition (> 8-10 kg ha(-1) a(-1)). We synthesized the current understanding of factors controlling N leaching in relation to three primary causes of N cycle disruption: (i) Increased N input (air pollution, fertilization, N-2 fixing plants). In European forests, elevated N deposition explains approximately half of the variability in N leaching, some of the remaining variability could be explained by differences in N availability or "N status". For coniferous forests, needle N content above 1.4% and (or) forest floor C:N ratio lower than 25 were thresholds for elevated nitrate leaching. At adjacent sites conifer forests receive higher N deposition and exhibit higher nitrate loss than deciduous forests; an exception is alder that shows substantial nitrate leaching through N fixation input. Fertilization with N poses limited risk to water quality, when applied to N-limited forests. (ii) Reduced plant uptake (clear-cut, thinning, weed control). The N cycle responses to plant cover disturbance by clear-cut are well studied. Nitrate losses peak after 2-3 years and are back to pre-cut levels after 3-5 years. Nitrogen losses increase with deposition and are higher at N rich sites. The extent and duration of the nitrate response is especially connected to the recovery of the vegetation sink. Less intensive disturbances like thinning have only minor effects on N loss. (iii) Enhanced mineralization of soil N (liming, ditching, climate change). Responses in nitrate leaching after liming may increase with N deposition and in older stands. However data on these types of N cycle disruption are too sparse to allow general conclusions on controlling factors. Nitrate leaching occurs when N deposition (input) and net mineralization (N status) exceed plant demand. A combined N flux to the soil of 50 to 60 kg ha(-1) a(-1) from N deposition and litterfall may be a threshold for nitrate leaching in undisturbed forests. This threshold also indicates risk of increasing losses in case of a disturbance (e.g., clear-cut). We conclude by discussing forest management options for water quality protection. These options focus on decreasing input, increasing plant uptake, increasing biomass removal, and (re)establishing immobilization and denitrification processes at the catchment scale.

AB  - Environmental pollution, increased energy consumption, and growing demand for the energy sector have been widely discussed. Due to policymakers and different organizations impacting a lot of new regulations, tools have been implemented to use clean energy that has zero impact on the environment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) supports energy efficiency and evaluation by developing tracking indicators and analyzing energy consumption data. The paper identifies critical indicators for efficient green energy production and ranks the IEA member countries using the CRITIC-TOPSIS method. Results showed that CO2 emissions and monitoring energy consumption are the most significant indicators while assessing the countries' performance regarding green energy production. The results indicated Sweden as the best-performing country regarding green energy production and reaching energy efficiency between 1990 and 2020. While Turkey and the USA ranked last, resulting in significantly increased CO2 emissions within the time range that need more efforts and policy implications to reach similar energy efficiency levels as other IEA countries.

AB  - In this study, the total flows of cadmium in Sweden in the period 1940-1990 - based on trade statistics, the manufacture of goods and the persistence of products in the environment - have been calculated. The metal industry, the mining of zinc and lead ores and the manufacturing of phosphorus fertilizers have been the dominant sources of industrial cadmium emissions to the environment. The application of fertilizers has led to the depositing of significant amounts of cadmium on agricultural land. Consumption emissions have originated from the use of cadmium in various products, e.g. rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries, pigments, stabilizers in polyvinyl-chloride plastics and protective plating for metals. The total calculated emissions of cadmium in Sweden, from production and consumption, have, in the past, been approximately 1700 t. The accumulated amount of cadmium used, including cadmium in alloys and as impurities in zinc, is approximately 5000 t. The 'societal weathering rate' exceeded the natural rate more than 4 times in 1970, and the present rate (1990) of anthropogenic emissions is still higher than the natural release due to weathering.

T2  - ENERGY

KW  - SWEDEN
AB  - Replacing fossil fuels with sustainably-produced biomass will reduce the net flow of CO2 to the atmosphere. We express the efficiency of this substitution in reduced emissions per unit of used land or biomass and in costs of the substitution per tonne of C. The substitution costs are calculated as the cost difference between continued use of fossil fuels at current prices and the use of biomass, assuming that the biomass technologies are implemented when reinvestments in existing technologies are required. Energy inputs into biomass production and conversion are biomass-based, resulting in a CO2-neutral fuel cycle, while CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are estimated for the complete fuel cycles. Substituting biomass for fossil fuels in electricity and heat production is, in general, less costly and provides larger CO2 reduction per unit of biomass than substituting biomass for gasoline or diesel used in vehicles. For transportation, methanol or ethanol produced from short-rotation forests or logging residues provide larger CO2-emission reductions than rape methyl ester from rape seed, biogas from lucerne (alfalfa), or ethanol from wheat. Of these, methanol has the lowest emission-reduction costs. Increasing biomass used by 125 TWh/yr, the estimated potential for increased utilization of logging residues, straw and energy crops, would eliminate more than one-half of the Swedish CO2 emissions from fossil fuels of 15 Mtonnes C in 1992.

AB  - We focus on a large and sustained stakeholder process for river restoration related to hydropower production that failed to reach any significant natural resource management outcomes. We explore to what extent the stakeholder process can be characterized as a learning-based intervention as well as the reasons for the lack of outcomes. The analysis draws on insights from existing literature of procedural and institutional factors identified to foster and hinder social learning in stakeholder processes. The analysis finds that the stakeholder process featured virtually all fostering procedural factors as well as various fostering institutional factors identified in the literature. The main hindering institutional element consisted of strong pre-existing water rights, granted by the legislation governing hydropower production and river restoration in Sweden. Existing legislation provided a key stakeholder with the power to successfully reach its objective through the unilateral action of exiting the stakeholder process. Our results demonstrate that various learning outcomes, including knowledge acquisition, trust building, and the creation of networks are possible in stakeholder processes that feature power imbalances. The results also suggest that, ultimately, the power imbalance limited the process from reaching significant natural resource management outcomes, both in the short and longer terms. Based on comparison with international cases, the results reveal the need to focus attention on the national scale to remediate power imbalances in stakeholder processes that arise from a share of stakeholders possessing strong prior rights to the use of natural resources. In such cases, sustainable management of natural resources could be better served by efforts to modify existing legislation, rather than investments in resource-intensive learning-based interventions.

AB  - The diversity of festivals in Finnmark, Norway, was researched with the aim of creating a festival map of the county's Festivalscape. Data were collected by questionnaires to the registered festival managers. It was concluded that Finnmark is a festive county where 72,000 people share close to 60 festivals arranged annually in 19 municipalities across the county. The festivals were categorized as either music, arts, sports or market festivals, however the largest group were named thematic festivals as they are each built around rather unique themes, thus representing a diverse example of festival variety and creativity. Even so, live music and food sales are found at most festivals, and all festivals have more than one main activity. Festivals are by no means a source of paid employment for the inhabitants, but rich opportunities for more than 3000 volunteers to participate in creating compressed cultural expressions and develop social networks. The number of visitors at the festivals varies from 100 to 10,000 persons. It is also a cost effective way of culture production as most of the festivals present budgets below 500,000 NOK. Entrance fees, sales of merchandise, sponsorship and public municipality funding are the most important source of sponsorship. A wide range of themes are represented in these festivals in which ethnicity, nationality and various border themes also play roles as ideological bases and cultural framing of the events. The tourism potential of the festivals and their actual production processes seems underdeveloped.

AB  - The transfer of scientific knowledge has received great attention by scientists and policymakers especially in fields that are crucially dependent on scientific knowledge like biodiversity conservation or climate change. Although many efforts have been made to better understand how scientific expertise can have an impact on politics, few studies have investigated the influence of limiting factors on scientific knowledge transfer. In this paper, we use a meta-analysis of 13 existing individual case studies from 5 different countries that all have in common that they apply the Research-Integration-Utilization model (the RIU model) to analyze limits of scientific knowledge transfer within research, integration, and utilization. Our results show that the factors of research, integration, and utilization are independent from each other in limiting or increasing the transfer of scientific knowledge. The independence of the RIU's factors also reveals that the increase of scientific knowledge alone will not lead to an improvement in knowledge transfer. There is empirical evidence in our cases providing that utilization could also be possible without a strong scientific basis, and successful integration could be based on weak scientific grounds. As a result of the independence of the different factors the RIU model consists of, the traps of scientific knowledge transfer could be observed in one or multiple RIU's factors and therefore improvements in scientific knowledge transfer should be orientated toward solely one or multiple factors instead of the whole process. We recommend that single improvements of different individual factors (research, integration, utilization) can help to improve the whole process of scientific knowledge transfer.

AB  - Environmental degradation is an important threat to sustainable development. Economic growth and fossil fuel-based energy consumption are main factors causing environmental pollution. The use of renewable energy as an alternative for fossil fuels can help to reduce environmental pollution, and thus, sustainable development can be achieved. From this point of view, hydropower is the most widely used renewable energy source in several countries. However, the effects of hydropower energy on the environment are controversial. To add a new dimension to the discussion, this study investigates the relationship between hydropower energy consumption, ecological footprint and economic growth for the top six hydropower-consuming countries within the framework of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study employs newly developed cointegration and causality tests with smooth structural changes over the period 1965-2016. The findings of the Fourier bootstrap ARDL procedure demonstrate that no cointegration exist between the variables. Therefore, the EKC hypothesis is not valid for Brazil, China, Canada, India, Norway and the US. Furthermore, the findings of the Fourier Toda-Yamamoto causality test suggest unidirectional causality running from hydropower energy consumption to economic growth in Brazil, and bidirectional causality between these variables in China. In the case of the top six hydropower-consuming countries, no evidence was found for a causal relationship between hydropower energy and ecological footprint. Overall, these results are important for policy makers. Hydropower energy plays a crucial role in China and Brazil's economic growth policies. On the other hand, hydropower energy consumption and economic growth do not have a role in mitigating the ecological footprint in six countries. For this reason, different types of renewable energy consumption should be taken into consideration by countries for the solution of environmental problems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In a boreal forest in southeast Norway, we evaluated the relative importance of stand-level structures versus historical data on forest age and absence of logging (at two spatial scales; stand and surrounding landscape), on the presence and abundance of the wood-rotting fungi Phellinus nigrolitnitatus and Cystostereum murraii. Both species are often considered to be indicators of long-time continuous presence of downed logs in Scandinavian forest stands.
   Of the stand-level variables, number of logs in late stages of decay was positively related to P. nigrolimitatus presence, while diversity of coarse woody debris was positively related to the abundance of the species. Both the presence and abundance of P. nigrolitnitatus was strongly and positively correlated with the area of forest uninterrupted by major disturbance the past 240 years (equalling 140 years of "old growth continuity") in the surrounding landscape (80 ha). For C murraii, consistent results was not found.
   We conclude that the causal relationships between ecological continuity and possible indicator species must be investigated on a larger scale than the stand-level as the condition of the forest surrounding a stand can have a large influence on these relationships.

AB  - This paper studies how political conditions and external events influenced the rise and fall of offshore wind on the political agenda in Norway between 2005 and 2012. In this sense, the paper contributes to recent debates about the role of politics in sustainable transitions. Key findings are that changes in government posts combined with a need for the offshore petroleum industry to diversify created favourable conditions for offshore wind. However, offshore wind as a solution to articulated problems was insufficiently developed when the window of opportunity opened up. The analysis then shows how a recovery in the offshore petroleum industry and new changes inside government closed the window of opportunity. The paper concludes that we should attend more to the interests of government actors, and conflicts inside government, in the analysis of energy transitions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

AB  - For decades, feminist activists and scholars have stressed the importance of integrating gender perspectives into the most defining challenge of our time: the climate disaster. In this article, we analyze official Norwegian policy documents in the context of regional and supra-national levels. We identify a lack of connection between gender equality policy and climate policy in the Norwegian policy documents that is symptomatic of a general silence on gender in climate policy in the Global North. We argue that there is untapped potential for gender mainstreaming in Norwegian climate policy and suggest that gendered, disaggregated data on climate issues could be combined with scholarly insights about the Nordic gender equality model so as to further our understanding of the climate crisis. Finally, we ask whether the absence of gender perspectives in Norwegian climate policy may reflect an unrecognized contradiction between Nordic gender equality policy and sustainability.

AB  - The heaths of Lygra, western Norway, were investigated, and 19 communities at the association level were distinguished. Distinct ecotypes of Ranunculus acris and Poa humilis and microspecies of Euphrasia were restricted to the grass heaths. No distinct ecotypes were found in the Calluna-dominated vegetation. It is suggested that the regular burning, which has been part of the management of the area, has activated the seed bank of the ericaceous heath, and thus maintained genetic diversity and slowed down ecotype differentiation. The grass heaths, with no combustible material, have been unaffected in this way. Permanent plots in the two dominant heath types, dry heath (Vaccinio-Callunetum) and wet heath (Ericetum tetralicis) were followed over six years and the data analysed using a modification of Jaccard's index, allowing for species abundances.

AB  - The theoretical concept of "climate-smart forestry" aims to integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation to maintain and enhance forests' contributions to people and global agendas. We carried out two local transdisciplinary collaboration processes with the aim of developing local articulations of climate-smart forestry and to identify barriers, pathways and indicators to applying it in practice. During workshops in northern and southern Sweden, local stakeholders described how they would like forests to be managed, considering their past experiences, future visions and climate change. As a result, the stakeholders framed climate-smart forestry as active and diverse management towards multiple goals. They identified several conditions that could act both as barriers and pathways for its implementation in practice, such as value chains for forest products and services, local knowledge and experiences of different management alternatives, and the management of ungulates. Based on the workshop material, a total of 39 indicators for climate-smart forestry were identified, of which six were novel indicators adding to the existing literature. Our results emphasize the importance of understanding the local perspectives to promote climate-smart forestry practices across Europe. We also suggest how the concept of climate-smart forestry can be further developed, through the interplay between theory and practice.

AB  - One of the effects of climate change is an increasing frequency of heavy rainfall events, which in turn leads to increased flooding damage in urban areas. The purpose of this study was to develop a tool for dynamic risk evaluation that can be used to fulfil several of the goals in the European Flood Risk Management Directive. Flood risk analysis was performed as a spatial GIS analysis with the FME software. The primary data source for the analysis was a 1D/2D model calculation, wherein 1D models described the pipeline network and the watercourses and a 2D model described surface runoff. An ArcGIS online platform was developed to visualize the results in a format understandable for decision makers. The method and tool were tested for the Norwegian capital of Oslo. The tool developed in the study enabled the efficient analysis of consequences for various precipitation scenarios. Results could be used to identify the areas most vulnerable to flooding and prioritize areas in which measures need to be implemented. The study showed that for urban areas in steep terrain, it is essential to include water velocity and depth-integrated velocity in risk analysis in addition to water depths and pipe network capacity.

AB  - Avoiding urban sprawl and increasing density are often considered as effective means to mitigate climate change through urban planning. However, there have been rapid technological changes in the fields of housing energy and private driving, and the development is continuing. In this study, we analyze the carbon footprints of the residents living in new housing in different urban forms in Finland. We compare the new housing to existing housing stock. In all areas, the emissions from housing energy were significantly lower in new buildings. However, in the inner urban areas the high level of consumption, mostly due to higher affluence, reverse the gains of energy efficient new housing. The smallest carbon footprints were found in newly built outer and pen-urban areas, also when income level differences were taken into account. Rather than strengthening the juxtaposition of urban and suburban areas, we suggest that it would be smarter to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of both modes of living and develop a more systemic strategy that would result in greater sustainability in both areas. Since such strategy does not exist yet, it should be researched and practically developed. It would be beneficial to focus on area specific mitigation measures.

AB  - Profitability and other economic aspects of farming in Finland are analyzed using clustering of the self-organizing map. The analysis of profitability bookkeeping data reveals several interesting relationships between the monitored financial variables. Economic profiles of farms are presented based on the clustering, and the findings are confirmed with statistical tests. A weight optimization system is proposed for upscaling financial figures of the sample of profitability bookkeeping farms to the whole country level. The system output is analyzed, and it is confirmed that the most important large and medium-sized enterprises are represented well by the sample. Furthermore, it seems that the utilized arable area is the key factor in guiding the weight optimization process. These findings may turn out to be useful in developing the sampling of bookkeeping farms in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper aims to calculate and evaluate the degree of achieved agricultural sustainability in the countries of the European Union. Agriculture is a specific activity that, on the one hand, must provide sufficient amounts of food for the population, while on the other hand, it can have a significant negative impact on the environment. The assessment of agricultural sustainability was made by selecting ten relevant indicators from the Eurostat and OECD databases, and by creating a composite index using the Mazziotta-Pareto method. The research results show that the Northern Europe countries (Sweden, Finland and Denmark) achieve the highest level of agricultural sustainability, mainly due to the high participation of organic agricultural production, as well as the low level of soil erosion, considering all European countries. On the contrary, countries with high agricultural economic performance show significantly worse results in terms of sustainability (such as Italy, Spain and France).

AB  - Concrete and asphalt are the two competitive materials for a highway. In Sweden, the predominant material for the highway system is asphalt. But under certain conditions, concrete pavements are competitive alternatives. For example, concrete pavements are suitable for high-traffic volume roads, roads in tunnels, concentrated loads (e.g., bus stops and industrial pavement). Besides the load-carrying capacity, the concrete pavement has many advantages such as durability (wear resistance), resistance against frost heave, environment (pollution, recycling, and low rolling resistance leading to fuel savings), fire resistance, noise limitations, brightness, evenness and aesthetics.
   Concrete pavements are long-lasting but need final repair. Single slabs may crack in the jointed concrete pavement due to various structural and non-structural factors. Repair and maintenance operations are, therefore, necessary to increase the service life of the structures. To avoid extended lane closures, prevent traffic congestions, and expedite the pavement construction process, precast concrete technology is a recent innovative construction method that can meet the requirement of rapid construction and rehabilitation of the pavement. This paper evaluates rapid repair techniques of concrete pavement using precast concrete technology by analysing three case studies on jointed precast concrete pavements. The study showed that the required amount of time to re-open the pavement to traffic is dramatically reduced with jointed precast concrete panels.

AB  - The question of how the urgent transformation in fossil fuel based economies might be realised has come to occupy an increasingly prominent place within the social sciences. The challenge here is often cast in terms of how one or more existing system can be replaced by alternatives in which the carbon content has been removed or at least diluted by purposeful interventions. Here we approach the question from a different angle, asking how ongoing transformations in critical systems (in this case energy) are or may be leveraged in relation to climate change. We take as our focus the emergence of the smart city and examine a case in which the notion of the smart city has become wedded to the ambition for a low carbon city: Malmo, Sweden. As commentators suggest, the growth of the smart city reflects a capitalist reflex to develop new waves of investment to realise new arenas for capital accumulation in the city. Yet shifting from this broad political economy diagnosis, we argue that there is a need to attend to the ways in which climate is imbued and embedded in the smart city and how this in turn enables and constrains low carbon transitions.

AB  - Mark-recapture experiments in replicated experimental plots were used to assess the relative effects of a barley crop and two widths of a field boundary on the field-to-field movement of three carabid species.  Movement of Harpalus rufipes, Pterostichus melanarisu and P. niger was slower through a grassy bank than through a barley crop, indicating that the bank had a lower permeability to these species than the crop.  Other variables affecting the movement of carabids through the field boundary were species, dietary condition and width of the field boundary.  The implications of these results are discussed in relation to the dynamics of carabid dispersal on farmland.

AB  - Capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus L., 1758) and black grouse (Tetrao tetrix L., 1758 (= Lyrurus tetrix (L., 1758))) are two sympatric Eurasian lekking grouse species that differ markedly in habitat affinities and social organization. We examined how size and spacing of leks in pristine (Russia) and managed (Norway) forests were related to habitat and social behavior. Leks of both species were larger and spaced farther apart in the pristine landscape. Capercaillie leks were regularly spaced at 2-3 km distance, increasing with lek size, which in turn was positively related to the amount of middle-aged and older forests in the surrounding area. Black grouse leks were irregularly distributed at shorter distances of 1-2 km, with lek size explained by the size of the open bog arena and the amount of open habitat in the surroundings. At the landscape scale, spatial distribution of open bogs and social attraction among male black grouse caused leks to be more aggregated, whereas mutual avoidance in male capercaillie caused leks to be spaced out. In the pristine landscape, large-scale and long-term changes in forest dynamics owing to wildfires, combined with an aggregated pattern of huge bog complexes, presumably provide both grouse species with enough time and space to build up bigger lek populations than in the managed landscape.

AB  - Electric scooters (e-scooters) have become a popular phenomenon internationally; however, their use has raised concerns about pedestrian safety. This study describes the possible effects of the emergence of e-scooters on pedestrians. We focus on the interaction, conflicts, crashes, and attitudes between pedestrians and e-scooter riders and pedestrians' perceived safety in the presence of e-scooters. Data were collected from e-scooter riders and non-riders (n = 3385) through an online survey in Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Norway, and Sweden. Around 20-30% of e-scooter riders rode on sidewalks, whether it is allowed or not. Non-riders of e-scooters tended to report that riding an e-scooter is rather dangerous. Pedestrians, except Australian ones, perceived e-scooter riders (and e-scooter operation) as annoying. Half of the e-scooter riders had experienced a near miss at some point in the past and more than 50% of these near misses included another road user. Up to 10% of the e-scooter riders from all five countries reported having experienced a crash. On the basis of these findings, we believe that the most relevant suggestions for the implications in sustainable (urban) mobility involve separating e-scooter riders and pedestrians.

AB  - During the latest early Campanian, a diverse vertebrate assemblage inhabited the shallow coastal waters of the Kristianstad Basin, southernmost Sweden. The taxon-rich fauna includes numerous species of sharks, rays, chimaeroids, bony fish, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, aquatic birds, crocodiles, and turtles. Vertebrate fossils have been found at several localities within the basin, representing at least three different environments: near-shore waters around a rocky island, presumably murky, shallow waters adjacent to a river mouth, and more open coastal waters. Many vertebrates in the marine faunal community were high-level predators, others were piscivorous, bottom-dwellers that fed primarily on benthic invertebrates and fish, or omnivores that fed on algae and invertebrates. The fauna thus exploited a wide range of food sources and habitats. Six trophic levels, ranging from primary producers to fifth-level consumers, are recognised, indicating a high loss of energy and reflecting a mixture of shallow coastal and more open water ecosystems. The trophic structure suggests that the basin was a rich palaeoenvironment with high faunal diversity and productivity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Organizational resilience emphasizes the adaptive capacity for renewal after crisis. This paper explores the sustainability and resilience of a not-for-profit firm that claims to contribute to sustainable development of the food system. We used semi-structured interviews and Holling's adaptive cycle as a heuristic device to assess what constitutes social and sustainable entrepreneurship in this case, and we discuss the determinants of organizational resilience. The business, Biodynamiska Produkter (BP), has experienced periods of growth, conservation and rapid decline in demand, followed by periods of re-organization. Our results suggest that BP, with its social mission and focus on organic food, meets the criteria of both a social and sustainability entrepreneurial organization. BP also exhibits criteria for organizational resilience: two major crises in the 1970s and late 1990s were met by re-organization (transformation) and novel market innovations (adaptations). BP has promoted the organic food sector in Sweden, but not profited from this. In this case study, resilience has enhanced sustainability in general, but trade-offs were also identified. The emphasis on trust, local identity, social objectives and slow decisions may have impeded both economic performance and new adaptations. Since the successful innovation Ekoladan in 2003, crises have been met by consolidation rather than new innovations.

AB  - The paper examines the impact of the social dimension of sustainable competitiveness on the economic dimension, where the social dimension is represented by Indicators of social sustainability, and economic dimension by the Global competitiveness index, GCI. This allows for the identification of various Indicators of social sustainability and their individual and aggregate impact on GCI, which allows for identifying strengths and weaknesses in building competitiveness (from social aspect) and gives recommendations for strengthening and improving competitiveness of the observed group of countries. In this regard, impact model of indicators of social sustainability on GCI is defined, and examined based on a sample of 30 European countries. Data in WEF Global Competitiveness Report for for 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was used. Analysis included two sets of countries with data on: 17 old free market economy countries in Europe (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK) and 13 post transition free market economy countries in Europe on the basis of the economic historical background (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Rep., Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovak Rep., Slovenia).

AB  - Lake Sakylan Pyhajarvi has been an important fishing site and drinking water source for the local population for centuries. The lake has undergone significant changes: (1) the water level was lowered in the 1600s and in the 1850s; (2) planktivorous coregonid fish were successfully introduced in the early 1900s; (3) nutrient input from intensified agriculture has increased since the 1950s and (4) the effects of the current variable climate on the lake and its catchment have become more evident since the 1990s. We determined the phases of oligotrophication, eutrophication and recovery and elucidated the ecosystem changes by combining palaeolimnological records with detailed neolimnological data. The sedimentary diatom and cladoceran assemblages first showed a relatively eutrophic period followed by oligotrophic periods, linked with the artificial changes in water level and consequent shifts in macrophyte abundance. The oligotrophic period in the early 1900s is thought to represent the target trophic state for the lake. After the 1950s, introduction of vendace resulted in higher planktivory reflected by an increased relative abundance of small-bodied pelagic cladocerans. Signs of eutrophication occurred due to increased nutrient load. During the last 10 years, signs of recovery have been recorded. A complex history such as that of Lake Pyhajarvi illustrates the difficulties in selecting management targets, and the risk of setting false targets, for lakes based solely on monitoring data-both neolimnological and palaeolimnological approach are needed.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between regional branding, global visions of the Arctic, and tourism seasonality. We analyse tourism development in the Yllas tourism destination in Finnish Lapland, exemplifying how Arctic branding and place production are fostered and challenged among tourism actors. To analyse tourism actors' perspectives on growth and development, we employ an Arctification perspective, understood as a form of globalisation and spatiocultural expansion of the Arctic in northern Europe. In more detail, the article examines tourism actors' views on seasonality and year-round tourism, as these divide opinions and exemplify key development challenges and limits in the Arctic. We provide an analysis of tourism actor interviews from Yllas, describing attitudes towards seasonality, growth, and the role of Arctic branding and the related regionalisation process in tourism development. The results reveal adaptation and opposing approaches to seeing Yllas through the global lenses of the Arctic. We further divide these positions into exogenous and endogenous tourism development strategies. The study elaborates on how northern areas are simplistically and export-oriented associated with the Arctic through the social process of Arctification. Finally, the article proposes contextualising seasonality more robustly by paying close attention to socio-ecological sustainability, local contradictions, and alternative opinions in envisioning Arctic tourism development.

AB  - Most populations of large mammals in developed countries are managed by human hunting, but there are surprisingly few empirical studies about the benefits and limitations of using recreational hunters to achieve specific management objectives. In particular, the extensive host culling required to markedly reduce population densities to combat some wildlife diseases may conflict with the management aims of landowners and hunters. This is particularly acute in the case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids, which has now emerged in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Norway. We analyzed the relative efficacy of approximately 1,000 recreational hunters and 30 professional marksmen during the eradication of the entire CWD-infected population of >2,000 reindeer in Norway. The government changed a series of legislation that would normally limit the efficacy of recreational hunters; these changes were linked to the duration of the hunting season, the specificity and size of the quotas, and spatial access rights. Efforts were taken to reduce both the searching time (hunters were given information on herd whereabouts) and handling time (helicopter aid for transport) of the recreational hunters. We compared 1) recreational hunting under ordinary legislation (up to 2016), 2) recreational hunting with less legislation (2017), and 3) culling by marksmen that were allowed to use both snowmobile and helicopter. Despite all of the changes in legislation, harvest by recreational hunters only increased from 241-316 during 2014-2016 to 582 reindeer in 2017 and was below management targets, while marksmen culled 1,399 reindeer, with a daily average and maximum offtake well above that of the hunters. The hunters shot more animals in the early season and during weekends. Offtake by both the hunters and marksmen were equally negatively affected by fog, which reduced visibility. We discuss the relative merits of using hunters and marksmen for wildlife control in general and limits to how legislation can increase offtake. We highlight the need for more research into how the use of marksmen comes with a cost in terms of social conflict. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Increases of riverine organic carbon concentrations have been observed across the northern hemisphere over the past few decades. These increases are the result of multiple environmental drivers, but the relative importance of the drivers is still unclear. We analyzed a dataset of >10 000 observations of riverine total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations and associated water chemistry and hydrological observations from 1993 to 2017. The observations span a ?600 km north?south gradient from 30 individual river systems in Finland. Our data show significantly increasing TOC concentrations in 25 out of 30 systems, with an average increase from 12.0 to 15.1 mg l(?1). The observed increase in riverine TOC concentrations led to an increase of 0.28 Mt in annual TOC load to the Baltic Sea from 1993 level to 2017 level. We analyzed the role of three putative environmental drivers of the observed TOC trends. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the most common driver was discharge, which alone explained TOC increases in 13 rivers, whereas pH and temperature were less important drivers (sole predictor in one and zero rivers, respectively). Different permutations of these three drivers were also found to be significant; the combination of discharge and pH being the most common (4 rivers). Land use was not in general linked with trends in TOC, except for the proportion of ditched land in the catchment, which was significantly correlated with increases in TOC concentration. Land use showed significant relationships with trends in discharge and pH. We also found that catchment characteristics are regulating the extent of these regional or global environmental changes causing the upward trends of riverine organic carbon.

AB  - This paper discusses in general terms the potential risk that increased recycling of materials in the technosphere may lead to significant changes in freight transportation demands. Such cyclic, as opposed to linear, material flows are proposed as one step towards an environmentally sustainable use of resources, Total volume of transported annual material flows in Sweden are estimated in order to provide a background for the analysis of transport demands:
   Raw material 210 Mton
   Products 165 Mton
   Residues from production 20 Mton
   Residues from consumption 10 Mton
   The difference in volume between raw material and products is explained by foreign trade, generation of residues and indefinite data. The difference in products compared to residues can primarily be explained by an increasing stock of materials in society, large pollution flows (e.g., CO,), and that resources have a higher water content than residues, On a qualitative basis, it can be argued that a drastic increase of transportation demand can not be expected by increased recycling. A decrease of transported raw material is expected for some sectors, while only limited increase of residue transports. Furthermore, it should also be observed that the problem of residue/ waste transportation is very small compared to the environmental impact of the total transportation sector. The main conclusion is therefore that the expected changes in transportation demand due to increased reuse and recycling, are not a general hindrance against introducing a more cyclic material management.

AB  - A new regulatory framework to support local quality and safety efforts in hospitals was introduced to the Norwegian healthcare system in 2017. This study aimed to investigate hospital managers' perspectives on implementation efforts and the resulting work practices, to understand if, and how, the new Quality Improvement Regulation influenced quality and safety improvement activities. Design This article reports one study level (the perspectives of hospital managers), as part of a multilevel case study. Data were collected by interviews and analysed according to qualitative content analysis. Setting Three hospitals retrieved from two regional health trusts in Norway. Participants 20 hospital managers or quality advisers selected from different levels of hospital organisations. Results Four themes were identified in response to the study aim: (1) adaptive capacity in hospital management and practice, (2) implementation efforts and challenges with quality improvement, (3) systemic changes and (4) the potential to learn. Recent structural and cultural changes to, and development of, quality improvement systems in hospitals were discovered (3). Participants however, revealed no change in their practice solely due to the new Quality Improvement Regulation (2). Findings indicated that hospital managers are legally responsible for quality improvement implementation and participants described several benefits with the new Quality Improvement Regulation (2). This related to adaptation and flexibility to local context, and clinical autonomy as an inevitable element in hospital practice (1). Trust and a safe work environment were described as key factors to achieve adverse event reporting and support learning processes (4). Conclusions This study suggests that a lack of time, competence and/or motivation, impacted hospitals' implementation of quality improvement efforts. Hospital managers' autonomy and adaptive capacity to tailor quality improvement efforts were key for the new Quality Improvement Regulation to have any relevant impact on hospital practice and for it to influence quality and safety improvement activities.

AB  - The expertise and knowledge of veterinary advisors on improving animal health management is key towards a better herd health status. However, veterinary advisors are not always aware of the goals and priorities of dairy farmers. To dairy farmers animal health is only one aspect of farm management and resources may be allocated to other more preferred areas. Veterinary advisors may experience this as non-compliant with their advice. To explore the preferences of European Union (EU) organic dairy farmers for improved animal health management relative to other farm management areas an adaptive conjoint analysis (ACA) was performed. A total of 215 farmers participated originating from organic dairy farms in France (n = 70), Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 28) and Sweden (n = 57). The management areas udder health and claw health represented animal health management whereas barn, calf and pasture management represented potential conflicting management areas. Results indicate that EU organic dairy farmers differ in their preferences for improved animal health management within the farming system. In general, improved calf management was the most preferred area and improved claw health management was found to be least preferred, the remaining areas were of intermediate interest. Cluster analyses on claw health measures and udder health measures resulted in respectively seven and nine distinct preference profiles. The results indicate a high degree of variation in farmers' preference, which cannot be explained by the typical herd characteristics. With the individual preferences revealed by ACA, a veterinary advisor can now find out whether his intended advice is directed at a favourable or unfavourable management area of the farmer. If the latter is the case the veterinarian should first create awareness of the problem to the farmer. Insights in individual farmers preferences will allow veterinary advisors to better understand why farmers were incompliant with their advice and improve their advice by showing, for example, the potential benefits of their advice.

AB  - To facilitate transitions in socio-technical systems, it is necessary to adopt a strategic and systemic perspective. The dynamics of socio-technical systems are associated with uncertainty and may yield to critical problems as the systems change and may lead to adverse results without deliberate intervention. This case study research develops a new theoretical framework to support strategic design interventions that aim to anticipate and address problems in systemic transitions by integrating two areas of knowledge strategic design and transitions theories. The theoretical framework is applied to a case study of facilitating salmon trout aquaculture in Finland that has been reaching stalemate. The resulting design demonstrates a new kind of strategic design intervention that is neither attached only to the present-day concerns to solve only present problems nor abstracted merely to the strategic level to project only long-term visions. Rather, the Strategic Ekofish Certification concept presents new strategic design with operational importance to mitigate foreseeable problems aligning with near-future goals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies of ground-nesting birds stress the importance of high nest losses as a factor influencing population dynamics. In particular, nest predation has been found to be accentuated in human-modified forest landscapes. In boreal ecosystems, the assemblage of nest predators is likely to be temporally variable. Thus, multi-year predation studies are required in order to highlight the temporal aspects of habitat and edge-specific ground-nest predation. On this basis, we conducted a 3-year predation study in Northern Norwegian mountain birch forests which had been fragmented by spruce plantations. Track boards were used to identify predators in different habitat and edge types. We used logistic regression to assess the importance and consistency of spatial and temporal predictors for the predation rate of six predator species. Total predation rates were high and were higher in the second and third year (range 89.9-96.7%) compared to the first year of the study (range 57.1-75.3%). Mammalian predation decreased while avian predation increased over the 3 years. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and hooded crow (Corvus cornix) were the dominant predators, followed by raven (Corvus corax) and magpie (Pica pica). Pine marten (Martes martes) and stoat (Mustela erminea) predation was low and almost absent in two of the years. Within the study years, predator species exhibited different temporal trends, probably owing to species-specific functional responses. While some edge types were preferred consistently over time by the dominant predators, the spatial pattern of predation was mainly due to unexplained large-scale differences among landscape blocks. This large-scale pattern was constant over the three study years despite the strong temporal fluctuation in predation rates within and between years.

AB  - By nature, oil and gas operations are sensitive to Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) requirements. Within the Norwegian Continental Self (NCS), it is mandatory to implement the Best Available Techniques (BAT) guidelines as required in the European Union's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) directive. The directive provides guidelines for selecting BAT in industrial activities while protecting the environment as a whole. One of the major challenges for an oil and gas operator is to satisfy the guidelines while confirming fitness for purpose with respect to the different technologies applied. Hence, the concept of technique qualification is paramount to reveal opportunities to improve system design, to minimize schedule risk and to reduce cost risks during operations by reducing uncertainties and increasing reliability.
   In this paper, we are concerned with the process of selecting a technique for supplying power from shore to an offshore unit. This paper discusses how we can give priorities to HSE concerns, while also satisfying financial objectives, in the context of implementing the BAT guidelines. The analysis aims to qualify the technique as a whole, considering the capability of satisfying the underlying objective of controlling environmental pollution.

AB  - A disease survey in Finnish oilseed Brassica (OSR) fields in 2007-09 revealed the widespread occurrence and several fold increase of necrotic stem base lesions and severely injured blackened roots in comparison to a corresponding survey carried out in 1984-89. Rhizoctonia solani was the predominant fungi detected in the isolations and was followed by several species of Fusarium and Thielaviopsis basicola. In 60% of the samples all three species were detected together. Only the R. solani AG 2-1 strains isolated from OSR and other cruciferous hosts caused damping off or stem base symptoms on turnip rape in a greenhouse experiment. Therefore R. solani AG 2-1 was considered the main pathogen associated with the observed symptoms in OSR crops. Cultural practices changed significantly between the 1980s and 2000s. In the 2007-09 survey there was an increase in the cultivation of oilseed rape instead of turnip rape, increase in the use of no soil or reduced soil tillage and of chemical control of weeds, but a reduction in macronutrient fertilization, especially P and K, when compared to the 1980s survey. The risk for high incidence of stem base lesions and blackened roots was affected by different cultural practices. No tillage and maintaining sufficient soil pH and NPK fertilisation decreased the risk for both types of R. solani induced symptoms. Late sowing date increased the risk for high incidence of stem base lesions, while application of fungicides against Sclerotinia reduced it. The incidence of R. solani damages in many fields was very high in spite of relatively long crop rotations and therefore the average effect of crop rotation in the disease was insignificant. Current turnip rape cultivars are vulnerable to root rot while oilseed rape is vulnerable to stem base symptoms. The higher incidence of R. solani induced diseases could be associated with the decline in productivity of OSR crops in Finland. This study showed that cultural practices such as reduced or no soil tillage, adequate levels of pH and of NPK fertilization could reduce the severity of the symptoms in OSR fields.

AB  - This research note suggests that the relationship between nature-based tourism entrepreneurs and money is complex and not fully understood. Based on observations from the Swedish supply data, four propositions are presented to illustrate why this is the case. We argue that (1) the identity of the entrepreneurs are not compatible with profit and growth, (2) niche markets and limited market knowledge obstruct opportunity for growth, (3) dependence of natural resources put sustainability ahead of growth and (4) nature-based tourism firms have limited control over their production process. These propositions can assist in better understanding how nature-based tourism companies can contribute to regional development and serve as a point of departure for further research.

AB  - The study uses content analysis to identify the sustainable attributes in 678 accommodation reviews from Finnish and Russian tourists published on the Tripadvisor website and examines the sustainability perceptions of these tourist groups. The servicescape framework was applied to the structuring of the attributes indicating sustain-ability in accommodation services. The sustainable attributes highlighted in the reviews were more frequently in the physical rather than in the social servicescape factor. The tourists also reported environmental sustainability attributes more often than those related to social, cultural and economic sustainability. Overall, the sustainable attributes were perceived positively. By analysing positive and negative tourists' perceptions in a sustainability context, this research provides insights drawn from tourists' perspectives to support the development of appealing and sustainable tourism accommodation products. The study also proposes a servicescape framework for managing environmental, social, cultural and economic sustainability in accommodation services.

AB  - PurposeThis study aims to investigate practitioners' perceptions of strategic work in municipal facilities management: how public facilities management is changing, what is included in strategic public facilities management and who leads the strategic work. Design/methodology/approachA literature review begins with mainstream studies of strategy management, ultimately concentrating on municipal facilities management. Findings are based on a 2020/2021 questionnaire targeting 356 practitioners in municipal facilities management across Sweden (50% response rate). The statistical treatment includes factor analysis. FindingsMost respondents indicated changed ways of managing facilities in the past five years; most reported that they were in an organization with an explicit goal of working more strategically. Respondents associated strategic facilities management with governance, facilities, sustainability, technology change and communication. Frequently, it was the management team of the facilities management department that led strategic work. Research limitations/implicationsResearch into municipal facilities management is dominated by studies in Northern Europe, and more studies from other regions are needed. How strategies and work roles evolve in parallel appears to be a fruitful direction of further research. Practical implicationsFacilities managers need stronger competences and more resources to engage in strategic facilities management. Findings indicate a need to integrate sustainability aspects better into long-term strategic work. Social implicationsMore strategic municipal facilities management is of obvious social value. Originality/valueThis is the first study of practitioner perceptions of work on strategic facilities management in municipalities.

AB  - Air pollution is estimated to cause more than 7000 deaths annually in Sweden alone. To reduce the impact of air pollution and to plan and build sustainable cities, it is vital that research is translated into efficient decisions and practice. However, how do civil servants in a municipality access research results? How do they normally find relevant information, and what obstacles are there to accessing and applying research results? As part of the collaborative and transdisciplinary research project Air Pollution Research in Local Environmental Planning (ARIEL), these questions were explored through interviews and seminars with civil servants within the Malmo Municipality Environmental Office. We found that the civil servants generally have proficiency in processing research results, but often do not use such results as part of their everyday decision making and practices. Instead, the data and measurements used are mostly produced case-by-case within the municipal sector itself. Information about best practices is also collected via a number of knowledge access practices, involving the Internet or social networks within other municipalities. Lack of time, paywalls, and the insufficient applicability of research hinder the dissemination of up-to-date results. This slows down the process whereby research, funded by tax-money, can be put to best practice in the effort to create healthy and sustainable cities.

AB  - We explored how consumers value the ecological and socio-cultural benefits of diversified food production systems in Finland. We used a stated preference method and contingent valuation to quantify consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the benefits of increased farm and regional scale diversity of cultivation practices and crop rotations. Three valuation scenarios were presented to a representative sample of consumers: the first one focused on agroecosystem services on cropland, the second on wider socio-cultural effects and the third was a combination of them. The results suggest that consumers are willing to pay on the average euro228 per household annually for the suggested diversification. This is equal to euro245 per hectare of cultivated cropland. The results also indicate that 21% of consumers were not willing to pay anything to support more diverse cropping systems. The relatively high WTP for both agroecological and socio-cultural benefits provide important messages for actors in the food chain and for policy makers on future targeting of economic resources within agri-environmental schemes.

KW  - MAYFIELD METHOD
AB  - Nest-site choice and reproductive success of Curlews Numenius arquata in different habitats were studied at a mixed farmland site (grasslands and flooded tilled fields relatively common) and at an arable farmland site (dry tilled fields more dominant than at the mixed site) in central Sweden. At both sites Curlews preferred to nest on grassland and fallow fields, where hatching success was higher than on tillage fields. Nests were also situated further away from forest edges than random sites, but hatching success did not vary with distance to the forest edge. Only 35.6% of the pairs were estimated to hatch young. The main cause of nest loss was predation and the second most important factor was destruction by farming practices, which was an important factor in tillage early in season. Surprisingly, nest survival was higher at the arable than at the mixed farmland site, probably being an effect of the increased proportion of fallowing during recent years. Mortality of chicks was 79.7% before fledgling age (both sites combined) and, surprisingly, chick survival was lower on meadows than on arable fields and leys. The mean production of young was only 0.25 fledglings per pair, which is lower than in areas less affected by farming practice. The low production of young is probably an important factor in the decline of Curlew populations on Swedish farmland. On bogs 1.4 fledglings per pair were produced, indicating that reproductive success of Curlews is higher in more natural habitats.

AB  - Experiences in airports may shape future travel plans and contribute to tourism destination development. However, a chaotic environment and time-consuming procedural routines in airports may result in negative associations towards the host country and its culture. Despite the existence of assistive airport applications, little attention is given to facilitating travelers' engagement with cultural exploration.
   This paper introduces a concept of interactive personalized storytelling that provides both a cultural learning adventure and connection to local retailing. Our application generates an imaginative Finnish storyline unique to every user to guide them through local shops in the airport. A field evaluation was conducted with 15 travelers of different nationalities. Travelers perceived the interactive storytelling experience as an interesting and unique way to spend waiting time at the airport while increasing cultural exposure. Moreover, we found this method to be effective in persuading travelers to explore local products at the airport. Further, our results give insight to designing storytelling applications for large public places.

AB  - Commercial farming of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) is now being developed in several countries. The ecological consequences of cod culture are poorly understood, but recent research suggests that Atlantic cod are more prone to escape from net pens than Atlantic salmon. Here, we describe the movements and the spatiotemporal distribution of farmed cod after escape relative to wild cod, both during and outside the natural spawning season. The experimental design included simulating escape incidents of farmed cod tagged with acoustic transmitters and using an array of automatic listening stations to monitor their dispersal and distribution. For comparison, local wild cod were monitored using the same array of receivers. The farmed cod dispersed rapidly after a simulated escape, they randomly distributed over large areas and their distribution overlapped with local wild cod. Moreover, escaped farmed fish were found at local cod spawning areas during the spawning season. The study also indicated that the recapture rate of escaped farmed cod was high compared with that of escaped farmed salmon. Thus, while our results showed that there is a considerable potential for ecosystem effects caused by escaped farmed cod, mitigating actions such as an efficient recapture fishery for escapees may be possible.

TI  - Mobility as a Late Modern Sensibility in the Short Stories of Tove Jansson
T2  - CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION
LA  - English
AB  - Finland-Swedish author Tove Jansson was an enthusiastic traveler, and traveling is said to have had a major impact on her writing. Although she is primarily famous for her fantastical Moomin works, she also wrote an extensive oeuvre of short stories and novels in which she insightfully represents the social reality of her time. This article examines travel and, more precisely, mobility as a late modern sensibility in Jansson?s short story collections Docksk?pet och andra ber?ttelser (1978, translated partly as Art in Nature, 2012) and Resa med l?tt baggage (1987, Traveling Light, 2010). This article discusses late modernity as a cultural period during which mobility, the potential and desire to move, has become key to understanding the life experience of the subject. It explicates the importance of mobility and its social stratification to late modernity and considers the desire for mobility as a recurring motif in Jansson?s stories. It also explores how the restrictions imposed on mobility represent an essential part of late modern life experience. Finally, it discusses how the stories? portrayals of mobile consumerism, in the forms of tourism and shopping, indicate that the desire for personal mobility reflects the desire for the freedom of movement of global capital.

AB  - 1. Introduced species are, world-wide, one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. Grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are one of many introduced species to have threatened a native congener; they are thought to have replaced red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris throughout much of the UK as a result of competition. The rate of competitive replacement may be influenced by habitat composition, with some red squirrel populations persisting for prolonged periods in the presence of greys in predominantly coniferous forest.
   2. Here the similarity of red and grey squirrels' pattern of habitat use was investigated in Craigvinean forest in Scotland, UK, a site that has experienced apparent coexistence for up to 30 years. Overlap was examined in several dimensions: spatial overlap of home ranges, dynamic association and niche overlap. Habitat selection was examined at three levels: selection of core home range areas, selection of tree species within the home range, and the characteristics of patches used intensively by each squirrel species in comparison with random locations within their home range.
   3. Although there was overlap between red and grey squirrel ranges, there were clear differences in the macrohabitats utilized, with red squirrels selecting areas of Norway spruce Picea abies and grey squirrels selecting riparian corridors of mixed woodland for their home ranges. Within their home ranges, habitat selection by individual red and grey squirrels was similar, but again with reds selecting Norway spruce and greys selecting patches of mixed conifers and broad-leaved trees. As no habitat variables consistently affected the microdistribution of red and grey squirrels within blocks or 'stands' of trees, stands that were used were thought to constitute good and relatively homogeneous habitats for squirrels of either species.
   4. There was no evidence to suggest that red and grey squirrels avoided using the same areas at the same time, and potential niche overlap was considerable (0.77). However, partitioning of habitats may have reduced competition between red and grey squirrels and hence have contributed to red squirrel persistence at this site.
   5. This work (i) reinforces earlier proposals that forest management offers a promising tool to assist the conservation of red squirrels; (ii) raises the issue of determining the spatial scale at which coexistence operates; and (iii) offers an illustration of how the management of invasive species can be mediated through the manipulation of niche availability.

AB  - Genetic interactions between farmed escapees and wild fish represent a challenge to environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Breeding programs for Atlantic cod Gadus morhua have been initiated; however, the genetic response to selection, and therefore the degree of domestication, has not been evaluated. We compared growth of 2 wild and 2 partly domesticated strains that had been under selection for 2 generations. Offspring of 54 synchronously produced families were reared in 2 common-garden experiments, each consisting of Phase I: parallel rearing in mesocosms and tanks 0-8 mo post-hatch, and Phase II: rearing in tanks or sea-cages 8-18 and 8-34 mo post-hatch, respectively. One of the domesticated strains displayed significantly higher growth compared to the wild Northeast Arctic cod population (48-67% higher weight), while the other domesticated strain had a similar growth rate to the Northeast Arctic cod population. The wild population from southern Norway displayed a significantly higher growth rate compared to the wild Northeast Arctic cod population. These results represent the first experimental estimation of domestication-driven changes in farmed cod, and demonstrate that the first breeding programs for this species have been partially successful, resulting in improved growth rates of cod in 2 generations.

AB  - Mass development of macrophytes is an increasing problem in many aquatic systems worldwide. Dense mats of macrophytes can negatively affect activities like boating, fishing or hydropower production and one of the management measures often applied is mechanical removal. In this study, we analyzed the effect of mechanical macrophyte removal on phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrate (pelagic and benthic samples) assemblages. Our study covered five sites in four countries in Europe and Africa with highly variable characteristics. In all sites, dense mats of different macrophyte species (Juncus bulbosus in a river in Norway; a mix of native macrophytes in a German river, Elodea nuttallii in a lake in Germany, Ludwigia spp. In a French lake and Pontederia crassipes in a South African lake) are problematic and mechanical removal was applied. In every country, we repeated the same BACI (Before-After-Control-Impact) design, including "before", "one week after", and "six weeks after" sampling in a control and an impact section. Repeating the same experimental design at all sites allowed us to disentangle common effects across all sites from site-specific effects. For each taxonomic group, we analyzed three structural and three functional parameters, which we combined in a scoring system. Overall, the removal of macrophytes negatively affected biodiversity, in particular of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate assemblages. In contrast, plant removal had positive effects on the phytoplankton assemblages. Effects were more pronounced one week after removal than six weeks after. Consequently, we suggest a stronger consideration of the effect of plant removal on biodiversity to arrive at more sustainable management practices in the future.

AB  - The hegemony of the private car is increasingly challenged as new policies and technologies affect passenger mobility. This study investigates how car-sharing is emerging and unfolding amidst established urban mobility practices. We apply a conceptual framework with seven elements based on social practice theories and transition literature to deconstruct practices in order to reveal how such (relatively) new mobility practices emerge. Our comparative study uses qualitative methods with data from 58 household interviews and three half-day work-shops with stakeholders in Oslo, Norway; Malmo, Sweden; and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The research question asks how car-sharing practices unfold differently in different places. The results indicate how elements of mobility practices change from the situation before and without car-sharing to after and with car-sharing. The analysis reveals different changes in the three areas, with greater change in Malmo because of public procurement of car-sharing and less in Rotterdam, where there was interest in urban experiments directed at phasing out car use and supporting car-free city zones. The framework highlights that new digital technologies and regulations are important, influencing business models and the social meaning of mobility towards a broader acceptance of access-based transportation. For car-sharing to contribute to environmental sustainability, the three areas need to reduce the daily use of cars so car-sharing can become a viable option for occasional use of cars. Further, policies should combine Electric Vehicles (EVs) and car-sharing, e.g. in Oslo, the focus of promoting EVs should include shared EVs, and in Rotterdam, improved charging infrastructure would be effective.

AB  - Rich herbaceous layers supply important ecosystem functions and amenity values in urban woodlands. However, due to poor dispersal and recruitment, typical woodland herbs often remain absent in woodlands established on post-agricultural and post-industrial sites, especially in fragmented urban landscapes. Efficient methods for active restoration of the herbaceous layer are therefore needed. In a plantation experiment in an 11-year-old oak stand established on post-agricultural land just outside Malmo City, southern Sweden, this study investigated the effects of compost addition and weed control on post-planting survival, growth and flowering of three typical shade-tolerant woodland herb species: Galium odoratum, Lamiastrum galeobdolon and Stellaria holostea. Removal of competing weed vegetation did not affect plant performance, but compost addition dramatically increased growth and flowering of all three species during the first two growing seasons, and also increased survival in S. holostea. This positive treatment effect probably derived from a more suitable top soil structure and a higher soil moisture in the compost treatment. We conclude that combined use of planting and composting is an effective method for rapid achievement of profusely flowering carpets of summer-green woodland herbs, which can provide important amenity values in the many woodlands established in and around cities in north-west Europe in recent decades. The method may also be applicable in other woodland restoration projects, where it can promote colonisation by typical shade-tolerant woodland herb species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been suggested to counter negative effects of agricultural intensification and enhance farmland biodiversity, but evaluations have produced inconsistent results. We suggest that this is partly a consequence of scale-dependence, i.e. that the consequence of organic farming will differ depending on the scale of uptake in a particular landscape. To test our hypothesis on diversity of forbs, we designed a landscape scale study using spatially explicit information about the Swedish AES for organic farming. The study system consisted of uncultivated field borders along paired fields (organic and conventional) in matched landscapes with either a high or a low proportion of organic faming, allowing separate tests of the effects of farming practice at the local and the landscape scale. The local effect of organic farming was consistently strong, with higher diversity in borders adjoining organic fields, most likely due to the lack of herbicide use on organically managed farmland. Thus, we show that not only the proportion of semi-natural habitat is important for farmland biodiversity, but that also the management of cropland can influence the diversity in semi-natural habitats. Furthermore, forb richness was also higher in borders situated in landscapes with a high proportion of organic land, irrespectively of local management, possibly as a result of dispersal of mainly annual plant species from the organically managed fields into the borders (mass effect). Our results demonstrate that farming practice at a local and a landscape scale independently can influence plant species richness, indicating that organic farming can influence diversity also at larger spatial scales and outside the organically managed land. Our study highlight the importance of studying multiple scales, including both local and landscape factors to provide a better understanding of biodiversity patterns.

AB  - The annual input and output of nitrogen (N) to and from agricultural land is relatively small compared with the total stock of organic N in soil. However, the long-term humus N pool dynamics is seldom considered in fertilisation planning, and thus N surpluses in budgets are considered as losses. In this paper, we analyse the consequences of this assumption and investigate how observed data precision affect the precision of model projections. We used available data sets from long-term agricultural field experiments in Sweden (topsoil C and N concentrations, crop yields as well as soil type and climate data) for calculating topsoil C and N mass dynamics. ICBM/2N, a simple C and N soil model (available at: www.mv.slu.se/vaxtnaring/olle/ICBM.html), was used for calculating soil organic matter balances. We parameterised this model for two field trials, and for specific crops, using available data and educated guesses and compared the results with those obtained from the conventional approach, not including humus pool C and N dynamics. In spite of the corrections for bulk densities, etc., the soil carbon measurements were too variable for a critical model validation or a sensitive test of the effects of including pool dynamics. In other words, we had to rely on the model assumptions for the projections and soil data could only be used to obtain general means, e.g., for the whole duration of the experiment. We think this is a general problem, not limited to this data set and model. We also show, at least in principle, how estimates of organic N pool dynamics can be used to produce improved N balance sheets for individual crops. For example, the apparent N use efficiency by sugar beet increased from 58 to 99% when organic N pool dynamics were included. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evaluations carried out in many countries show that soft policy measures in the form of personalized travel planning reduce private car use and increase travel by public transport. Sweden is a sparsely populated country that poorly supports public transport, a country with long distances, a cold climate, and a high concentration of private cars, which is why soft policy measures implemented in Sweden may be less cost-effective than has been found in other countries. Thirty-two programs using personalized travel planning were analysed with regard to stewardship, geographic area of application, choice of techniques of exerting an influence, and effects on car use and choice of alternative travel modes. None of the evaluations of the documented programs met the method requirements for such evaluations as regards design and effect measurement. Additionally, reporting was substandard as well as non-standard in the way that is desirable in order to enable comparative analyses. With reservations for these shortcomings, it is inferred that positive effects on a par with the results in other countries have been obtained in some of the implemented programs. It is however necessary to conduct evaluations which are of higher quality. The requirements which will then have to be applied are defined.

AB  - Information on wood properties is crucial in estimating wood quality and forest biomass and thus developing the precision and sustainability of forest management and use. However, wood properties are highly variable between and within trees due to the complexity of wood formation. Therefore, tree-specific field references and spatially transferable models are required to capture the variability of wood quality and forest biomass at multiple scales, entailing high-resolution terrestrial and aerial remote sensing methods. Here, we aimed at identifying select tree traits that indicate wood properties (i.e. wood quality indicators) with a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) in an examination of 27 even-aged, managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in southern Finland. We derived the wood quality indicators from tree models sampled systematically from TLS data and built prediction models with respect to individual crown features delineated from ALS data. The models were incapable of predicting explicit branching parameters (height of the lowest dead branch R-2 = 0.25, maximum branch diameter R-2 = 0.03) but were suited to predicting stem and crown dimensions from stand, tree, and competition factors (diameter at breast height and sawlog volume R 2 = 0.5, and live crown base height R-2 = 0.4). We were able to identify the effect of canopy closure on crown longevity and stem growth, which are pivotal to the variability of several wood properties in managed forests. We discussed how the fusions of high-resolution remote sensing methods may be used to enhance sustainable management and use of natural resources in the changing environment.

AB  - In 1990 and 1999, heavy storms accompanied by the worst gales ever recorded in Switzerland, struck Europe and left millions of cubic metres of windthrown Norway spruce trees; this provided breeding material for the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) and led to mass attacks in subsequent years which resulted in the additional loss of millions of cubic meters of standing spruce trees. In addition to the ecological concerns, many forest owners were faced with a difficult financial situation, resulting in a change in strategy that left some storm and bark beetle damaged areas uncleared. Also, logistical issues made it sometimes impossible to remove all of the timber before a new generation of beetles emerged. This situation forced forest services and land-owners to set priorities. To address questions related to developing a new risk assessment, we initiated observation projects about scolytid behaviour occurring in variously threatened storm areas and regions.

AB  - Arable soil is a functional unit whose condition is vital to crop production, but also to ecosystems at large owing to the significant role of soil in global nutrient cycles and balances. The soil quality concept recognises the concern for the sustainability of current arable land use practices. It integrates soil chemical, physical and biological properties, and takes account of the interaction of soil with water and air. This paper reviews the soil quality concept and its applications and discusses the importance of the concept for the assessment of Finnish arable soils. Many aspects of the chemical quality of arable soil are already well known in Finland. In contrast, follow-up of the physical and biological soil components, which are increasingly seen as important features of soil quality, is rudimentary. For monitoring of the soil quality at different scales - field, regional, national and global a suitable set of indicators needs to be identified. In this paper particular attention is paid to the potential importance and usefulness of selected biological indicators. It is clear that more basic research is needed to provide scientists and advisors with a solid basis for transmitting reliable information on soil quality. While the soil quality concept has been justifiably criticised, it has clear merits in the integrated handling of the soil entity and in highlighting the environmental aspects of arable soil quality.

AB  - The research on mixed-species forestry has rapidly increased in recent decades because there is a growing interest in these types of stands for environmental reasons. Their positive influence on ecosystem biodiversity, stability and resilience, as well as their role in the new challenge brought up by the adaptation to global change, have been the object of many research works. However, the economic implications of mixed-species forest management have not deserved the same attention. The objective of this work is to study the effect of species interactions on productivity, and to economically assess this effect. This research is focused on the analysis of financial return and risk in even aged mixed stands of Pinus sylvestris and Fagus sylvatica in Northern Spain. Growth and yield projections for monospecific and mixed stands of Scots pine and European beech were made by means of a previous model developed from a set of the Spanish National Forest Inventory plots in the region of Navarre. Data from yield tables for both species were used. The effect of species proportion on total stand yield was assessed and transgressive overyielding was found for some mixing ratios. A data series on average stumpage price for both species in Spain over a 29-year period was compiled and the joint probability distribution of price data was used to generate 500 price scenarios. Different management alternatives based on species proportion and rotation age were considered and evaluated in terms of profitability and risk. Some management recommendations can be derived from the results obtained, which point at an optimum mixing ratio from 30% to 40% Scots pine and 70% to 60% European beech.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to study and compare different power distribution alternatives for subsea electrical components for deep-sea mining in the Norwegian Sea. Such application requires power delivery in the multi-MW range at water depth of more than 3000 m. Hence, AC (50Hz), DC, high frequency AC and low frequency AC can be possible options to transfer electrical power to the mining equipment. Comparing them at the preliminary stages of projects is beneficial in order to select the most suitable alternative. Minimizing voltage drop and distribution losses, in addition to reducing the number of components, their weight and cost are critical and often conflicting aspects, to design the electrical system appropriately. In this paper, the basic processes of deep-sea mining (regarding Seafloor Massive Sulfides) will be described briefly. In addition, an estimation of the amount of required power to feed the subsea mining equipment for the Norwegian Sea case will be given and finally, different power distribution schemes will be analyzed and compared, using the PowerFactory/DIgSILENT software for simulations.

AB  - Diverse environmental and anthropogenic factors, such as the ongoing reservoir constructions may influence riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties. This has important implications for river water quality, particularly when reservoirs are a source of drinking water. Simultaneous studies of multidecadal trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are scarce. We studied the patterns in DOC and DON concentration in two major rivers of the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) basin over a 42-year period (1978-2019). We also examined the impact of a large reservoir on riverine DOC properties. Contrary to many studies, we did not find a long-term in-crease in DOC and DON concentration, and DOC and DON patterns were not always synchronous. In an agriculture dominated watershed like the SSR basin, agricultural land use (e.g., nitrogen-fertilizer application) could influence DOC and DON concentration differently, potentially resulting in asynchronous patterns over time. River discharge was an important driver of DOM patterns. Regional precipitation in the lower SSR basin may also influence DOM pat-terns in locations where runoff contribution is greater. These regional factors explained greater variability in DOM compared to global scale indices (e.g., Pacific decadal oscillation) due to their direct control on DOM. A travel time corrected approach to account for the lengthy reservoir turnover time showed that a large reservoir caused a reduction in allochthonous DOC characteristics through photodegradation and perhaps, an increase in autochthonous character-istics. Our results illustrate: 1) the increase in DOM concentrations seen in the northern hemisphere is not present in semi-arid prairie rivers, 2) Controls on different DOM components could be different, and 3) large reservoirs may mod-ify riverine DOC composition due to longer water residence time.

AB  - Light pollution resulting from artificial lighting is a global environmental change that profoundly alters the nocturnal environment. Various ecological and health effects are caused by the alteration of natural levels of light and disruption of cycles of light and dark. Emissions of artificial light into the night environment have increased rapidly over the last decades and this trend is likely to continue due to the introduction of new cost-efficient light sources, urban sprawl, increasing traffic, population growth, and economic growth. Efficient measures to reduce light pollution are needed. Most measures so far have been based on top-down approaches such as legislation, technical norms and guidance. Based on the results from an online survey in Finland, household-level efforts aimed at reducing light pollution are reviewed and obstacles to action based on bottom-up approach are discussed. The systems intelligence is proposed as a context sensitive approach to light pollution management. Systems intelligence emphasises personal and active involvement in socio-technological systems, characterised by complex cross-scale interactions and feedbacks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Contemporary vision of the housing environment is based upon an idea of the "ideal city", which puts the needs of its residents as a priority. One of them is pro-health character of the residential environment shaped according to the principles of sustainable development and sustainable design, expressed, inter alia, by the respect for human rights and the natural environment.
   Growing threats such as: reduction of biologically active areas or air and water pollution triggers the need for corrective actions in architecture and urban planning, but also in other scientific disciplines, based on the principles of harmony and care for the environment, but also including the needs of future generations.
   This paper presents the contemporary architectural objects created in accordance to the principles of sustainable design. Among other things, the paper will introduce an anlalysis of the residential complex in Almere, and Bo01 which is a residential-service district in Malmo, Sweden.
   These are great examples of applying sustainable solutions in architecture. Both principles of social and environmental balance were taken into account during the design of the surroundings, as well as the objects themselves. It should be emphasized that the inhabitants of Almere complex and Bo0ldistrict were involved in the process of shaping living environment. In order to maintain biodiversity (in Malmo) they have committed themselves to placing home boxes for birds and establishing habitat for bats.
